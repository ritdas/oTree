            colonies situated at Hambran Road, in Village Jainpur, Tehsil &amp; District

            Ludhiana (hereinafter referred to as 'Jainpur site') claiming direction to

            to direct the respondents to stop throwing of the garbage as well as bio-

            medical wastes generated by the two medical colleges and for direction to

            throw the garbage at a place away from the populated area as well as CWP

            No.24367 of 2011 filed by the residents of colonies situated near the garbage

            dumping ground situated at Village Jamalpur on Tajpur Road, Tehsil &amp;

            District Ludhiana (hereinafter referred to as 'Jamalpur site') to direct the

            respect of dumping of Municipal Solid Waste and installation of Municipal

            Solid Waste Management Plant at Jamalpur and/or Jainpur site, therefore,

            the same are taken up together.

            for dumping garbage since the year 1985 though the throwing of garbage

            was stopped in the year 2005 on the intervention of the then Municipal

            Commissioner. It is pleaded that colonies and schools have come up to cater

            the basic need of education for children near the dumping site and, therefore,

            it should be shifted from that place.

            communication dated 31.01.2013, a copy of which has been placed on

            record as Annexure P-28. On 02.09.2013, when the writ petitions came up

            for hearing, the Ministry of Civil Aviation was directed to finalize the grant

            of No Objection Certificate for setting up of Municipal Solid Waste

            Management Plant at Jamalpur dumping site. However, on 07.10.2013, Mr.

            communication dated 06.11.2013, taken on record and marked as Annexure

            consultation with Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is not in a

            position to grant No Objection Certificate.         However, if any fresh fact

            emerges, the same will be examined by DGCA / AAI. Mr. Sandhu referred

            to noting of the office of the Executive Director of Airport Authority of

            India, on the basis of documents enclosed, to the effect that development of

            Waste Management Plant falls within a radius of 10 kms from Ludhiana

            Rules, 1937, the Director General of Civil Aviation is the competent

<p id="p_13">                               In the light of the above factual background, Mr. Sethi, learned

            Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners in CWP No.3611 of

            2009, argued that Jainpur site is close to residential localities and cannot be

            used for landfill for the reason that it is in use for the last more than 25

            years. Relying upon Clause 7 of Schedule III of the Municipal Solid Waste

            (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 2000 (for short the Rules), contemplating

            specifications for landfill sites, he argued that the Municipal Corporation

            should be restrained from using the said dumping site forthwith as the

            contemplated time has already lapsed.             Mr. Sethi also relied upon a

            judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported as Almitra H. Patel &amp; another

            Vs. Union of India &amp; others AIR 2000 SC 1256 to contend that the solid

            Plant case (supra), the prayer was to shift the garbage dumped along with the

            boundary wall of the milk plant run by the petitioner. The Court observed

            that the public which uses the milk manufactured in the plant of the

            petitioner is likely to suffer irreparable harm, if the garbage dump is not

            shifted from the site. The writ petition was disposed of with a direction to

            the respondents to take a final decision regarding alternative site where the

            Municipal Council, Mohali can dump the garbage etc. The directions in the

            said case cannot be applied in the present case. The dumping sites in

            question are in use for the last more than 25 years before the jurisdiction of

            this Court was invoked. Stage is now for setting up of a Solid Waste

            Management Plant.           The setting up of the plant at this stage is a dire

            necessity to neutralize the affect of dumped garbage and to process the

            garbage, which is generated henceforth. We do not find that the reference of

            the petitioner on the said judgment is of any help.

            that the dumping site is in use since long, as it is alleged the garbage has

            reached 32 feet height from the boundary walls of adjoining sewerage plant

            and that the Airport is about 10 kms from the site in question. From the

            facts on record, it transpires that both the dumping sites i.e. Jainpur and

            Jamalpur are being used by the Municipal Corporation for dumping of

            garbage for the last 25 years, as is the stand of the Corporation in the reply.

                               The Competent Authority has considered the proposal and

            decided to grant clearance. We do not have any expertise to say that such

            clearance is unwarranted. The argument that the environmental clearance is

            based upon report of the Expert Appraisal Committee, without granting wide

            publicity and adequate opportunity of hearing to the affected persons, is

            again not tenable. Firstly, the petitioners have an effective alternative

            remedy against the clearance granted in terms of <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_3">Section 16</a> of the National

            Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Since the petitioners have not availed such

            remedy, it is not open to them to challenge the same on the ground that

            opportunity of hearing was not granted to them. Secondly, the record shows

            that initially a public meeting was held on 20.09.2011 for granting

            environmental clearance, but thereafter the Expert Appraisal Committee has

            granted hearing to the affected persons on 18/19.10.2012. It was only,

            thereafter, after considering the objections filed and the report submitted,

            conditional environmental clearance has been granted on 31.01.2013.

            Utkarsh Mandal's case (supra) was to operate mine, whereas the present is a

            condition for installation of Solid Waste Management Plant. The special

            conditions are mostly post operational of the plant; therefore, such

            conditions cannot be termed as conditional clearance, which can be disputed.

            Still further, If the conditions are not complied with, the clearance can be

            withdrawn, leading to stoppage of Plant. Therefore, it is not that once

            clearance is granted, the Central Government or the other competent

            authorities under the Act will not have jurisdiction over the operation of the

            Solid Waste Management Plant.

            of the Airport has been acquired. Such acquisition of land reduces the

            distance from the Airport to the dumping site to 6.5 kms. Thus, the decision

            of the Airport Authority not to grant NOC can be faulted with. Learned

            counsel for the petitioners argued that the dumping of municipal solid waste

            will create bird menace, therefore, the Plant cannot be permitted to be set up

            Airport and the maximum passengers load is 150 a week, though it is

            pointed out that there are certain charter flights, which operate daily. The

            fact is that the population of Ludhiana Municipal Corporation is more than

            16 lakhs and that of Ludhiana District is more than 35 Lakhs as per Census -

            2011. Even if, the flights are not operated from Ludhiana on account of

            perceived bird menace, it would not harm the interest of general public. It is

            the decision of the experts to operate commercial or charter flights in view

            of endanger to the safety of the passengers, but the larger public good of the

            entire population of Ludhiana is free from garbage. Larger public interest

            will outweigh the interest of miniscule number of persons, who may be

            charter flights from the Airport, but the larger public interest warrants that

            there cannot be any further delay in setting up of Municipal Solid Waste

            Management Plant at the site in question, in respect of which the

            Corporation has been granted clearance.

<p id="p_31">                               The issue; whether the conditions to obtain clearances under the

            Municipal Solid Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 2000 are

            mandatory to an existing dumping site has been examined by this Court in

            CWP No.2032 of 2006 titled 'Pollution Control Committee, Amritsar Vs.

            Municipal Corporation, Amritsar &amp; others' decided on 2307.2013, wherein

            this Court has said that such Rules are not applicable to the existing dumping

            sites. The Court observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">                               "17. The sole reliance of the petitioner on the question whether the
                               Municipal Corporation and/or the Contractor requires authorization
                               in terms of Rule 4(2) of the Rules for its land fill facility at
                               Bhagtanwala is based upon an order dated 17.3.2009 passed in CWP
                               No. 8504 of 2003 by the Division Bench of this Court (of which one
                               of us Hemant Gupta J.), was a member. The marked distinction
                               between the two cases is that the acquisition of the land for dumping
                               the Municipal waste in the aforesaid case was completed in the year
                               1975 and at that time the site was outside the Municipal limits of
                               Rohtak. The site came to be within the Municipal limits only in the
                               year 1990. The writ petitioner had purchased 25 acres of land at a
                               short distance from the dumping site nearly after 20 years of the use
                               of the dumping site. It was a case of purchaser of land seeking
                               shifting of dumping site. Thus Clause 5 of Schedule-III was
                               interpreted to mean that the landfill sites existing as on the date of
                               framing of the Rules, have only to be improved in accordance with
                               the specifications given in the Schedules and that there is no
                               prohibition for use of an existing landfill site by the Municipal
                               Authorities."

            Punjab' decided on 14.11.2011, a Division Bench of this Court was dealing

            with the problem of pollution in Ludhiana and Budha Nallha, which

            ultimately merges in the river Sutlej. This Court noticed the problem of

            pollution by the dyeing industries and disposed of the writ petition with the

            following directions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                                      "To give effect to what has been stated above, we dispose of these
                               five writ petitions by directing that the High Power Committee already
                               constituted under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary concerning Budha
                               Nullah shall continue to meet periodically and shall also monitor actively,
                               protection and preservation of Budha Nullah, its environment and ecology
                               and that of Ludhiana city. To ensure probity and transparency in the
                               affairs of the Committee, we direct it to publish the action taken report
                               quarterly so that in case any citizen or a well meaning group is aggrieved
                               he can again approach this Court for redressal of the grievance. We do
                               hope and expect that in the light of what has been noticed in this judgment
                               and the observations made, the above said Committee duly constituted
                               under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary shall perform its part and

            fact may be first step to make Ludhiana a better place to live in. Such plant

            is to manage garbage, which as on day is lying unattended. The plant is

            solution and not the problem. Thus, we do not find any merit in the present

            writ petitions. The same are dismissed, but with following directions in the
