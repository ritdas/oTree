      WHEREAS, in compliance of order of the Hon'ble High
      Court of Uttarakhand in the matter of WP(PIL) No. 5 of 2014
      Ashok Kumar Vs. State of Uttarakhand &amp; Ors. on 26.03.2018,
      ETP outlet sample of the Unit was collected and analysed and
      analysis report showed BOD-155 mg/L which is above the
      prescribed effluent discharge norms specified under the

<p id="p_7">      As such, it is evident from the above analysis results that
      Effluent Treatment Plant is not being operated and
      maintained appropriately to meet prescribed discharge
      norms and polluted wastewater is being disposed into drain
      leading to river Bahella. The Unit may be categorized as

<p id="p_10">      MEMBER SECRETARY"
</p>
<p id="p_11">3.           Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner approached the learned
Single Judge under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The
learned Single Judge by the impugned judgment took the view that on
an inspection, certain deficiencies were detected in the manufacturing
plant of the petitioner. House keeping of the plant was found to be
very poor, the Effluent Treatment Plant and sludge disposal system
were not working properly and the polluted wastewater was being
disposed into the drain leading to river Bahella. It was found that on
the basis of the same, impugned order has been passed. It was found,
as is evident, that the petitioner was violating the prescribed norms
and standards resulting into threat to the environment. Thereafter, it is
stated that in any case, the petitioner has an alternative remedy as the
impugned order is appealable under <a href="/doc/14118/" id="a_16">Section 16(c)</a> of the National
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    -5-</span>
<a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_17">Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 and the writ petition was dismissed on the
ground of alternative remedy.
</p><p id="p_12">4.           We heard Mr. Narendra Bali, learned counsel on behalf
of the petitioner, Mr. Narayan Dutt, learned Brief Holder for the State
of Uttarakhand / respondent no. 1 and Mr. Shiv Pande, learned
counsel on behalf of respondent no. 2.
</p><p id="p_13">5.           It is true that the impugned order was passed under
<a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_18">Section 33-A</a> of the Act. It is equally true that under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Section 33-B</a> of
the Act, an appeal lies before the National Green Tribunal, but we
must be detained by one aspect of the matter that the appellant was
issued a show cause notice. The appellant gave reply to the same
(Annexure-4). The show cause notice (Annexure-3), to which the
appellant gave Annexure-4 reply has culminated in Annexure-5,
which is the impugned order. We have perused the impugned order.
Though there is reference to the show cause notice, the second
respondent has not considered the reply given by the appellant and yet
passed the order under <a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_20">Section 33-A</a> of the Act. The purpose of giving
the show cause notice was to elicit response, if any, to the contents of
the show cause notice and, thereafter, pass an order.
</p>
<p id="p_14">6.           In this case, though a reply was given, it is not in dispute
that the reply given by the appellant has not been adverted to or
considered while passing the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_15">7.           In such circumstances, we would think that to relegate
the appellant to avail remedy under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Section 33-B</a> of the Act may not
be very fair in the circumstances as the appellant would have to appeal
the order before the National Green Tribunal, which is located at New
Delhi. Therefore, we may notice that the appellant does not, as of
now, have consent to operate and its application for consent to operate
is pending consideration. Therefore, also we think that the interest of
justice would be sub-served, if we quash the impugned order and
direct the second respondent to consider Annexure-4 and take a
decision in accordance with law within a period of 10 days from the
date of production of a certified copy of this judgment. In the
meantime, needless to say, the appellant cannot be permitted to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  -6-</span>




operate as the appellant does not have the consent to operate.
Accordingly, we dispose of the Appeal by modifying the judgment of
the learned Single Judge and directing the second respondent to
consider Annexure-4 reply given by the appellant and take a decision
in accordance with law within a period of 10 days from the date of
production of a certified copy of this judgment before him. The
second respondent will not consider the observations made by the
learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment.
</p><p id="p_16">8.            Let a certified copy of this judgment be issued today
itself.
