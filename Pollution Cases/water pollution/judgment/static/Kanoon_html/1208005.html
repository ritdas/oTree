HEADNOTE:
     The  petitioner,  an  active  social  worker,  filed  a
petition before	 this Court  complaining  that	neither	 the
Government nor	the people were giving adequate attention to
stop the pollution of the river Ganga and it was, therefore,
necessary to  take steps  for the  purpose of protecting the
cleanliness of	the stream  in the  river Ganga which was in
fact the  life sustainer  of a	large part  of the  northern
India, and sought the issue of a writ/order/direction in the
nature of mandamus to the respondents other than respondents
Nos. 1	and 7  to 9  restraining them  from letting  out the
trade effluents into the river Ganga till such time they put
necessary treatment  plants for treating the trade effluents
in order to arrest the pollution of water in the said river.
     This Court	 directed issue of notice under order 1 Rule
8 of the
280
Code  of   Civil  Procedure   treating	 the   case   as   a
representative action by publishing the gist of the petition
in the	newspapers in  circulation  in	northern  India	 and
calling upon  industrialists and  the municipal corporations
and town  municipal councils  having jurisdiction  over	 the
areas through  which the  river Ganga flows to appear before
the Court  to show  cause as  to why direction should not be
issued as  prayed for  by the  petitioner asking them not to
allow trade  effluents	and  sewage  into  the	river  Ganga
without appropriately  treating them before discharging them
into the river.
     Pursuant to  the aforesaid	 notice a  large  number  of
industrialists and  legal bodies  entered  appearance.	Some
filed counter affidavits ex-plaining the steps taken by them
for treating  trade effluents  before discharging  them into
the river.
     The case  against the  tanneries at Jajmau, Kanpur, was
first taken  up by  the Court for consideration. Forty three
respondents admitted  in their	counter affidavits  that the
tanneries discharged  their trade  effluents into the sewage
nallah which  led to  the municipal sewage plant before they
were thrown into the river Ganga.
     The Court	was informed  that six	of the tanneries had
already set  up and fourteen were engaged in construction of
primary treatment  plants, and	some others pleaded for time
to do so. It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that
it would  not be  possible for them to have secondary system
for treating waste water in view of the enormous expenditure
involved, which	 the tanneries	would not  be able  to meet.
Some of	 the tanneries neither appeared nor were represented
by counsel in this Court.
     Issuing interim directions, this Court,
^
     HELD: 1.1	<a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_3">Article 48-A</a>  of the  Constitution  provides
that the  State shall  endeavour to  protect and improve the
environment and	 to safeguard  the forests  and wild life of
the country. <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_4">Article 51-A</a> of the Constitution imposes as one
of the	fundamental duties  on every  citizen  the  duty  to
protect	 and   improve	the  natural  environment  including
forests, lakes,	 rivers and wild life and to have campassion
for living creatures. [285C-D]
     Realising the  importance of the prevention and control
of pollution of water for human existence, Parliament passed
the Water  (Prevention and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974,
to provide for the
281
prevention  and	  control  of	water  pollution   and	 the
maintaining or	restoring of wholesomeness of water, for the
establishment, with  a view  to carrying  out  the  purposes
aforesaid of  Boards for the prevention and control of water
pollution, for	conferring on  and assigning  to such Boards
powers	and  functions	relating  thereto  and	for  matters
connected therewith  <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_6">Sections 16</a> and <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_7">17</a> of the Act describes
the functions  of the  Central and  the State Board. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">The Act</a>
was adopted  by the  State of  Uttar Pradesh.  In  addition,
Parliament also	 passed the  Environmental (Prevention) Act,
1986 which  came into  effect from November, 1986 throughout
India. [288B-D; 289A, F]
     1.2  Notwithstanding   the	  comprehensive	  provisions
contained in  the Act  of 1974, no effective steps appear to
have been  taken by  the State	Board so  far to prevent the
discharge of  effluents of  the Jajmau	near Kanpur  to	 the
river Ganga.  The fact	that such  effluents are being first
discharged into	 the municipal sewerage does not absolve the
tanneries from	being proceeded against under the provisions
of the law in force since ultimately the effluents reach the
river Ganga  from the  sewerage system	of the municipality.
Not much  has been  done even  under the  Act of 1986 by the
Central Government  to stop the grave public nuisance caused
by the tanneries at Jajmau, Kanpur. [289-E; 290C]
     1.3 There	is no  doubt that the discharge of the trade
effluents from	the tanneries  into the river Ganga has been
causing considerable  damage to	 the life  of the people who
use the	 water of  the river and also to the aquatic life in
the river.  The effluents  discharged from  a tannery  is 10
times noxious  when compared  with the domestic sewage which
flows into  the river  from any urban area on its banks. The
tanneries at Jajmau, Kanpur cannot be allowed to continue to
carry on  the industrial  activity unless they take steps to
establish primary treatment plant. [298E-F]
     No doubt  it may  not be  possible for the tanneries to
establish immediately  the secondary system plant in view of
the large  expenses  involved,	but  having  regard  to	 the
adverse effect	the effluents are having on the river water,
the tanneries  at Jajmau,  Kanpur, should  at least  set  up
primary treatment  plants, which  is the  minimum  that	 the
tanneries should  do in	 the circumstances  of the case. The
financial capacity  of the tanneries should be considered as
irrelevant  while   requiring  them   to  establish  primary
treatment plants.  Just like  an industry  which cannot	 pay
minimum wages  to its  workers cannot be allowed to exist, a
tannery, which	cannot set  up a  primary  treatment  plant,
cannot be  permitted to	 continue to be in existence for the
adverse
282
effect on  the public  at large	 which is likely to ensue by
the discharging	 of the	 trade effluents from the tannery to
the river  Ganga would	be immense  and it will outweigh any
inconvenience that  may be  caused to the management and the
labour employed	 by it	on account of its closure. Moreover,
the tanneries  involved	 in  this  case	 are  not  taken  by
surprise. For  several years  they are	being asked  to take
necessary steps	 to prevent the flow of untreated water from
their factories	 into the  river. Some	of them have already
complied with the demand. [298C-E]
     1.4 In  cases of  this  nature  this  Court  may  issue
appropriate directions	if it finds that the public nuisance
or other  wrongful act	affecting or likely to affect public
is being  committed and	 the statutory authorities which are
charged with  the duty to prevent it are not taking adequate
steps to  rectify the  grivevance. For every breach of right
there should be a remedy. [298F-G]
     It is  unfortunate that a number of tanneries at Jajmau
even though  they are  aware of	 these proceedings  have not
cared even  to enter  appearance in  this Court	 to  express
their willingness to take appropriate steps to establish the
pretreatment plants.  So far as they are concerned, they are
directed to  stop running of their tanneries and also not to
let out	 trade effluents  either directly or indirectly into
the river  Ganga without subjecting the trade effluents to a
pretreatment process  by setting up primary treatment plants
as approved  by the  State Board with effect from October 1,
1987. Time granted till 31.3.1988 to other tanneries who are
members of  the Hindustan Chambers of Commerce and the other
tanneries to  establish primary	 treatment plants within six
months. If  any of these tanneries does not set up a primary
treatment plant	 within 31.3.1988  such a  tannery will stop
business with  effect from  1.4.1988.  [298G-H;	 299D,	G-H;
300A]
     Such of those tanneries who have already put up primary
treatment plants may continue running provided they keep the
plants in sound working order.[299Fl
     The  Central   Government,	 the  Uttar  Pradesh  Board,
established under  the provisions  of the  Water (Prevention
and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control  of  Pollution)  Act</a>,  1974  and  the  District
Magistrate, Kanpur are directed to enforce this order. [30OB
l
     Per Singh, J: (supplementing)
     The pollution of the river Ganga is affecting the life,
health and
283
ecology of  the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The (Government as well
as Parliament  both have  taken a number of steps to control
the  water  pollution,	but  nothing  substantial  has	been
achieved. No  law or  authority can  succeed in removing the
pollution unless the people cooperate. It is the sacred duty
of all	those who  reside or  carry on	business around	 the
river Ganga  to ensure	the purity  of Ganga.  Tanneries  at
Jajmau area  near Kanpur  have been polluting the Ganga in a
big way. Though notices were issued many industrialists have
not bothered  either to	 respond to  the notice	 or to	take
elementary steps  for the  treatment of	 industrial effluent
before discharging  the same into the river. Those tanneries
which have  failed to  take minimum  steps required  for the
primary treatment  of industrial effluent are directed to be
closed.	 No   doubt   closure	of   tanneries	 may   bring
unemployment, loss  of revenue, but life, health and ecology
have greater importance to the people. [301G-H; 302A-B]

     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     VENKATARAMIAH, J.	This is a public interest litigation
The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">284</span>
petitioner who	is an  active social  worker has  filed this
petition inter	alia for the issue of a writ/order/direction
in the	nature of  mandamus to	the respondents	 other	than
Respondents 1,	and 7 to 9 restraining them from letting out
the trade effluents into the river Ganga till such time they
put up	necessary treatment  plants for	 treating the  trade
effluents in  order to	arrest the pollution of water in the
said river. Respondent 1 is the Union of India, Respondent 7
is the	Chairman of  the Central  Board for  Prevention	 and
Control of  Pollution, Respondent  8 is	 the Chairman, Uttar
Pradesh Pollution  Control Board  and Respondent  9  is	 the
Indian Standards Institute.
</p><p id="p_6">     Water is  the most important of the elements of nature.
River valleys are the credles of civilization from beginning
of the	world. Aryan  civilization grew around the towns and
villages on  the banks of the river Ganga. Varanasi which is
one of	the cities  on the  banks  of  the  river  Ganga  is
considered to  be one of the oldest human settlements in the
world. It  is the popular belief that the river Ganga is the
purifier of  all but  we are  now led  to the situation that
action has to be taken to prevent the pollution of the water
of the	river Ganga  since we  have reached a stage that any
further pollution  of the river water is likely to lead to a
catastrophe.  There  are  today	 large	towns  inhabited  by
millions of  people on	the banks  of the river Ganga. There
are also  large industries on its banks. Sewage of the towns
and cities on the banks of the river and the trade effluents
of the factories and other industries are continuously being
discharged into	 the river.  It	 is  the  complaint  of	 the
petitioner that	 neither the  Government nor  the people are
giving adequate attention to stop the pollution of the river
Ganga. Steps have, therefore, to be taken for the purpose of
protecting the cleanliness of the stream in the river Ganga,
which is  in fact  the life sustainer of a large part of the
northern India.
</p><p id="p_7">     When this petition came up for preliminary hearing, the
Court directed	the issue  of notice under order 1 rule 8 of
the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure	 treating  this	 case  as  a
representative action by publishing the gist of the petition
in the	newspapers in  circulation  in	northern  India	 and
calling	 upon  all  the	 industrialists	 and  the  municipal
corporations  and   the	 town	municipal  councils   having
jurisdiction over  the areas  through which  the river Ganga
flows to appear before the Court and to show cause as to why
directions should  not be  issued to  them as  prayed by the
petitioner asking  them not to allow the trade effluents and
the  sewage  into  the	river  Ganga  without  appropriately
treating  them	before	discharging  them  into	 the  river.
Pursuant to the said notice a large number of industrialists
and local bodies have entered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">285</span>
appearance  before  the	 Court.	 Some  of  them	 have  filed
counteraffidavits explaining  the steps	 taken by  them	 for
treating the  trade effluents  before discharging t-hem into
the river.  When the  above case  came up  for consideration
before the  Court on  the last	date of	 hearing we directed
that the  case against	the tanneries  at Jajmau  area	near
Kanpur would  be taken	up for hearing first. Respondents 14
to 87  and  89	are  the  tanneries  near  Kanpur.  Of	them
respondents 16	to 32, 34 to 36, 43, 47, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57,
58, 60 to 62, 64, 67 to 69, 72, 74, 75, 77 to 82, 85, 87 and
89 are	represented by	counsel. The remaining tanneries did
not appear  before the	Court at the time of the hearing nor
were they represented by any counsel.
</p><p id="p_8">     Before proceeding to consider the facts of this case it
is necessary  to state	a few  words about the importance of
and need for protecting our environment. <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_11">Article 48-A</a> of the
Constitution provides  that the	 State	shall  endeavour  to
protect and  improve the  environment and  to safeguard	 the
forests and  wild life	of the	country. <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_12">Article 51-A</a> of the
Constitution imposes  as one  of the  fundamental duties  on
every citizen  the duty	 to protect  and improve the natural
environment including  forests, lakes,	rivers and wild life
and  to	  have	compassion   for   living   creatures.	 The
proclamation adopted by the United Nations Conference on the
Human Environment  which took place at Stockholm from 5th to
16th of June, 1972 and in which the Indian delegation led by
the Prime Minister of India took a leading role runs thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	       "1. Man	is both	 creature and moulder of his
	  environment which  gives him	physical  sustenance
	  and affords  him the opportunity for intellectual,
	  moral, social	 and spiritual	growth. In  the long
	  and tortuous	evolution of  the human race on this
	  planet a  stage has  been reached when through the
	  rapid acceleration  of science and technology, man
	  has  acquired	  the	power	to   transform	 his
	  environment  in   countless	ways   and   on	  an
	  unprecedented	 scale.	  Both	aspects	  of   man's
	  environment, the  natural and	 the  man-made,	 are
	  essential to	his well-being	and to the enjoyment
	  of basic  human  rights-even	the  right  to	life
	  itself.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	       2. The  protection  and	improvement  of	 the
	  human environment  is a  major issue which affects
	  the well-being of peoples and economic development
	  throughout the  world; it  is the urgent desire of
	  the peoples of the whole world and the duty of all
	  Governments.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">286</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">	       3. Man  has constantly  to sum  up experience
	  and go  on discovering,  inventing,  creating	 and
	  advancing.  In   our	time   man's  capability  to
	  transform his	 surroundings, if  used wisely,	 can
	  bring to  all peoples	 the benefits of development
	  and the  opportunity to  enhance  the	 quality  of
	  life. Wrongly	 or  heedlessly	 applied,  the	same
	  power can do incalculable harm to human beings and
	  the human  environment. We  see around  us growing
	  evidence of  man-made harm  in many regions of the
	  earth; dangerous  levels of  pollution  in  water,
	  air,	earth	and   living   beings;	 major	 and
	  undesirable disturbances to the ecological balance
	  of the  biosphere; destruction  and  depletion  of
	  irreplaceable resources;  and	 gross	deficiencies
	  harmful to  the physical, mental and social health
	  of man,  in the man-made environment; particularly
	  in the living and working environment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	       A point	has been  reached in history when we
	  must shape our actions throughout the world with a
	  more	prudent	  care	 for   their   environmental
	  consequences. Through ignorance or indifference we
	  can  do  massive  and	 irreversible  harm  to	 the
	  earthly environment  on which	 our life  and well-
	  being depend. Conversely, through fuller knowledge
	  and wiser action, we can achieve for ourselves and
	  our posterity a better life in an environment more
	  in keeping  with human  needs and hopes. There are
	  broad vistas	for the enhancement of environmental
	  quality and  the creation  of a good life. What is
	  needed is  an enthusiastic  but calm state of mind
	  and intense  but orderly  work. For the purpose of
	  attaining freedom in the world of nature, man must
	  use  knowledge  to  build  in	 collaboration	with
	  nature a better environment. To defend and improve
	  the  human  environment  for	present	 and  future
	  generations has  become  an  imperative  goal	 for
	  mankind-a goal to be pursued together with, and in
	  harmony  with,  the  established  and	 fundamental
	  goals of  peace and  of  world-wide  economic	 and
	  social development.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	       To  achieve   this  environmental  goal	will
	  demand  the	acceptance  of	 responsibility	  by

	  needed in  order to raise resources to support the

to the	provisions of  the  said  section  no  person  shall
knowingly  cause   or  permit	any  poisonous,	 noxious  or
polluting  matter   determined	in   accordance	 with	such
standards as  may be  laid down	 by the State Board to enter
whether directly or indirectly into any stream or well or no
person shall  knowingly cause  or permit  to enter  into any
stream any other matter which may tend either directly or in
combination with  similar matters  to impede the proper flow
of the	water of the stream in a manner leading or likely to
lead to	 a substantial aggravation of pollution due to other
causes or  of its  consequences. The  expression  stream  is
defined by <a href="/doc/41018319/" id="a_18">section 2(j)</a> of the Act as including river, water
course whether	flowing or  for the  time being	 dry, inland
water whether  natural or  artificial, sub-terranean waters,
sea or	tidal waters to such extent or as the case may be to
such point  as the  State Government  may by notification in
the official Gazette,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">289</span>
specify in  that behalf.  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Under the Act</a> it is permissible to
establish  a   Central	Board  and  the	 State	Boards.	 The
functions of  the Central  Board and  the State	 Boards	 are
described in  <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_20">section 16</a>  and <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_21">17</a>  respectively. One  of	 the
functions of  the State	 Board is to inspect sewage or trade
effluents, works  and plants for the treatment of sewage and
trade effluents,  and to  review  plans,  specifications  or
other data  relating to	 plants set  up for the treatment of
water, works  for the  purification and	 the system  for the
disposal of  sewage or	trade  effluents.  'Trade  effluent'
includes any  liquid, gaseous  or solid	 substance which  is
discharged from	 any premises used for carrying on any trade
or industry,  other than domestic sewage. The State Board is
also entrusted	with the  work of  laying down	standards of
treatment of  sewage and  trade effluents  to be  discharged
into any  particular stream  taking into account the minimum
fair weather  dilution available  in  that  stream  and	 the
tolerance limits  of pollution	permissible in	the water of
the stream, after the discharge of such effluents. The State
Board is also entrusted with the power of making application
to courts  for restraining apprehended pollution of water in
streams	 or   wells.   Notwithstanding	 the   comprehensive
provisions contained in the Act no effective steps appear to
have been  taken by  the State	Board so  far to prevent the
discharge of  effluents of  the Jajmau	near Kanpur  to	 the
river Ganga.  The fact	that such  effluents are being first
discharged into	 the municipal sewerage does not absolve the
tanneries from	being proceeded against under the provisions
of the law in force since ultimately the effluents reach the
river Ganga from the sewerage system of the municipality.

the discharge  of the  trade effluents	from these tanneries
into the river Ganga has been causing considerable damage to
the life  of the people who use the water of the river Ganga
and also  to the aquatic life in the river. The tanneries at

<p id="p_17">     A monograph  entitled 'Treatment  Technology of Tannery
Effluents' prepared  by S. Rajamani, W. Madavakrishna and G.
Thyagarajan  of	 the  Central  Leather	Research  Institute,
Adyar, Madras states that generally the wastewater from beam
house process  namely soaking,	liming,	 deliming  etc.	 are
highly alkaline containing decomposing organic matter, hair,
lime sulphide  etc. and	 is nearly  ten times  as strong  as
domestic sewage and refers to the various methods
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">292</span>
by which  the effluents	 of the	 tanneries could  be treated
before their  discharge into  any river. They recommend four
types of  wastewater treatment	technology  so	far  as	 the
tanneries  are	 concerned  -1)	 segregation  or  mixing  of
suitable sectional waste water from different processes; (2)
primary treatment;  (3) secondary  biological treatment; and
(4) disposal  of solid wastes from the treatment system. The
said monograph	explains the  work at  the primary treatment
unit thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "The primary	treatment units principally comprise
	  of coarse  screens, two  numbers of settling tanks
	  and sludge drying beds. The settling tank, each of
	  about 1-2  days capacity  acts as an equalisation-
	  cum-setting  tank  as	 well.	As  an	alternative,
	  clarifier can	 be provided  in place	of  settling
	  tank	for   treating	higher	capacity  effluents.
	  Depending on	the quality  of composite  effluent,
	  addition  of	neutralising  chemicals	 like  lime,
	  alum, ferric	chloride etc.  would be required for
	  effective precipitation of chromium and removal of
	  suspended solids in the sedimentation process. The
	  sludge from  the settling  tanks and	clarifier is
	  removed and dried on sludge drying beds made up of
	  filtering  media   gravel,  sand   and  supporting
	  masonary  structure.	 For  operational   reasons,
	  sludge drying	 beds are  divided into four or more
	  compartments. The  dried sludge  from	 the  sludge
	  drying beds  can be used as manure or for landfill
	  if it	 is vegetable  tannery	waste.	In  case  of
	  chrome tannery  waste, the  dried sludge should be
	  buried  or   disposed	 off  suitably	as  per	 the
	  directions  of   regulatory  agencies	  and  local
	  bodies. "</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">     The secondary treatment units are explained in the said
monograph thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	       "The  pre-treated   effluent  needs  suitable
	  secondary  biological	  treatment  to	  meet	 the
	  pollution   control	 standards.   The    general
	  biological treatment	units which  can be  adopted
	  under	 Indian	 conditions  are  anaerobic  lagoon,
	  aerated lagoon,  extended  aeration  systems	like
	  oxidation ditch, activated sludge process etc.
	       Anaerobic  lagoon   is  a   simple  anaerobic
	  treatment unit  suitable for	effluents with	high

	  aerators are	provided  to  transfer	oxygen	from
	  atmospheric air  to the  effluent  for  biological
	  treatment  using   micro-organisms  under  aerobic

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	       4. Jajmau is an environmentally degraded area

	  Civic facilities  for	 water	supply,	 sanitation,
	  solid	 waste	 removal  etc.	 are   also   highly
	  inadequate.  Because	the  area  abuts  the  Ganga
	  river, its  pollution affects the river quality as
	  well. Accordingly,  under the Ganga Action Plan an
	  integrated sanitation	 project is  being taken  up
	  for the  Jajmau area.	 Some aspects  of  the	Plan
	  relate to tannery wastes as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	       (i) The	medium and  large units will have to
	  up pre  treatment facilities	to ensure  that	 the

	  will be  necessary to	 treat the waste further and
	  as part of the Ganga Action Plan a treatment plant
	  will be  constructed for  this  purpose  utilising

<p id="p_22">     In	 the   counter-affidavit  filed	 on  behalf  of	 the
Hindustan Chambers  of Commerce, of which 43 respondents are
members it  is admitted	 that the  tanneries discharge their
trade effluents	 into the  sewage nullah  which leads to the
municipal sewage plant before they are thrown into the river
Ganga. It is not disputed by any of the respondents that the
water in  the river  Ganga is  being polluted grossly by the
effluent discharged  by the  tanneries. We are informed that
six of	the  tanneries	have  already  set  up	the  primary
treatment plants  for carrying	out the pre-treatment of the
effluent before it is discharged into the municipal Sewerage
which ultimately  leads to  the river Ganga. About 14 of the
tanneries are  stated to  be engaged  in the construction of
the primary treatment plants. It is pleaded on behalf of the
rest of	 the tanneries	who are the members of the Hindustan
Chambers of  Commerce and  three other tanneries represented
by Shir	 Mukul Mudgal  that if some time is given to them to
establish the pre-treatment plants they would H
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">298</span>
do so.	lt is,	however, submitted  by all  of them  that it
would not  be possible for them to have the secondary system
for treating  wastewater  as  that  would  involve  enormous
expenditure which the tanneries themselves would not be able
to meet.  It is	 true that  it may  not be  possible for the
tanneries to  establish	 immediately  the  secondary  system
plant in  view of  the large expenditure involved but having
regard to the adverse effect the effluents are having on the
river water,  the tanneries  at Jajmau,	 Kanpur	 should,  at
least set up of the primary treatment plants and that is the
minimum which  the tanneries  should do in the circumstances
of the case. In the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the
Hindustan Chamber  of Commerce	it is  seen that the cost of
pretreatment plant  for a  'A' class tannery is Rs.3,68,000,
the cost of the plant for a 'B' class tannery is Rs.2,30,000
and the cost of the plant for 'C' class tannery is Rs.50,000
This cost  does not  appear to	be excessive.  The financial
capacity of the tanneries should be considered as irrelevant
while requiring	 them to establish primary treatment plants.
Just like  an industry which cannot pay minimum wages to its
workers cannot	be allowed  to exist  a tannery which cannot
set up	a primary  treatment plant  cannot be  permitted  to
continue to  be in  existence for  the adverse effect on the
public at  large which is likely to ensue by the discharging
of the	trade effluents	 from the tannery to the river Ganga
would be immense and it will outweigh any inconvenience that
may be	caused to  the management and the labour employed by
it on  account	of  its	 closure.  Moreover,  the  tanneries
involved in  these cases  are not  taken  by  surprise.	 For
several years  they are	 being asked to take necessary steps
to prevent  the flow  of  untreated  wastewater	 from  their
factories into the river. Some of them have already complied
with the  demand. It  should be remembered that the effluent
discharged from a tannery is ten times noxious when compared
with the  domestic sewage  water which	flows into the river
from any  urban	 areas	on  its	 banks.	 We  feel  that	 the
tanneries at Jajmau, Kanpur cannot be allowed to continue to
carry on  the industrial  activity unless they take steps to
establish primary  treatment plants. In cases of this nature
this Court may issue appropriate directions if it finds that
the public  nuisance or	 other	wrongful  act  affecting  or
likely to  affect the  public is  being	 committed  and	 the
statutory authorities  who are	charged	 with  the  duty  to
prevent it  are not  taking adequate  steps to	rectify	 the
grievance. For	every breach  of a  right there	 should be a
remedy. It  is unfortunate  that a  number of  tanneries  at
Jajmau even  though they are aware of these proceedings have
not cared  even to enter appearance in this Court to express
their willingness to take appropriate steps to establish the
pretreatment plants.  So far  as they are concerned an order
directing them	to stop	 working their	tanneries should  be
passed.

     The case is adjourned to 27th October, 1987 to consider
the case  against the municipal bodies in the State of Uttar
Pradesh having jurisdiction over the areas through which the
river Ganga is passing.
</p><p id="p_32">     SINGH, J.	I respectfully agree with every word what my
learned brother Venkataramiah, J. has stated in the proposed
order and  the directions  issued by  that order. However, I
wish to add few words.
</p><p id="p_33">     The river	Ganga is  one of  the greatest rivers of the
world, although	 its entire  course is	only 1560 miles from
its source  in Himalaya	 to the	 sea. There  are many rivers
larger in shape and longer in size but no river in the world
has been  so great  as the  Ganga. It  is great	 because  to
millions of  people since  centuries it	 is the	 most sacred
river.	It   is	 called	  "Sursari"  river   of	 the   Gods,
'Patitpawani' purifier	of all	sins and  'Ganga Ma'  Mother
Ganges. To  millions of	 Hindus, it is the most sacred, most
venerated river	 on earth.  According the  Hindu belief	 and
mythology to  bathe in	it, is	to wash away guilt, to drink
the water,  having bathed  in it,  and to  carry it  away in
containers for	those who  may have not had the good fortune
to make	 the  pilgrimage,  to  it,  is	meritorious.  To  be
cremated on  its banks,	 or to	die there, and to have one's
ashes cast on its waters, is the wish of every Hindu. Many P
saints and  sages have persued their quest for knowledge and
enlightenment on the banks of the river Ganga. Its water has
not only  purified the	body and soul of the millions but it
has given  fertile land	 to the country in Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar. Ganga  has been	used as means of water transport for
trade and  commerce. The Indian civilization of the Northern
India thrived  in the  plains  of  Ganga  and  most  of	 the
important towns and places of pilgrimage are situated on its
banks. The  river Ganga has been part of Hindu civilization.
Pt. Jawahar  Lal Nehru who did not consider himself a devout
Hindu gave  expression to his feelings for the Ganga that is
to be  found in his Will and Testament, a short extract from
which is as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	  "My desire  to have  a handful  of my ashes thrown
	  into the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">301</span>
     Ganga at  Allahabad has  no religious  significance, so
     far as I am concerned. I have no religious sentiment in
     the matter.  I have  been attached to the Ganga and the
     Jamuna rivers in Allahabad ever since my childhood and,
     as I  have grown older, this attachment has also grown.
     I have  watched their  varying  moods  as	the  seasons
     changed, and have often thought of the history and myth
     and tradition  and song  and  story  that	have  become
     attached to  them through the long ages and become part
     of their  flowing waters. The Ganga, especially, as the
     river of  India, beloved of her people, round which are
     intertwined her  racial memories,	her hopes and fears,
     her songs	of triumph,  her victories  and her defeats.
     She has  been a  symbol of India's age-long culture and
     civilization, ever-changing, ever-flowing, and yet ever
     the same  Ganga. She  reminds me  of  the	snow-covered
     peaks and	the deep  valleys of  the Himalayas, which I
     have loved	 so much,  and of  the rich  and vast plains
     below, where my life and work have been cast."</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">     The river	Ganga is the life line of millions of people
of India,  Indian culture  and civilization has grown around
it. This  great river  drains  of  eight  States  of  India,
Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh,	 Bihar and West Bengal. The Ganga has always
been an	 integral part	of the nation's history, culture and
environment. It	 has been  the source  of sustenance  of the
millions of  people who	 have lived  on its  banks from time
immemorial.
</p><p id="p_35">     Millions of  our people  bathe in	the Ganga  drink its
water under an abiding faith and belief to purify themselves
and to	achieve moksha	release from  the cycle of birth and
death. It  is tragic  that the	Ganga, which  has since time
immemorial, purified  the people is being polluted by man in
numerous ways,	by dumping  of garbage,	 throwing carcass of
dead  animals	and  discharge	 of  effluents.	  Scientific
investigations and  survey reports have shown that the Ganga
which serves one-third of the India's population is polluted
by the	discharge of  municipal sewage	and  the  industrial
effluents in  the river. The pollution of the river Ganga is
affecting the life, health, and ecology of the Indo-Gangetic
Plain. The  Government as well as Parliament both have taken
a number  of steps  to	control	 the  water  pollution,	 but
nothing substantial  has been  achieved. I need not refer to
those steps  as my  learned brother  has referred to them in
detail. No  law or  authority can  succeed in  removing	 the
pollution unless the people cooperate. To my mind, it is the
sacred duty  of all  those who	reside or  carry on business
around
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">302</span>
the river  Ganga to ensure the purity of Ganga. Tanneries at
Jajmau area  near Kanpur  have been polluting the Ganga in a
big way.  This Court  issued notices to them but in spite of
notice many  industrialists  have  not	bothered  either  to
respond to  the notice	or to  take elementary steps for the
treatment of industrial effluent before discharging the same
into the  river. We are therefore issuing the directions for
the closure  of those  tanneries which	have failed  to take
minimum	 steps	 required  for	 the  primary  treatment  of
industrial  effluent.  We  are	conscious  that	 closure  of
tanneries may bring unemployment, loss of revenue, but life,
health and ecology have greater importance to the people.
