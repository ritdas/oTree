<p id="p_1">1.            The instant petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

raises a significant issue as to 'whether the Hindu College of Pharmacy,

Sonipat is exigible to payment of water cess and whether it would be

covered by the expression 'local authority' and 'specified industry' used in

Section 2(a) and 2(c) read with Schedule 1 of <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977 (for brevity 'the

Act'). As per the charging <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> of the Act, water cess could be levied

on the 'specified industry' or 'local authority'. It is payable by every person

carrying on any 'specified industry' or by any 'local authority'. The case of

the petitioner is that it is neither covered by the definition of expression

'local authority' or 'specified industry' as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_5">Section 2(a)</a> and

<a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_6">2</a> ( c) read with Schedule 1 of the Act. It is claimed that they are neither

'local authority' nor covered by any 'specified industry being' an

educational institution.

</p><p id="p_3">2.           In response to notice of motion having been issued, the

respondent- Board has filed the written statement. It is claimed that the

Board has rightly issued letter dated 27.3.1986 to the petitioner requiring it

to submit monthly water consumption return as per condition no.5 of the

Act. According to the respondents , the petitioner is covered under <a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_7">Section

2(a)</a> of the Act being 'local authority' and are liable to pay water cess.

</p><p id="p_4">3.           We have heard learned counsel for the parties at a

considerable length and are of the view that this petition deserves to

succeed. It would first be appropriate to read the charging <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_8">Section 3</a> of the

Act which is set out below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "3. Levy and Collection of cess.- (1) There shall be levied

               and collected cess for the purposes of the Water (Prevention

               and Control of Pollution )Act,1974 and utilization

               thereunder.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               (2)The cess under sub section (1) shall be payable by-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">               (b) every local authority,

               and shall be calculated on the basis of the water consumed

               by such person or local authority, as the case may be, for

               any of the purposes specified in column (1) of schedule II,

               at such rate, not exceeding the rate specified in the

               corresponding entry in column (2) thereof as the Central

               Government may, by notification in the official gazette,

               from time to time specify

               (3) Where any local authority supplies water to any person

               carrying on any specified industry or to any other local

               authority and such person or other local authority is liable to

               pay cess under sub section (2) in respect of the water so

               supplied, then, notwithstanding anything contained in that

               sub section, the local authority first mentioned shall not be

               liable to pay such cess in respect of such water."

</blockquote><p id="p_5">4.           A perusal of the aforesaid provision would make it clear that

cess has been levied and is to be collected for the purposes of Water

(Prevention and Control of Pollution ) Act, 1974 and utilization

thereunder. Such water cess is payable by a 'local authority' or any person

carrying on any 'specified industry'. The expression ' local authority' and

'specified industry' as used in <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> of the Act are defined by <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_10">sections 2</a>
</p><p id="p_6">(a) and 2( c) of the Act respectively and the definitions are set out below:

             requires,-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             (a) " local authority' means a municipal corporation or a

             municipal council ( by whatever name called) or a cantonment

             Board or any other body entrusted with the duty of supplying

             water under the law by or under which it is constituted.

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             (c )'specified industry' means any industry specified in

               schedule 1."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">5.           Under <a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_11">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act ' local authority' has been

defined to mean a municipal corporation, municipal council, cantonment

Board or any other body entrusted with the duty of supplying water under

the law by or under which it is constituted. The 'local authority' necessarily

has to be entrusted with the duty of supplying water under the law. An
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CWP No. 7467 of 1991                  4</span>

educational institution like the petitioner has no obligation to supply water

by virtue of provision of any law. When we read the expression like

municipal council, municipal corporation which are obliged by the

municipal laws to supply water to residents of local area then any other

such institution could be brought under the definition by the principle of

ejusdem generis if it under obligation by law to supply water. It is neither

the case pleaded nor even argued. The bald statement that the petitioner is

covered by expression 'local authority' is without substance and has not

been substantiated at all. Likewise under <a href="/doc/547105/" id="a_12">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act 'specified

industry' is the one, which is detailed in schedule 1. According to the

Schedule 15 industries have been listed which reads as under:

</blockquote><p id="p_8">6.          The educational institution run by the petitioner have not been

included in the definition of 'specified industry' nor any mention thereof

has been made in the schedule. By no stretch of reasoning the petitioner

school it could be called an 'industry' for the purposes of charging water

cess. There is no mention in Schedule 1 of the institution like the

petitioner. It is only those industries which cause water pollution or

discharge trade effluents that have been made liable to pay water cess. For

example, the     Petroleum    industry,   Ferrous metallurgical industry,

Chemical industry etc. etc. Therefore, it is evident that respondent did not

have any jurisdiction to demand levy or cess from the petitioner. Any

amount of water cess, under the Act, which is to be recovered from the

local authority or specified industry did not cover the same. It was under

some mis-conceived notion that the petitioner college was sought to be

brought within the mis-chief of <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> of the Act and was assessed by

passing assessment order dated 26.9.1986 (P.1). Consequential order of

penalty dated    26.2.1990 (P.2)    for non payment would also not be

sustainable. Likewise the order dated 19.4.1991 for recovery of cess,

penalty and interest as arrears of land revenue would also be illegal. It is

further appropriate to mention that when the petition came up for motion

hearing, the Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 21.5.1991 had

stayed the operation of recovery order dated 19.4.1991.

</p><p id="p_9">6.             The matter in respect of Tourism Corporation has been

considered by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1758792/" id="a_15">Haryana

Tourism Corporation Ltd v. Haryana State Board</a> for the Prevention and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CWP No. 7467 of 1991                  6</span>

Control of Water Pollution and another AIR 1993 P &amp; H 272. The Bench

held that Haryana Tourism Corporation would not fall in any of the

industries nor it would be covered by the expression 'local authority.The

Bench rejected similar argument of the respondent and the view of the

Division Bench is discernible from the perusal of paras 5 and 6 of the

judgement which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">            "   5. "................... Under no circumstance, the petitioner-

            Corporation can be said to be carrying on an industry engaged

            in processing of animal or vegetable products. Faced with this

            situation, emphasis was laid by the learned counsel for the

            respondents that the petitioner-Corporation fell within the

            ambit of 'local authority' being 'any other body' and, therefore,

            is liable to pay cess as it is supplying water to various visitors

            visiting or staying in the complexes.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">            6. The stand of the respondents cannot be accepted. As already

            noticed, the local authority means a municipal corporation or

            any other body entrusted with the duty of supplying water

            under the law by or under which it is constituted. In the

            present case, the respondents have completely failed to show

            that the petitioner-Corporation is entrusted with the duty of

            supplying water under the law...................... It does not apply

            to such persons who draw their own water, say, by installing

            tubewell and then supply in the houses or the complexes

            where some visitors also happen to come and stay. It is not the

            duty of such authority or a body to supply water under any

            provisions of law. The petitioner-Corporation is drawing water
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CWP No. 7467 of 1991                  7</span>

             for its own consumption and is not entrusted with the duty of

             supplying water to others. Merely providing the amenity of

             water to the visitors coming or staying in the complexes, by

             the petitioner-Corporation cannot mean to hold that it is

             entrusted with the duty of supplying water to them under the

             law.........` "

<p id="p_10">8.           In view of the above, this petition succeeds. It is declared that

the petitioner is not liable to pay water cess under <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_16">Section 3</a> of the Act as it

is neither 'local authority' or 'specified industry' within the meanings of

<a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_17">Section 2(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_18">2</a> ( c) of the Act. Consequently, orders dated 26.9.1986

(P.1), 26.2.1990 (P.2) and 19.4.1991 (P.4) are hereby quashed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
