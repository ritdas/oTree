                       Per contra, learned counsel for the petitioners
                       submits that in a similar case, Pollution Control
                       Board has specified 1 km. to be safe distance
                       between crusher and human habitation. Reliance
                       has been placed on Supreme Court decision in
                       Mohammed Haroon Ansari and another Vs. District
                       Collector, Ranga Reddy District (AIR 2004 SC 823).
                       That was a case where mining quarrying operations
                       were seen to be causing pollution, the expert
                       committee appointed by High Court opined that 1
                       km. is safe distance between site under quarry
                       lease and residential locality or Ground Level
                       Service Reservoir. Pollution Control Board also
                       specified 1 km. to be safe distance between crusher
                       and human habitation. The Supreme Court accepted
                       the said position. In view of such decision of
                       Supreme Court, learned counsel for the petitioner
                       would contend that the respondent-State should
                       modify the 1963 Minor Mineral Rules in view of the
                       report of the Pollution Control Board and decision of
                       the Supreme Court in Mohammed Haroon Ansari

                       the Board having found that the respondents nos. 6
                       to 8 were causing pollution in the area cancelled the

                       order dated 21.07.2010. In view of the cancellation
                       of such consent the respondents nos. 6 to 8 cannot
                       operate the crushing unit.

                       have closed the unit, submits that they be allowed
                       to apply for fresh lease in an area where the public

                       observe that the crushing unit can be allowed to

                    have started blasting operations which has caused
                    substantial damage to the residential houses including

                    that the authorities concerned in flagrant disregard of
                    the earlier orders passed by this Court have granted
                    permission to start the quarry in favour of Respondent

<p id="p_25">        4.        Learned counsel also submitted that the petitioners
                  had also highlighted potential risk and hazards to the
                  safety of life and property of the people residing in the
                  surrounding   area.        He     has      submitted   that      the
                  authorities concerned duly complied or/and ignored
                  the objections and representations of the petitioners.
                  Mr.Japee brought to our notice the photographs of the
                  mosque and other residential houses which indicates
                  and suggest that cracks have developed due to
                  vibration caused by the crushing unit which is only at
                  a distance of 645 meters. Mr.Japee also vehemently
                  submitted that it was specifically pointed out to the
                  authorities that on account of small particles of stones
                  being spread due to operation of the quarry the
                  standing crops also would get damaged. He submitted
                  that authorities also ignored the fact that there would
                  be shortage of water on account of necessity of water
                  in the quarry. The agricultural labourers residing in the
                  agriculture fields would also be affected by the
                  pollution created by the operation of the quarry unit.
                  He    submitted     that    authorities      very   conveniently
                  obtained NOC from some of the relatives, friends and
                  neighbours of respondent Nos.7 and 8 but deliberately
                  ignored the objection of the persons who are most
                  affected.

                    this judgment of the Apex Court Mr.Japee submitted
                    that Supreme Court took serious note of the pollution
                    being caused by operations of stone crushing/mining
                    quarry. He submitted further by inviting our attention
                    to para No.8 of the judgment where the Supreme Court
                    has observed that the distance of 1 k.m. is a safe

<p id="p_29">        7.          Learned Assistant Government Pleader appearing on

                    dispute to the fact that the distance between the site
                    and the residential locality is of 645 meters. According
                    to the learned AGP, this distance is a safe distance and
                    the pollution problem which is being apprehended by
                    the petitioners is not well founded, if respondent Nos.6
                    to 8 are permitted to operate the quarry. Learned AGP
                    further submitted that necessary permissions from the
                    revenue authority have also been obtained by the
                    respondent. Learned AGP relied on Gujarat Minor

                   lines, Dam, Roads, Hospitals, Buildings and residential

                   been granted in accordance with Rule 22(7)of Gujarat
                   Minor Minerals Rules, 1966. Learned AGP further
                   submitted that as and when it has been found that the
                   lease holder has violated the terms of the lease action
                   has been taken and penalty of Rs.10.50 lac has been
                   recovered from Respondent No.6. Learned AGP also
                   submitted relying on the affidavit-in-reply filed by
                   respondent no.4, Geologist that on inspection it has
                   been found that adequate measures are being taken
                   by respondent no.6 to meet with the conditions of the
                   lease. Learned AGP, therefore, submitted that there is

<p id="p_33">        9.        Learned Senior Counsel Mr.Bhaskar Tanna submitted
                  that respondent no.6 has in all earnestness carried out
                  all necessary modifications and compliance of Gujarat
                  Pollution Control Board given from time to time and
                  accordingly Gujarat Pollution Control Board has issued
                  a consent order in favour of respondent No.6 for a
                  period of five years. Learned Counsel submitted that
                  affidavit filed by the Geologist would show that Survey
                  No.613 is at a safe distance of 645 meters from the
                  said quarry. Mr. Tanna further submitted that there are
                  no residential houses in that area as well as in the
                  nearby vicinity. He vehemently submitted that when all

<p id="p_34">             VI.       ANALYSIS :
</p>
<p id="p_35">          10.      What can be gathered from the materials on record is
                   that in the first round of litigation, the petitioners
                   pointed out to the Court that the respondent Nos.6 to 8
                   were       using   crushing         machine    causing    multiple
                   problems relating to health hygiene and safety of the
                   agriculturists of the surrounding area. We have noticed
                   that at that point of time, the stand on behalf of the
                   State Government relying on the Collector's report was
                   that the minimum distance of 200 metres is prescribed
                   under the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966 and,
                   therefore, the unit of the respondent Nos.6 to 8 was far
                   beyond the prescribed distance from the residential
                   premises of the petitioners. We have also noticed that
                   at that stage the petitioners pointed out to the Court
                   that as per the decision of the Supreme Court in
                   Mohammed Haroon (supra), the minimum distance
                   between the crusher and human habitation must be 1
                   km. It was also pointed out to the Court that in view of
                   decision     of    the   Supreme       Court   in   the   case   of
                   Mohammed Haroon (Supra), the State should modify
                   Minor Mineral Rules, 1966, so far as the distance part
                   is concerned. We may only say at this stage that the
                   Rules, 1966 are now replaced by the Rules, 2010.
                   Even while enacting the Rules, 2010, it appears that
                   the State Government has overlooked the decision of
                   the Supreme Court in the case of Mohammed Haroon

                  (supra) so far as distance part is concerned. Be that as
                  it may, we shall deal with this issue at a later stage in
                  our judgment. We have also noticed that the Gujarat
                  Pollution Control Board submitted before the Court that
                  the respondent Nos.6 to 8 were causing pollution in the
                  area    and,   therefore,       cancelled   the   consolidated
                  consent and authorization (C.C.A.) by order dated July
                  21, 2010 and in this view of the matter, the respondent
                  Nos.6 to 8 cannot operate the crushing units. Record
                  also reveals that in the first round of litigation, the
                  respondent Nos.6 to 8 accepted the fact before the
                  Court that they have closed the unit as per the order of
                  the Gujarat Pollution Control Board dated July 21, 2010.
                  However, they pleaded that they may be allowed to
                  apply for fresh lease in an area where the public in
                  general will not be affected. We have noticed that the
                  Division Bench in its order dated August 31, 2010,
                  which we have referred to in the foregoing paragraph
                  22, observed without expressing any opinion that the
                  crushing unit can be allowed to operate without
                  causing pollution and affecting the agricultural fields or
                  human habitation or the health and hygiene of the
                  locality, including the water reservoirs.
</p>
<p id="p_36">          11.     It appears that once again the respondent Nos.6 to 8
                  applied before the Gujarat Pollution Control Board for
                  fresh lease and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board has
                  granted consent to run the unit, subject to certain
                  terms and conditions, which according to respondent
                  Nos.6 to 8 are being scrupulously complied with.
                  However, what is important once again is the distance

        WPPIL/70/2011                         14/33                     JUDGMENT



                  at which the unit is being operated from the residential
                  locality. It is an undisputed fact that the distance
                  between the unit and the residential locality of the
                  petitioners is about 645 metres i.e. for sure, less than 1
                  km.. We are not able to understand as to why            the
                  Gujarat Pollution Control Board has ignored this aspect
                  while granting consent, more particularly, when there
                  is a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
                  Mohammed Haroon (supra) that a safe distance
                  between a crushing unit and residential locality should
                  be 1 km.. The judgment of the Supreme Court would

                  Constitution of India and the Gujarat Pollution Control
                  Board       could not have overlooked the judgment and
                  granted necessary consent or permission to start the
                  unit. Most disturbing feature of this litigation is
                  complete misreading of Rule 22(vii) of the Gujarat
                  Minor Minerals Rules, 1966. It appears that taking
                  shelter of this particular Rule, the Gujarat Pollution
                  Control Board as well as respondent Nos.6 to 8 are of
                  the view that since the distance between the unit and
                  the residential locality is of more than 50 metres, as
                  prescribed under the Rules, the Gujarat Pollution
                  Control Board was well within its powers to accord
                  permission in favour of the respondent Nos.6 to 8. For
                  better understanding of this issue, we may quote Rule
                  22(vii) of the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966, which
                  reads as under :

<p id="p_37">          12.     Plain reading of this Rule 22(vii) suggests that the
                  quarrying operations can be permitted at any point
                  within a distance of 50 metres, if no blasting is
                  involved and if blasting is involved, then within a

<p id="p_38">          13.     In our opinion, the position of law as understood by the
                  respondents is completely misconceived and absurd. If
                  the argument of the respondents is accepted, it would
                  lead to a situation where the industrial stone crushing
                  unit would come and say that they do not discharge,
                  suspend particulate beyond the levels of parametres
                  prescribed under the Act and, therefore, they should
                  be allowed to operate the stone crushing unit in the
                  heart of the city. In the first instance, Rule 22(vii) of the
                  Rules, 1966 has no application because Rule 22(vii) is
                  absolutely      silent   insofar    as      the   distance   to    be

                  maintained from a residential locality is concerned. The
                  word "building" used in Rule 22(vii) would not suggest
                  that it would include the residential locality and other
                  structures like schools, temples, national highways,
                  etc.. This problem has cropped up as according to us,
                  there is no unified policy of Gujarat Pollution Control
                  Board       or any guidelines framed by the Gujarat
                  Pollution Control Board in this regard. What we have
                  noticed is as and when the permission is prayed for to
                  start a quarry unit, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board
                  seems to be taking into consideration the guidelines as
                  regards the parametres to be maintained as fixed
                  under Schedule-I of the Environment (Protection)
                  Rules,      1986.     We     shall    quote   Rule   37   of   the
                  Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, which reads as

                  is concerned. However, this would not preclude or

                     the Board has not issued any guidelines then too the
                     Board to achieve the object under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a> can issue
                     a direction relating to closure, prohibition or regulation
                     of any industry, operation or process. The Board can
                     also issue a direction to an existing unit that it should
                     shift its location. We are of the view that keeping in
                     mind the seriousness of the issue in question, the
                     Board must immediately frame appropriate guidelines
                     insofar as granting permission to start quarry operation
                     units (stone crushing units) like in the present case. In
                     framing such guidelines, the Board may keep in mind
                     the following factors :

                              and oxygen with minor constituents like
                              carbon dioxide and trap gases. Pollutants are
                              substances which are not normally present in
                              the air. Pollutants in the form of dust, smoke,
                              industrial and automobile exhaust, gaseous
                              and particulate matters, though not normally

                              air. Nature and amount of such pollutants
                              varies from place to place depending upon
                              population, vehicular density and location of
                              industrial units etc. Lungs are the major
                              organs affected by the air pollution. The

                              to air pollution. Organic matters including dust
                              can cause the allergic reactions producing
                              allergic alveolitis. Inorganic dust may get
                              deposited in the lungs and produce fibrosis.
                              Exposure to dust may lower the lung defences

                       awareness. Over thousands of years men had been
                       successfully exploiting the ecological system for his
                       sustenance but with the growth of population the
                       demand for land has increased and forest growth
                       has been and is being cut down and man has
                       started encroaching upon Nature and its assets.
                       Scientific developments have made it possible and
                       convenient for man to approach the places which
                       were hitherto beyond his ken. The consequences of
                       such interference with ecology and environment
                       have now come to be realised. It is necessary that
                       the Himalayas and the forest growth on the
                       mountain range should be left uninterfered with so
                       that there may be sufficient quantity of rain. The top
                       soil may be preserved without being eroded and the
                       natural setting of the area may remain intact. We
                       had commended earlier to the State of Uttar
                       Pradesh as also to the Union of India that
                       afforestation activity may be carried out in the
                       whole valley and the hills. We have been told that
                       such activity has been undertaken. We are not
                       oblivious of the fact that natural resources have got
                       to be tapped for the purposes of social development
                       but one cannot forget at the same time that tapping
                       of resources have to be done with requisite
                       attention and care so that ecology and environment
                       may not be affected in any serious way, there may
                       not be any depletion of water resources and long
                       term planning must be undertaken to keep up the
                       national wealth. It has always to be remembered
                       that these are permanent assets of mankind and
                       are not intended to be exhausted in one

                       and the search for new sources of energy and raw

                       balances, the destruction of a multitude of animal
                       and plant species for economic reasons and
                       sometimes for no good reason at all are factors
                       which     have      contributed      to    environmental
                       deterioration. While the scientific and technological
                       progress of man has invested him with immense
                       power over nature, it has also resulted in the
                       unthinking use of the power, encroaching endlessly
                       on nature. If man is able to transform deserts into
                       oases, he is also leaving behind deserts in the place
                       of oases. In the last century, a great German
                       materialist philosopher warned mankind : 'Let us
                       not, however, flatter ourselves over much on
                       account of our human victories over nature. For
                       each of such victory nature takes its revenge on us.
                       Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about
                       the results we expected, but in the second and third
                       places it has quite different unforeseen effects
                       which only too often cancel the first.' Ecologists are
                       of the opinion that the most important ecological
                       and social problem is the widespread disappearance
                       all over the world of certain species of living
                       organisms. Biologists forecast the extinction of
                       animal and plant species on a scale that is
                       incomparably greater than their extinction over the
                       course of millions of years. It is said that over half of
                       the species which became extinct over the last
                       2,000 years did so after 1900. The International
                       Association for the Protection of Nature and Natural
                       Resources calculates that now, on average, one
                       species or sub-species is lost every year. It is said
                       that approximately 1,000 bird and animal species
                       are facing extinction at present. So it is that the
                       environmental question has become urgent and it
                       has to be properly understood and squarely met by
                       man. Nature and history, it has been said, are two
                       component parts of the environment in which we
                       live, move and prove ourselves.

                       this problem. The once Imperial City of Calcutta is
                       no exception. The question raised in the present
                       case is whether the Government of West Bengal has
                       shown such lack of awareness of the problem of
                       environment in making an allotment of land for the
                       construction of a Five Star Hotel at the expense of
                       the zoological garden that it warrants interference
                       by this Court. Obviously, if the Government is alive
                       to the various considerations requiring thought and
                       deliberation and has arrived at a conscious decision
                       after taking them into account, it may not be for this
                       Court to interfere in the absence of mala fides. On
                       the other hand, if relevant considerations are not
                       borne in mind and irrelevant considerations
                       influence the decision, the Court may interfere in
                       order to prevent a likelihood of prejudice to the
                       public. Whether a problem of ecology is brought
                       before the Court, the Court is bound to bear in mind
                       <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_29">Art. 48-A</a> of the Constitution. Directive principle
                       which enjoins that 'The State shall endeavour to
                       protect and improve the environment and to
                       safeguard the forests and wild life of the country'
                       and <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_30">Art. 51</a> A (g) which proclaims it to be the
                       fundamental duty of every citizen of India 'to

                       including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life and to
                       have compassion for living creatures.' When the
                       Court is called upon to give effect to the directive
                       principle and the fundamental duty, the Court is not
                       to shrug its shoulders and say that priorities are a
                       matter of policy and so it is a matter for the policy
                       making authority. The least that the Court may do is
                       to examine whether appropriate considerations are
                       borne in mind and irrelevancies excluded. In
                       appropriate cases, the Court may go further, but
                       how     much    further   must depend        on   the
                       circumstances of the case. The Court may always
                       give necessary directions."

                  industrial unit and residing in the surrounding areas
                  owes an absolute obligation to the community to
                  ensure that no harm results to any one on account of
                  such hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the
                  activity. A person engaged in such industrial activity is
                  under       an   obligation     to   conduct         his   commercial
                  activities with the highest standards of safety. If the
                  enterprise is permitted to carry on any hazardous or
                  inherently dangerous activity for profit, the law must
                  presume that such permission is conditional on the
                  enterprise absorbing the cost of any accident arising
                  on account of such activity as an appropriate item of
                  its overheads. In case of loss on account of such
                  activity the enterprise is even liable to indemnify and
                  compensate the sufferer. No person, therefore, can
                  claim to have a right of carrying on any commercial
                  activity which admittedly affects the health of others.
                  The State, under these circumstances is under a
                  constitutional obligation to provide safeguards for
