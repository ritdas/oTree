<p id="p_1">      This application is filed to quash all proceedings relating to

C.C. 2206/2007 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Irinjalakuda.   The police has filed a charge sheet against the

accused and another person under <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_1">Section 269</a>, <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_2">278</a> IPC and

<a href="/doc/898393/" id="a_3">Section 24(1)</a> r/w. 43 of the Water Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution Act</a> 1974. The allegations against the accused are that

they had carried the human waste in a tanker and had attempted

to flow it in a residential locality which would give rise to

infectious diseases and therefore had committed the above said

offences. The learned counsel would contend that at any rate an

action under <a href="/doc/340671/" id="a_5">Section 24(1)</a> of the Water Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control

of Pollution Act</a> will not be maintainable. But whatever it may be,

on the basis of the allegation an action may lie under <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_7">Section 269</a>

and <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_8">278</a> of the IPC and other is a technical question that requires

consideration. The matter requires consideration at the hands of

the court below at appropriate stage and therefore if it is being

tried as a warrant trial where charge has to be framed, it may be

done at that stage otherwise let it be considered after the trial

and at the time of final hearing.
