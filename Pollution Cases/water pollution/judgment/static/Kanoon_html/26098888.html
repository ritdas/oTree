<p id="p_1">1.                 Originally, Petitioner Manuel F. Rodrigues had filed

Writ Petition No.18 of 2009 in the High Court of Bombay at

Panaji, Goa seeking invocation of Writ jurisdiction of the Hon'ble

High Court for issuance of Writ of Mandamus directing

Respondent No.1 to 7 to demolish illegal construction carried

out by Respondent No.8 in land Survey No.54/3 of village Velsao

in Marmugao Taluq.                     The other reliefs sought by him were of

incidental nature.                   The writ petition has been transferred by

Hon'ble High Court of Bombay, Bench at Goa vide order dated

(J) Appln. No.21(THC) of 2013 (WZ)
 17th October 2013. It appears that the Writ Petition has been

transferred to this Tribunal mainly for the                              reason that

contention of the petitioner inter-alia is that construction of the

Hotel raised within Survey No.54/3 by 8th Respondent is in

violation of CRZ Regulations and as such substantial dispute

relates to breach of environmental norms.

<p id="p_2">2.                 Admittedly, 8th Respondent-M/s. Kyle-San Holidays

Pvt. Ltd. is a company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>

1956. For sake of convenience, it may be referred hereinafter as

"Kyle Holiday Resort Company" (K.H.R.C.). 1st Respondent to 7th

Respondent are Government Authorities. 3rd Respondent is the

MoEF which controls the policy of Coastal Zone Management

and      Implementation               thereof   through     2nd    Respondent.      7th

Respondent is Village Panchyat of village Velsao which is semi-

Government organization working under the relevant Village

Panchyat Act. These seven authorities are directly or indirectly

concerned with implementation of the Coastal Regulation Zone

Notification           issued        under   provisions     of    the    <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment

(Protection) Act</a> 1986.                They were made parties to the original

petition for the reason that inspite of various complaints made

to them, they had failed to take proper legal action against the

illegal construction activities of 8th Respondent (K.H.R.C.).

</p><p id="p_3">3.                 Admittedly,          K.H.R.C.        applied    for     grant     of

Environment Clearance to the construction project of its Holiday

Resort (Hotel).                  The proposal was recommended by 2nd

Respondent i.e. GCZMA vide communication dated September

24th, 1994 and subsequently dated November 29th, 1996.                              So

 communication dated November 29th, 1996.                   3rd Respondent

(MoEF) granted the Environment Clearance (EC) dated April 20th

1998 to the project of K.H.R.C. on certain conditions. One of the

conditions was that the provisions of the Coastal Zone

Notification dated February 19th, 1991 and further amended

Notification dated August 16th 1994 as well as July 9th, 1997

and provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a> shall be

complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.                 Case of the Applicant is that under the CRZ

Notification dated February 19th, 1991 Zones were classified as

CRZ-I, CRZ-II, CRZ-III and CRZ-IV in accordance with the

distance from base line of the High Tide Line (HTL) and Low Tide

Line (LTL).          Said Notification declared the Coastal stretches of

seas, bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers and backwater influenced by

tidal action on landward side upto 500 mtrs. distance from High

Tide Line (HTL).                The HTL has been defined as the line upto

which the highest tide reaches during the spring season.               By

virtue of said Notification, area of 200 mtrs. distance from HTL

was declared as No Development Zone (NDZ).                  Obviously, no

construction activity or any kind of development activity was

permissible within the said area of the NDZ.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.                 According to the Applicant, one of the conditions

stipulated in the EC dated April 20th, 1998 granted in favour of

8th Respondent (K.H.R.C.) is Condition No.XIX which mandated

that the construction shall conform to all the provisions of the

Coastal Zone Management Plan of Goa.                    Another condition

No.XXII is that no construction shall be carried out within 200

mtrs. towards the seaward side.                 The Applicant alleges that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                         4</span>
(J) Appln. No.21(THC) of 2013 (WZ)
 although 7th Respondent i.e. Village Panchyat had issued

construction permission dated July 2nd 1999 in favour of 8th

Respondent (K.H.R.C.).                    Yet, no work was carried out in any

manner and as such, validity period of the permission/licence

elapsed by the end of June 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.                 The Applicant averred that although 8th Respondent

(K.H.R.C.) submitted applications for renewal of the construction

permission/licence                   on    two   occasions,      however,        those

applications were rejected by 7th Respondent-Village Panchyat at

both the times on September 16th, 2002 and October 31st, 2002.

The 7th Respondent (Village Panchyat) took a stand that it had

no legal authority to renew the construction licence.                             Still,

however, after about two years of such rejection on second

occasion,          the       Village      Panchyat     granted   renewal    to     the

construction licence in favour of 8th Respondent (K.H.R.C.) on

August 17th, 2004. There was no iota of construction activity,

even till the time of said renewal of construction licence issued

in favour of 8th Respondent. The renewal was granted subject to

certain        conditions            including   the    condition   that    the     8th

Respondent shall obtain Health Cards for labourers engaged by

the Contractor from the Health Officer, before commencement of

the construction.                    The construction licence issued by 7th

Respondent-Village                   Panchyat    was     challenged   before       the

Additional Director of Panchyat, by one of the Panch Member on

the ground that the resolution to renew the construction licence

was improper and illegal.                   By an interim order, the Additional

Director stayed operation of the resolution No.14 passed in the

meeting of the Village Panchyat and called for Record and

 Proceedings. This stay order was issued on October 18th, 2004.

The Applicant alleges that as on that date, the construction

activity has not been fully commissioned and was at the stage of

beginning but came to stand still due to the stay order.

</p><p id="p_7">7.                 According to the Applicant, villagers of Velsao had

challenged another project which was proposed in land Survey

No.53/5 and was approved in the year 1997-98 treating HTL as

per       Naval         Hydrographic        Chart       Dehradun.    The   letter

communication of addressed by the villagers to the Hon'ble High

Court of           Bombay, Bench at Goa, was treated as P.I.L. and

Writ Petition No.154 of 2000 was entertained by Hon'ble

Divisional Bench which by order dated July 10th, 2000 gave

directions to GCZMA, to consider the grievances of the villagers.

Thereafter, the GCZMA gave directions to that project proponent

that no construction shall be permitted in Survey no.53/5. It is

alleged, therefore, that identical legal action should have been

taken by the GCZMA against 8th Respondent (K.H.R.C.)

</p><p id="p_8">8.                 The case of the Applicant further is that though 2nd

Respondent (GCZMA) issued show cause notice under provisions

of <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_5">section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, to 8th

Respondent (K.H.R.C.) when the unauthorized excavation was

done and a foundation was being laid, yet, subsequently, by

order dated July 24th 2006, Chief Secretary, Government of Goa

directed 4th Respondent (Collector South Goa) to carry out joint

inspection           and       also   directed   that    during   inspection   8th

Respondent (K.H.R.C.) shall suspend the construction work

until the issue is finally sorted out.                  The joint inspection was

accordingly carried out on August 4th, 2006 in presence of a

 local M.L.A., Member Secretary of GCZMA, Dy. Collector,

Mamlatdar, Village Sarpanch, S.D.O. and representative of 8th

Respondent.              A joint inspection report was drawn thereafter

which indicates that the construction of K.H.R.C. falls within the

N.D.Z. The matter was discussed in the meeting of GCZMA in

August 2006 and after deliberation in the said meeting a

reference was made to the 3rd Respondent (MoEF).                                   The

Applicant further alleges that the 8th Respondent (K.H.R.C.)

committed violation of the C.R.Z. Notification of 1991 and

though the construction had not started prior to 2004, in any

manner, what so ever, yet, GCZMA sought advice from National

Coastal         Management             Zone    Authority,     MoEF     by    a   letter

Communication dated September 22nd, 2006 on making wrong

representation that said construction of the hotel project vis-a-

vis HTL demarcation as per Naval Hydrographic Chart may be

taken into account and appropriate guidance may be given.

Subsequently,              the       show    cause   notice   issued    to   the   8th

Respondent was decided to be dropped on the ground that the

construction was initiated as per the approved plan and that it

was "on going" project.                 By letter Communication dated April

23rd, 2008, the GCZMA informed the said decision to 8th

Respondent             and       the   3rd    Respondent      also   continued     the

Environment Clearance for the reason that it was treated as "on

going project" and as such, the work was allowed to be

continued.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.                 The Applicant alleges that the 3rd Respondent (MoEF)

(J) Appln. No.21(THC) of 2013 (WZ)
 properly evaluated by the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent

failed to see that the Members of the 2nd Respondent (GCZMA)

vaguely stated that the impugned construction of the K.H.R.C. is

outside 200 mtrs. of the HTL which was factually incorrect.

Moreover, the project was not "on going" as such, because no

work was done, till the site inspection was carried out by the Dy.

Collector, representative of the 8th Respondent and others. The

Applicant alleges that the authorities have bent and violated all

the Rules with sinister design to help the 8th Respondent and

protect the illegal construction of K.H.R.C.             The Applicant,

therefore, seeks demolition of the construction of the K.H.R.C.

and further seeks direction to initiate appropriate inquiry

against the authorities who rendered help to the 8th Respondent

in such illegal activity. Hence, the Application.

</p><p id="p_10">10.                By filing reply-Affidavit of Olga D'souza, Sarpanch of

the Village Panchyat, 7th Respondent resisted the Application.

According to the 7th Respondent, construction licence was

issued to 8th Respondent (K.H.R.C.) on July 2nd, 1999 for the

proposed construction to be carried out in Survey No.54/3 in

accordance with the approvals which were granted by the 2nd,

3rd, and 6th Respondent to the said work.            It is further stated

that the renewal of licence was declined by communication

dated September 27th, 2002 because of the lapses of the licence

period. Still, however, it was subsequently renewed on August

17th, 2004 due to change in the circumstances.                   The 7th

Respondent alleged that by Resolution dated August 14th, 2007,

request for construction licence sought by 8th Respondent was

rejected and therefore, the 8th Respondent had filed Appeal vide

Panchyats.            By order dated May 26th, 2008 that Appeal was

allowed and the 7th Respondent was directed to renew the

construction licence. It is submitted by the 7th Respondent that

when the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay, suo-moto, in Writ

Petition No.02 of 2006 directed all the village Panchyats to take

action against the structures which were identified to have come

up within 'No Development Zone' as per the CRZ plan drawn by

the Directorate of settlement and land records, the construction

of 8th Respondent was identified to be falling under 'No

Development Zone'. So, a show cause notice was issued to the

8th Respondent.                Moreover, 2nd Respondent was requested to

clarify whether the impugned construction was violating CRZ

Notification of 1991. The clarification was communicated vide

letter dated November 7th, 2008 by 2nd Respondent, informing

that the construction undertaken by 8th Respondent could not

be construed as violating the CRZ Notification, 1991 and hence

it was for such a reason that the show cause notice was dropped

and the subsequent construction renewal was allowed in favour

of 8th Respondent.

property in land Survey No.53/6 (Part) in violation of the CRZ

Notification.            The Applicant cannot ventilate cause of public

interest when the Application is ill-motivated and filed with

personal interest.               The Application is filed with ill-intention to

black-mail the 8th Respondent and is therefore, abuse of the

legal process. A parcel of land Survey No.54/3 was purchased

by 8th Respondent vide registered sale-deed dated January 31st

view to develop the same for tourism purpose.                           Before

existing authority i.e. GSCCE (Goa State Coastal Committee for

Environment) to demarcate the High Tide Line (HTL) as per

was demarcated as on February 26th, 1996, that construction

conducted inspection of the site on March 1st, 1996 and

thereafter in the 11th Meeting held on March 15th, 1996 and

March 24th, 1996 decided to refer the construction project to the

 the Member Secretary of the GSCCE called upon the 8th

Respondent to submit revised plan for approval indicating the

HTL as demarcated by the Naval Hydrographic Office Chart.

Such revised Plans were drawn and submitted to the GSCCE on

August 10th, 1996 curtailing the construction area, in view of the

change in the High Tide Line position, as indicated under the

Naval Hydrographic Office Chart.       The revised plans were

accordingly forwarded by the Member Secretary of GSCCE (Goa

State Coastal Committee for Environment) to the MoEF on

November 29th 1996. The MoEF called upon 8th Respondent to

obtain NOC from the Goa Pollution Control Board in order to

facilitate processing of the Application.    After the NOC was

produced, the MoEF approved the project on April 28th 1998 by

imposing certain conditions. The Condition XV of the EC is that

Naval Hydrographic Office Chart shall be adopted as Bench

Mark for demarcation of the HTL in the area. On strength of the

said EC, granted by the MoEF the construction licence was

sought from the 7th Respondent which was duly issued after

inspection. The Collector of South Goa also granted permission

for conversation of the land to non-agricultural use by imposing

fees of Rs.62,805/- vide order dated March 5th 1999.          The

construction work could not be commenced and subsequently

the period of construction licence was over. The 7th Respondent

declined to renew the licence and, therefore, an Appeal was filed

before Director of Panchyats which was allowed on May 8th

 work shall not be stopped. The joint inspection was carried out

by the authorities on August 10th, 2006.                           The authorities

including           the       GCZMA          represented   that    the     impugned

construction was within 200 mtrs. which was demarcated by the

National            Institute           of    Oceanography        (NIO),    whereas

representatives of 7th Respondent and 8th Respondent identified

the High Tide Line as marked by the stones which were kept at

the site and did not accept the HTL indicated by the Officers of

the 4th Respondent. The construction was validly undertaken in

accordance with the HTL identified by the Naval Hydrographic

Office chart prevailing at time of approval of the project and

when the construction activities began.                    The construction was

"on going project" and therefore, it could not be treated as

activity done in breach of the CRZ Notification of 1991 nor does

it fall within NDZ area. Consequently, there is no violation of

CRZ Notification due to the impugned construction.                          The 8th

Respondent has incurred heavy expenditure for construction of

the Holiday Resort which is likely to be adversely affected if the

Application is allowed in terms of the prayers".

</p><p id="p_12">12.                The       8th      Respondent    sought    dismissal      of   the

Application chiefly on the ground that the construction project

was granted EC by the MoEF because the HTL was demarcated

by the Naval Hydrographic Office Chart which was then accepted

and approved bench-mark for the purpose.                           The subsequent

change in the HTL would not materially affect the construction

project because it was "on going project" and as such the same is

legal and valid.                     The 8th Respondent, in support of such

contention seek to rely on observations in case of "Goan Real

Court         clarified        the      legal     position.    There        were   certain

developments during pendency of the Writ Petition before the

Hon'ble High Court of Bombay, Bench at Goa. We may give brief

account of such developments, at this juncture, before we would

set out what transpired during hearing of the Application in this

Tribunal.             By order dated February 11th, 2009 the 8th

Respondent              was          restrained     from      carrying      out    further

construction in any manner and was directed to maintain

status-quo as on that day. By order dated June 30th, 2009 the

Hon'ble Division Bench directed Registrar of the High Court of

Bombay Bench at Goa to carry out inspection of the site and

submit a report.                 The site inspection was carried out as per

directions of the Hon'ble Bench. A report was submitted to the

Hon'ble High Court Bench at Goa and is placed on record.

</p><p id="p_13">13.                As stated before, by order dated October 17th, 2013,

the Writ Petition No. 98 of 2009 came to be transferred to this

Tribunal. Notices were issued to the parties. On the first date of

appearance, none had appeared. Subsequently, on January 8th,

2014, learned Counsel for the Applicant appeared and informed

that a separate Application seeking leave to withdraw the main

Application            has       been     filed     on     account     of     subsequent

developments. That Application is treated as Misc. Application

Agencies sought time to file reply-Affidavits.                       Learned Counsel

appearing for 8th Respondent stated that the construction was

done in accordance with approved plan and there was no

illegality committed by the 8th Respondent (K.H.R.C.).                                 We

view of the fact that substantial question pertaining to

Environmental dispute is involved in the matter.

</p><p id="p_14">14.                We heard learned Counsel for the parties.                 It need

not be reiterated that the Applicant has no interest left in the

matter and his counsel did not advance arguments on merits of

the Application. However, learned Counsel Ms. F.M. Mesquita

appearing for the first 6 Respondents except MoEF and learned

Sr. Counsel Mr. Coelho Pareira appearing for 8th Respondent

vehemently argued that the impugned construction does not

violate the CRZ Notification of 1991.                      They seek to rely upon

Affidavit of Dr. U. Sridharan, Additional Director of the MoEF.

The Affidavit of Dr. U. Sridharan shows that the MoEF granted

EC for construction of M/s. Saldanha Cove Beach Resort under

CRZ Notification, 1991 on April 20th 1998 on basis of the maps

prepared by Naval Hydrographer as per the Naval Hydrographic

Chart which was the only recognized agency for demarcating the

High       Tide        Line          basis   of   (HTL)   and   on   basis   of   the

recommendations of Chief Town Planner, Government of Goa.

The Affidavit further shows that the MoEF had authorized

certain Agencies for demarcating the HTL in the month of

December 1998, the Coastal Zone Management Authorities were

constituted in 1998 and were delegated powers for the CRZ

projects. The project seems to be within 200 mtrs. of the HTL

due to the change in the shoreline at subsequent stage, but the

EC cannot be withdrawn as the HTL demarcated by the National

Institute of Oceanography was not stipulated for the projects

that were cleared earlier to such demarcation.

</p><p id="p_15"> 15.                Thus, Affidavit of Dr. U.Sridharan is to the effect that

the project was given clearance on the strength of distance

between the proposed construction and the High Tide Line (HTL)

as per Naval Hydrographic Chart prepared by the Naval

Hydrographer which was the only recognized prevailing agency

for demarcating the HTL. His Affidavit further shows that there

was subsequent change in the HTL demarcated by the NIO

(National Institute of Oceanography) due to the change in the

shoreline but it was not relevant for the purpose because the

project which was already cleared on the basis of the HTL

demarcated by the Naval Hydrographic Chart could not have

been materially altered.

                   issued April 20th, 1998 would stand valid because

 directions were issued to the Authorities to tackle with the

common problem of CRZ violations. Obviously, it is difficult to

say that the Applicant approached the High Court or the

Tribunal at belated stage. In any case, it cannot be said that the

Applicant kept quite till the project was at the stage of

completion and thereafter approached the Court with ulterior

motive. It is the contention of the 8th Respondent that the Writ

Petition/Application is filed with ulterior motive of black-mailing

him. Had that been so, perhaps the Applicant would not have

filed the Application for withdrawal of the same. It is not the

contention of the 8th Respondent that he has succumbed to the

illegal demands of the Applicant and has paid any amount of

alleged "black money" to the Applicant.             It is easy to make

allegations of illegal gratification or demand for black money or

attribute ill-motives to others but it is difficult to justify conduct

of any one who himself now says that the Application for the

withdrawal of petition/main Application should be allowed.

</p><p id="p_34">19.                At this juncture, we may further clarify that by order

dated February 11th, 2009, the Hon'ble Bench of the High Court

restrained the 8th Respondent from carrying out further

construction in any manner and directed maintenance of status-

quo.         In the same order, it is categorically stated that the

construction in question, as per the statement of learned

Advocate General, is within 200 mtrs. as per the HTL

demarcated through NIO (National Institute of Oceanography).

In this background, further direction issued vide order dated

June 30th, 2009 also may be taken into account. By that order

of the High Court, the 8th Respondent was permitted to carry on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                       19</span>

 the construction subject to condition that no claim for equity on

the basis of such construction will be putforth and that he shall

be required to remove the impugned construction, if ultimately

the petition would be decided against him. The Hon'ble Division

Bench appointed Registrar of the High Court, Bench at Goa, to

conduct site inspection with help of a technical person.

Considering the tenor of such specific order passed by the

Hon'ble Bench on June 30th, 2009, it goes without saying that

the 8th Respondent was well aware that no claim for equity could

be putforth, if, ultimately the impugned construction would be

held as illegal. Not only that, the 8th Respondent was very well

put on notice that he would be required to remove such

construction in case the petition/Application is decided against

him. In other words, the 8th Respondent was having full notice

of the consequences which may follow if the impugned

construction would be held as illegal. Obviously, the pleadings

of the 8th Respondent regarding his huge investment of money,

so called probability of loss that may be incurred by him due to

adverse orders and the so called protection on basis of equity

due to the EC granted by the MoEF is of no avail. We need to

dislodge such pleas based on equitable principle in view of the

orders of the Hon'ble High Court which we have referred to

herein above.

 the same was allowed to be completed. The learned Sr. Counsel

would submit that reliance of the Applicant on judgment of the

Apex Court in "Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action Vrs. Union

of India, 1996(4) S.C.C. 263" is misplaced. He argued that the

facts of the present case stands on different footing and

therefore, the ratio of the judgment in "Indian Council for Enviro-

Legal Action" is not applicable. He further argued that judgment

of the Apex Court in Writ Petition (C) (2008) 8 S.C.C.645 in

Goan Real Estate and Construction Ltd. and another Vrs. People's

Movement for <a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_6">Civil Act</a>ion, will govern the facts of the present

case.       He pointed out that the Apex Court in case of "Indian

Council for Enviro-Legal                Action"    was    pleased   to   consider

amendment of the CRZ Notification of 1991 by virtue of CRZ

Notification 1994 which curtailed the NDZ (No Development

Zone) by relaxing the distance of 50 meters to 100 meters with

reference to HTL in relation to rivers.                  It is pointed out that

judgment in "Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action" is held to

have prospective application in view of the dictum in "Goan Real

Estate and Construction Ltd. and another" (supra). Mr. Coelho

Pareira, learned Sr. Counsel vehemently argued, therefore, that

the construction of the K.H.R.C. was in accordance with the

construction licence granted on basis of the HTL demarcated as

per the Naval Hydrographer Office Chart which was prevalent at

the relevant time and hence, the subsequent changes in the HTL

<p id="p_36">21.                Before considering the legal position and applicability

of a particular yardstick to the facts of the present case, it would

be useful to mention here that 'No Development Zone' (NDZ) is

specifically defined by the CRZ Notification of 1991.                    The CRZ

Notification is issued U/s. 3 sub-section (1) and Clause (v) of

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986.          The purport of the CRZ Notification is to impose

restrictions "on industries, operation and processes in the CRZ".

The CRZ Notification aims to protect stretches of the land

adjoining the HTL and prohibits certain activities including

construction, trading, industries so on and so forth.                           The

expression "No Development Zone" (NDZ) is clarified under the

Notification as :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   "Area upto 200 meters upto HTL of landward side in

         case of seafront and 100 meter alongwith Tidal influence

         Water bodies or width of the creek which ever is less".

<p id="p_37">Perusal         of    the      said   Notification   goes    to   show   that   no

construction shall be permitted within NDZ except for repairs or

reconstruction of existing authorized structure within existing

FSI.

 Premnath Savant go to show that at the inception, the HTL

demarcated by the surveyor of India and later on as demarcated

by Naval Hydrographic Office Chart was taken as base line for

the purpose of approval of the construction plan.           It is stated

that on basis of such Naval Hydrographic Office Chart, the Goa

State Coastal Committee for Environment (GSCCE) by letter

No.27 of 1995 approved the plan for construction.                  The

pioneer/vegetation line did not appear as demarcated one in

that plan and HTL as indicated in the Naval Hydrographic Office

Chart.        It is asserted by the 8th Respondent that letter dated

November 27, 1995 is indicative of the correct picture. Further,

it is stated on Affidavit that the 8th Respondent is ready and

willing to produce the original letter Communication in support

of the contention that such HTL was demarcated by the Naval

Hydrographer at the height point at which the water level

reaches or wherefrom the permanent vegetation began.

</p><p id="p_39">23.                From the pleadings of the parties, it is amply clear

that the location of the HTL at the time of commencement of the

construction activity, the period of actual commencement

activity and the applicability of particular CRZ Notification are

the important aspects which need consideration.

submissions of Sr. Counsel Mr. Coelho Pereira, we may clarify

the factual position that atleast until April 2000, there was

absolutely not a single brick placed at the work site. By letter

<p id="p_51">                  Still, however, there is no iota of evidence to show

that such condition was complied with by the 8th Respondent at

any given point of time. The 8th Respondent has not produced

any scintilla of authentic record to show that there was

particular          demarcation         of   HTL   in   the    area   by   Naval

Hydrographic Office, Dehradun wherefrom the distance of the

proposed construction was measured prior to approval of the

construction licence issued by the Village Panchyat. It is further

important to note that 8th Respondent has failed to produce copy

of the Naval Hydrographic Office Chart which allegedly prevailed

at the relevant time, in the year 1998.

for Environment) considered the proposal.              At the fag end of

paragraph 10 of the Affidavit in sur-re-joinder, it is stated that

the 8th Respondent had not doctored the said covering letter nor

its sister concern had manipulated the same and therefore,

genuineness of the said covering letter cannot be disputed. It is

further stated :-

<p id="p_53">28.                We fail to see as to why any specific direction was

needed from the Court for production of said letter when

genuineness of the said letter was disputed by the Applicant.

Moreover, the construction plan was not submitted by the 8th

Respondent at the relevant time but it was said to have been

submitted by the so called sister concern. The fact that the 8 th

Respondent purchased the part of the land Survey No. 54/6 in

January 1996 is a glaring fact.                 That was subsequently

purchased and that construction licence was sought from the

Village Panchyats at later point of time.

the 8th Respondent falls within the NDZ if HTL mark as a NIO

(National Institute of Oceanography) near vegetation line is

considered as the Bench mark. Therefore, 8 th Respondent was

directed         to     refrain      itself     from       carrying    out    any    further

construction.

<p id="p_55">30.                What we find from the record is that the 8th

Respondent utterly failed to establish that the construction was

approved in accordance with the HTL which was prevalent in

1998 which is said to be the line demarcated by Naval

Hydrographic Chart drawn by the Dehradun Authority.                                        It

cannot be assumed merely on basis of the Affidavit filed by the

8th Respondent that such line was demarcated for the area of

Village Velsao. Secondly, it is manifest that subsequently, there

was a direction of the Hon'ble High Court to demarcate the HTL

on basis of the vegetation line available as Bench mark by way of

stop       gap        arrangement             till   the     NIO      (National     Institute

Oceanography)                could     finally       determine        the    same.       The

parameters were not complied with by the 8th Respondent. So

also, it is amply clear that the construction work had not

commenced at all prior to April 2000. By that time, already the

Notification dated December 29th, 1998 had been issued and on

basis thereof, the 2nd Respondent (GCZMA) had stayed all

construction activities pending demarcation of HTL by NIO

(National Institute of Oceanographic). It is obvious that the 8th

Respondent could not have started the construction when it had

not commenced at all in the month of April 2000, due to

intervening CRZ Notification and the Communication of the

reference has been made in respect of their findings and

regarding demarcation of HTL somewhere in the year 2005. The

sketch map drawn by Circle Inspector and Field Surveyor of the

dated July 22nd 2009 filed by the Registrar of the Hon'ble High

Court goes to show that the construction work was hardly at the

stage of fixing of grills and putting of certain walls. It was found

that on second floor, there was no other construction except

walls and the beams.                   No slab work was done.           The internal

work such as flooring/laying of tiles, installation of water tap,

that 8th Respondent had not started the construction work

Collector of South Goa found that the proposed construction

was       within        NDZ          and   there   was   no    actual    authorized

construction raised at the site. The site inspection was carried

out in view of order (H-1) dated July 24th 2006 passed by the

         Cortalim Mr. Mathany Saldana have stated that the
         construction coming up is within 200 mts. of the high tide

          that at the ground level, construction must be cross checked
         to see whether it is actually within 200 mts of the HTL. If
         so, than we have to necessarily take up this issue again
         with the Ministry of Environment and see whether the
         earlier approval is valid. The total facts of the case may be

         the presence of the complainant, representative of the
         Developers as well as Dr. Varde.             Due notice of the

</p><p id="p_66">35.                Now, legal submission advanced by learned Sr.

Counsel Mr. Coelho Pareira may be considered in the light of the

aforesaid fact situation.            By Judgment dated April 18 th, 1996,

the Apex Court in "Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action Vrs.

Union of India, 1996(4) S.C.C. 281" held that the amendment of

CRZ Notification of 1991 by another Notification August 16 th,

1994 which caused reduction of the CRZ area for prohibition of

construction activity in              the   NDZ was illegal.    The   two

amendments were held to be bad in law and as such were struck

down. According to learned Sr. Counsel Mr. Coelho Pareira the

present case is not governed by Dictum of the Apex Court in

"Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action Vrs. Union of India,

referred to above but is covered by Goan Real Estate and

Construction Ltd. and another Vrs. Union of India, through

Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Forest &amp; others (W.P. (C) 329

(J) Appln. No.21(THC) of 2013 (WZ)
 have carefully gone through the Judgment in "Goan Real Estate

and Construction Ltd. &amp; Another". The facts of the given case

would make it explicit that the petitioners in that matter (Goan

Real Estate and Construction Ltd. &amp; Another) who had obtained

construction permission in respect of a project beyond 100

meters, had submitted additional proposal to the Village

Panchyat for construction of 18 blocks between 50 mtrs. and

100 mtrs., in view of the relaxation granted vide subsequent

CRZ Notification of 1994.             The Town and Country Planning

Authority approved the construction vide order dated July 31 st,

1995. The Village Panchyat sanctioned the plans and granted

permission to construct.             It was further found that (Project

Proponent i.e. Goan Real Estate and Construction Ltd. and

another) had carried out certain construction within 50 and 100

mtrs. of the stretches. This was noticed during site inspection

dated September 25th, 1996.            The foundation work was found

but have been completed work upto plinth level and in some

areas of the property was also completed, the construction work

of the building was complete and ready for occupation.             The

facts stated at the fag end of the said Judgment go to show that

the construction work done by M/s. Goan Real Estate and

Construction Ltd. and another was practically completed prior to

September 25th 1996 and therefore, there was substance in the

contention that it was "a continuing project" of which the work

had started, prior to pronouncement of the judgment in "Indian

Council for Enviro-Legal Action" (Supra) and hence that project

could be treated as "on going project" and may not be impacted

by invalidity of CRZ Notification of 1994 as per judgment of the

(J) Appln. No.21(THC) of 2013 (WZ)
 Apex Court delivered on April 18th, 1996. What the Apex Court

has decided in "Goan Real Estate and Construction Ltd. and

another (supra) is that its judgment in "Indian Council for Enviro-

Legal Action" will have prospective effect.                     So, the Dictum in

"Indian         Council          for      Enviro-Legal   Action"    has    remained

undisturbed but will hold the field prospectively. This precisely

is the legal ratio which can be culled out from judgment of the

Apex Court in Goan Real Estate and Construction Ltd. and

another Vrs. Union of India, through Secretary, Ministry of

Finance and Forest &amp; others (W.P. (C) 329 of 2008) decided on

March 31st 2010.

<p id="p_67">36.                It need not be re-iterated that in the fact situation of

present case atleast till April 2000 there was no construction

activity at the site. The 8th Respondent later on proceeded with

unauthorized construction after 2008 which was stalled by the

competent authority. It appears that the MoEF erroneously gave

opinion that the project was "on going construction activity" or

that there was some mis-representation in this behalf.

</p><p id="p_68">37.                Be that may as it is, when there was absolutely no

construction activity initiated prior to April 18 th, 1996 by the 8th

Respondent at the site in question, he cannot claim benefit of

the judgment in "Goan Real Estate and Construction Ltd. and

another" (supra). As a matter of fact, perhaps, it was for such a

reason that the Hon'ble High Court Bench pre-warned the 8th

Respondent             that          if   such   construction   activity   could   be

undertaken by him, then it would be at his risk and without

claiming any equity. Inspite of such clear understanding given

by the Hon'ble Division Bench of the Bombay High Court at Goa,

(J) Appln. No.21(THC) of 2013 (WZ)
 the 8th Respondent proceeded with the construction and got it

completed.           Obviously, the 8th Respondent must face the legal

consequences which may follow.                 The record of the present case

reveals disturbing state of affairs in the Administration of the

Regulatory functionaries.                  It appears that the Regulatory

Authorities as well as MoEF practically joined hands with the

8th Respondent although the impugned construction was

apparently violative of the CRZ Notification 1991, even though it

had not been initiated before April 1996 and was granted

renewal only on third occation by the Village Panchyat in 2004.

There is not only an attempt to circumvent the legal provisions

by the 8th Respondent but also hoodwinking done by others.

environmental degradation caused due to violation of the CRZ

on the 8th Respondent in as much as he proceeded with the

illegal construction undauntedly, in total disregard to pre

warning given by the Hon'ble High Court, taking a risk of the

things which he was aware of to be rather a murky affair. We

also deem it proper to call upon the 8th Respondent to pay

restitution cost to the State of Goa which can be utilized for

restitution of the environment.                   We further deem it proper to

impose appropriate cost on the Village Panchyat, for illegally
