PRESENT:
</p><p id="p_6">Hon'ble Dr. Justice P. Jyothimani (Judicial Member)
Hon'ble Dr. Ajay A. Deshpande (Expert Member)
                                 Order of the Tribunal
               Delivered by Hon'ble Dr. P.Jyothimani, Judicial Member


</p><p id="p_7">1.   This application has been taken up by the Tribunal on receipt from the Hon'ble

High court of Madhya Pradesh.         The applicant has challenged the orders dated

04.03.2011 and 28.03.2011 passed by invoking the provisions of Madhya Pradesh

Kolahal Niyantran Adhiniyam, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as "Adhiniyam") and Noise

Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 (herein after referred as "Rules"). The

Sub Divisional Magistrate under the impugned order has warned the applicant trust that

if anybody defies the rule by making noise pollution in their premises, the trust will be

held liable.    The applicant trust which was created as per the trust deed dated

30.10.1947 was given a lease hold right by the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur, of the

land to the extent of 10.34 acres subject to various conditions. The applicant trust, after

obtaining the lease, is said to have put up the boundary wall and developed the same by

making certain constructions which was inaugurated by the Late Prime Minister of

India, Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru. The land appurtenant to super structure in the form of a

Bhawan put up by the applicant, is being given by way of license to third parties

temporarily to organize social, cultural and religious functions. It is the case of the

applicant trust that under the Adhiniyam which was enacted to control the noise

pollution in the State of Madhya Pradesh, there has been some restriction regarding the

use of loud music between 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. In case of violation, the statute

provides the same as a non cognizable and bailable offence. The Union Government,

by virtue of the powers conferred under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, has

also formulated the noise pollution rules, restricting the use of noise in public places,

etc. It is the case of the applicant that when once the trust issues licence to third party

for running social or cultural function, it is for the licensee to obtain necessary

permission from the authority concerned for using the public address system. But the

grievance of the applicant is that wherever the licensee who obtains licence from the

authority concerned violates the provisions of Adhiniyam or the Noise Pollution Rules

of Government of India, the Sub Divisional Magistrate namely, the Respondent No.3




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                              2</span>
 use to issue orders like the impugned order to the applicant trust threatening the trust

liable for the conduct of the licensee on the ground that the trust, being the licensor, is

having overall control over the premises. In the said order, the Respondent No.3 SDM

threats criminal action against the applicant trust for certain violation made or would be

made by the licensee. The impugned orders are challenged contending inter alia that

the Respondent No. 3 and 4 who have actually issued the licence to the licensee under

ther provisions of Adhiniyam and/or rules cannot abdicate their legal obligation as per

the Adhiniyam/Rule and impose liability on the applicant, that in as much as the

applicant is not the violator, even under Adhiniyam, it cannot be proceeded with simply

because it is in control of the premises and that the impugned order is intended to harass

the applicant trust which has been constituted for the noble public purpose.



</p><p id="p_8">2.   In the reply filed by the respondent, it is stated that not only the application is

misconceived but the order dated 04.03.2011 has been passed pursuant to the directions

issued by the Hon'ble High Court in Writ Petition No. 2199 of 2010 dated 17.02.2010,

wherein the Hon'bleHigh Court has given the following directions :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "However, it is directed that concerned Sub Divisional Magistrate and Executive
     Magistrate shall ensure compliance of the order passed by the Collector dated
     11.01.2010."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">In order to implement the said order of the High Court, the impugned notice came to be

issued and that is also in accordance with the Adhiniyam.           It is the case of the

respondents that as per Rule 8 of "Rules", the person who owns the premises in which

noise pollution is committed also is responsible. Otherwise, it is the case of the

respondents that the applicant being the owner of the premises, having control over the

land has equal responsibility under Adhiniyam/rules to see that noise pollution is not

committed by anyone. The Respondent No.3 and 4 being the lawful authorities are

legally bound to discharge their duties as per the provisions of the Adhiniyam/Rules and

therefore, there is no illegality or impropriety in the impugned order passed by the

respondents. The respondents also rely upon the order passed by the Hon'ble High

Court in the contempt proceedings, discharging them from such proceedings based on

unconditional apology, to substantiate the contention that there is no malafide in passing




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                              3</span>
 the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_10">3.   The Learned Counsel appearing for the applicant has taken us to various

provisions of the Adhiniyam as well as the Rules framed by the Government of India

for regulating the noise pollution.     According to him, under <a href="/doc/142996678/" id="a_2">Section 2(a)</a> of the

Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the definition "environment" includes 'air' and

therefore, not only under the provisions of Adhiniyam, 1985, but also as per the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_3">Central

Act</a> namely the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, the Respondent No. 3 and 4 being

the legal authorities to enforce the provisions of the Act, have authority to issue

impugned notice and while issuing such notice, they must have applied their minds to

the fact that the intent of the Adhiniyam as well as the Rules in preventing noise

pollution is in fact preventing the polluter from doing the same and by no stretch of

imagination, the applicant can be deemed to be a polluter so as to make him liable.

According to him, the noise pollution have been caused by the licensee which is

personal in nature, liability cannot be vicariously imposed on the applicant, especially

when the Adhiniyam proposed to impose the punishment by ways of penalty for

violation. He would submit that in case of penal liability, there is no question of

making vicarious liability of the applicant since the person who commits offence is

liable to be punished and not any other person unless he is shown as an abettor. He

would also rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, reported in

AIR 1952 SC 16 to substantiate his contention that there is no vicarious liability in

respect of penal action.
</p>
<p id="p_11">4.   Repudiating such contention of the applicant, the Learned Counsel appearing for

the Respondents would at the threshold raise an issue of maintainability of the

application before this Tribunal. According to him, a wholesome reading of Adhiniyam,

1985 shows that it is a penal legislation and therefore, even if the applicant is aggrieve

by the impugned order, his remedy is available before the criminal court, as per the

Code of Criminal Procedure and not to the Tribunal. It is his contention that the

Tribunal, having the limited powers in respect of environment issues covered in 7 Acts

contemplated under Schedule I, cannot usurp the powers of criminal court.

</p><p id="p_12">5.   However, when it was brought to his notice that the intention of the Adhiniyam, as




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                             4</span>
 it is shown in Preamble, which is clear that it is to provide control over the noise

pollution in the State of MP and therefore, imposing of punishment or penalty is only

incidental and simply because the noise pollution is treated as non-cognizable and

bailable offence and the penalty of Rs. 1,000/- is imposed, the entire Adhiniyam cannot

be treated as a criminal legislature like<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5"> Indian Penal Code</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>,

etc., he has sought leave to permit him not to press the said contention. He has

contended that when the scope of the Adhiniyam as well as Rules are to be taken into

consideration, the intention of the law makers is to avoid pollution and in that process,

anyone who is even remotely responsible should be made liable. He would state that as

the owner of the premise, he has got more control over his licensee contractually and as

and when his licensee has exceeded the limit, the applicant should have either cancelled

the licence or cautioned him and in as much as such act has not been done, the applicant

cannot get away with his responsibility attributing any motive on Respondent Nos. 3 &amp;

</p><p id="p_13">4. He has also relied upon the judgment reported in 2012 (5) SCC I to substantiate his

contention that the applicant can be made responsible under vicarious liability principle

as per the intent and ambit of the Adhiniyam as well as Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_14">6.   We have heard the Learned Counsels for the applicant as well as the respondents,

referred to the provisions of Adhiniyam, Rules as well as the documents filed by both

the sides and gave our anxious thought to the issues involved in this case.

</p><p id="p_15">7.   The Madhya Pradesh KolahalNiyantranAdhiniyam, 1985 which is a <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_7">State Act</a> is

prior in point of time and when compared with the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986,

which is a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_9">Central Act</a>, came into effect from May 1986 there are no contradiction. It is

also nobody's case that there is any contradiction between the State and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_10">Central Act</a> and

therefore, it is not necessary for us to enter into the realm of the said aspect. The basic

concept of both the Acts is to see that the environment is kept clean. While the

Adhiniyam is restricting wholly in respected of the noise pollution, the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment

(Protection) Act</a>, 1986, deals with the larger issues of environment. As submitted by the

Learned Counsel for the respondents, the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 defines

"environment" under <a href="/doc/142996678/" id="a_13">Section 2(a)</a> which includes not only issue relating to water, air,

land and also other living creatures, plants, micro organisms. It is relevant to extract the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                               5</span>
 said definition, which is as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     '2.(a) "environment" includes water, air and land and the interrelationship which
     exists among and between water, air and land, and human beings, other living
     creatures, plants, micro-organism and property'.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">8.   The Government of India, while formulating a separate Act for the purpose of

prevention, control and abatement of air pollution, has passed the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 in which the power of controlling air pollution has been

intended to be entrusted to the Pollution Control Board. <a href="/doc/765335/" id="a_15">Section 2(a)</a> of the Air Act,

1981while defining "air pollutant" also includes noise by virtue of an amendment

inserted w.e.f. 01.04.1998. The term 'air pollutant' has been defined, as on date, under

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a> as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     '2. (a) "air pollutant" means any solid, liquid or gaseous substance 2[(including
     noise)]present in the atmosphere in such concentration as may be or tend to be
     injurious to human beings or other living creatures or plants or property or
     environment;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">9.   Therefore, it is clear that under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_17">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 which are <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_19">Central Act</a>s they have

entrusted the power to the prescribed authorities for effective control of pollution and

environmental degradation. In continuation of the same, Rules were framed by the

Government of India called as Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 by

which various regulatory measures, including maintenance of ambient air quality with

respect to Noise levels to be maintained and authority who is responsible to supervise

and implement the same have also been specifically mentioned. In the said Noise

Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, in Rule 5 the loud speaker pollution

level is explained in detail.    It is relevant to extract the said provision for better

understanding of the concept of noise pollution:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "5. Restriction on the use of loud speakers/public address system 2[and sound

     producing instruments]. - (1) A loud speaker or a public address system shall not

     be used except after obtaining written permission from the authority.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">          [(2) A loud speaker or a public address system or any sound producing

      instrument or a musical instrument or a sound amplifier shall not be used at night

      time except in closed premises for communication within, like auditoria,

      conference rooms, community halls, banquet halls or during a public emergency.]



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                           6</span>

          [(4) the noise level at the boundary of the public place, where loudspeaker or

      public address system or any other noise source is being used shall not exceed 10

      dB (A) above the ambient noise standards for the area or 75 dB (A) whichever is

      lower;]

      3[(5) The peripheral noise level of a privately owned sound system or a sound

      producing instrument shall not, at the boundary of the private place, exceed by

      more than 5 dB (A) the ambient noise standards specified for the area in which it

      is used.]


</blockquote><p id="p_18">10.   Under the said "Rules", the authority for enforcement have also been specified as

the local authority in the following definition namely 2(c):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      '2.[(c) "authority" means and includes any authority or officer authorised by the
      Central Government, or as the case may be, the State Government in accordance
      with the laws in force and includes a District Magistrate, Police Commissioners,
      or any other officer not below the rank of the Deputy Superintendent of Police
      designated for the maintenance of the ambient air quality standards in respect of
      noise under any law for the time being in force;]'

</blockquote><p id="p_19">11.   Now, going to the provisions of the Adhiniyam, namely the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_20">State Act</a>, the

Adhiniyam in <a href="/doc/96411495/" id="a_21">Section 2(d)</a> explains the prescribed authority as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "(d) 'prescribed authority' means the District Magistrate or such other authority
      or officer not below the rank of a NaibTehsildar as may be empowered by the
      District Magistrate in writing in this behalf."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">12.   However, the provision of the said Act, even though restricts the use of loud

speakers between 10.00 PM to 6.00 AM, the contents thereof is not minute as that of the

Central Noise Pollution Rules which is specific in nature. Be that as it may, on an

overall reading of both, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_22">Central Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_23">State Act</a>, we have absolutely no doubt

that both the legislations are intended for the purpose of preventing noise pollution. It




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                                            7</span>
 goes without saying that provision of noise pollution is one of the noble causes which

are being carried out by both the Governments. In fact, it helps not only old people who

are required to have peaceful life but also patients undergoing treatment apart from the

students who are required to concentrate on their education and by the indiscriminate

use of loud speaker by various organizations, either by way of music, religious

discourse or by way of any meeting common people who have fundamental right to life

are affected. That being the main object of all the legislations, any approach has to be

only on that basis. The contention of the Learned Counsel for the Respondent that the

Adhiniyam is a penal legislation, has no basis, even though the Learned Counsel has

realised the same and withdrawn the said submission at a later point of time. However,

we are of the view that we have to examine that aspect also since it has raised an

interesting issue. It is true that under Section 14 of the Adhiniyam, noise pollution is

treated as an offence but as non-cognizable and bailable for which the penalty has been

imposed under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_24">Section 15</a>. It is relevant to extract the said provision as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_25">Section 14</a>. Offences to be non-cognizable and bailable. - all offences under this

      Act shall be non-cognizable and bailable.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9"> <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_26">Section 15</a>. Penalty - (1) Whoever contravenes or attempts to contravene or abets

      the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder

      shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or

      with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees or with both.

      (2) Whoever after having been previously convicted of an offence punishable

      under sub-section (1) subsequently commits and is convicted of an offence shall be

      liable to twice the punishment which might be imposed on a first conviction under

      this Act."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">13.   It is significant to note that <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_27">Section 15</a> which imposes penalty not only starts with

the word 'whoever contravenes' which is wider in its amplitude and therefore, the

intention of law makers is made very clear that they wanted include any person whether

he is actually using noise pollution or who is allowing a person to do so as an abetter.

An overall view of the Act makes it clear that the idea of the State Government in

enacting of the said Adhiniyam is to control noise pollution in the State of Madhya




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                                             8</span>
 Pradesh. For the purpose of effective controlling, various provisions contemplating

prohibition regarding the soft music, prohibition regarding loud music, restriction

regarding use loud speaker, restriction regarding use of horn type loud speaker,

operation of loud speaker, use of loud speaker in public premises for making

announcement are made and ultimately it prohibits all noise in public interest which is

categorically stated under <a href="/doc/171616267/" id="a_28">Section 10</a> of the Act, which is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "10. Prohibition of any kind of noise in public interest. (i) Noise of any kind is
      prohibited between the hours of 11.00 PM and 6.00 AM.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      (2) The prescribed authority, on being satisfied that in its opinion it is necessary
      in public interest so to do, by an order in writing, recording reasons therefore,
      prohibit noise of any kind in any place at any other time."

</blockquote><p id="p_22">14.   There are certain exemptions given in respect of noise on certain occasions like

republic day, independence day, etc., apart from the traditional use in the religious

places which requires permission and exemption from the prescribed authority. Even

under Central Legislation, there is a limited provision for exemption.          The said

legislation, however, provides for such exemption on permissible dates as stated under

<a href="/doc/120862145/" id="a_29">Section 13</a> of the Act. Now, when any person contravenes the provisions of the Act,

such contravention is treated as an non-cognizable and bailable offence and ultimately

when the person who contravenes is brought to the criminal court, he will be imposed

with the penalty of Rs. 1,000/-. Merely, because the penalty clause is provided in one of

the provisions, one cannot treat it as a penal legislation. The idea being not to punish a

person as a primary concept but to abate noise pollution. This, compared with any other

legislations like<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30"> Indian Penal Code</a> wherein the offences are defined, followed by the

punishment by way of sentence and therefore, the entire Act has been devoted for the

purpose of offence and penalty and punishment. When that is not so, in respect of

Adhiniyam, one cannot come to the conclusion that Adhiniyam is a criminal legislation

and therefore, the remedy available to the applicant is by way of either criminal appeal

or revision under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_31"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_23">15.   Even assuming that the Adhiniyam is a criminal legislation, it cannot be said that

the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.    It is under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_32">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010

enacted by the Government of India, the National Green Tribunal gets its jurisdiction as

seen in <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_33">Section 14(1)</a> which is as follows:

out in the definition section, in an elaborate sense includes those words defined in any

other Acts related to environment even though such definition is not finding any place

in any one of the seven Acts contemplated under Schedule I. This shows the intention

of the law makers in giving wider meaning to the terms to be interpreted by the Tribunal

come to the conclusion that the Tribunal, will not have any jurisdiction to adjudicate

is liable to be rejected.

<p id="p_27">19.    Now, coming to the next point as to whether the applicant being the licensor, in a

position of the owner of the premises, is liable for the Act of the licensee. It is not

disputed that between the applicant and different licensees to whom the applicant permit

to organize functions from time to time, is purely contractual, but such contract cannot

be against the provisions of any law.        When the Adhiniyam, 1985contemplates a

restriction on the use of noise pollution in any place and such place is issued licence by

the applicant to a licensee by way of a contract, certainly the terms of law have to be

read within the terms of contract between the parties in so far as it relates restriction

regarding the noise pollution. Therefore, the applicant cannot escape his liability saying

that even though he has let out his premises, he has not actually committed any noise

pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_28">20.    At the same time, one cannot ignore the fact that principal liability is on a person

who violates the law and therefore, it is primarily the licensee who has violated and who

must be primarily be held responsible. In fact, the licensor may not know the ambient

quality which is to be maintained by the licensee, for, it is the licensee who obtains the

permission from the authority concerned which is expected to impose restrictions

regarding the level of noise to be maintained by him and in that process of issuing

permission by the public authority, certainly licensor is not a party and therefore, one

cannot impose full responsibility on the licensor and in our view the licensee is

principally responsible which is also the intention of the Central Rule namely, the Noise

Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rule, 2000 especially Rule 8 which is as follows:

</blockquote><p id="p_29">21.    At the same time, the applicant being the licensor is also covered under the

definition of the 'occupier', under <a href="/doc/184316376/" id="a_57">Section 2(f)</a> of the Act which makes it abundantly

clear that occupier is not only the person who is in possession but also who is in control

of the premises. The term occupier defined under <a href="/doc/184316376/" id="a_58">Section 2(f)</a> is as follows:

</p><p id="p_30">       '(f)      "occupier", in relation to any factory or premises, means a person who

<p id="p_32">23.    It was in Ramlila Maidan Incident, In Re, reported in (2012) 5 SCC Page 1, the

Hon'ble Apex Court has held that right to sleep is a fundamental right which has to be

read under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_59">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India which ensures right to life. That was a

case where by virtue of imposing <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_60">Section 144</a> of Cr.P.C., a Dharna alleged to have been

conducted by Yoga Guru, Baba Ramdev, was sought to be interfered in the night time

when all the participants were fast asleep. While dealing with the order passed under

<a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_61">Section 144</a> of Cr.P.C. by the Commissioner of Police or the Ministry of Home Affairs,

the Hon'ble Justice Swatanter Kumar, Hon'ble Chairperson of National Green Tribunal

speaking for the Supreme Court has observed as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_33">      "85. From the record, it can reasonably be inferred that the Ministry of Home
Affairs and Delhi Police were working in coordination and the police was keeping the
Ministry informed of every development. There is some element of nexus between the
Government's stand on the demands of Baba Ramdev, its decision in that regard and
the passing of an order under Section 144 Cr. PC but, this by itself would not render the
decision as that taken in bad faith. The decision of the Ministry or the police authorities


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                                          12</span>
 may not be correct, but that ipso facto would not be a ground for the Court to believe
that it was a colourable and/or mala fide exercise of power.
</p>
<p id="p_34">24.   His Lordship has also observed that a person who seeks to fight against the

corruption and black money cannot be portrayed as threat to law and order.

</p><p id="p_35">      "96. On these facts, it is the submission of Respondent 4 that it is ironic that
persons fasting against failure of the Central Government to tackle the issue of
corruption and black money have been portrayed as threats to law and order. Citizens
have a fundamental right to assembly and peaceful protest which cannot be taken away
by an arbitrary executive or legislative action. The law prescribes no requirements for
taking of permission to go on a fast. Respondent 4 suggests that in order to establish the
truth of incident, an independent Commission should be constituted, based on whose
report, legal action to be taken in such situations should be determined.

</p><p id="p_36">25.   While holding that the trust under which Baba Ramdev has conducted Yoga Camp

is equally guilty since in the guise of conducting Yoga Camp for which permission was

obtained an indefinite fast was undertaken, it was held that the action taken as an

emergency cannot be held to be malafide even though such action when the participants

were sleeping without giving opportunity to them was uncalled for.

</p><p id="p_37">26.   The Supreme Court has held, ultimately by relying upon the earlier judgment,

Babulal Parate Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1961 SC 884, that <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_62">Section 144</a> Cr.P.C.

cannot be resorted merely on imaginary ground or on the ground of tendency or a threat

in para 177:
</p>
<p id="p_38">"177. It was for the police authorities or the administration to place on record the
material to show that there was a genuine threat or reasonable bias of communal
disharmony, social disorder and public tranquillity or harmony on the night of
04.06.2011. However, no such material has been placed before this Court. Right from
Babulal Parate, this Court has taken a consistent view that the provisions of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_63">Section
144</a> Cr.PC cannot be resorted to merely on imaginary or likely possibility or likelihood
or tendency of a threat. It has not to be a mere tentative perception of threat but a
definite and substantiated one. I have already recorded that none of the authorities
concerned, the their wisdom, had stated that they anticipated such disturbance to public
tranquillity or imposition of a restriction under Section 144 Cr. PC as late as till 10.40
PM on 04.06.2011, which then was sought to be executed forthwith.

</p><p id="p_39">27.   In the operative portion, while dealing with the similar situation of vicarious

liability, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that while a trust conducts a programme, it is

not only the trust but also other members of the assembly for whose act the trust should

take up the responsibility. The portion of the judgement which is relevant for the

purpose is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_40">"270. Once an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_64">Section 144</a> Cr.PC is passed by the competent authority and
such order directs certain acts to be done on abstains (sic abstention) from doing
certain acts and such order is in force, any assembly, which initially might have been a
lawful assembly, would become an unlawful assembly and the people so assembled
would be required to disperse in furtherance to such order. A person cannot only be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                                         13</span>
 held responsible for his own act, but, in the light of <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_65">Section 149</a> IPC, if the offence is
committed by any member of the unlawful assembly in prosecution of a common object
of that assembly, every member of such assembly would become member of the unlawful
assembly."
</p>
<p id="p_41">28.   Ultimately, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has given certain guidelines for the

purpose of conducting of public meeting, dharna and agitation but it remains true as

extracted above that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has also observed that once the trust

has conducted a programme for the Act of everyone of its member and in that case few

of the Members are found to have involved in brick batting, trust was made responsible.

Even though the said observation may not be strictly applicable in the fact of the present

case, the basic spirit of the order can be borrowed for our coming to the conclusion that

the applicant being a trust cannot escape from its own obligation only because the trust

itself has given licence to third party.

<p id="p_42">29.   But unfortunately, referring to the impugned order of the Respondent No. 3 and 4

dated 04.03.2011, wherein the Respondent No. 3 has chosen to state that under the

Adhiniyam, 1985 the applicant is also liable for the noise pollution committed by any

person in its premises, has not acted as per the direction of the District Collector dated

11.01.2010. It is nobody's case that the impugned order has not been issued by the

Respondent No.3 in accordance with the directives issued by the Collector dated

11.01.2010. In the said directions issued by the District Collector dated 11.01.2010,

the collector has made it amply clear that the notice shall state specifically the extent of

ambient air quality relating to noise as notified by the Government of India while

delegating powers to the Respondent No.3. It is also relevant to point out that in the

permission granted by SDM to the licensee of the applicant dated 24.12.2010, he has

specifically mentioned the ambient air quality related to noise, but unfortunately in the

impugned order there is nothing to show that the licensee has violated the condition

relating to the ambient air quality relating to noise with any particular details. In the

absence of such particulars, we are unable to understand as to how either the licensee of

the applicant or applicant himself, as a trust, can be made responsible for an unspecified

act. We are of the view that the impugned notice issued by the Respondent No. 3 and 4

are vague in nature and they cannot be complied with even by the licensee. In such

view of the matter, while there is no doubt that both the applicant as well as licensee are

  liable under <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_66">State Act</a> and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_67">Central Act</a>, the impugned notice issued by the Respondent

 said respondents to act in future in accordance with the Acts as stated above with

 specific reference to the nature of violation to both the licensee as well as the licensor.
