        Shri Amit Munde, learned counsel for the petitioners.
        Smt.   Preeti   Waghmare,     learned   counsel   for   the
respondent.</pre>
<p id="p_1">        They are heard.
</p><p id="p_2">        By this petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C., 1973, the
petitioner is praying for quashment of complaint and criminal
case bearing No.80/12 pending in the Court of J.M.F.C., Dhar.
</p><p id="p_3">2.      The facts of the case are that the non-applicant Pollution
Control Board filed a complaint on 9/12/2011 against the
petitioner alongwith other co-accused persons namely M/s
Jaideep Glass Works Pithampur and its Managing Director -
Mr. Vinay Agrawal under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_4">26</a> and <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_5">24</a> of the Water
Pollution Act, 1974. It is alleged by the prosecution that the
petitioners were the Director of the M/s Jaideep Glass Work
Pvt. Ltd.(Spinning Unit-2) Plot No.1 Sector-3, Industrial Area
Kheda, Pithanpur, District - Dhar(M.P.) and in the year 2010
the Company was granted permission by the Board to establish
a unit for production of cotton and synthetic yarn at Industrial
Area Kheda, Pithampur District - Dhar vide letter dated
18/03/2008 bearing No.2123.
</p><p id="p_4">3.      The case of the prosecution is that the company was
granted permission for establishing the unit on certain
conditions and the permission was granted on this pretext that
the company will not use any new outlet or new discharge of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                27</span>

sewage. It was further stated in the letter that the company will
not manufacture anything without prior consent of the Board
and they will establish the treatment plant within one month
from the date of issuance of letter dated 18/03/2008.
</p><p id="p_5">4.   On 30/04/2010, the Board (respondent) issued a show
cause notice under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_6">Section 33-A</a> of Water Pollution Act, 1974
and under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_7">Section 31-A</a> of Air Pollution Act, 1981 stating that
since the company has started production without complying
the conditions as mentioned in letter dated 18/03/2008. The
company was also directed to submit the requisite information,
but the company did not comply hence on 9/07/2010, the
permission was cancelled.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   It is also alleged that on 14/06/2010 at the time of
inspection of the said unit it was found that the company did not
take any step for discharge of sewage and no sewage
treatment plant was established. On the basis of said
allegation, a complaint under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_9">44</a> of the Water
Pollution Act, 1974 has been filed against the company and
against the petitioners as well as against Vinay Agrawal who is
the Managing Director of the Company.
</p><p id="p_7">6.   On 20/07/2011, the learned Judicial Magistrate First
Class, Dhar has taken cognizance under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_10">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_11">44</a> of
the Water Pollution Act, 1974 against the accused person and
registered the case as Criminal Case No.80/12.
</p><p id="p_8">7.   It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners
that the petitioners are not the Director nor incharge and
responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company at
the time of alleged offence. The prosecution did not establish
the fact that from the date of permission by the Board i.e. from
18/03/2008 till 09/07/2010 when the permission was withdrawn
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                27</span>

by the Board, the petitioners were related in any manner with
the Company.
</p><p id="p_9">8.    As per the report of the Registrar of the Company, the
petitioners were not the Directors of the said Company during
the period of alleged offence. The petitioners were the Directors
of the said Company from 31/10/1980 till 16/12/1982 and they
resigned the Company on 16/12/1982.
</p><p id="p_10">9.    No material has been filed by the petitioners or certified
copy of the Registrar of the Company has been filed to prove
that the petitioners were not the Directors of the said Company
during the alleged offence.
</p><p id="p_11">10.   As per reply of the M.P. Pollution Control Board, on
30/06/2010, the M.P. Pollution Control Board sent a letter to the
petitioners through Industry for submitting required information
and even explain that after fulfillment of required information
they can consider the industry. After granting number of
opportunities, the application has been rejected on 9/07/2010.
</p><p id="p_12">11.   The petitioners started the operation of the industry
without valid consent and, therefore, the complaint has been
filed against them. At this stage, on the basis of Annexure-P/2
it cannot be said that during relevant period the petitioners were
not the Directors of the Company or in any way involved in the
alleged offence.   The petitioners may raise all these pleas
before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class where
proceedings is going on. On the basis of complaint filed by the
M.P. Pollution Control Board, it cannot be said that no case is
made out against the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_13">12.   Inherent powers u/s 482 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a>. include powers to
quash FIR, investigation or any criminal proceedings pending
before the High Court or any Courts subordinate to it and are of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 27</span>

wide magnitude and ramification. Such powers can be
exercised to secure ends of justice, prevent abuse of the
process of any court and to make such orders as may be
necessary to give effect to any order under this Code,
depending upon the facts of a given case.
</p><p id="p_14">13.   It is well settled that the inherent powers under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">section
482</a> can be exercised only when no other remedy is available to
the litigant and not where a specific remedy is provided by the
statute.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.   Plenitude of power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_14">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. by itself
makes it obligatory for the Court to exercise the same with
utmost care and caution.       Width and nature of power itself
demands that its exercise is only in cases where this Court is,
for reasons to be recorded, of clear view that continuance of
prosecution would be nothing but an abuse of process of law.
Inherent power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_15">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C; though wide has
to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with great caution and
only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid
down in this section itself.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.   Considering the aforesaid and so also        looking to the
nature of allegation made against the petitioners, no case for
quashment of complaint and criminal case bearing No.80/12
pending in the Court of J.M.F.C., Dhar, as prayed by the
petitioners under the proceeding of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_16">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C., is
made out.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.   With the aforesaid, M.Cr.C. No.7050/2017 is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                                                (P.K. Jaiswal)
                                                     Judge
