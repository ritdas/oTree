         not necessary to issue notice to the respondents.

<p id="p_2">         In this petition, the petitioner has prayed for the following reliefs:
</p>
<p id="p_3">           1. Certiorari quashing the Notice No.SPCB/RDJ/N-1/2017/901-03 dated
               11th December, 2017 issued by the Respondent No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           2. Mandamus commanding the respondents to process the request of the
               petitioner for grant of consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water
               (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">section 21</a> of the
               Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981;

<p id="p_6">         When the matter was taken up today, learned counsel for the petitioner
      submitted that even though show cause notice was issued by the Pollution
      Control Board to the petitioner on 11.12.2017, yet the same was dispatched to

    her on 15.12.2017 and the petitioner had received the same on 16.12.2017 and
   the petitioner has been asked to submit a reply within a period of three days. It
   is further submitted that petitioner has filed an application for obtaining the
   requisite consent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   In view of the fact that only show cause notice has been issued to the petitioner
and the final decision in the matter is yet to be taken by the concerned authority, I
deem it appropriate to direct that in case the petitioner files reply to the show-
cause notice dated 11.12.2017 within a period of one week from the date of
receipt of certified copy of the order passed today, the competent authority shall
afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and shall pass a speaking order
in accordance with law. Till the order is passed, no coercive action shall be taken
against the petitioner in pursuance of the show-cause notice dated 11.12.2017.
Needless to state that competent authority shall also pass appropriate orders on the
application for consent which has been filed by the petitioner under the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. It is made clear that this court has not expressed any
opinion on merits of claim of the petitioner.

<p id="p_8">   With the aforesaid direction, the writ petition is disposed of along with
connected MP.
