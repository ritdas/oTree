                           M.Cr.C. No.3409 of 2019


   matters, which have been registered against the present applicant.
</p><p id="p_8">         On perusal of the orders of the Co-ordinate Bench, it appears
   that for want of sanction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 197</a> of Cr.P.C., stay was
   granted and same appears to be the reason in this case as well.
</p><p id="p_9">         On due consideration, I.A. No.638/2019 is allowed and stands
   disposed of. Consequently, no proceedings against the applicant shall
   ensue in the case registered against him till the next date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_10">         Also heard on the question of admission.
         Petition is admitted for final hearing.
         List the matter for final hearing in due course.
