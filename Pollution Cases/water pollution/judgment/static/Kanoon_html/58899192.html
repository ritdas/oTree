the writ petition challenging the mining activities on the

ground that land of the petitioners bearing Khasra No.463

No.10 in contravention of provisions of Section 165 of the

M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1959 because petitioners were

belonging to Scheduled Tribe categories and said land

has been granted to them by State as 'patta bhumi' and is

non-transferable. Admittedly, the aforesaid land has been

taken by respondent No.10 from petitioners on rent for

installation of machinery and collection of Overburden.

reliance on certain pronouncement of Apex Court. Placing

reliance on (1991)4 SCC 54 (Bangalore Medical Trust

Vs. B.S. Muddappa and others), it has been submitted

that    resident       of    locality        can       challenge     any     action      of

Development Authority if a private hospital is allowed to

be constructed in an open space. Placing reliance on

(1995) 2 SCC 577 (Virendra Gaur and others Vs. State

of Haryana &amp; others), it has been submitted that right to

reliance        on     (2000)7         SCC         552     (M.S.       Jayaraj        Vs.

Commissioner of Excise, Kerala &amp; others), it has been

submitted         that      court      should          adopt    liberal      approach

regarding the entitlement of a person to move to High

Court involving writ jurisdiction. If violation of law is

brought to the notice then on the ground of locus standi

petition should not be rejected rather it is required to be

considered on merits. Further placing reliance on (2006) 3

SCC 581 (K.K. Bhalla Vs. State of M.P. and others), it is

submitted that in relation to discharge of official duties of

public servants and authorities, policy as a whole should

be taken into consideration and if any illegality is brought

to the notice of the Court, in certain situation can exercise

its power        suo moto. Equality Clause contained in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Article

14</a>, Constitution of India cannot be invoked to perpetuate

illegality. Placing reliance on (2007) 7 SCC 140 (State of

Kerala &amp; others Vs. K. Prasad and another) it was

submitted that if any illegality or irregularity is found in

favour      of any individual or even                      group of individuals

of the same. Judicial forum can be used to perpetuate

illegality. Further, placing reliance on (2008) 11 SCC 740

(Umesh         Challiyill       Vs.    K.P.       Rajendran),              it   has     been

submitted that affidavits in writ petition should not be

construde         in   strict    sense.         T yp o g r a p h i c a l   or    cosmetic

errors should not be prevailed. Techanicalities should not
