                                In the instant writ petition, the petitioners have challenged the

           orders dated 20.07.2015 and 10.08.2015 issued by respondent No.4 under

           <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Sections 31-A</a> of the Air Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1981 and

           under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_3">Section 33-A</a> of the Water Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution Act</a>,

           1974. It has also been averred that against the aforesaid orders, separate

           appeals have been filed by both the petitioners, but the same have not been

           considered and decided so far. A prayer has also been made in this writ

           petition that a direction be issued to the Appellate Authority (respondent

           No.2 herein) to consider and decide those appeals filed by the petitioners,

           expeditiously.

                                After hearing learned counsel for the petitioners and keeping in

           view the fact that appeals filed by the petitioners against the impugned

           orders are still pending before the Appellate Authority, without issuing

           notice of motion as it will un-necessary delay the matter, we dispose of this

           petition with a direction to the Appellate Authority (respondent No.2) to

           consider and decide the appeals filed by the petitioners against the orders

           dated 20.07.2015 and 10.08.2015, expeditiously, preferably within a period

           of two months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.

           However, till disposal of those appeals by the Appellate Authority, no

           coercive step be taken against the petitioners.</p><pre id="pre_2">
