Magistrate, Chalakkudy to consider the bail application to be filed by

the petitioner in connection with C.C. No.1057 of 2009 on the same

day of its filing and to pass such other orders or reliefs as this Court

deems it fit in the interest of justice.  Petitioner is accused in C.C.

No.1057 of 2009 of the trial court for offences punishable under

Warrant was issued to her for her absence for a single day,         I am

unable to issue any such direction as prayed for in the light of
