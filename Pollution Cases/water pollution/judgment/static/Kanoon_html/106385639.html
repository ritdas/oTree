     the recommendations of NEERI.  We hope and trust that the Committee 
      


     continues   to   do   good   work   in   future   also.   As   the   Committee   is 
   



     functioning   efficiently,   it   is   necessary   for   the   Committee   to   set   up   a 

     grievance  redressal  mechanism to enable the  citizens to bring to the 





     notice of the Committee the violations of law in relation to the river 

     Godavari and the breaches of the orders of this Court. This will help the 





     Committee   to   effectively   monitor   the   entire   process.   To   enable   the 

     citizens   to   understand   the   scheme   adopted   by   this   Court   for 

     rejuvenation   of   river   Godavari,   we   propose   to   direct   the   Nashik

     Mela, the other issue is regarding availability of necessary funds.  There 

     is an affidavit filed by Shri Vilas Balaram Patil, the District Collector on 





     4th  July,   2014.   The   affidavit   provides   that   total   funds   required   for 

     Simhastha Kumbh Mela 2015-16 are to the tune of Rs.237.78 Crores.

<p id="p_11">     The   maximum   requirement   out   of   the   said   funds   is   of   the   Nashik 

     Municipal Corporation which is to the tune of Rs.1052.61 Crores. The 

     Nashik Municipal Corporation has already issued the work orders for 

     the   works   to   the   tune   of   Rs.669.61   Crores.     The   issue   is   regarding

     it is pointed out that financial assistance to the tune of Rs.1100 Crores

     Pradesh for conducting Kumbh Mela at Allahabad in the year 2012-13.

<p id="p_13">     It is pointed out that for the Kumbh Mela of 2003-04 at Nashik, the

     organization of the Kumbh Mela events.  We had adjourned this Petition 

     repeatedly to enable the learned Additional Solicitor General of India to 





     take instructions as a grievance made was that the Government of India 

     has not taken any decision for release of one time financial assistance 

     on the request made by the State Government.   The learned ASG has 

     tendered a letter dated 19th  November, 2014 addressed to him by the

     that   though   organizing   Kumbh   Mela   is   a   State   subject,   in   view   of 

     importance of the event, the Government of India has been seized   of

     decision on the request made by the State Government for release of 

     one time assistance as expeditiously as possible preferably before the 
      


     end of January, 2015. Availability of adequate funds will be necessary 
   



     for implementation of the Action Plan of NEERI.  We are informed that 

     usual   practice   is   that   the   State   spends   the   amount   and   one   time 





     assistance is received by way of reimbursement. Therefore, the State 

     will have to ensure the availability of necessary funds notwithstanding 





     the pendency of the proposal befre the Central Government.

     is of taking an important step to restrict the inputs of pollution in river 

     stream   upto   Odha   Barrage.   The   action   suggested   is   that   this   Court

     Respondents to lift the treated effluent directly from the outlets of the 
                         
     respective STPs located in the Nashik City.  In fact, the same suggestion 

     has been made by the Superintending Engineer to the Chief Engineer of 
                        
     the concerned Department in the letter dated 9 th  October, 2014.   The 

     said   suggestion   is   to   issue   directions   to   the   Nashik   Municipal 
      


     Corporation   not   to   release   treated   effluent   into   Godavari   river   by 
   



     directing  the  seventh  Respondent  to  lift  the   water  directly  from  STP 

     outlet. This step is required to be taken to avoid the pollution of the 





     river Godavari.  On this aspect, seventh and eight Respondents will have 

     to be heard.

     provisions under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7"> the Indian Penal Code</a> as well as Bombay Police Act, 





     1951 are not sufficiently deterrent.   He submitted that even the penal
