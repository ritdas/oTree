JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON):
</p>
<p id="p_3">1.   Vide order dated 29th March, 2013, the Tamil Nadu

Pollution Control Board (for short 'the Respondent Board'), in

exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_2">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, (for short the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>'),

directed closure of M/s. Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (for short

the 'appellant-company') with immediate effect. On that very day,

it also, by a separate communication, again in exercise of its

powers under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Section 31-A</a> of the Air Act, directed the

Superintending    Engineer,    Tamil    Nadu     Electricity   Board,

Thoothukudi, to disconnect the electricity supply to the appellant

company. The correctness and legality of this order have been

challenged by the appellant-company, primarily on the ground

that it is arbitrary, discriminatory and has been passed in an


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                    2</span>
 undue haste without proper application of mind, non-grant of

appropriate      opportunity    and   by       taking    into   consideration

irrelevant materials, while ignoring the substantive and relevant

considerations. It is also stated that the order is based upon no

scientific study or data. The respondents, besides refuting the

above contentions, have raised a preliminary objection with

regard to the maintainability of the present appeal on the ground

that the Government of Tamil Nadu constituted an appellate

authority, vide notification dated 8th May, 2013, which is

functional, and hence the present appeal, in terms of the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>, would lie before that appellate

authority. Therefore, the present appeal is not maintainable.


</p><p id="p_4">2.     In order to examine the merits or otherwise of the

contentions raised above, we have to notice the facts that have

resulted in filing of the present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
FACTS:
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">3.     The   appellant-company        is   a    public     listed   company,

registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_7">Companies Act</a>, 1956. The appellant-

company has been operating a copper smelter plant (for short

'the   plant')   since   1996    at    S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>OT       Industrial      Complex,

Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. The plant has been operating with

requisite approvals and consents issued by the regulatory

authorities during all this period. The appellant-company is

engaged in the manufacture of copper cathodes and copper rods.

These are manufactured by a process - smelting copper


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                            3</span>
 concentrate - which is the main raw material (copper ore),

containing approximately 30% copper, 30% sulphur, 30% iron

and balance 10% as other impurities. The copper concentrate

along with other raw materials is fed into the smelter to produce

copper anode, which is copper of 98.6% purity, which then is

refined to produce copper cathode i.e. copper of 99.9% purity.

From this copper cathode, copper rods are manufactured. During

the smelting process, the sulphur contained in the copper

concentrate is converted into sulphur dioxide (SO2), which is

collected and sent to sulphuric acid plants through a closed duct

system. Thereafter, the SO2 gas is cleaned in the gas cleaning

plant comprising gas cooling tower, scrubber system and wet

electrostatic precipitators. The cleaned SO2 gas is then oxidized

using vanadium pentoxide catalyst to form sulphur tri-oxide

(SO3) gas which is absorbed in water and converted to sulphuric

acid. The residual gas from the sulphuric acid plant is further

treated in the tail gas scrubber to meet the prescribed

environmental standards and then routed through the stack.

Emissions of SO2 from the stacks are being monitored by online

SO2 analysers. Furthermore, it is stated that an analyser is

connected to the stack to analyse the extent of SO2 that is

released into the atmosphere. The data collected by the analyser

is then sent to both the Distributed Control System (DCS) within

the plant and to the CARE Air Centre at the premises of

Respondent No.1 in Chennai. The software that is to be used

along with the analyser has been the one recommended by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                4</span>
 Respondent Board and is a tamper-proof system. The prescribed

emission standard of SO2 is 477.53 ppm at the tip of the stack

and 80 Âµg/m3 (micro grams per cubic meter) for the ambient air.

The analyser installed at the end of the appellant-company can

be run in two different modes i.e. 'Actual Mode' and 'Maintenance

Mode'. It is the case of the appellant-company that in order to

ensure accuracy of SO2 emission, it undertakes calibration

checks of the analyser. Such calibration checks are carried out

periodically as also before restarting the smelting plant where

such   plant    has   been   shut     down    either    for   scheduled

maintenance or due to unscheduled breakdowns. For calibration,

typically a gas having a known concentration is fed into the

analyser directly to remove the drift errors spotting the higher

(unrealistic) emissions and to test whether the analyser is

capable of reading accurate values. After being tested/analysed,

such gas having excess SO2 concentration is not directed to the

stack and is not released in to the atmosphere; rather it is

released within the caustic absorber analyser-room by trained

personnel, wearing necessary safety equipment. When the

calibration checks of the analyser are being performed, it is run

on 'maintenance mode' and is depicted by the letter 'M' alongside

the relevant data. The appellant-company claims to be very

particular   about    adhering   to     the   highest    standards    of

environment, health and safety practices in its operations,

adding that the unit has been continuously upgraded in terms of

environmental    performance     from    time   to     time   based   on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                       5</span>
 international best practices. Considering adherence to maintain

quality in its processes and its compliance to international

practices, the appellant-company claims to have been awarded

ISO 9001 for quality management systems and the same has

been renewed periodically and it has also been conferred with

ISO   14001   for   environment   management     systems,   which

continues till date. In addition, the appellant-company also

possesses an OHSAS 18001 certificate in respect of safety

management systems apart from an ISO 50001 certificate for

energy management systems.

<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">4.    The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute

(for short the 'NEERI') had submitted a report in the year 2005

showing that the emission levels of the plant of the appellant-

company were within the stipulated limits while some emissions

did not conform to the standards prescribed. It had also made

some recommendations. Regarding the solid waste released out

of slag in the plant site, the Central Pollution Control Board had

taken a view in its communication dated 17th November, 2003 to

the Respondent-Board that the slag was non-hazardous. The

NEERI, in its report had indicated as many as 30 deficiencies

and had pointed out what the appellant-company was required

to do to rectify the deficiencies. On these recommendations, the

Respondent Board had given 30 directions out of which,

according to the appellant-company, it had completed all the 30

improvements/measures. However, in the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/26352158/" id="a_9">Sterlite Industries (India) Limited v.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                  6</span>
 Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.[ (2013) 5 SCALE 202], it has been noticed

that the appellant-company had complied with 29 of the 30

directions. Thus, according to the appellant-company, its plant

was running without any violations and with the approval and

sanction of the competent authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">5.   On the morning of 23rd March, 2013, the appellant-

company was informed that certain complaints of eye irritation

and throat suffocation were received from the people of New

Colony, Keela Shanmuga Puram and other areas of Thoothukudi

town. The appellant-company's plant was, therefore, inspected by

the District Environmental Engineer, Thoothukudi (for short the

'DEE') of Respondent-Board at 8.00 a.m. on that date. Some

other officials including the SDM, and the Deputy Chief Inspector

of Factories, Thoothukudi, were present. They probably came to

inspect the premises and check the environmental parameters of

the plant. They were informed that the plant was taken for

maintenance shut down at around 3.20 a.m. on 21st March,

2013 to attend to certain repairs and was taken for start up at

around 2.00-2.45 p.m. on 23rd March, 2013. It was also informed

to the Inspecting Team that the system was taken up for

calibration of the analyser during the start up process. At that

time and as per the directions of the DEE, the calibration process

was again carried out. The observed values during such

requested calibration were in the range of 675 ppm to 1123 ppm,

which was found to be normal and it was assessed that the

analyser was working normally and that the emission levels were

 within the prescribed norms.        According to the appellant-

company, the DEE, Thoothukudi, also submitted a report to the

Collector of that District mentioning that the plant was

functioning normally and the environmental parameters were

within the limits. In fact, the Collector issued a press release to

the effect that the emissions of SO2 were found within overall

limits and that it was not the case that the public had been

affected by it.

<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">6.   After having taken all these steps, suddenly and to the

surprise of the appellant-company, it received a notice dated 24th

March, 2013 wherein it was alleged that the appellant-company

had contravened the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of the Air Act while

referring to eye irritation and throat suffocation complaints

received from various residents. It was also stated that SO2 trend

graph of ambient air quality indicated that the value shot up

suddenly from 20 Âµg/m3 to 62 Âµg/m3 and that the SO2 emission

monitor was not connected with the CARE Air Centre of

Respondent Board. On these allegations, the appellant-company

was required to submit a reply to the show cause notice within 3

days as to why action, including closure of the unit, stoppage of

power supply, water supply, etc. might not be taken against it. At

this stage, it may be useful to reproduce below the notice dated

24th March, 2013, served upon the appellant-company, by the

for filing of the reply was extremely short but still it submitted a

reply dated 27th March, 2013 supplemented by another reply

dated 28th March, 2013.      In these two replies, the appellant-

company pointed out, inter alia, that the smelting plant had been

shut down from 3.20 a.m. on 21st March, 2013 till the early

hours of 23rd March, 2013 for repairing of a puncture in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                  10</span>
 furnace roof cooling jacket tube. The process of start-up of the

smelting plant was restarted on 23rd March, 2013 and that before

and during the start-up process, as per the Standard Operating

Procedure (SOP), calibration of the Analyser had been performed.

As per the SOP, the gas used for calibration was not released into

the atmosphere and the values of SO2 concentration during

calibration done at 2.00 a.m. were virtually equal to the values of

such concentration during the calibration done as per the

request of the officials of the Respondent Board at 9.00 a.m. It

was also stated that the Analyser had always been connected to

the appellant Company's DCS as also to the Respondent Board

CARE Air Centre and though the appellant-company had

inadvertently not switched the Analyser from the 'Maintenance

Mode' back to the 'Actual Mode' after the calibration at 2.00 a.m.

was concluded, the entire data would be available with the CARE

Air Centre provided the option to view both the 'Maintenance

Mode' data and the 'Actual Mode' data was chosen. It was also

specifically emphasised that Analyser readings during the

calibration process, i.e. the analyser readings with 'M' tag are not

a true representation of the actual emission during operation of

the smelting plant since it denoted only the calibration gas

values fed to the Analyser.         The appellant-company also

submitted that on earlier occasions the CARE Air Centre data

confirmed that during the calibration process (software in

maintenance mode) the values of SO2 had gone up to 1000 ppm

range. The appellant-company reiterated the above submissions


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                  11</span>
 and also craved leave to adopt the entire replies dated 27th

March, 2013 and 28th March, 2013 as part and parcel of this

appeal. There was no evidence of the fact that the alleged throat

irritations were caused by gas emitted from the appellant

company's plant.     In fact, the notice dated 24th March, 2013

issued by the Collector had categorically stated that the report in

regard to gas emitted from the appellant company's plant was

being examined. If that be so, then the question of holding the

appellant-company responsible for alleged complaints of throat

irritation etc. did not arise.   Moreover, not a single case was

reported in any of the hospitals and that is the best proof of the

fact that the allegations lacked verisimilitude.


</p><p id="p_27">8.    In terms of the show cause notice, complaints had been

received from New Colony and Keela Shunmuga Puram at

around 7.00 a.m. which are around 7 kms and 8.1 kms

respectively from the plant.        It is averred by the appellant-

company that the average wind speed during the complaint

period was 0.79 km/hr and even on hypothetical basis of

assuming that 1000 ppm was emitted from the stack at 0.79

km/hour the approximate time taken by the pollutant to reach

the   complainant    area   could     be   9.22    and   10.23   hours

respectively.   This would show that the high emission should

have been emitted 9-10 hours before the complaint-time, i.e.

were within the regulatory standards.

that the officials of the Respondent Board were at the plant

premises during the whole day of 23rd March, 2013 (Saturday) till

late in the evening and even on 24th March, 2013 when various

officials of the government visited the site.          Furthermore,

according to the appellant-company, no written guidelines/SOP

were issued by Respondent Board for CARE Air Centre explaining

the procedure to be followed during the maintenance including

information during calibration of analyzers.     Based upon the

complaints that had been received, the officials of Respondent

Board inspected the unit within 15 minutes and found that all

the parameters were in normal condition and reported the same

to the District Collector on 23rd March, 2013. It is also the case

of the appellant-company that keeping in view the contents of the

complaints and particularly the complaints with regard to the

throat and eye irritation, it had sought information under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_20">RTI

Act</a> from Tuticorin General Hospital, if there were cases of in-

patient/out-patient   reported   in   the   hospital    with   such

complaints and were treated by that hospital.          The answer

received, which has been placed on record, is in the negative.

Despite the above, Respondent Board vide its order dated 29th

March, 2013 directed closure of the unit and also required the

Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to disconnect the power supply to

the unit with immediate effect, as already noticed.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                 13</span>
</p><p id="p_30"> 10. At this stage, we may also notice that under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_21">Section 31(1)</a> of

the Air Act "Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State

Board under this Act may, within thirty days from the date on

which the order is communicated to him, prefer an appeal to

such authority (hereinafter referred to as the Appellate Authority)

as the State Government may think fit to constitute...."         The

State Government issued notification to constitute an authority

of three persons in terms of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_22">Section 31(2)</a> of the Air Act.

However, at the relevant time, there was only one Member of the

said authority in position and according to the appellant-

company, it could not have filed an appeal which could be

effectively heard by the appellate authority, keeping in view the

law stated by a Bench of this Tribunal in the case of Gurdial

Singh and Another v. State of Punjab and Ors., [Application No.

4/2013, (THC)] decided by Principal Bench at New Delhi on 30th

April, 2013.   In terms of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_23">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act, an order

passed under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_24">Section 31</a> by the appellate authority is appealable

to this Tribunal. In the normal course, under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_25">Section 31</a> of the

Air Act, the appellant-company should have preferred an appeal

before the said appellate authority. Since the State Government

had not constituted the complete State Appellate Authority for

want of quorum, the appellant-company could not prefer the

appeal before that authority particularly keeping in view the

urgency of the case. Thus, it filed an appeal before this Tribunal.

clearance (for short "the EC") granted by the Government of India

and the consent orders passed by the Board under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_26">Air Act</a>

and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974,

(for short the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_28">Water Act</a>') respectively, permitting the appellant-

company to establish and commence its plants, were challenged

by the National Trust for Clean Environment by way of a writ

petition in the Madras High Court.       The Division Bench of the

High Court of Madras vide its judgment dated 29th September,

2010 allowed and disposed of the writ petition with the direction

to the appellant-company to close down its plants at Tuticorin.

By the writ petitions filed before it, the High Court also settled

certain industrial disputes between the appellant-company and

the workmen. Against this judgment special leave petitions were

preferred before the Supreme Court of India which came to be

registered    as   Appeal   Nos.   2776-<a href="/doc/26352158/" id="a_29">2783/2013,    M/s.   Sterlite

Industries India Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors</a>. and were finally

decided on 2nd April, 2013.        The Supreme Court accepted the

appeals while setting aside the judgment of the High Court and

permitted the appellant-company to carry on its business.          It

specifically left certain contentions of the parties open in relation

to compensation and other matters. It will be useful to refer to

the relevant part of the judgment at this stage: -

</p><p id="p_33">     From the aforesaid conclusion of the joint
inspection report, it is clear that out of the 30
directions issued by the TNPCB, the appellant-
company has complied with 29 directions and
only one more direction under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_31">Air Act</a> was to
be complied with. As the deficiencies in the plant
of the appellants which affected the environment
as pointed out by NEERI have now been removed,
the impugned order of the High Court directing
closure of the plant of the appellants is liable to
be set aside.
</p><p id="p_34">      39. We may now consider the contention on
behalf of the interveners that the appellants were
liable to pay compensation for the damage caused
by the plant to the environment. The NEERI
reports of 1998, 1999, 2003 and 2005 show that
the plant of the appellant-company did pollute the
environment through emissions which did not
conform to the standards laid down by the TNPCB
under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_32">Air Act</a> and through discharge of
effluent which did not conform to the standards
laid down by the TNPCB under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_33">Water Act</a>. As
pointed out by Mr. V. Gopalsamy and Mr.
Prakash, on account of some of these deficiencies,
TNPCB also did not renew the consent to operate
for some periods and yet the appellants continued
to operate its plant without such renewal. This is
evident from the following extracts from the
NEERI report of 2011:

environment from 1997 to 2012 and for operating
the plant without a valid renewal for a fairly long
period, the appellant-company obviously is liable
to compensate by paying damages. <a href="/doc/1599374/" id="a_36">In M.C. Mehta

      that the harm occurred           without    any
     negligence on its part."</blockquote><p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">     The Constitution Bench in the aforesaid case
further   observed    that   the   quantum       of
compensation must be co-related to the
magnitude and capacity of the enterprise because
such compensation must have a deterrent effect
and the larger and more prosperous the
enterprise, the greater must be the amount of
compensation payable by it. In the Annual Report
2011 of the appellant-company, at pages 20 and
21, the performance of its copper project is given.
We extract hereinbelow the paragraph titled
Financial Performance:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "PBDIT for the financial year 2010-11
     was Rs.1,043 Crore, 40% higher than the
     PBDIT of Rs.744 Crore for the financial year
     2009-10. This was primarily due to higher
     LME prices and lower unit costs at Copper
     India and with the improved by-product
     realization."</blockquote><p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">      Considering the magnitude, capacity and
prosperity of the appellant- company, we are of
the view that the appellant-company should be
held liable for a compensation of Rs. 100 crores
for having polluted the environment in the vicinity
of its plant and for having operated the plant
without a renewal of the consents by the TNPCB
for a fairly long period and according to us, any
less amount, would not have the desired deterrent
effect on the appellant-company. The aforesaid
amount will be deposited with the Collector of
Thoothukudi District, who will invest it in a Fixed
Deposit with a Nationalized Bank for a period of
five years. The interest therefrom will be spent for
improving the environment, including water and
soil, of the vicinity of the plant after consultation
with TNPCB and approval of the Secretary,
Environment, Government of Tamil Nadu.
</p><p id="p_46">     40. We now come to the submission of Mr.
Prakash that we should not grant relief to the
appellants because of misrepresentation and
suppression of material facts made in the special
leave petition that the appellants have always
been running their plant with statutory consents
and approvals and misrepresentation and
suppression of material facts made in the special
leave petition that the plant was closed at the time
the special leave petition was moved and a stay

 order was obtained from this Court on
01.10.2010. There is no doubt that there has been
misrepresentation and suppression of material
facts made in the special leave petition but to
decline relief to the appellants in this case would
mean closure of the plant of the appellants. The
plant of the appellants contributes substantially
to the copper production in India and copper is
used      in   defence,    electricity,  automobile,
construction and infrastructure etc. The plant of
the appellants has about 1300 employees and it
also provides employment to large number of
people through contractors. A number of ancillary
industries are also dependent on the plant.
</p><p id="p_47">Through its various transactions, the plant
generates a huge revenue to Central and State
Governments in terms of excise, custom duties,
income tax and VAT. It also contributes to 10% of
the total cargo volume of Tuticorin port. For these
considerations of public interest, we do not think
it will be a proper exercise of our discretion under
<a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_37">Article 136</a> of the Constitution to refuse relief on
the grounds of misrepresentation and suppression
of material facts in the special leave petition.
</p><p id="p_48">      41. Before we part with this case, we would
like to put on record our appreciation for the writ
petitioners before the High Court and the
intervener before this Court for having taken up
the cause of the environment both before the High
Court and this Court and for having assisted this
Court on all dates of hearing with utmost sincerity
and hard work. In Indian Council for <a href="/doc/818256/" id="a_38">Enviro-Legal
Action and Others vs. Union of India and
Others</a> [(1996) 3 SCC 211], this Court observed
that voluntary bodies deserve encouragement
wherever their actions are found to be in
furtherance of public interest. Very few would
venture to litigate for the cause of environment,
particularly against the mighty and the
resourceful, but the writ petitioners before the
High Court and the intervener before this Court
not only ventured but also put in their best for the
cause of the general public.
</p><p id="p_49">     42. In the result, the appeals are allowed
and the impugned common judgment of the High
Court is set aside. The appellants, however, are
directed to deposit within three months from
today a compensation of Rs.100 crores with the
Collector of Thoothukudi District, which will be
kept in a fixed deposit in a Nationalized Bank for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                       19</span>
           a minimum of five years, renewable as and when
          it expires, and the interest therefrom will be spent
          on suitable measures for improvement of the
          environment, including water and soil, of the
          vicinity of the plant of the appellants after
          consultation with TNPCB and approval of the
          Secretary, Environment, Government of Tamil
          Nadu. In case the Collector of Thoothukudi
          District, after consultation with TNPCB, finds the
          interest amount inadequate, he may also utilize
          the principal amount or part thereof for the
          aforesaid purpose after approval from the
          Secretary, Environment, Government of Tamil
          Nadu. By this judgment, we have only set aside
          the directions of the High Court in the impugned
          common judgment and we make it clear that this
          judgment will not stand in the way of the TNPCB
          issuing directions to the appellant-company,
          including a direction for closure of the plant, for
          the protection of environment in accordance with
          law.
</p><p id="p_50">               43. We also make it clear that the award of
          damages of Rs. 100 Crores by this judgment
          against the appellant-Company for the period
          from 1997 to 2012 will not stand in the way of
          any claim for damages for the aforesaid period or
          any other period in a civil court or any other
          forum in accordance with law."
</p><p id="p_51">12. It is commonly conceded position before us that the

incident of 23rd March, 2013 was mentioned and brought to the

notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, a day prior to

pronouncement of judgment, on behalf of the Respondent Board.

However, the Supreme Court of India while setting aside the

judgment of the High Court and permitting the appellant-

company to carry on its production, made it clear that the

judgment of the Supreme Court will not stand in the way of the

Respondent Board to issue appropriate directions to the

appellant-company, including directions for closure of the plant

for the protection of environment, in accordance with law.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                 20</span>
</p><p id="p_52"> 13. The appellant-company submits that the Tribunal has

jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal inasmuch as at the

relevant time, the appellate authority of requisite quorum under

the law did not exist in the State of Tamil Nadu and keeping in

view the urgency of the matter and the fact that the appellant

had no effective remedy available to it, the appeal had been filed

before this Tribunal.    There was no urgency or emergency

existing as the alleged leakage or emission took place on 23 rd

March, 2013 while the impugned order was passed on 29th

March, 2013. The respondents have exercised their authority in

an arbitrary and unfair manner. In fact, the use of expressions

like "'unidentified gas' or 'undefined gas' emitted from some

source, probably M/s Sterlite", gives sufficient indication that it

was an ambiguous and uncertain allegation that was made the

basis for taking the action against the appellant-company. The

symptoms suffered by the alleged 12 individuals were non-

specific and could be attributable to leakage of any other gas

including ammonia, chlorine, nitrogen oxide, etc. which are also

the gases found in the ambient air, and not merely to sulphur

dioxide. The appellant-company has been denied the opportunity

to a free, fair and unbiased inquiry into the veracity of the

complaints to find out whether there was actually any emission

from its plant or not. On 23rd March, 2013, the DEE of the

Respondent Board had visited the plant and submitted his

inspection report confirming that the sulphuric acid plant's stack

emissions and ambient air quality were within the prescribed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                 21</span>
 limits of 1250 mg/m3 and 80 Âµg/Nm3. The appellant-company is

fully aware of the welfare of the public and had taken all the

measures to ensure that there was no pollution. The press

release made on 24th March, 2013, was not merely to bring out

the preliminary details of the accident and, in fact, after due

consideration of the ground realities, it did not put any blame on

the appellant-company. According to the appellant-company, the

action taken against it was only at the behest of a handful of

people with vested interests and political association, mobilised

from the districts around Thoothukudi and who had participated

in the alleged protest. The order of closure is based on surmises

and assumptions. There are a large number of other units

carrying on their manufacturing activities in and around the unit

of the appellant-company. One M/s Ramesh Flowers, which were

carrying on the business of dyeing and bleaching could have

caused the problem and even the Committee appointed by the

Govt. of Tamil Nadu, after a detailed investigation, concluded

that the SO2 emission from the appellant-company's unit in and

around the area in question was well within the prescribed

limits. There is heavy vehicular traffic owing to diesel run

vehicles and such vehicles also emit SO2, nitrogen oxide etc. In

addition, other gases such as ammonia, chlorine etc. may also

emanate from the industries around Tuticorin, which have

similar effects on the environment. None of the inspection reports

have fixed any direct responsibility on the appellant-company's

unit.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                22</span>
</p><p id="p_54"> 14. On this factual premise, the appellant-company submits

that the impugned orders are in violation of the principles of

natural justice as adequate opportunity of showing cause to the

proposed action of closure was not provided to it. This has led to

an action being taken by the respondents in undue haste and

without proper application of mind. The unit of the appellant-

company has never caused any pollution.       It was only in the

normal process of calibration that the higher values of SO2 had

been noticed and its emission from the plant of the appellant-

company had never exceeded the prescribed parameters.         The

data collected from the Analyser as well as the Ambient Air

Quality monitoring stations clearly demonstrates that the

appellant-company has never caused any pollution, much less

any health hazard to the residents in the vicinity.           The

complaints against the company are engineered and motivated.

It was not possible that persons staying 8 kms away would have

eye and throat irritation as a result of alleged discharge of SO2

from the appellant-company's unit while no complaints were

received from the residents of the areas near and even adjacent

to the premises of the appellant-company. Further, it is the case

of the appellant-company that the Chairman of the respondent-

Board was not competent to pass the impugned order and in any

case, it is an arbitrary exercise of power. The present appeal is

maintainable and the appellant-company is entitled to carry on

its manufacturing activities in accordance with law.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                23</span>
</p><p id="p_55"> 15. We may now notice the stand taken by the Respondent

Board. Two affidavits dated 8th April, 2013 and 20th May, 2013

were filed on behalf of this respondent.        According to the

Respondent Board, the appellant-company had obtained its

consent to operate on 15th October, 1996 and had actually

commissioned the manufacturing activity on 1st January, 1997.

Subsequently, it expanded the copper manufacturing capacity in

the years of 2005 and 2006 and installed diesel based power

plant in 2002. Again, the consent and the EC had been obtained

from the Respondent Board and the Ministry of Environment &amp;

Forests, Government of India respectively. The consents granted

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_39">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_40">Water Act</a> were challenged before the

Madras High Court.      Subsequently, the plant of the appellant-

company was ordered to be closed. Operation of that judgment

was stayed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide an interim order

dated 28th September, 2010 and the final judgment passed by

the Supreme Court has already been referred to. On 23 rd March,

2013 at 7.00 a.m., according to the Respondent Board, several

complaints   of   eye    irritation,   continuous   cough,   throat

constriction and breathing difficulties, due to presence and

inhalation of obnoxious gas in the atmosphere, were received

from the people of New Colony, Keela Shamuga Puram, which is

situated at a distance of 5 kms away from the appellant-

company's unit.     Based on the complaints, the DEE had

immediately inspected the appellant company's plant and had

made certain observations. It was stated that the unit had been

 shut down on 21st March, 2013 to attend to the puncture in the

furnace roof cooling jacket tube. The smelter was again put into

operation from 23rd March, 2013. According to the Respondent

Board, no such intimation in advance was sent to it and its

permission was not sought.    The Respondent Board CARE Air

Centre at Guindy, Chennai, logged in data pertaining to

sulphuric acid plant-I (SAP-1) of appellant-company from 2.15

a.m. to 2.45 a.m. on 23rd March, 2013 which showed that the

Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) in the stack emission was in the range of

2103.23 mg/Nm3 to 2939.33 mg/Nm3 (803.5 ppm to 1123.6

ppm) as against the emission standards of 1250 mg/Nm3 (477.53

ppm) prescribed by the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests in the

Notification published in the gazette. Thereafter, the inspection

was carried out on 24th March, 2013 which also confirmed

accident of SO2 emissions at the online continuous monitoring

system in the SAP-1 of the unit. Keeping in view the gravity of

the situation, a show cause notice dated 24th March, 2013 was

issued to the appellant-company.     It is specifically mentioned

that the appellant-company had submitted its reply on 27th-28th

of March, 2013 informing that during the period of calibration

between 9.00 a.m. to 11.15 a.m. on 23rd March, 2013, higher

values had been recorded which were similar to the values

experienced during the earlier calibration period, which in turn

shows that it was not operational.     It is submitted that the

Ambient Air Quality Monitor available at the factory site, not

having recorded higher values cannot be adduced as a reason for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                               25</span>
 the 80 Âµg/Nm3 upper limit being not breached, as the monitor in

the factory which is located 500 metres away within the factory,

is not in the line of stack emission. The fact that eye irritations

and throat suffocation were felt by the people at a distance of 5

kms away, once again leads to the irrevocable conclusion that

there was emission of obnoxious gas at higher parameters than

those laid down. SO2 is a toxic gas and can not only cause the

problems complained of but may also damage vegetation, soil

and water content in the locality. According to this affidavit, the

plant had been operated without observing the due precautions

and safety norms leading to dangerously high levels of SO2,

which could not be controlled by the existing Air Pollution

Control measures provided in the plant.
</p>
<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">16. In paragraph 24, the said respondent has referred to a table

showing emissions in excess of the standard parameters and

there are stated to be 84 such instances. The copper smelters

are infamous for their extensive public health and environmental

impacts both in Western countries and in countries where the

environmental standards are much less rigorous.


</p><p id="p_58">17. In view of the excessive emissions, it is contended that the

appellant-company is only looking after its own economic

interests and not the public interest.          Merely providing

employment to 3000 people is not a justifiable cause for such

emissions. The prevention of deterioration of environment has to

be of paramount consideration.         Permitting the appellant-

 company to commence its operations will cause irreparable

injury and hardship to the public as there is an imminent threat

and danger of a chemical disaster.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">18. In its affidavit dated 20th May, 2013, the Board has

primarily reiterated the above averments but has also further

attempted to counter the contentions/documents that have been

placed on record by the appellant-company.            To such reply-

affidavit, even a rejoinder was filed by the appellant-company

placing further documents on record.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">19. The District Collector, Thoothukudi, had informed the DEE

of the complaints received and upon receiving such complaints,

the DEE had inspected the appellant-company's unit.             The

report, thereafter, has been placed as Annexure 'A'. It is further

submitted that the appellant-company is situated in S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_41">IPC</a>OT

Industrial Complex Thoothukudi, and there are about 64

industries in the campus, out of which only 54 are functioning

and only the appellant Company emits toxic gases which are

injurious to health.    It is averred that the contention of the

appellant-company      that   excessive   emissions    were   during

calibration process is false. The analyser is connected to stack

and it shows the measure of SO2 gas emitted at the stack level.

Calibration exercise is to ascertain whether the analyser is

working properly and recording the emissions correctly or not.

As per experts of the Respondent Board, the readings recorded

by the analyser are not due to calibration exercise but in fact are



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                  27</span>
 actual emissions.       Calibration approximately takes 20 minutes

while excessive gases have been recorded in excess thereto as

well as on different times.       The emissions recorded on 23 rd

March, 2013 at 0145 hours to 0245 hours show a gradual

increase, from 0146 hours to 0201 hours, of about 16 minutes.

Emission levels reached a maximum readable range of the

analyser of 1123 ppm, from 0202 hours to 0240 hours i.e. for 39

minutes. Later there was a gradual decrease of emission levels

in five minutes from 0241 hours to 0245 hours. Had this been

due to calibration then the reading would have demonstrated a

sudden spurt of 30 seconds in the graph.             This exceedence

indicates that this spurt in the value of SO2 is not due to

calibration process       but due   to   the emissions    with high

concentration levels of SO2 from the process.         Similarly, from

October   2012   till    March   2013,   84   such   occurrences   of

exceedence were reported for every 15 minutes of recorded

values. It is submitted on behalf of the Respondent Board that

even if concentration of SO2 in the stack is at any level beyond

1123 ppm, the analyser would show concentration at only 1123

ppm as the analyser cannot record any figure which is beyond

the readable figure.      The Ambient Air Quality Monitor is not

always correctly reflective of the fact as to whether there were

excessive emissions or not.         It is contended that the data

submitted by the appellant-company is an average of 24 hours of

the Ambient Air Quality recorded in the seven stations.         This




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                   28</span>
 data cannot and will not reflect any sudden spurt in the emission

during the period of the said emissions.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">20. It is also averred by the Respondent Board that the

appellant-company's plant was connected to CARE Air Centre,

Respondent Board for two stack parameters, i.e. SAP 1 and 2 for

SO2 only from 12th March, 2012.        Three more stacks, i.e. ISA

Furnace Stack, SGS (Secondary Gas Scrubber) 1 &amp; 2 stacks were

connected only from 1st March, 2013. No Continuous Ambient

Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQM) of the appellant-

company is connected by the CARE Air Centre, Respondent

Board.     There are seven CAAQM stations available at the

appellant-company and the same data is not connected to the

CARE Air Centre of the Respondent Board. According to this

respondent, the appellant-company is guilty of suprressio veri

suggestio falsi and therefore, not entitled to any relief.


</p><p id="p_65">21. Thus, according to the respondent-Board, the issuance of a

show cause notice on 24th March, 2013 and the order of closure

dated 29th March, 2013 was correctly passed.


</p><p id="p_66">22. Respondent No.2, at the very outset, has taken an objection

with regard to the maintainability of the present appeal on the

ground that the appellant-company has a statutory remedy

under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_42">Section 31</a> of the Air Act of filing an appeal before the duly

constituted Appellate Authority.        As such entertaining the

present appeal would allow the appellant-company to jump the

statutory appeal, which is not permissible in law. It was required


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                 29</span>
 of the appellant-company to exhaust all the remedies available to

it in law before filing an appeal before the National Green

Tribunal (for short the "NGT"). It is averred by this respondent

that complaints were received over the phone from the public of

Thoothukudi town and nearby areas stating that an unidentified

gas was emitted from some source, probably M/s Sterlite

Industry, Thoothukudi, around 6.30 a.m. on 23rd March, 2013

which led to various health problems like eye irritation, throat

infection, severe cough, breathing problem and nausea to the

people of Thoothukudi town and particularly in the areas of Anna

Nagar, Toovipuram, Bryant Nagar and George Road.       An urgent

meeting was called by the District Collector at 11.00 a.m. on that

day and a number of officers of the government participated in

that meeting including the police authorities. It was decided by

the District Administration to proceed against the appellant-

company for causing public nuisance under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_43">Section 133</a> of the

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short '<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_44">Cr.P.C</a>.') and a

notice dated 24th March, 2013 in Form 20 was issued to the

appellant-company.     Demonstrations were held by various

bodies, including the General Secretary, MDMK, along with a

large number of workers against the appellant-company. Nearly

70% of the shops in Thoothukudi town were closed. Finally, the

orders for closure in terms of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_45">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act were

issued on 29th March, 2013 for violation of rules and standards.

Thereafter, even the electricity supply to the premises was

disconnected on 30th March, 2013.      The appellant-company is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                30</span>
 stated to have operated its unit without observing all due

precautions and safety norms leading to dangerously high rise in

levels of Sulphur Dioxide emissions which could not be

controlled by the existing air pollution control measures.

Moreover, the SO2 exposure threatened the public with both

short-term and chronic effects on its health. The sub-Divisional

Magistrate and Revenue Divisional Officer, Thoothukudi, had

conducted a detailed enquiry under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_46">Section 133</a> Cr.P.C. On 24 th

March, 2013, a press release was issued by the District

Administration to bring out the preliminary details of the

incident and its effects on the people and in this release, it was

mentioned that as per the inspection report of the DEE, the SO2

emission from the appellant-company were in high quantity. At

the same time, it is stated that the press release had not given

any clean chit to the appellant-company and they cannot take

any shelter under the said submission.        A number of persons

had taken medical treatment in AVM Hospital. Though there

were no in-patients in the hospital but the fact is that a number

of persons were affected as a result of the emission of pungent

gases on 23rd March, 2013. Lastly, it is submitted that in view of

the past experience, it will not be in the public interest to permit

the appellant-company to operate its plant.


</p><p id="p_67">23. Respondents No.4 and 5, who were subsequently ordered to

be impleaded as respondents have also filed separate replies.

Besides taking up an objection with regard to the maintainability

of the appeal, the respondents have contended that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                                  31</span>
 jurisdiction, which has been conferred upon the Appellate

Authority under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_47">Air Act</a>, cannot be exercised by this Tribunal

and thus, the appeal is not maintainable for want of jurisdiction.

Referring to the process adopted by the appellant-company in its

plant, it is stated that the SO2 is a by-product of the copper

smelting process. SO2 gas is run through the catalytic converter

for conversion into Sulphur Trioxide (SO3) and Sulphuric Acid

(H2SO4). The SO2 levels in the off gases during start-up and shut

down modes are usually lean and the conditions are not stable

enough to provide a safe flow of SO2 rich gases. Thus, the

concentration of SO2 in the gas is not high enough to warrant

running the gases through the catalytic converter for conversion

into SO3 and H2SO4. The standard operating procedure is that

during the start-up and shut down the tail gas scrubbers should

necessarily and compulsorily be operated.         Gases should not

bypass the scrubber. Only after the plant reaches a steady-state

and conditions stabilise, a steady stream of SO2 gas will emerge

from the furnaces with percentage of SO2 that is high enough to

make it viable to operate the converter. At this stage, the gas is

cooled, scrubbed and fed to the catalytic converter.         Here it

undergoes conversion from SO2 to SO3.         It is mandatory for the

gases to be sent to tail end gas scrubber to reduce the

concentration of SO2 to permissible levels.


</p><p id="p_68">24. Inhalation of Sulphur Dioxide is associated with symptoms

of increased respiratory ailments, difficulty in breathing and

premature    death.      In   2008,   American       Conference    of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                   32</span>
 Governmental Industrial Hygienists reduced the short-term

exposure limit from 5 ppm to 0.25 ppm.
</p>
<p id="p_69">
</p><p id="p_70">25. The respondents specifically denied that the identical

mechanism readings of 1123.6 ppm were there because of

calibration events.    On the contrary, there was variable high

emissions discharge of Sulphur Dioxide from the appellant-

company's unit as a result of manufacturing process rather than

calibration.    According to these respondents, there is an

overwhelming evidence that there was a serious incident on 23rd

March, 2013 and there was a gas leakage, which itself was not

an isolated incident but there were repeated similar incidences.

It is also denied that the unit of the appellant-company was

running and operating with requisite approvals and consents

issued by the regulatory authorities. The appellant-company is

importing copper concentrate from its two Australian mines and

this imported copper concentrate is said to contain not only

copper but also toxic and radioactive substances such as

Arsenic, Bismuth, Flouride and Uranium. Thus, the appellant-

company is only making profit while exposing people to a great

risk.
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">26.     It is contended by these respondents that the emissions on

23rd March, 2013 at 6.00 a.m. were not within the permissible

limits. The concentration of sulphur dioxide graph of Ambient

Air Quality on that day shows abnormal increases. Even after

the lapse of 15 years, the appellant-company has not complied



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                33</span>
 with   the     requirements     as    indicated   by      NEERI   and   the

Respondent-Board. The appellant-company cannot be allowed to

pollute the atmosphere repeatedly under the garb of providing

employment to people and claiming compliance with the defects

pointed out by NEERI and the Respondent-Board.


</p><p id="p_73">27. Therefore,      all   the   respondents       while    oppugning    the

contentions raised on behalf of the appellant-company have

contended that the incident of 23rd March, 2013 was a clear case

of emission of SO2 in violation of the prescribed standards and

not calibration. The data reflected in the graph shows that the

increase and decrease in emission of SO2, is gradual and not

sudden. A gradual increase or decrease is opposed to the very

concept of calibration.     There has to be a rapid fall in case of

calibration.    Further, it is contended that it was in the public

interest and public health to meet the environmental exigencies

that the impugned orders were passed directing closure of the

appellant-company's plant.           It was a punitive measure.     There

were large number of defects noticed in the functioning of the

appellant-company's plant and persistence of excessive emission

of SO2 for considerable period compelled the authorities to pass

the order in question.          The Respondent Board has provided

adequate opportunity to the appellant-company to reply to the

show cause notice dated 24th March, 2013 while the order of

closure was passed on 29th March, 2013. Thus, there is no

violation of the principles of natural justice. Moreover, the

consent granted to the appellant-company had come to an end

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                         34</span>
 on 31st March, 2013 and as such the industry in any case cannot

operate.
</p>
<p id="p_74">
</p><p id="p_75">28. Emission of SO2, in violation of the prescribed standards,

resulted in health hazards to the residents in furtherance to

which the complaints were received.       Owing merely to the fact

that there are economic stakes of the appellant-company, it is

neither desirable nor permissible to let the appellant-company

operate.   The impugned orders have not been passed in an

arbitrary or unjust manner. The orders have been passed by the

Chairman who is competent, has been delegated with the

requisite authority and has passed such orders in bona fide

exercise of such authority. The orders do not suffer from the vice

of arbitrariness or otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">29. In any case, the present appeal is not even maintainable

and thus, the appeal should be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">30. Rejoinders to the reply of the respective respondents have

been filed by the appellant-company mainly reiterating the

averments made in its appeal. Further, it is stated that the show

cause notice did not mention any exceedance of SO2 emission

from the appellant company's unit. The impugned order and the

show cause notice are contradictory in terms.


</p><p id="p_80">31. The appellant-company has also averred in its rejoinder

that Mr. Vaiko, Respondent No.5, is closely associated with one

Mr.   Nityanand, who     is   intentionally   working against   the

appellant-company for personal vendetta. The recommendations

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                 35</span>
 given by NEERI and the Board were only further improvements

suggested in the environmental protection as the appellant-

company's unit was already having the necessary plant,

machinery and technology to comply with the prescribed limits

and in fact, all monitoring reports during the said period

confirmed the same with respect to air, water and land

environment. It is also specifically denied that at any point of

time, there was any emission of sulphur dioxide above the

prescribed limits. The alleged stack emission figures in the range

of   2103.23   mg/Nm3    to   2939.33   mg/Nm3    are   based   on

imagination of Respondent No.5.
</p>
<p id="p_81">
</p><p id="p_82">32. In the joint inspection report conducted by the Central

Pollution Control Board and the Respondent Board before the

Supreme Court such emissions were not mentioned. A contrario,

it was stated by the Respondent Board that considering the

compliance made by the appellant-company, the Respondent

Board had issued renewal consent orders for copper smelting

project, copper rod plant and power division vide its proceeding

dated 5th October, 2012 with validity upto 31st March, 2013. The

Respondent Board also specifically stated that as per the

performance report, the ambient air quality inside the plant and

outside its premises met the national ambient air quality

standards. The impugned order, thus, has been passed on mere

assumptions.    NEERI, in its report of May 2011, had also

confirmed that the appellant-company's unit was meeting the

environmental standards and there was nothing in the report

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                36</span>
 stating that the operation of the appellant-company's unit was a

threat or concern to the environment. Moreover, an email of the

Respondent Board was received from CARE Air Centre, Chennai,

beyond its normal working hours at about 2042 hours on 23rd

March, 2013 informing that SAP-1, Sulphur Dioxide parameters

were showing the values in excess of the standards provided, and

the same should be checked and its reason informed.             The

appellant-company had informed that the value of 1080.5 ppm -

1123.4 ppm at 9.15 a.m. was recorded on account of calibration

carried out at the request of the DEE. The DEE had visited the

unit of the appellant-company at 0800 hours on 23rd March,

2013, had taken the field trends from the commencement of

shutdown till that time as also the details from the tail gas

scrubber.    The appellant-company had informed this to the

Respondent-Board on various occasions, including on 23rd

March, 2013 and 24th March, 2013 when the officers of the

Board had come for inspection, and had also written in their

reply dated 25th March, 2013 and thereafter in the explanation

dated 27th - 28th March, 2013. Thus, it was not all of a sudden

that the appellant-company had taken the stand that there was

excessive emission as a result of calibration.   All the suggestions

and directions made by the Central Pollution Control Board, the

Respondent-Board and NEERI including providing of Flue Gas

Desulphurisation System along with bag filters in primary

smelter and bag filter alone in the secondary smelter for handling

Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal at Chennai and

was heard by that Bench. Vide its order dated 12th April, 2013,

that Bench had appointed an Expert Committee to visit the plant

of the appellant-company at Thoothukudi and submit its report

to the Tribunal. The Committee was expected to file its report by

29th April, 2013. However, before the said report could be filed on

record, the Southern Bench of NGT, Chennai, recused itself from

hearing the matter any further and that is how, the matter came

up for hearing before the Principal Bench of NGT.

Committee had visited the plant of the appellant-company at

Thoothukudi district on 23rd April, 2013. Before the visit, the

Committee had directed the Respondent Board to resume power

and water supply from 9.00 a.m. on 21st April, 2013 to 9.00 a.m.

on 4th May, 2013. This was done to attain the normal working

conditions of the plant as it needed five working days for that

 company in advance to the Expert Committee and to the

Respondent Board officials. The Committee visited the unit of the

appellant-company in the presence of the representatives of the

Respondent Board and the appellant-company. The Committee,

upon due examination of the analysers, found that instruments

were calibrated properly and were working well. The Committee

also   visited   the   ambient    air   quality   monitoring   stations,

maintained both by the appellant-company and the Respondent

Board, on 23rd April, 2013 itself. The Committee instructed the

appellant-company to start the feed to the smelter on Friday, 26th

April, 2013 at 8.28 p.m. so that the process attained steady state

by Saturday morning. The Committee revisited the premises on

27th April, 2013 at 9.00 a.m. and the process attained steady

state at 7.30 a.m. on the same day with a feed rate of 152 Tons

per hour. The Committee inspected the readings of all the online

SO2 monitors from 5 different stacks (SAP1, SAP2, SGS1, SGS2,

ISA1). The Committee also conducted manual stack monitoring

for all the 5 stacks to cross check the on-line results. The

manually measured data and online data were compared and it

was found that the SO2 emissions from all the stacks were well

within the permissible limits. The Committee also examined the

routing of gas from the stack to the analysers, flow rate, leakage

in the sampling tubes and sensitivity of the sensors. The ambient

air quality was monitored in 13 stations maintained by the

appellant-company       and   3    NAAQMS         maintained   by   the

Respondent Board.

2013 was filed before the Tribunal and received by the Registry of

the Principal Bench of the Tribunal on 29th April, 2013 and was

placed before the Tribunal on 8th May, 2013. Thereafter and with

reference to the above factual matrix of the report on record,

lengthy arguments were advanced over a long period. The

arguments were concluded on 31st May, 2013 on which date the

Tribunal, while reserving the matter for judgment, passed an

interim order and also appointed another Expert committee, in

whose presence the appellant-company was permitted to carry

on its business and which was to submit its report before the

Tribunal by 10th July, 2013. The Tribunal passed the following

interim order on 31st May, 2013:
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">            "At the outset, we may notice that all the learned
        counsel appearing for various parties specifically



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                    40</span>
 agreed not to raise any objection to the constitution
of this Bench and proceeded to argue the matter.
</p><p id="p_91">     This is an Appeal filed against the Order dated
29thMarch, 2013 passed by Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board.
</p><p id="p_92">   Initially, the Appeal was instituted before the
Chennai Bench of the National Green Tribunal. The
Bench dealing with the matter did not grant any
interim relief at the initial stage. However, the Bench
directed that the Appeal be heard on merits. Vide
order dated 12th April, 2013 the Bench appointed an
Expert Committee to visit the plant of the Appellant
at Tuticorin and took up the matter for final hearing.
The Committee so appointed was directed to file its
Report by 29th April 2013. However, the Bench
dealing with the matter recused itself that is how the
matter came to be listed before the Principal Bench
for hearing. The Principal Bench also did not grant
any interim order but continued with the final
hearing in the matter from 14th May, 2013 to 31st
May, 2013. The matter has been argued by the
learned counsel appearing for the respective parties
at 8 effective hearings. Various contentions have
been raised before us including the very
maintainability of the present appeal. The lengthy
arguments and voluminous records have been
referred during the prolonged hearings before the
Tribunal. While reserving the case for judgment and
as prayed, we have also to decide the question of
interim orders. Thus, we will be passing a detailed
judgment in due course and primarily because of the
intervening vacations, we consider it appropriate to
pass interim order in the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case.
</p><p id="p_93">     At the outset, we hold that the appeal is
maintainable in terms of the provisions of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_48">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981,
particularly because when the appeal was instituted
before the Chennai Bench of the Tribunal,
admittedly, the appellate authority under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_49">Air Act</a>
had neither been constituted nor was it functional. In
fact during the course of arguments before us, it was
argued that the Govt. of Tamil Nadu has constituted
the appellate authority and is functional on 8th May,
2013, when the appeal has been instituted. The
appeal thus, is substantially progressed before the
Tribunal. In any case, it is the time of the institution
of the appeal that would be determinative. Another
aspect in this regard which deserves to be noticed is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                           41</span>
 that the order of the said appellate authority is
appealable before this Tribunal. The matter has been
pending before the Tribunal and has been heard for
quite some time. Thus, it would not even be in the
interest of justice to reject the memorandum of
appeal requiring the appellant to file the appeal
before the said appellate authority. Thus, we hold
that the present appeal in the facts of the case is
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_94">     In order to examine whether or not we should
pass some interim directions, it is necessary for us to
record the reasons which have weighed with us for
permitting   the   appellant     to   carry    on   its
manufacturing activity. The reasons are the
following:-
</p><p id="p_95"> (i)    The judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of Sterlite Industries &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India &amp;
Ors. [(2013)5 SCALE 202 ] puts quietus to a number
of contentions raised before us in this petition. It is
not disputed that the incident of 23rd March, 2013
was mentioned by the State Pollution Control Board,
Tamil Nadu, before the Supreme Court prior to
pronouncement of the judgment. However, Supreme
Court still permitted the appellant industry to carry
on its manufacturing activity subject to the
conditions stated in the judgment. However, the
Supreme Court had granted leave to the Pollution
Control Board to proceed in accordance with the law.
Thus, the judgment of the Supreme Court, besides
being a binding precedent has raised a number of
contentions raised on behalf of the respondents.
</p><p id="p_96">(ii)    The main controversy between the parties
revolves around whether on 23rd March, 2013, the
higher values reflected in the analyser's data of the
appellant-industry was a result of calibration or
excess emission as a result of leakage of SO2. Before
passing the impugned order, it was obligatory upon
the Board to satisfy itself as to the fact that it was a
case of actual leakage of gas and it was imperative to
shut down the industry. Such opinion ought to have
been backed by scientific data and analysis report. In
our opinion, the Board has failed to discharge such
onus and has passed the impugned order on an
apprehension which was not supported by any
scientific data.
</p><p id="p_97">(iii)  The closure of an industry is in fact a 'civil
death' of a company and has very serious
consequences. Thus, application of mind, existence
of actual scientific data and actual nexus between

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                           42</span>
 the leakage of gases and activity of the industry is a
sine qua non. We are afraid that these ingredients
have not been satisfied by the Board. The industry
was inspected by the Board just before 23rd March,
2013 as well as on 23rd and 24th March, 2013. In
another     inspection   report,  neither    anything
significant or any wrong in the functioning of the
plant was noticed nor was any stack or ambient air
quality samples collected from and around the
premises of the industry, thus, erring to provide any
scientific support to the apprehension of the Board
that the gas had leaked from the plant of the
industry.
</p><p id="p_98">(iv) We may notice that in the inspection carried out
by the officers of the Pollution Control Board on 24 th
March, 2013 at 4.30 pm, it was noticed "presently all
remains normal and the plant is operating at its full
capacity".
</p><p id="p_99">(v) The team of experts appointed by the Tribunal
vide its order dated 12th April, 2013 in its report
made no adverse comments in relation to the
functioning of the plant and in fact, found that
largely the functioning of the plant is in consonance
with the scientific requirements and notified
parameters.
</p><p id="p_100">(vi) It is undisputed that the area in question is an
industrial cluster and a number of other industries
which deal with different gases like sulphur dioxide
(SO2), ammonia and chlorine are carrying on their
activities. There are even power units located at a
short distance from that area which are bound to
release SO2. The Board has not placed on record any
determinative scientific evidence by way of analysis,
its reports or reading of analyser or continuous
ambient air quality mechanism to show that it is the
appellant-industry alone responsible for the alleged
excessive emission of SO2.
</p><p id="p_101">(vii) Another aspect which must be noticed is that
the complaints with regard to injury to public health
that were being received were from a village nearly 8
km away from the unit of the appellant. In normal
case, if it was a case of excessive emission from stack
of the appellant industry and it contained
impermissible emissions of SO2, then the persons
living near the village would get more affected by
release of such gas as by the time it reaches 8 km
away from the industry, its impact and consequences
adverse to human health would stand diluted
considerably. This certainly cannot be stated to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                          43</span>
 the determinative factor but can be an indicator of
the possibility of no offence being committed by the
appellant industry. We may also notice that from the
records before us, the timing of complaints of the
public against the excessive release of emissions from
the industry of the appellant are not compatible to
draw the conclusion that the industry in question
was an offending industry.
</p><p id="p_102">(viii) It is not disputed before us that the emission
standards during calibration of the Analyser of the
industrial plant of the appellant under supervision or
otherwise was maintained at 1113 ppm as against
the limit of 477 ppm.
</p><p id="p_103">(ix)    The Board has exercised its power with a
primary reference to the 'precautionary principles'.
According to the Board, the industry was shut down
as a precautionary measure following the incident of
23rd March, 2013. In the facts and circumstances of
the case, it is difficult for us to accept this
contention. Admittedly, the incident had taken place
on 23rd March, 2013 and for a continuous period of
six days, the industry was permitted to function. It
was only on 29th March, 2013 that an order was
passed directing closure of the industry. No scientific
data or analytical report either from the records of
the Board or that of the appellant has been placed
before us to show that either the emissions continued
during this period or they were in excess of the
prescribed parameters.
</p><p id="p_104">(x)     Incidentally, on 25th March, 2013 itself, the
District Collector had constituted a sub-committee to
examine the complaints of the public in relation to
the release of gases from the area in question.
Strangely, this report has still to see the light of the
day. Thus, this Committee was to inspect not only
the appellant-industry but all the industries located
in that area. If no report of this committee has so far
been submitted, we fail to understand what weighed
with the Board in passing the impugned order. In our
considered view, this was not a precautionary step
but was per se a 'punitive' order. The action of the
Board would suffer from the vice of arbitrariness if it
collected no data whatsoever during the period of 23rd
to 29th March, 2013 and passed the impugned order
in an abrupt manner. This appears to be correct from
the records before us.
</p><p id="p_105">(xi)    Another aspect which has weighed with the
Board is that the impugned order dated 29th March,
2013 has been passed by the Chairperson of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                           44</span>
 Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. In terms of
<a href="/doc/1897355/" id="a_50">Section 15</a> read with <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_51">Section 31A</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_52">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, it is the
Board which is vested with the power to pass such
orders and directions. However, the Board could have
delegated its functions and powers to the
Chairperson of the Board for which a resolution is
stated to have been passed. The Board had passed a
resolution on 24th February, 1994. In terms of this
resolution, the power was supposed to be vested with
the Chairperson as a measure of emergency and
inasmuch as the Board was not likely to meet for
some time. The resolution was further restricted to a
polluting industry contravening the provisions of the
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_53">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, in
short the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_54">Air Act</a>, and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_55">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 in short the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_56">Water Act</a>,
particularly <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_57">Section 31A</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_58">Section 33A</a> of the
respective Acts, thus, liable to closure. It was in these
circumstances that the power was delegated to the
Chairperson. The delegation of powers contemplated
satisfaction of certain conditions i.e. existence of
emergency as well as satisfaction of the Chairperson
in regard to the industry being a polluting industry
and the necessity for passing the directions, as
contemplated under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_59">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act
and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_60">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act. Further, it has to
satisfy that the offence was likely to continue. As
evident from the TNPCB's inspection report, which
showed as everything was normal and the plant was
working to its capacity. The bare analysis of the
above would show that it is nobody's case that the
offence in relation to the industry was likely to
continue. Secondly, what was the emergency and
lastly why the matter has not been placed before the
Board till today. Besides all this, what is of greater
significance is that in the impugned order, it has
been noticed as follows:
</p><p id="p_106">     "The Board after deep consideration of the above
facts and your reply to the show cause notice has
taken a serious view of the matter. It is the statutory
duty of the Board to prevent any incident as narrated
above."
</p><p id="p_107">     The matter was expected to be dealt with by the
Board objectively while it is an admitted case that till
today, the matter has not been placed even for
rectification before the Board.
</p><p id="p_108">(xii) At best, it was the apprehension of the Board
that SO2 has been emanated from the industry of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                            45</span>
 appellant and has caused prejudice to the public
health. This apprehension would in normal course be
not sufficient to pass such a drastic order unless
there was definite and scientific evidence available to
the Board that the emission from the unit of the
appellant was in excess of the prescribed norm and
this in turn has a direct nexus to the adverse effects
on human health of the persons living in the vicinity
of the industry. During the course of hearings, it was
pointed out before us that the continuous ambient
air quality monitor belonging to the Board, which is
in the vicinity of this industrial area, is not functional
for the last more than two years. It is anticipated that
adequate data would be collected by the monitoring
station provided by the Pollution Control Board as
well as by the appellant-company for measuring
accurately the excessive emission of SO2 or any other
gases. Another relevant factor is that gases like
ammonia, chlorine can have serious physical effect
on the human beings like SO2. Furthermore, large
number of units in and around the industrial area
are releasing all these three gases and therefore, it
ought to be pointed out as to which industry was
responsible for excessive release of the prescribed
parameters. Thus, a mere apprehension would not be
sufficient for passing of such a drastic order. Keeping
in view the large public interest, which in fact was
noticed by the Supreme Court in paragraph 40 of the
judgment in the case of Sterlite Industries, needs to
be referred to by us even at the cost of repetition.


</p><p id="p_109">(xiii) It is not disputed that the appellant-company
before us is one of the largest manufacturers of
copper in the country. Obviously, it is also the case of
the appellant that before it came into production, a
huge quantity of copper was being imported by India.
Thus, they play a significant role in the economy not
only at the national level but even at the
international level. They are employing a large
number of persons and are contributing towards
economic growth and industrial development,
particularly in the field of manufacture of copper. The
value of copper in the country is largely dependent
upon the manufacture of copper by the appellant
industry. It is the contention of the appellant that
they are manufacturing 55% of the total production
of copper in the country. It was expected of the Board
to examine adverse effects of their order on the
economy and pricing of copper in comparison to the
pollution that the industry was alleged to be causing.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                             46</span>
</p><p id="p_110">         It was also contended before us and remains
        undisputed that the copper manufactured by the
        appellant is also used in the defence services of the
        country. These are not determinative considerations
        but certainly relevant considerations. Considering
        the role the industry plays, a balance has to be
        attained between environmental interest and the
        principle of sustained development. Even if we apply
        the principle of comparative hardship and balance
        between the requirements of environment and
        sustained development, the Tribunal must strike
        balance which would protect the environment on the
        one hand beyond any reasonable threat as well as to
        ensure production of an essential product like
        copper. The Board essentially should have considered
        options available to it unless the Board came to a
        conclusion that no other solution could be found to
        the problem except closure and it was not possible to
        take recourse to certain methodology like providing
        appropriate checks and balances including early
        warning system while permitting the industry to
        function. It is always expected of a statutory public
        authority to consider all these balancing factors
        before it comes to the conclusion of passing such a
        drastic order.
</p><p id="p_111">             For these reasons, we pass the following order:
</p><p id="p_112">(i)     We permit the appellant-industry to commence its
        production and operate its industry subject to certain
        condition hereunder.

         material data with excessive emission data. It will
         collect on-line available SO2 data from the thermal
         power plant of the area.
</p><p id="p_120">(ix)     The Committee shall, before the industry is permitted
         to operate, take ambient air quality samples around
         and at a distance of 7-8 km point of the industry.
</p><p id="p_121">(x)      The Committee shall also examine the emergency
         action plan in and outside the industry in question
         and its efficacy.
</p><p id="p_122">(xi)     In its report to the Tribunal, the Committee may
         suggest whether the appellant industry requires to
         improve its system for better maintenance and
         ensuring that it strictly operates within the specified
         parameters which do not infringe environmental
         interest of the town and people living therein.

         brought in line with SAP II in terms of monitoring
         system.

         the site within one week from today.
</p><p id="p_125">                   We also direct the Tamil Nadu Pollution
         control Board to immediately put in order its ambient
         air quality automatic system and ensure that the
         requisite data is collected from such system. The
         Board shall carry out a study relating to the causes
         of ill-health of the people who are living around the
         industrial pockets and the various thermal power
         plants which are running in the town of Tuticorin
         and submit a report to the Tribunal. If the appellant-

the Air quality data was collected over a period of eight days.

There were 13 automatic and 13 mobile ambient air quality

monitoring   systems    and     the   stack   emissions    were    also

continuously kept under check. No excessive emission of SO2 or

any other pollutant problem was noticed by the Expert

Committee.    The ambient air quality remained between 4 to

46Âµg/m3 as against the permissible limit of 80Âµg/m3. As far as

the stack samples were concerned, the reading was found to be

around 129.5 mg/NM3 as against 1250 mg/NM3 or 49 ppm as

against the permissible limit of 477 ppm were observed.         It may

be noticed that these were the highest values recorded during the

operation of the industry, right from 23rd June, 2011 to the date

of preparation of the report.     The mass emission of sulphuric

acid was 0.79 kg/tonne of sulphuric acid as against the

permissible limit of one kilogram sulphuric acid per tonne of

sulphuric acid.

TRUSTWORTHINESS AND RELIABILITY OF THE INCIDENT OF
23RD MARCH, 2013 :
</p>
<p id="p_139">
</p><p id="p_140">43. The very foundation of the order dated 29th March, 2013 is

the alleged incident of 23rd March, 2013. It is stated that certain

complaints   were   received   from   the   residents   of   Therku

Veerapandi      Puram,      Vadakusilikanpatti      Sourispuram,

Korampallam etc. in regard to burning of eyes, irritation in the

throat and heaviness in breathing.      All these complaints are

dated 23rd March, 2013 and had been made in somewhat

identical language and content. According to these complaints,

between 5.45 a.m and 7.30 a.m., smoke came from the

appellant-company causing breathing difficulty. Requests were

made in these reports to inspect the appellant company's site

and take necessary steps. In one of the complaints it was stated

that when the complainant reached the Bryant Nagar main road,

there was sudden smoke, which resulted in eye irritation.

Another complainant claims to have reached Annanagar main

road when he suddenly realized that there was some obnoxious

gas in the air which caused irritation. Another complaint was

made by one Mr. M.Thomas.        According to him while he was

going to church, he suddenly experienced suffocation, eye

irritation and giddiness, which happened due to mixing of

poisonous gas in the air. He specifically states that there are no



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                                                 52</span>
 other factories which can emit smoke in the area and the smoke

must have come from the appellant company.
</p>
<p id="p_141">
</p><p id="p_142">44. It was the case of the appellant-company before the

Tribunal that no one suffered such eye irritation, suffocation and

throat irritation as none went to the hospital or the doctors for

getting treated for the same. The appellant-company also claims

to have filed an RTI application for seeking information from the

Government Medical Hospital, Thoothukudi on 25th March, 2013.

This was responded to by the authorities at the college on 28th

March, 2013 wherein they stated that on 23rd March, 2013 no

patient was admitted in the Medical College hospital as 'in-

patient' or 'out-patient', who was affected by leakage of gas, none

was admitted and given treatment to as per records of the

hospital.   The respondents had relied upon the two affidavits

filed by Dr. Dorus and Dr. Pethukkani. They, in their affidavits,

have stated that they had reliably learnt that Sterlite Industries

had contended before the Tribunal that no complaints were made

by the people alleging to be suffering from eye, throat irritation

etc. In these affidavits it was also stated that the deponents had

no way of ascertaining      whether or not the gas leak happened

from Sterlite Industries but there was a marked increase in the

number of patients coming in with the complaints of breathing

difficulty on 23rd March, 2013.   According to one of the doctors,

he sees 60-70 patients in a day. He is not a general practitioner

but specializes in antenatal cases and he has got regular

patients.      On    23rd    March,   2013,    he   had    noticed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                                 53</span>
 disproportionately    high   number      of    patients   who    came

complaining of breathing difficulties.        The other doctor is an

Obstetrician and Gynaecologist and stated that many newly

married couples had come to him in the last six years and many

pregnancies had ended up in abortion, sometimes reasons for

the same remained unexplained.           By implication, the doctor

intends to connect it to the gas leak.
</p>
<p id="p_143">
</p><p id="p_144">45. In the case of a past event that is alleged to have happened,

normally it is legally impermissible to rely upon a mere

suspicion. There should be cogent evidence to support such a

serious occurrence.    May be not by the standards of 'beyond

reasonable doubt' under the criminal jurisprudence but it should

be of such evidentiary value which in the normal course would

be sufficient to hold the appellant-company responsible for

tortuous liability or violation of the law and its consequences.

These are matters of serious consequences and cannot be

founded on surmises and conjectures. The various complaints or

the affidavits filed do not state in definite terms that the gas leak

was from appellant-company.        In fact, the doctor stated and

probably rightly so, that he did not have any means of

ascertaining as to whether the gas leaked from the appellant

company.    Admittedly, S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_61">IPC</a>OT is an industrial cluster within

which the appellant-company's plant is also located. It is also

now clear from the records before us that there are a large

number of industries, including ones categorized as 'red

industries' which emit different types of gases.          It is further

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                     54</span>
 undisputable that different kinds of gases can cause eye and

throat irritation and can lead to suffocation as well. The severity

of such health hazards can even be of a much higher grade by

release of other gases in the air.
</p>
<p id="p_145">
</p><p id="p_146">46. As    we   have   already    noticed,   the   District   Collector,

Thoothukudi had constituted a Committee to examine the

matter, in the proceedings dated 25th March, 2013 and for

conducting everyday audit/inspection at the industries such as

SPIC, TAC, Sterlite, Kilburn Chemicals, Madura Coats, Ramesh

Flowers, Nila Sea Food, DCW, IND Bharath Coastal Energen and

Loyal Textiles, amongst others.      This obviously means that all

these industries were suspected of having emitted gaseous

substances into air, in excess of the prescribed limits.        It was

expected of the Committee and the Respondent Board to place on

record before the Tribunal as to whether after the inspection or

collecting evidence, the finger pointed towards none else but the

appellant company. That certainly is not the case herein. Any of

the industries located at S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62">IPC</a>OT and surrounding areas could be

responsible for emission of obnoxious gases in the process of its

manufacturing activity.      Thus, the only question which the

authorities/Board was expected to answer and establish before

the Tribunal by cogent evidence was as to which one of these

large numbers of industries had emitted what gas and in

violation of the prescribed standards on the fateful day.       It can

be usefully noticed at this stage that even the Special Expert

Committee, appointed by the Tribunal, in its report dated 10th

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                     55</span>
 July, 2013 has stated that besides the appellant company there

are large and medium scale industries located in and around the

S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_63">IPC</a>OT area and has named the said industries, which were also

mentioned in the order of the District Magistrate. It noticed the

major industries in the red category, the emission sources and

the pollution load in terms of SO2 emission per tonne per day in

Annexure 'E' to the Report. Thus, there is no evidence, much

less cogent and reliable evidence, which could persuade this

Tribunal to accept the allegations of the Respondent Board as a

fact   rendering   the   appellant-company      solely   liable   for

consequential actions, much less its closure.


</p><p id="p_147">47. There are no medical records to show that the people had

actually suffered eye irritation, throat irritation and suffocation

on 23rd March, 2013 in the morning hours, as a result of release

of SO2. It is a mere assumption on the part of the doctors. Even

if we assume for the sake of arguments that people had suffered

as a result of release of obnoxious gases in the air, then also,

there has to be a definite link between the plant of the appellant

company at that relevant time and emission of excessive gases

from the said plant during that hour. This had to be established

by ocular, documentary and scientific data by collecting samples

of the stack and Ambient Air Quality at the relevant time, which

again has not been done in the present case. In fact, the Special

Expert Committee has observed in its report 'the cross wind

levels having an impact on ambient SO2 levels contributed by

nearby industries.'

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                   56</span>
</p><p id="p_148"> 48. Another aspect of this issue is that the wind direction at the

relevant time was found to be towards the villages. If the release

of excessive emission was from the appellant-company's plant

then after the release of excessive emission, it would have

affected the people living in the nearby areas as well.        The

villages from where the complaints have been received are stated

to be six to eight kilometres away from the plant of the appellant-

company. This is somewhat strange. One patent improbability in

regard to these complaints is that the impact of excessive

emissions because of higher mixture concentration would have

been much more serious in the surrounding areas than the far

flung areas located more than 6-8 kms away.          Admittedly, no

complaints from the vicinity, adjacent or within six kilometres of

appellant-company's premises, had been received.         Even this

reasoning creates a little doubt in the story put up by the

Respondent Board for closing the unit, particularly in face of the

allegation made by the appellant-company that the complaints

are engineered and motivated ones.
</p>
<p id="p_149">
</p><p id="p_150">49. On     the   cumulative    analysis   of   the    above   facts,

circumstances and evidence, we are of the considered view that

the alleged incident of leak or excessive emission of SO2 from the

premises of the appellant-company's plant is founded on a mere

suspicion and the allegation that it resulted in a health hazard is

based upon a mere apprehension or unfounded suspicion and is

certainly not supported by any cogent evidence. The Respondent

Board has certainly not placed before the Tribunal any study in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                  57</span>
 consonance with the scientific methodologies for the entire period

from 23rd March, 2013 to 29th March, 2013 to substantiate their

plea of excessive emission released by the appellant-company

resulting in serious health hazards to the residents.


</p><p id="p_151">50. Having noticed the factual matrix of the case, pleadings of

the parties and the Expert Committee reports, we shall now

proceed to discuss the merits or otherwise of the various

contentions raised before us in this matter.


EFFECT OF THE JUDGMENT OF SUPREME COURT DATED 2 ND
APRIL, 2013 IN THE CASE OF THE APPELLANT-COMPANY
ITSELF
</p><p id="p_152">51. As already noticed, the grant of consent to the appellant-

company by the Respondent Board under the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_64">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_65">Water Act</a> was challenged before the Madras High

Court and even the EC granted by the Ministry of Environment

and Forests was questioned in different Writ Petitions filed before

that Court. The Division Bench of the Madras High Court, by a

common judgment dated 28th September, 2010, had allowed and

disposed of the writ petition with the direction to the appellant-

company to close down its plant at Thoothukudi. This judgment

of the High Court was challenged in an appeal before the

Supreme Court by filing a Special Leave Petition. The Supreme

Court granted leave and all the related matters were heard by the

Supreme Court as Civil Appeal. One of the main grounds raised

against the appellant-company was that the unit was not located

25 km or more away from the ecological sensitive areas and this



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                                 58</span>
 was not in consonance with the guidelines issued. Thus, the

consent granted was not in accordance with the law. The EC had

not been granted to the appellant-company in accordance with

the provisions of the notification. The public hearing was made

mandatory vide the notification dated 10th April, 1997 while the

appellant-company had been granted EC on 16th January, 1995

in terms of the notification dated 7th January, 1994. The area of

the appellant-company was located in an industrial complex,

S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_66">IPC</a>OT, and it was at a similar distance from any ecologically

sensitive area as the other chemical and other industries in the

same area. In terms of environmental management of the plant,

it was contemplated that the industries will develop a green belt

of 250 metre width around the factory limits. In terms of the

guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,

the green belt could be of 25% of the plant area which the

appellant-company had provided. The last contention against the

appellant-company was that the plant of the appellant-company

had caused severe pollution in the area and it was recorded in

NEERI's report of 2005, submitted to the High Court and that

the ground water samples taken indicated heavy metals therein.

According to the appellant-company, it had corrected the

deficiencies in accordance with the reports of NEERI of 2005 and

2011.
</p>
<p id="p_153">
</p><p id="p_154">52. Thus, various contentions in regard to the activities of the

appellant-company were taken up before the Supreme Court,

including that it was causing air, water and environmental

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                                               59</span>
 pollution. The Supreme Court, as is evident from the referred

paragraphs of the judgment, clearly noticed that out of the 30

directions issued by the Respondent Board and the deficiencies

pointed out by NEERI and as was evident from the joint

inspection report, 29 directions had been complied with by the

appellant-company, and therefore, the order of the High Court

directing closure of the appellant-company's plant was liable to

be, and was in fact, set aside by the Supreme Court. The

consent, for some time, had not been renewed by the Respondent

Board, yet the appellant-company had continued with its

manufacturing activities. Considering the magnitude, capacity

and the prosperity of the appellant-company, the Supreme

Court, after considering various facets, more importantly the

possible pollution resulting from carrying on of its manufacturing

activities, while permitting it to carry on its commercial and

manufacturing activities, directed the appellant-company to pay

a compensation of Rs.100 crores for having polluted the

environment in the vicinity of the plant.
</p>
<p id="p_155">
</p><p id="p_156">53. The Supreme Court, while granting this relief to the

appellant, had clearly noticed that it was only setting aside the

direction of the High Court in its judgment under appeal and

made it clear that the judgment would not stand in the way of

the Respondent Board issuing any direction to the appellant-

company including the direction for closure of the plant in the

interest of protection of environment in accordance with law.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                                60</span>
</p><p id="p_157"> 54. As is evident from the above, the Supreme Court had taken

note of the respective contentions raised on behalf of the parties

in relation to environmental pollution, grant of consent and

environmental clearance given to the appellant-company. The

Supreme Court then proceeded to discuss and answer all the

issues, which findings of the Supreme Court attained finality,

except the specific leave granted therein. The doctrine of finality

has two purposes to serve - it should decide finally the rights

and obligations between the parties to a lis and, more

importantly, a public purpose i.e. to avoid multiplicity of

litigation. There should be an end to litigation by attaching

finality to the judgment of the courts which itself has attained

finality. Some issues cannot be permitted to be agitated or re-

agitated time and again. Such an approach would frustrate the

very basic rule of law and would encourage endless litigation.

Thus, the issues to the exclusion of the specific leave granted by

the Supreme Court itself must operate as quietus to its

conclusions and they ought not be re-agitated or re-argued

before any other forum after its adjudication by the highest court

of the land.
</p>
<p id="p_158">
</p><p id="p_159">55. It is also unambiguously clear and is an admitted position

that the incident of 23rd March, 2013 was mentioned to the

Supreme Court one day prior to the pronouncement of the

judgment of 2nd April, 2013. Despite such mentioning, the

Supreme Court proceeded to pronounce its judgment on all the

issues and did not pass any other order in regard to the events of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                                                 61</span>
 23rd March, 2013. For that purpose, it granted specific leave to

the Respondent Board to act in accordance with the law even

while giving it freedom to direct closure of the appellant

company's unit.        To that extent, these specific issues have

neither been argued, discussed nor adjudicated upon by the

Supreme Court in its judgment dated 2nd April, 2013. The

matters relating to all facets of environmental pollution and grant

of environmental clearance, as contended before the Supreme

Court, thus, would stand finally concluded by the judgment of

the Supreme Court and cannot be permitted to be re-agitated

before this Tribunal in the present appeal. The findings recorded

by the Supreme Court in its judgment dated 2nd April, 2013 are

binding on this Tribunal, and therefore, have to be followed and

would stare the parties in their face in relation to the conclusions

of facts and law both. The very material finding that has been

returned by the Supreme Court in the judgment of 2nd April,

2013 is that subject to deposit of Rs.100 crores, the appellant-

company has been permitted to continue its manufacturing

activities. This dictum of the Supreme Court would have to be

given due weightage by the Tribunal while determining the

present controversy within the limited jurisdiction carved out by

the judgment itself.
</p>
<p id="p_160">
OBJECTIONS TO THE MAINTAINABILITY OF THE PRESENT
APPEAL:
</p><p id="p_161">56. A 'statutory right to appeal' is a right which is provided

under a specific statute. Such statutory right to appeal is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                                                  62</span>
 controlled by the limitations imposed under that statute. Neither

expansion nor contraction of such a right is permissible. The

appeal has to be filed and dealt with in accordance with the

provisions of the statute providing for such right to appeal. This

is a known principle, but being a part of the procedural law, is

not free of exceptions. Exceptions could arise as a result of the

'doctrine of necessity' or the principle that 'none can be rendered

remediless'. The right to appeal has to be effective and

purposeful, though within the framework of the law governing

such right.
</p>
<p id="p_162">
</p><p id="p_163">57. The objection to the maintainability of the present appeal is

on the ground that an order passed under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_67">Section 31A</a> of the Air

Act by the Respondent Board is appealable to the appellate

authority constituted by the State Government under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_68">Section 31</a>

of the Air Act. Thus, a direct appeal against the order passed by

the Respondent Board in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_69">Section

31A</a> of the Air Act to the National Green Tribunal is not

contemplated. Reliance in this regard is also placed upon the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_70">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act. In terms of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_71">Section 31A</a>

of the Air Act, a Board may, in exercise of its powers and

performance of its functions under the Act, issue any directions

in writing to any person, officer or authority. Such person, officer

or authority shall be bound to comply with such directions under

the mandate of this provision. In the present case, vide its order

dated 29th March, 2013, the Respondent Board had issued

directions with regard to the closure of the appellant-company. It

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                                  63</span>
 further directed disconnection of water and electricity supplies to

the appellant-company's unit. <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_72">Section 31</a> of the Air Act empowers

any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Board to

prefer an appeal to such authority (the appellate authority) as

the State Government may think fit to constitute, within 30 days

from the date of communication of the order. <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_73">Section 31</a> of the

Air Act not only provides for an appeal against an order passed

by the Board, obviously including an order passed under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_74">Section

31A</a> of the Air Act, but also specifies that the appellate authority

shall consist of a single person or three persons, as the State

Government may think fit to appoint in terms of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_75">Section 31(2)</a> of

the Air Act. It is not in dispute before us that the State

Government of Tamil Nadu had issued a gazette notification

specifying that the appellate authority, in terms of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_76">Section 31</a> of

the Air Act, shall consist of three persons. This notification was

issued on 15th September, 2000 and the second notification was

issued on 24th January, 2012. Under this second notification, the

appellate authority was to consist of three persons out of which

only a single person had been appointed. The appellate authority

remained presided by a single Member, particularly during the

period of February, 2013 to May, 2013. During the pendency of

the present appeal, a notification (dated 8th May, 2013) had been

issued by the State Government of Tamil Nadu constituting an

appellate authority of three Members and it had started

functioning as such. In other words, right from February, 2013

till 8th May, 2013, the appellate authority contemplated under

<a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_77">Section 31</a> of the Air Act, had not been constituted in accordance

with law and was not functional. At this stage, it could be useful

to notice that in terms of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_78">Section 31</a> of the Air, it is the option of

the State Government whether to constitute the appellate

authority consisting of one Member or three Members but once it

exercises such an option and issues a notification, then the

appellate authority has to consist essentially of three Members,

as has been decided by the State Government, which should

dispose of the appeal in accordance with law. Of course the

appeal could not be filed before, heard and disposed of by the

appellate authority consisting of one Member, in face of the

notification of the State Government to constitute an appellate

authority consisting of three Members. This issue need not

detain us any further as it has been squarely answered by a

judgment of this Tribunal in the case of Gurdial Singh v. State of

Punjab [Application    No.4 of 2013 (THC)] decided on 30th April,

2013, where a 4-Member Bench of this Tribunal answered this

question as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_164">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">        "18. The Sub-clause (2) of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_79">Section 31</a> of the Air Act
        and Sub- clause (2) of <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_80">Section 28</a> of the Water Act
        make it explicit that the Appellate Authority shall
        consist of a single Member or three Members
        appointed by the State Government. It does not
        mention a two Member Authority to function as
        Appellate Authority. The intention of legislature
        appears that the decision can be taken either by a
        single Member or by three Members. If a decision is
        taken by single member authority, then it becomes
        final decision of the authority. If it is the decision of a
        three member authority, there is inherent provision
        to mitigate any difficulty arising due to difference of
        opinion, i.e. if one of the members disagrees the
        opinion of the rest of the two Members will prevail

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                                                      65</span>
         and can be treated as a majority decision of the
        Appellate Authority. This is not possible if only two
        members are appointed because if there is a
        divergence of opinion among them, there is no third
        member to overcome the difficulty. Under the above
        circumstances, the meeting of the authority attended
        by two members is one more reason as to why the
        impugned order is liable to be quashed."

<p id="p_165">58. Similar issue was also dealt with by the Supreme Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_81">A.P. Pollution Control Board v. Prof. M.V. Nayadu

(Retd</a>.) &amp; Others, (1999) 2 SCC 718, where it impressed upon the

Government to appoint expert and professional judges to hear

such matters together. The Court held, "In other words, this

Court not only contemplated a combination of a judge and

technical experts but also an appeal to the Supreme Court from

the Environmental Court."            Similarly in another case, the

Supreme Court directed that the Central Government should

constitute an authority under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_82">Section 3(3)</a> of the Environment

(Protection) Act, 1986, headed by a retired Judge of High Court

and it may have other Members - preferably with expertise in the

field of pollution control and environmental protection - to be

appointed by the Central Government. In the light of the above

judgment,   it   is   clear   that   the    appellate    authority,   once

constituted of judicial and expert Members, has to hear the cases

collectively and the strength of the notified appellate authority

cannot be altered contrary to the notification issued by the State

Government. The relevant question that calls for consideration of

the Tribunal is as to whether at the relevant point of time the

appellate   authority    had    been       constituted    by   the    State


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                                                         66</span>
 Government of Tamil Nadu; whether it was functional thereof;

and if it provided an effective, efficacious and purposeful right to

appeal to an aggrieved person from the order of the Respondent

Board. The order, in the present case, was passed on 29 th March,

2013 and admittedly, it was communicated to the appellant-

company immediately thereupon. Thus, the limitation of 30 days,

as prescribed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_83">Section 31</a> of the Air Act,

expired on 29th April, 2013. The appellate authority was not

consisting of three Members and admittedly was not functional

in the prescribed manner, right from February, 2013 to 8th May,

2013 when the notification was issued. The appellant-company

could not have availed of the right of statutory appeal in terms of

<a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_84">Section   31</a>     of   the   Air   Act   effectively,   efficaciously   and

purposefully. The very purpose of filing of appeal before the

appellate authority would have stood frustrated as the same

could neither be heard nor decided by a single Member of the

appellate authority, constituted by the State Government. In

order to avail of its right in accordance with the law, the

appellant-company filed an appeal with the aid of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_85">Section 31B</a> of

the Air Act before the Southern Bench of the NGT, Chennai, on

1st April, 2013 within the period of limitation. Thus, it can hardly

be stated that institution of the appeal as on 1st April, 2013 was

barred in law.
</p>
<p id="p_166">
</p><p id="p_167">59. The relevant date for considering such objection is the date

on which the right to file an appeal arises and the date on which




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                                                        67</span>
 the appeal is actually filed. The maintainability of the appeal has

to be essentially examined as on the date of filing the same.


</p><p id="p_168">60. The Supreme Court, in the cases of <a href="/doc/961006/" id="a_86">Rajahmundry Electric

Supply Company Ltd. v. A. Nageswara Rao &amp; Ors</a>. [AIR 1956 SC

213] and <a href="/doc/184405/" id="a_87">Zonal Manager, Central Bank of India v. Devi Ispat Ltd.

&amp; Ors</a>. [(2010) 11 SCC 186] has taken the view that the date of

presentation of the petition is the relevant date for examining the

maintainability of the petition as well as the scope of cause of

action. Subsequent events to the date of institution of the appeal

are not material considerations for adjudicating upon the

maintainability of the petition as well as to the cause of action

that had arisen in favour of the appellant. The law applicable as

on the date of institution of the application is the relevant law for

determining the question of maintainability. Certain events

subsequent thereto cannot alter the framework of such petition,

particularly in relation to the procedural law.


</p><p id="p_169">61. Cause of action is one of the factors which requires to be

examined by the Tribunal while dealing with such question. The

expression 'cause of action' has acquired a judicially settled

meaning. In the restricted sense, cause of action means the

circumstances forming infraction of the right or the intermediate

occasion for action. In wider sense, it means the necessary

conditions for maintenance of the suit, including not only the

infraction of the right, but the infraction coupled with the right

itself. The invocation of the right or the objection in regard to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                                                   68</span>
 maintainability    of   the   appeal   would   hardly   be   of   any

consequence. Herein, the notification, on the strength of which

objection in regard to maintainability is being raised, was issued

on 8th May, 2013 which itself indicates that a proper appellate

authority in accordance with the notification of the State

Government was not in existence when the cause of action in

favour of the appellant company arose or even on the date when

the appellant company was expected to avail or actually availed

of its right to file an appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_170">
</p><p id="p_171">62. Another aspect that would support the view that we are

taking is the doctrine of necessity. Wherever in the facts and

circumstances of the case, it is absolutely inevitable for a person

to exercise another right available to it under the statute and

where it is unable to exercise the preliminary right of appeal

because of non-existence or non-proper constitution of the

appellate authority and for its effective and efficacious exercise of

right, it becomes necessary for the appellant-company to invoke

another remedy, then the same would be permitted unless it was

so specifically barred by law governing the subject and the rights

of the parties. It was upon the appellant-company, particularly

keeping in view the emergent situation created by issuance of the

order dated 29th March, 2013, to avail of its right to appeal

without any undue delay and as was rightly done by it within two

days of the passing of the order. The unit of the appellant-

company had been directed to be shut down and the appellant-

company obviously could not have taken recourse to the remedy

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                                                   69</span>
 under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_88">Section 31</a> of the Air Act as the authority itself was not

properly constituted and was not functional. Besides the aid of

the doctrine of necessity, the appellant-company has also placed

its reliance on <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_89">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act. An appeal against the

order passed by the appellate authority in exercise of its powers

under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_90">Section 31</a> of the Air Act lies to the NGT in terms of

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_91">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act. In other words, the appellate order

passed by the proper authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_92">Section 31</a> of the Air Act is

appealable to the NGT in terms of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_93">Section 31B</a>. Thus, the NGT is

the appellate authority of the appellate authority constituted

under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_94">Section 31</a> of the Air Act by the State Government. The

appellant-company has itself given up its right of first appeal

before the appellate authority in view of the peculiar facts and

circumstances of the case. The respondents have placed reliance

upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/32597732/" id="a_95">Manohar Lal v.

Union of India</a> 2010 (11) SCC 557 where the Court had taken the

view that no higher authority in the hierarchy or an appellate or

revisional authority can exercise the power of the statutory

authority nor the superior authority can mortgage its wisdom

and direct the statutory authority to act in a particular manner.

Firstly this judgment on facts and law has no application to the

present case. Secondly, the non-constitution of the authority

itself would bring the present case outside the application of the

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Manohar Lal

(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_172">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                                                70</span>
</p><p id="p_173"> 63. We are unable to contribute ourselves to the contention

raised that a direction passed under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_96">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act is

not covered under the expression 'order' used in <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_97">Section 31</a> of

the Air Act. Any direction essentially would contain an element of

order as it requires and calls upon the parties to comply with the

same. 'Direction' itself means an order; an instruction how to

proceed, like the judge's direction to the jury, while 'Order' is

defined as a command, direction or instruction. This is how the

Black's    Law Dictionary,    9th   Edition,   refers   to   these   two

expressions. In other words, they can be used as synonyms. They

are not conflicting terms and one can be read into the other.

Thus, we find no substance in this contention raised on behalf of

the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_174">
</p><p id="p_175">64. An appellate authority, which is constituted under the

statute,    is   completely   distinct   and    different    from    an

administrative authority constituted otherwise even to deal with

adjudicatory proceedings. In the case of an appellate authority, it

must satisfy the existence de facto and must function de jure, in

accordance with law. If the appellate authority itself was not in

conformity with the notification, it cannot be said that it could

function in accordance with law without constitution of the three

Member appellate authority. The cumulative effect of this

discussion is that the objection in regard to maintainability is

without any substance and is liable to be rejected. In view of this

finding, it is not necessary for us to examine whether this could

be treated as a petition under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_98">Section 14</a> of the National Green

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                                                      71</span>
<a href="/doc/1850110/" id="a_99">Tribunal Act</a> (for short 'the NGT Act') even if it was not

OBJECTIONS IN REGARD TO THE TERMS OF REFERENCE IN
TERMS OF THE COURT ORDER DATED 12TH APRIL, 2013:
</p><p id="p_176">65. During the course of the arguments, an objection was also

raised on behalf of the respondents to the terms of reference (for

short the "TOR"), as contained in the order of the Court dated

12th April, 2013 and its impact on the report dated 28th April,

2013 submitted by the Expert Committee. Vide order dated 9th

April, 2013, the Southern Bench of the Tribunal had noticed that

Shri Vaiko, a senior politician and also the General Secretary of

the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) Party

had been actively campaigning for the closure of the unit of the

appellant-company and had effectively participated in the

proceedings against it before the Madras High Court. Treating

him to be an aggrieved person within the meaning of Section 16

of the NGT Act, it impleaded the said Shri Vaiko as Respondent

No.5. Even the Secretary of the National Trust for Clean

Environment was also impleaded as Respondent No.6. Thus, the

matter was hotly contested by all the respondents before the

Tribunal when it came up for hearing before the Bench on 12th

April, 2013 when the Tribunal passed the following order:

junior counsel for R-5 and R-6 in Appeal Nos. 22 and

senior could not be present due to some

hearing.</blockquote><p id="p_177">

clippings and photographs after serving copies to the
other side. The appellant-company has filed rejoinder
to the counters filed by the respondents.
</p><p id="p_179">      The Tribunal heard the arguments advanced by
all the counsel. From the submissions made, it could
be seen that the 1st respondent/Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board, issued a show cause notice to the
appellant/ Sterlite Industries (India)    Limited, on
24.03.2013 alleging that an incident of emission of
SO2 exceeding the permissible limit had taken place
in the plant and in violation of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_100">section 21</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_101">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and
the appellant/company was called upon to tender its
explanation within three days. Accordingly, a reply
was sent on 27.03.2013 and a supplemental reply was
also sent on 29.03.2013 by the appellant/company.
Not satisfied with the explanation tendered, the first
respondent/Board passed two orders, (1) with
directions to the appellant/company to close the unit
forthwith and (2) directing the Tamil Nadu Electricity
Board, Thoothukudi to disconnect the power supply.
While the matter stood thus, the appellant-company
preferred the appeals and all the respondents entered
appearance and filed      counters except the newly
impleaded National Trust for Clean Environment.
Heard the representing counsel except the newly
impleaded Trust.
</p><p id="p_180">      From the time of admission of the appeals, the
appellant/company is pressing for an interim relief for
stay of operations for the first respondent's order
under challenge. The matter was adjourned for filing
of counters by the respondents this day.           The
arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the
respondents and also the appellant-company are part
heard. At this juncture, it is pertinent to point out


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                                     73</span>
 that while the first respondent/Board, issued show
cause notice to the appellant/company alleging that
there was an incident of emission of SO2 in excess of
the prescribed limit in the early morning hours of
23.03.2013, the said allegation was flatly denied by
the appellant/company and hence a question would
arise whether there was an incidence of SO2 emission
in excess of permissible      limit on 23.03.2013 as
alleged by the first respondent/Board and if so what
were the consequences brought about? In so far as
the    question is concerned, the counsel for the
appellant-company and also for the respondents
except for     6th respondent have adduced their
contentions and they also relied on the documents
filed by them in support of their contentions and
hence, it remains to be decided. Next, it is contended
by the respondent's side that the machines and also
the instruments that are attached to the plant are not
working properly and this led to the emission of SO2
and caused all health hazards. In answer to his, it is
submitted by the senior counsel for the appellant-
company that all the machinery and instruments are
in perfect working condition. Hence, the Tribunal is of
the considered opinion that it is fit and proper and the
circumstances also warrant the appointment of an
Expert Committee:
</p><p id="p_181">     (1) To assess and appraise the actual working
condition of SO2 analyser, its current status, the

</p><p id="p_194">66. From the bare reading of the above order, it is clear that the

issue in regard to the closure and/or functioning of the plant of

the appellant-company was specifically raised. In fact, it was

contended on behalf of the respondents that the machines and

instruments that had been attached to the plant were not

working properly and this led to emission of SO2 and caused

health hazards. After noticing these rival contentions, the

Southern Bench of the Tribunal decided that the circumstances

of the case warranted appointment of an expert committee and

thus, made specific TOR in its order. The TOR were so wide as to

cover the working condition of the analyser, to measure the

emission of SO2, to oversee the calibration of the analyser and to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                                                75</span>
 find out the location, working condition and data record system

of the monitoring stations under the NAAQMS. These TOR were

specific but still wide enough to cover the necessary facets of the

working of the plant and thus, to bring on record the possibility

of any pollution resulting from the operation of the plant of the

appellant-company. The Expert Committee was to be duly

assisted by the representatives of the Respondent-Board as well

as that of the appellant-company. The report of the Committee

was filed in furtherance to this order, which we have already

discussed. The main contention raised is that the TOR did not

make a specific reference to the incident of 23rd March, 2013 and

as such the report of the Committee cannot be taken into

consideration and cannot form the basis of the decision of the

Tribunal. This argument is without any basis and, in fact, is

merely an after-thought on the part of the respondents. The

order was passed in the presence of the respondents, who were

vehemently contesting the application. It was for the respondents

to request the Southern Bench of the Tribunal to incorporate in

the order/TOR the incident of 23rd March, 2013 and its effects, if

any. For reasons best known to the respondents, this contention

was not raised. Thus, the respondents cannot be permitted to

take advantage of their own wrong and omission.


</p><p id="p_195">67. We have also noticed that the TOR were general in nature,

and therefore, would cover the entire functioning of the plant of

the appellant-company. It would bring before the Tribunal the

defects in the functioning of the machinery, tools, analysers, air

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                                                 76</span>
 monitoring stations and the general impact of emissions on the

health of the public. The general TOR, as directed by the

Southern Bench of the Tribunal, do not leave any scope for any

restriction or inability on the part of the Expert Committee to

bring out any deficiency in the appellant-company's unit on

record.     The   report   submitted   before   the   Tribunal   is

comprehensive and deals with all the specific issues that are

germane to the matter requiring adjudication in the present

application. Therefore, the objection raised by the respondent is

more of an after-thought and cannot, in any way, be a ground for

under clauses (a) to (j) of Sub-section (1).    The Board has to

perform functions which include such functions, as may be

prescribed or entrusted to the Board by the Central Government

or the State Government, as the case may be.        A general power

is vested in the Board to do such other things and to perform

such other acts, as it may think necessary for the proper

discharge of its functions and generally for the purpose of

carrying into effect the purposes of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_108">Air Act</a>.   In other words,

<p id="p_203">72. The bare reading of the above resolution shows that the

Respondent Board meets once a month. It was, in order to meet

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                                                  81</span>
 an emergency or environmental exigency that may arise all of a

sudden requiring passing of appropriate directions within the

ambit and scope of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_158">Section 33A</a> or <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_159">Section 31A</a> of the Water Act

and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_160">Air Act</a> respectively that delegation of powers to the

Chairman was made. In the preamble to the resolution, it has

been specifically stated that where urgency is necessary, and

such directions are required to be issued in the case of a

polluting industry contravening the provisions of the Acts, there

in order to avoid delay in taking appropriate action that the

powers and functions of the Respondent Board to issue

directions, as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_161">Section 33A</a> or <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_162">Section 31A</a> of

the respective Acts have been delegated to the Chairman of the

Respondent Board. In other words, the following are the essential

features which must exist before the Chairman can exercise the

power to issue directions of closure, etc.:-


</p><p id="p_204">  (a) There should be urgency and necessity to issue such

     directions;
</p>
<p id="p_205">  (b) The polluting industry must be contravening the provisions

     of either of or both the Acts; and lastly

</p><p id="p_206">  (c) Delay in taking action would frustrate the very object of the

     Acts and would be prejudicial to the environment.


</p><p id="p_207">73. These appear to be the in-built limitations of delegation of

powers to the Chairman to issue directions. When powers of

such wide magnitude and of serious consequences are delegated,

then the delegatee is expected to act with greater caution. Higher



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                                                 82</span>
 the element of authority delegated, greater is the degree of

caution required from such authority while exercising such

powers. The delegatee can exercise the powers within the

framework of the limitations to which such powers are subjected.

The delegatee would exercise the powers as if being exercised by

the delegator but the onus of responsibility, caution and

objectivity is, to a great extent, upon the former. Essentially the

authority delegated with the powers must eliminate the element

of arbitrariness in its process and directions. It is not only that

specifically prescribed limitations have relevant consideration but

also the object and spirit of delegation is a relevant factor. Such

delegation would squarely fall in the category of conditional

delegation. Conditional delegation of such functional powers

would depend upon the satisfaction of the delegator. It also

depends upon the objective facts that are to be reached before

the powers can be exercised. There is fine distinction between the

absolute power provided by legislation and the conditional

delegation of power in furtherance to a subordinate legislation.

Exercise of such powers is dependent upon the fulfilment of

certain conditions and the delegatee has to exercise such powers

within the authority, conditional or otherwise, as delegated. The

power of the Chairman to pass such directions like the impugned

order, can hardly be questioned. In terms of the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_163">Section 12(3B)</a> of the Water Act and <a href="/doc/1897355/" id="a_164">Section 15</a> of the Air Act, the

Respondent Board, as a matter of fact, has delegated its power to

pass directions, as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_165">Section 31A</a> of the Air


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                                                 83</span>
 Act and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_166">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. This delegation was in the

discretion of the Respondent Board and once such power of

delegation is exercised by the Respondent Board, the correctness

of vesting such powers in the Chairman of the Respondent Board

can hardly be open to question.           The resolution of the

Respondent Board dated 24th February, 1994 and as circulated

vide letter dated 11th March, 1994, thus, is a complete delegation

of powers in regard to the relevant provisions of the respective

Acts.
</p>
<p id="p_208">
</p><p id="p_209">74. Still the question that remains to be answered is whether

exercise of the power by the Chairman of the Respondent Board

was proper, free of vice of arbitrariness and rightly called for in

the facts and circumstances of the case. As already noticed, the

alleged incident of 23rd March, 2013 when SO2, in excess of the

prescribed parameters, is stated to have emanated from the

industrial plant of the appellant-company resulting in health

hazards to the residents of the villages located at 6-8 kms. from

the industrial premises of the appellant-company does not aspire

credence. We have discussed, in greater detail, the occurrence

and reliability of the allegations made against the appellant-

company separately in the later part of the judgment. We are

unable to contribute to the view of the respondents that

undoubtedly SO2 gas emanated in violation of the prescribed

parameters from the stacks of the unit of the appellant-company.

The various allegations made against the appellant-company

have not been substantiated by any scientific data. During the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                                                 84</span>
 course of hearings, it was even conceded before us that there

were no 84 instances of leakage of gas in violation of the

prescribed standards and the table shown in the reply filed by

the respondents only related to the period of calibration.


</p><p id="p_210">75. In light of these circumstances and the fact that the

complaints were uncertain in terms and based on mere suspicion

that gases might have leaked from the premises of the appellant-

company, their (complaints) reliability is doubtful. It is to be seen

whether these complaints provide a definite basis to the

Respondent-Board to pass such a serious direction ordering

closure of the industrial unit. The expression in the resolution

clearly points out that the industry should be a polluting

industry contravening the provisions of the Act. No data, much

less scientific data, has been placed on record to support this

aspect of the matter. Even if the complaints are read in their

entirety, they still mention that the gas "could have" leaked from

the    industrial   plant   of   the   appellant-company.     Still   the

apprehension indicated in these complaints is required to be

supported by proper scientific data or analytical report which

ought to have been taken immediately on the date of occurrence

or    immediately thereafter.     Firstly,   neither   any   supporting

documents whatsoever were filed on record nor any samples,

either from stack or of the Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) were

collected, to show that on 23rd/24th March, 2013 there were

excessive emissions from the plant of the appellant-company.

Secondly, it must have been shown that some urgency existed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                                                       85</span>
 which necessitated passing of such a direction. From the records

before us, it does not appear that even the Respondent Board

itself considered it a case of such an extreme urgency or

necessity. The incident is alleged to have occurred on 23rd March,

2013 but the appellant-company's plant was permitted to

continue its manufacturing activities till 29th March, 2013. The

Respondent Board was not expected to compromise with the

health of the public at large and wait for a week before it could

pass the order of closure in relation to the appellant-company. It

is nobody's case before us that the appellant-company carried on

its manufacturing activities in violation to the prescribed

parameters on 23rd of March 2013 or any subsequent day thereto

and the same is not supported by any analysis report. The

incident of 23rd March, 2013 has not been established by any

cogent evidence before the Tribunal. Moreover, neither the order

of the Respondent Board nor any record produced before us

showed that any emergency existed right from 23rd March to 29th

March, 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_211">
</p><p id="p_212">76. The impugned order dated 29th March, 2013 that has been

passed     by   the   Respondent   Board   did   not   refer   to   any

independent data or analytical report that would substantiate

the plea that the industry was leading to environmental

pollution. The technical part of the impugned order, we have

discussed separately, does not support the case of the Board any

further.
</p>
<p id="p_213">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                                                     86</span>
</p><p id="p_214"> 77. Another aspect which we must notice in relation to the

impugned order dated 29th March, 2013 is that the order

specifically states, "The Board after deep consideration of the

above factors and your reply to show cause notice, has taken a

serious view of the matter". This undoubtedly is a factually

incorrect statement of facts. It is undisputed before us that the

matter was never placed before the Respondent-Board pre or

post-passing of the order dated 29th March, 2013. Months have

gone by and there is no explanation on record before us as to

why the matter has not been placed before the Board for its

appropriate consideration. This by itself may not vitiate the order

but certainly is an indicator of callousness and undue haste with

which the order in question has been passed. An order of such

serious   consequences     does    deserve    better    attention   and

forethought at the hands of the authority vested with such

powers particularly where the authority decided to close any

industry while framing a trajectory for achieving the object of

preventing and controlling environmental pollution.


</p><p id="p_215">78. Any    of   the   reports,    whether    before    or   immediately

subsequent to the event of 23rd March, 2013 do not attribute

causing of air pollution to the plant of the appellant-company.


</p><p id="p_216">79. The cumulative effect of the above circumstances and

particularly the fact that the authority has mis-construed the

data, has acted on an unfounded suspicion and has considered

irrelevant matters, does to some extent, introduce an element of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                                                     87</span>
 arbitrariness in the process of passing of the impugned order

dated 29th March, 2013 itself. Thus, we are of the considered

view that the Chairman of the Board has not exercised his power

in an emergent situation where a necessity existed and recourse

to any regulatory mechanism was not possible, leaving no option

but to close the appellant company's unit. The order does suffer

from the vice of arbitrariness and thus, cannot be sustained.

<p id="p_217">
</p><p id="p_218">80. In the very opening part of the judgment, we have explained

that one of the principle questions that require determination by

the Tribunal in the facts of the present case is whether the

alleged incident of 23rd March, 2013 was a consequence of

calibration or leakage of gas in excess of the prescribed

parameters. To examine this aspect in its broader perspective, it

would be necessary to examine the manufacturing process of the

appellant-company along with the cause of the alleged incidents

of emission and what was its effect on the ambient air quality in

and around the premises of the appellant-company. The parties

to these proceedings have filed voluminous data, supporting

documents and reports to substantiate their respective pleas.

The Tribunal has analysed these records with reference to the

pleadings of the parties, more particularly in regard to the

incident of 23rd March, 2013 as a lot turns on that issue. The

 Tribunal has also minutely and critically examined the episodic

incidences of emission and health hazards complained of by the

Manufacturing Process and Sources of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)

</p><p id="p_220">81. The appellant company, as already noticed, is engaged in

manufacturing of copper cathodes and copper rods. These are

manufactured by smelting copper concentrate (copper ore)

containing 30% copper, 30% sulphur, 30% iron and balance of

other impurities. Copper concentrate with moisture along with

quartz and limestone is fed into smelter where pure oxygen is

injected. As a result of the reactions, the copper concentrate gets

mainly split into Matte (a mixture of sulphide having copper and

iron), Slag (containing iron silicate) and SO2 gas. The Matte is

transferred to Holding Furnace from where it is tapped

periodically from the bottom through a water cooled tap hole and

the Slag gets further separated out owing to differential density.

The Matte is further processed into Blister Copper and Ferro

Sand (0.7 to 1% copper) in two stages in a Convertor where in

the first stage 98.5% blister copper is obtained by removal of iron

slag and small quantity of trapped Sulphur. In the second stage,

remaining Sulphur is removed by oxidation. The Cleaning

Furnace further recovers the Copper left in the Ferro Sand and

subsequently Anode Furnace further refines Blister Copper by

oxidizing remaining Sulphur to produce Copper Anode (i.e.

copper of 99.7% purity). Finally Electro Refinery produces

Copper Cathode (copper of 99.9%) purity). In this entire

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">                                                                 89</span>
 manufacturing process of Copper, the Sulphur contained in the

copper concentrate is converted into SO2 primarily during the

Smelter operation followed by comparatively limited quantities of

SO2 during operation of Holding Furnace and Convertor.

</p><p id="p_221">82. Entire SO2 gas produced in Smelter, Convertor and other

Furnaces is collected and carried through ducts to two Sulphuric

Acid Plants (SAP-1 and SAP-2). The SO2 is then cleaned and

oxidized to sulphur-tri-oxide (SO3) using Vanadium Pentaoxide

catalyst. The SO3 is then absorbed in water to convert it into

sulphuric acid. The Sulphuric Acid Plants SAP-1 and SAP-2 are

of identical capacity and use same technology for conversion of

SO2 to sulphuric acid. The residual gas from the SAP Plant is

further treated in the Tail Gas Scrubber to meet the prescribed

norms and then emitted through the stacks into the atmosphere.

</p><p id="p_222">83. From the understanding of the entire manufacturing

process, it is evident that the possible sources of emission of SO2

are i) Stack emissions from Smelter, Convertor and other

Furnaces, ii) Stack emissions from SAP-1 and SAP-2, ii) Fugitive

emissions opening of all furnaces mouth and transfer of material

from one furnace to another, iii) Leakages from Ducts, and iv)

Effluent from Secondary Gas Scrubbers (SGS). To further

understand likely sources of excessive emission, it is placed on

record that of the total sulphur contents in the raw material;

almost 95.75% sulphur is fixed in SAP-1 and SAP-2 whereas

1.92% sulphur is fixed in Slag of Smelter and another 2.08%

sulphur is fixed in the cakes of Effluent Treatment Plant; thereby


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                                                                 90</span>
 fixing almost 99.7% of total sulphur contents. Remaining

sulphur amounting to 0.24 to 0.29% is released to the

atmosphere through the five stacks i.e., Smelter, SAP-1, SAP-2,

SGS-1 and SGS-2.
</p>
<p id="p_223">84. All the above sources of emission from the stacks have been

installed with online SO2 analyzers to continuously monitor the

concentration of SO2 in the Stack emissions. Each stack is

connected with one online analyzer to continuously monitor the

extent of SO2 being released into the atmosphere. The appellant

company uses three different types of online SO2 analyzers for

stack monitoring, which are: i). ABB make model AO2020

(LIMAS11) extraction type analyzer working on principle of UV

absorption integrated by Emersion Process Management installed

at the stack of SAP-1; ii). Rosemount make model MLT1

extraction type analyzer working on IR absorption principle

installed at Smelter and furnaces (ISA HVS); and iii) OPSIS make

model AR600 in situ type analyzer working on principle of open

path technology at the stack of SAP-2, SGS-1 and SGS-2.

</p><p id="p_224">85. The data collected by all the 5 online analyzers is

transferred to DCS within plant and a direct line from the online

analyzers of SAP-1 and SAP-2 to the CARE AIR Centre located in

the office of Respondent Board at Chennai. The software used is

as per the specifications of Respondent Board and is temper-

proof. The Respondent Board has prescribed consent limit for

SO2 emission in stacks as 477.53 PPM (equivalent to 1175

mg/m3) at tip of stacks and 80Âµg/m3 for the ambient air. It is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">                                                               91</span>
 important to note here that the online analyzers installed are of 3

types and each type of analyzer has different range of

measurement. The range of measurement of online analyzers is 0

to 500 ppm for analyzer at the stack of smelter, 0 to 1000 ppm

for the analyzer at the stack of SAP-1, 0 to 700 ppm for the

analyzer at the stack of SAP-2 and 0 to 5000 ppm for the

analyzers at the stack of SGS-1 and SGS-2. It is equally

important to note that OPSIS make online analyzers installed at

SAP-2, SGS-1 and SGS-2 stack requires calibration normally

once in a year whereas the other 2 online analyzers at SAP-1 and

ISA stacks require regular calibration in order to ensure the

quality of data collected by them. Such calibration checks are

also needed before restarting the smelter plant, when the plant

has been shut down either on account of scheduled maintenance

or minor unscheduled break-down.
</p>
<p id="p_225">Calibration v/s Emission of SO2

</p><p id="p_226">86. In order to understand the complexity of the problem, it is

essential to go into the finer details of calibration process.

Calibration is a comparison between measurements - one of

known magnitude or correctness made or set with one device and

another measurement made in as similar a way as possible with

a second device. The device with the known or assigned

correctness is called the standard. The second device is the unit

under test, test instrument, or any of the several other names for

the device being calibrated.

<p id="p_227">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                                                 92</span>
</p><p id="p_228"> 87. Instrument calibration is one of the primary processes used

to maintain instrument accuracy. Calibration is the process of

configuring an instrument to provide a value within an

acceptable range. Eliminating or minimizing factors that may

cause inaccurate measurements is a fundamental aspect of

instrumentation design. In the case on hand, the calibration

process generally involves using known concentration of the SO2

of one or more known values. The results are used to establish a

relationship between the observed values in the instrument and

the known values. The process in essence "teaches" the

instrument to produce results that are more accurate than those

that would occur otherwise. The instrument after calibration can

then provide more accurate results.
</p>
<p id="p_229">88. Here it is important to understand as to why the instrument

needs calibration on regular basis when it generally makes sense

that calibration is required for a new instrument in order to

ensure that the instrument is providing accurate indication or

output signal when it is installed. Therefore, the obvious

question is as to why it can't continue to provide indication

accurately as long as the instrument is operated properly. It is

known that instrument error can occur due to a variety of

factors:   drift,   environment,   electrical   supply,   addition   of

components to the output loop, process changes, etc. Since

calibration is performed by comparing or applying a known

signal to the instrument under test, errors can be detected by

performing a calibration. An error is the algebraic difference


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                                                     93</span>
 between the indication and the actual value of the measured

variable. Typical errors that occur include: Zero and Span errors

and these can be corrected by performing a calibration. The zero

adjustment is used to produce a parallel shift of the input-output

curve. The span adjustment is used to change the slope of the

input-output curve. Linearization error may be corrected, if the

instrument has a linearization adjustment. If the magnitude of

the nonlinear error is unacceptable and it cannot be adjusted,

the instrument must be replaced. To detect and correct the

instrument error, periodic calibrations are essential. Even if a

periodic calibration reveals the instrument is perfect and no

adjustment is required, one would not know the same unless

calibration is performed. Even if adjustments are not required for

several consecutive calibrations, one still needs to perform the

calibration check at the next scheduled due date to over-rule the

possibility of erroneous data. Periodic calibrations at scheduled

intervals as provided by the manufacturer to specific tolerances

using approved procedures are an important element of any

quality control system.
</p>
<p id="p_230">89. Calibration of an instrument may be called for at the time of

</p><p id="p_231">i) installation of a new instrument; ii) after an instrument has

been repaired or modified; iii) when a specified time period has

elapsed; iv) when a specified usage (operating hours) has elapsed;

</p><p id="p_232">v) before and/or after a critical measurement; vi) after an event,

for example after smelter has been stopped for scheduled or

unscheduled    maintenance    or   an   instrument   has   had   a

 shock, vibration, or has been exposed to an adverse condition

which potentially may have put it out of calibration or damaged

it; v) sudden changes in weather; and vi) whenever observations

appear questionable or instrument indications do not match the

output of surrogate instruments. In general, calibration is often

regarded as including the process of adjusting the output or

indication on a measurement instrument to agree with value of

the applied standard, within a specified accuracy.

</p><p id="p_233">90. From the records before us, it is seen that the industry

carries out calibration for SAP-1 and ISA online analyzer on

regular basis, whereas SAP-2, SGS-1 and SGS-2 online analyzers

are calibrated on yearly basis as per the Manufacturer's

recommendations. Apart from the regular schedule, the online

analyzers of ISA and SAP-I are also calibrated pursuant to any

process shutdown/restart as a result of any break-down. For

calibration, typically a gas having a higher known concentration

is fed into analyzer directly, without routing such gas through

stack and it is tested whether the analyzer is capable of reading

accurate value as per the known concentration. In the instant

case, the online analyzers are calibrated using SO2 cylinders of

concentrations of 490 ppm, 1000 ppm or 4000 ppm depending

on availability of cylinders at appellant company and the

duration of calibration varies from 30 minutes to 4-5 hours or

more depending upon other preventive maintenance activities

taken up along with the calibration. There are also occasions

when multiple calibrations in a day are carried out owing to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                                               95</span>
 maintenance    problem    because    the   online    analyzer   needs

calibration every time the plant is shut down for maintenance.

</p><p id="p_234">91. The Expert Committee appointed by NGT Southern Zonal

Bench oversaw the calibration exercise of online analyzers on

23rd April, 2013. According to appellant company, three types of

processes are adopted for calibration i.e. (i) single point

calibration; (ii) two point calibration; and (iii) multi-point

calibration. In all the above calibration procedures zero is

checked using zero-grade Nitrogen gas into analyzer and in single

point calibration 490 Â±10 ppm SO2 is used whereas in two point

calibration, 490 Â±10 ppm and 1000 Â±10 ppm SO2 is used while in

multi-point calibration, 4000 Â±10 ppm, SO2 is used for full range

of calibration. Calibration of all the three types of online

analyzers was carried out in presence of the committee members.

The entire calibration time for SAP-1 was 19 minutes and 64

minutes for online analyzer to check for maximum measurement.

Thus, the time required for one calibration is around 83 minutes.

If the plant has to be shut down again for maintenance, the next

calibration is required, which may take more time and thus, time

required for calibration could significantly vary.

</p><p id="p_235">92. Another important aspect pertains to the fact that although,

the online analyzer for SAP-1 has a maximum range of recording

upto 1000 ppm; however, the data presented in various reports

is shown upto 1123 ppm. It was brought on record that although

the online analyzer for SAP-1, has a maximum measurement

range of 1000 ppm, however, the instrument has small leverage


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                                                   96</span>
 and the maximum which this analyzer can record is 1123 ppm.

It was pointed out that SAP-1 online analyzer calibration for

1000 ppm based on 20 mA output and 1125 ppm based on 22

mA output is carried out using linearity check-up.

</p><p id="p_236">93. In the present matter, as per stand of Respondent Board, in

the early morning of 23rd March, 2013, there were complaints of

eye irritation and throat suffocation from the New Colony, Keela

Shanmugapuram and other areas of Thoothukudi town. In

response to the complaints, District Environmental Engineer,

Respondent Board, Thoothukudi and other officials namely

Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories, Thoothukudi and Sub-

Divisional Magistrate and Revenue Division Officer, Thoothukudi

inspected the Appellant-company's plant premises to check the

pollution status. Finally on 29th March, 2013, Respondent Board

issued closure order to the appellant company wherein the main

reason is stated to be values of excessive emission that were

reflected from the online analyzer on 23rd March, 2013 between

2.15 a.m. to 2.45 a.m. ranging from 2103.23 mg/m3 to 2939.55

mg/m3 (803.5 ppm to 1123.6 ppm) and 1767.65 mg/m3 to

2941.12 mg/m3 (675.3 PPM to 1123.6 PPM) between 9.15 a.m.

and 11.15 a.m. on the same day, as against the stipulated

emission standards of 1250 mg/m3 (477.53 ppm) prescribed by

the MoEF Gazette Notification No 248 dated 07th May, 2008.

</p><p id="p_237">94. The appellant company contended that the plant was taken

for maintenance shut down around 3.20 a.m. on March 21, 2013

to attend certain repairs and was taken for start-up at around


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                                              97</span>
 2.00-2.45 a.m. on March 23, 2013 and during start up process,

the online analyzer for SAP-1 was taken up for calibration as

required in the standard prescribed procedure of the instrument.

It is further contended that on the same day between 9.15 a.m.

and 11.15 a.m., calibration exercise was repeated before the

inspecting team of officials to demonstrate the abnormal values

observed in the online analyzer of SAP-1. The higher values as

recorded in the online analyzer of SAP-1, were due to calibration

process and was a spam gas and not due to excessive emission

as the emission source was dis-connected from the Analyzer

during calibration. The observed values during such repeated

calibration exercise were in the range of 675 ppm (equivalent to

1767 mg/m3) to 1123 ppm (equivalent to 2940 mg/m3).

</p><p id="p_238">95. From the further averment made by the Respondent Board

it is evident that the entire premise on which they arrived at the

conclusion that the appellant company is releasing excessive

emission relates to the online analyzer data in respect of stack of

SAP-1. The SAP-1 is alleged to have emitted high SO2 on 23rd

March, 2013 on two occasions as mentioned earlier. The

appellant company contended that the two sulphuric acid plants

are designed in such a way that SAP-1 and SAP-2 are getting

entire SO2 from copper smelter from a common duct and is then

divided equally into two sulphuric acid plants of similar capacity

and technology. From the corresponding data of both the online

analyzers of SAP-1 and SAP-2, it is argued that the recorded data

of emission from both the online analyzers is almost at the same


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                                                                 98</span>
 level except the time period when calibration of the online

analyzer of SAP-1 is carried out and it is also argued that the

same data is also sent online to CARE AIR Centre of Respondent

Board at Chennai.
</p>
<p id="p_239">96. Thus, it is clear that the higher values recorded by the

SAP-1 analyzer is due to calibration and not due to excessive

emission.
</p>
<p id="p_240">Episodic Incidences of Emission

</p><p id="p_241">97. During   the    course   of   arguments,   Respondent   Board

submitted that the excess emission was not only on two

occasions on 23rd March, 2013 but in fact, based on past

available data of online analyzer of SAP-1, 84 such incidences

were reported based on analysis of data for every 15 minutes

interval between the period from October, 2012 to March, 2013

on 7 occasions. These are: on 17th October, 2012, between 13.30

and 14.00 hrs and 18.15 and 20.45 hrs, for about 3 hrs 30, 14

incidences with reported values of SO2 between 694.5 and

1123.5 ppm, on 26th October, 2012 to 27th October, 2012,

between 20.15 hrs and 01.00 hr, for 5 hrs, 20 incidences with

reported values of SO2 between 527.0 and 1123.4 ppm, on 24th

November, 2012, between 14.15 to 17.00, for 3 hrs, 12

incidences with reported values of SO2 between 554.8 and 1123.5

ppm, on 1st December, 2012 to 2nd December, 2012, between

21.45 to 01.15 hrs, for 3 hrs 45 minutes, 15 incidences with

reported values of SO2 between 598.4 and 1123.1 ppm, on 21st

December, 2012 between 16.45 to 19.30, for 2 hrs, 8 incidences


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                                               99</span>
 with reported values of SO2 between 504.5 and 1122.3 ppm, on

16th January, 2013, between 08.15 and 8.45, for 45 minutes, 3

incidences with reported values of SO2 between 583.0 and

1082.7 ppm, on 23rd March, 2013, between 02.15 and 02.45 and

09.15 and 11.15 hrs, for 3 hrs, 12 incidences with reported

values of SO2 between 675.3 and 1123.6 ppm.
</p>
<p id="p_242">98. However, the appellant company again relied on the

emission data recorded in respect of online analyzers of SAP-1

and SAP-2 to make the point that only during calibration in

respect of SAP-1 online analyzer, higher emission is recorded

whereas for the same time period, reading of online analyzer for

SAP-2, which has the same supply source for gases, indicated

values in permissible range. Since the SAP-2 emission values as

recorded at CARE AIR Centre, Chennai on all the said 84

occasions is normal, there is no reason why emissions from SAP-

1 should be different from SAP-2 on the alleged calibration days.

In this context, Respondent Board also placed reliance on

analysis of graphical data representation of the above reported

84 incidences at 15 minutes interval. The contention of

Respondent Board pertained to the fact that calibration normally

takes approximately 20 minutes whereas in all these incidences,

the duration of the event runs into few hours. The Respondent

Board contested that during calibration, the online analyzer is

fed with very high known concentration of SO2 and this leads to

sudden spurt in the graphical presentation of emission data at

shorter intervals and thus, the graph should reflect sudden


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                                               100</span>
 higher concentration of SO2 that was fed into the online analyzer.

These graphs were prepared during examination by the Expert

Committee appointed by NGT, Southern Bench. The appellant

company contended that during calibration there would be

gradual increase in SO2 release as only very small quantity is fed

into the analyzer at the ground level and it takes a while for the

gases to reach the online analyzer at the top of the stack and

therefore, would be reflected as gradual increase in the graphs

and hence contention of Respondent Board that all the values

exceeding the limits are due to emission and not calibration is

incorrect. As further contended by the appellant company, the

calibration may continue for longer time due to maintenance and

hence cannot be taken as firm evidence to establish that all the

events when the higher values recorded from SAP-1 at CARE AIR

Centre were due to emission and not due to calibration.       It is

pertinent to note that not a single incidence of excessive emission

of SO2 is reported from the historical data of SAP-2 stack online

analyser. Even assuming that excessive emission took place in

SAP-1 owing to malfunctioning in this plant, the question that

arises for consideration is why malfunctioning only took place in

SAP-1 as against SAP-2. Equally important is the fact that even

if such excessive emission episodes were occurring, not a single

point data of ambient air quality from any of the stations have

shown exceedence in permissible levels of SO2.

</p><p id="p_243">99. From the discussion made above, it is clear that the

episodic incidences of emission from SAP-1 in view of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                                                                101</span>
 corresponding data of emission recorded at SAP-2 and also the

fact that source of supply to both SAP-1 and SAP-2 online

analyzer is connected to the same duct, no merit is observed in

the contention of Respondent Board. The contention of the

Respondent Board regarding graphical interpretation of episodic

incidences of emission from SAP-1 online analyzer also does not

satisfy on merits in view of the discussion made above.

Ambient Air Quality Monitoring

</p><p id="p_244">100. Air pollutants are added in the atmosphere from variety of

sources that change the composition of atmosphere and affect

the biotic environment. The concentration of air pollutants

depend not only on the quantities that are emitted from air

pollution sources but also on the ability of the atmosphere to

either absorb or disperse these emissions. The air pollution

concentration vary spatially and temporarily causing the air

pollution pattern to change with different locations and time due

to changes in meteorological and topographical condition. The

sources of air pollutants include vehicles, industries, domestic

sources and natural sources. In order to ensure the air quality

within stipulated standards, ambient air quality monitoring is

made mandatory for the polluting industries around their plants.

Ambient air quality monitoring programmes are needed to

determine the existing quality of air and evaluation of the

effectiveness of pollution control programmes.

</p><p id="p_245">101. Any air quality monitoring network thus, involves selection

of pollutants to be monitored, selection of locations, frequency,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                                                              102</span>
 duration of sampling, sampling techniques, infrastructural

facilities, man power and operation and maintenance. The

network design also depends upon the type of pollutants in the

atmosphere through various common sources, called common air

pollutants, such as Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter

(RSPM), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), and

Carbon Monoxide (CO) etc. Air pollutants show short term,

seasonal and long term variations. Atmospheric conditions

determine the fate of the air pollutants after their release into the

atmosphere. The mean transport wind velocity, turbulence and

mass diffusion are three important and dominant mechanisms in

the dispersal of air pollutants. Meteorological conditions play a

major role in monitoring ambient air quality. The wind speed and

direction play a major role in dispersion of air pollutants. The

wind direction is the measurement of direction from which the

wind is blowing, measured in points of compass viz. North,

South, East, West or in Azimuth degrees. Wind direction has an

important role in distributing and dispersing pollutants from

stationary and mobile sources in horizontally long downwind

areas. The wind speed is the measure of horizontal motion of

wind relative to the surface of earth per unit time. The effect of

wind speed on air pollution is two-fold. It determines the travel

time from a source to a given receptor while on the other causes

dilution of pollutants in downwind direction. The stronger the

wind, the greater will be the dissipation and dilution of

pollutants emitted. Knowledge of the frequency distribution of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                                                                  103</span>
 wind direction as well as wind speed is essential for accurate

estimation of the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. The

frequency distribution of wind speed and direction varies

considerably from month to month. Air pollutants show diurnal

variations in their levels. During the daytime, solar heating

causes maximum turbulence and strongest vertical motions.

This causes the maximum amount of momentum exchange

between the various levels in the atmosphere. On clear nights

with light winds, heat is radiated from the Earth's surface

resulting in cooling of the ground and air adjacent to it. This

results in extreme stability of the atmosphere near the Earth's

surface. Under these conditions turbulence is at a minimum and

thus, air pollution dispersion is also minimal. More calm the

conditions during winter, higher are levels of air pollution. The

concentration of pollutants is maximum in winter months and is

low   during   summer   and   monsoon     months.   A   plausible

explanation for these results may be found by examining

meteorological conditions. The general meteorology during the

winter is dominated by high pressure causing increased

atmospheric stability, which in turn allows for less general

circulation and thus, more stagnant air masses. Stagnant air

masses allow more accumulation of pollutants in any given area.

During the winter, average mixing height is lower as compared to

other seasons and atmospheric dispersion is typically at a

minimum and therefore, the pollutants will not be as widely

dispersed. During the summer months, the average mixing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                                              104</span>
 height is typically at its highest resulting in increased mixing

through a greater volume of the troposphere, and hence lower

pollutant concentrations. The monsoons result in large amount

of precipitation, high wind velocities and changes in general wind

direction. The large amounts of precipitation reduce atmospheric

pollution via associated wet deposition processes. Further wind

velocities will allow for pollutant transport away from sources,

increase mixing processes and the winds coming from the marine

environment will have less background concentrations than that

of continental air masses. The strong and medium wind in the

coastal areas during summer and monsoon season creates

turbulent conditions and local disturbances in the environment

which causes fast dispersion of air pollutants. Therefore,

Tuticorin area, where the appellant-company is located, being a

coastal area will experience fast dispersion of air pollutants in

the nearby areas and by the time the same reaches too far off

areas, its impact will become negligible.      During monsoon,

frequent rains washes down the air borne particulates and other

pollutants generated and dispersed from the sources in the

environment, therefore, the period from July to September is

cleaner period in the year.

pertinent to observe that the SO2 emission can cause eye

 quality data for various stations provides no such trend and

rather on all occasions, the values are well within the permissible

excessive emissions when compared with air quality data

recorded for preceding or successive days also provides no such

inference that the values are varying significantly. To this, the

contention put forward on behalf of the Respondent Board that

since these values are on 24-hour basis and, therefore, the

incidences of excessive emission have been averaged out and to

draw any such inference, air quality data recorded at shorter

interval would be relevant. In this context, ambient air quality at

three locations under National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring

higher values above the prescribed standard were recorded by

any of the monitoring stations. In fact, the ambient levels of SO2

 courts, particularly the superior courts in India are vested with

wide powers, especially in terms of Articles 32 and 226 of the

Constitution of India to deal with issues relating to the

fundamental rights of the persons. The courts, in fact, can even

impose exemplary damages against the polluter. Proper and

healthy environment enables people to enjoy a quality life which

is the essence of the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_177">Article 21.</a> The State

and the citizens are under a fundamental obligation to protect

and improve the environment including forests, lakes, rivers,

wild life and to have compassion for living creatures. Right to

have living atmosphere congenial to human existence is a right to

life. The State has a duty in that behalf and to shed its

extravagant unbridled sovereign power and to forge in its policy

to maintain ecological balance and hygienic environment.        The

power to issue directions and other powers should be exercised

by the State to effectuate and further the goals of approved

scheme, zonal plans, etc. The hazards to health and environment

of not only the persons residing in illegal colonisations but of the

entire town as well as the provisions and schemes of the relevant

Acts have to be taken into consideration. The most vital

necessities, namely air, water and soil having regard to the right

to life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_178">Article 21</a> cannot be permitted to be misused or

polluted so as to reduce the quality of life of others. Risk of harm

to the environment or to human health is to be decided in public

interest, according to a "reasonable person's" test. Life, public

health and ecology have priority over unemployment and loss of

 revenue. It is often said that development and protection of

environment are not enemies but are two sides of the same coin.

If without degrading the environment or by minimising the

adverse effects thereupon by applying stringent safeguards, it is

possible to carry on developmental activities applying the

principle   of    sustainable    development,     in     that   eventuality,

development has to go on because one cannot lose sight of the

need for development of industry, irrigation resources, power

projects, etc. including the need to improve employment

opportunities and the generation of revenue. A balance has to be

struck. Courts have exercised the power of imposing exemplary

damages     against      the   pollutants   in   order    to    protect   the

environment and to restore the damage done to the environment

as well. In fact, even the disturbance in the environment by

undesirable sound of various kinds, amounts to noise pollution.

It is a shadowy public enemy whose growing public menace has

increased    in    the    modern     age    of   industrialisation        and

technological advancement. Noise has become one of the major

pollutants and has serious effects on human health. Consistent

judicial opinion in India has recognised the right to live in

freedom from noise pollution as a fundamental right also,

guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_182">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Thus, the right

of an individual to healthy and clean environment including air,

water,    soil     and   noise-free      environment      is    of     paramount

consideration and it is impermissible to cause environmental

pollution    and     particularly       in   violation   of     the    prescribed

standards. Since the different facets of environment are relatable

to life and human rights and concern a person's liberty, it is

necessary that resources are utilised in a planned manner.

Wherever industrialisation has an impact on utilisation of

essential resources like air, water and soil and results in

irreversible       damage     to    environment,         then     it       may     be

impermissible to utilise these resources in that fashion. In the

recent times, there has been accelerated degradation of the

environment,        primarily      on    account    of    lack        of   effective

enforcement of laws and non-compliance with the statutory

norms. Concentrated industrialisation in some pockets has been

the other reason for enhanced damage to the environment. It

emerges from the desire of the people to operate from the areas

where the industry presently exists. [ References: <a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_183">Subhash

<p id="p_282">114. The right to development itself cannot be treated as a mere

right to economic betterment or cannot be limited as a misnomer

to simple construction activities. It encompasses much more

than economic well-being and includes within its definition the

guarantee of fundamental human rights. It includes the whole

spectrum of civil, cultural, economic, political and social process,

for the improvement of people's well-being and realisation of their

full potential. It is an integral part of human rights. Of course,

development is the essence of any pragmatic and progressive

society. But essentially,      development besides        being   inter-

generational, must be balanced to its ecology and environment.

Sustainable development means that the richness of the earth's

bio-diversity would be conserved for future generations by greatly

slowing or if possible halting extinctions, habitat and ecosystem

destruction, and also by not risking significant alterations of the

global environment that might - by an increase in sea level or

changing rainfall and vegetation patterns or increasing ultraviolet

radiation   -   alter   the   opportunities   available    for    future

generations. Sustainable development has been defined in many

 ways but the most frequently quoted definition is from the

Brundtland Report which states as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">          "Sustainable development is development that meets the
     needs of the present without compromising the ability of
     future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within
     it two key concepts:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">               ï· The concept of needs, in particular the essential
                 needs of the world's poor, to which overriding
                 priority should be given; and
               ï· The idea of limitations imposed by the state of
                 technology and social organisation on the
                 environment's ability to meet present and future
                 needs."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">115. The earlier school of thought was that development and

ecology are opposed to each other but with the passage of time

and development of law, this concept has undergone tremendous

change and is no longer acceptable. Now operates the principle of

sustainable         development.      It   takes    within    its    ambit       the

application of 'principle of proportionality' and the 'precautionary

principle'.        In   other   words,     one     must,     while    promoting

development, not only ensure that no substantial damage is

caused to the environment but also take such preventive

measures which would ensure that no irretrievable damage to

the environment, even in future, is caused. All these principles

have to be examined and applied on the touch stone of

"reasonable person's test", as afore-stated. Where the principle of

proportionality introduces prudent mind's reasonableness in

relation      to    development      vis-a-vis     environment,       there      the

precautionary           principle   can    be   explained    to     say   that    it

contemplates that an activity which poses danger and threat to

 the environment is to be prevented since prevention is better

than cure.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_283">116. While applying the concept of sustainable development, one

has to keep in mind the "principle of proportionality" based on

the concept of balance. It is an exercise in which courts or

tribunals have to balance the priorities of development on the

one hand and environmental protection on the other. So

sustainable development should also mean the type or extent of

development that can take place and which can be sustained by

nature/ecology with or without mitigation. In these matters, the

required standard now is that the risk of harm to the

environment or to human health is to be decided in public

interest, according to a 'reasonable person's test'. [Refer:

<p id="p_284">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">                                                               120</span>
</p><p id="p_285">           "228.     I   have   referred    to    the   aforesaid
          pronouncements only to highlight that this Court
          has emphasized on striking a balance between the
          ecology and environment on one hand and the
          projects of public utility on the other. The trend of
          authorities is that a delicate balance has to be
          struck between the ecological impact and
          development. The other principle that has been
          ingrained is that if a project is beneficial for the
          larger public, inconvenience to smaller number of
          people is to be accepted. It has to be respectfully
          accepted as a proposition of law that individual
          interest or, for that matter, smaller public interest
          must yield to the larger public interest.
</p><p id="p_286">          Inconvenience of some should be bypassed for a
          larger interest or cause of the society. But, a
          pregnant one, the present case really does not fall
          within the four corners of that principle. It is not a
          case of the land oustees. It is not a case of "some
          inconvenience". It is not comparable to the loss
          caused to property. I have already emphasized
          upon the concept of living with the borrowed time of
          the future generation which essentially means not
          to ignore the inter-generational interests. Needless
          to emphasize, the dire need of the present society
          has to be treated with urgency, but, the said
          urgency cannot be conferred with absolute
          supremacy over life. Ouster from land or
          deprivation of some benefit of different nature
          relatively would come within the compartment of
          smaller public interest or certain inconveniences.
          But when it touches the very atom of life, which is
          the dearest and noblest possession of every person,
          it becomes the obligation of the constitutional
          courts to see how the delicate balance has been
          struck and can remain in a continuum in a
          sustained position. To elaborate, unless adequate
          care, caution and monitoring at every stage is done
          and there is constant vigil, life of "some" can be in
          danger. That will be totally shattering of the
          constitutional     guarantee      enshrined     under

<p id="p_291">120. Precautionary principle is one of the most important

concepts of sustainable development. This principle essentially

has the element of prevention as well as prohibition. In order to

protect the environment, it may become necessary to take some

preventive measures as well as to prohibit certain activities.

These decisions should be based on best possible scientific

information and analysis of risks. Precautionary measures may

still have to be taken where there is uncertainty but potential

risk exists. Ecological impact should be given paramount

consideration, particularly when the end result would be

irreversible. The decision making authority should assess the

records and conclude whether it was a case of directing

precautionary and preventive measures to be taken or that the

information on which it has to reach a determination is

inadequate. Informed decision is the essence of a preventive or a

prohibitory decision. The principle of direction thereunder

involves the anticipation of environmental harm and taking

measures to avoid it or to choose the least environmentally

harmful   activity   which   is   based   on   scientific   certainty.

Environmental protection should not only aim at protecting

health, property and economic interest but also the environment

for its own sake. It is said that inadequacies of science is the

basis that has led to change from an 'assimilating impact

principle' to 'precautionary principle'. Availability of scientific

 data is one of the most essential features of environmental

adjudication. The precautionary principle was stated in <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_200">Article 7</a>

of   the       Bergen    Ministerial   Declaration   on   Sustainable

Development in the ECE Region, May, 1990, as incorporated in

      degradation."

Welfare Forum v. Union of India</a> (AIR 1996 SC 2715) recognised

the precautionary principle and explained it as follows:

of invocation of precautionary principle as under:

     ecological threat in regard to carrying out of an activity or

authority, upon taking an objective approach, could take

recourse to and pass directives under the precautionary and

authorities concerned to adopt a balanced and pragmatic

approach to ensure environmental protection while permitting

sustainable development.

<p id="p_295">124. It will not only be expected of but shall be an obligation on

the decision making authority to identify sources of pollution as

well as their impact on public health or environment. It must be

understood    that   every   direction    under   the   precautionary

principle is not a punitive action in its content and effect. These

are two different legal connotations which operate in their own

respective fields. Precaution in contradistinction to punitive

action is an anticipated action and is futuristic.

something     dangerous,     unpleasant     or    inconvenient   from

happening. To put it simply, it is a prudent foresight, while a

'punitive' action is one involving or inflicting punishment. It has

an element of something that has already occurred.

wrong done to environment and for its restoration thereto.

Therefore, there must be a nexus between befalling of an event,

or its likelihood thereof, and its pollution source and the injury

apprehended or caused. All these ingredients must be supported

by   reasonable   scientific   data,   especially   in   the   case   of

precautionary principle.

<p id="p_302"> The precautionary Principle replaces the Assimilative
Capacity principle:
</p>
<p id="p_303">32. A basic shift in the approach to environmental
protection occurred initially between 1972 and 1982.
Earlier the concept was based on the 'assimilative
capacity rule as revealed from Principle 6 of the
Stockholm Declaration of the U.N. Conference on
Human Environment, 1972. The said principle
assumed that science could provide policy-makers
with the information and means necessary to avoid
encroaching upon the capacity of the environment to
assimilate impacts and it presumed that relevant
technical expertise would be available when
environmental harm was predicted and there would
be sufficient time to act in order to avoid such harm.
But in the 11th principle of the U.N. General
Assembly Resolution on World Charter for Nature,
1982, the emphasis shifted to the 'precautionary
Principle', and this was reiterated in the Rio
Conference of 1992 in its Principle 15 which reads as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_304">Principle 15: In order to protect the environment, the
precautionary approach shall be widely applied by
States according to their capabilities. Where there are
threats of serious or irreversible damage; lack of full
scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for
proposing cost-effective measures to prevent
environmental degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_305">33. In regard to the cause for the emergence of this
principle, Chairman Barton, in the article earlier
referred to in Vol. 22, Harv. Envtt. L. Rev. (1998) P.
509 at (p. 547) says:
</p>
<p id="p_306">There is nothing to prevent decision makers from
assessing the record and concluding there is
inadequate information on which to reach a
determination. If it is not possible to make a decision
with "some" confidence, then it makes sense to err on
the side of caution and prevent activities that may
cause serious or irreversible harm. An informed
decision can be made at a later stage when additional
data is available or resources permit further
research. To ensure that greater caution is taken in
environmental management, implementation of the
principle through Judicial and legislative means is
necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_307">In other words, inadequacies of science is the real
basis that has led to the precautionary principle of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                                                          127</span>
 1982. It is based on the theory that it is better to err
on the side of caution and prevent environmental
harm which may indeed become irreversible.
</p>
<p id="p_308">34. The principle of precaution involves the
anticipation of environmental harm and taking
measures to avoid it or to choose the least
environmentally harmful activity. It is based on
scientific uncertainty. Environmental protection
should not only aim at protecting health, property
and economic interest but also protect the
environment for its own sake. Precautionary duties
must not only be triggered by the suspicion of
concrete danger but also by (Justified) concern or
risk potential. The precautionary principle was
recommended by the UNEP Governing Council
(1989). The Bomako Convention also lowered the
threshold at which scientific evidence might require
action by not referring to "serious" or "irreversible" as
adjectives qualifying harm. However, summing up
the legal status of the precautionary principle, one
commentator characterised the principle as still
"evolving" for though it is accepted as part of the
international customary law, "the consequences of its
application in any potential situation will be
influenced by the circumstances of each case". (See
First Report of Dr. Sreenivasa Rao Pemmaraju,
Special - Rapporteur, International Law Commission
dated 3.4.1998 paras 61 to 72).
</p>
<p id="p_309">The Special Burden of Proof in Environmental cases:

</p><p id="p_310">35. We shall next elaborate the new concept of
burden of proof referred to in the Vellore case
AIR1996SC2715 . In that case, Kuldip Singh, J.
stated as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_311">The 'onus of proof is on the actor or the
developer/industrialist to show that his action is
environmentally benign.
</p>
<p id="p_312">36. It is to be noticed that while the inadequacies of
science have led to the 'precautionary principle', the
said 'precautionary principle' in its turn, has led to
the special principle of burden of proof in
environmental cases where burden as to the absence
of injurious effect of the actions proposed, is placed
on those who want to change the status quo (Wynne,
Uncertainty and Environmental Learning, 2 Global
Envtl. Change 111 (1992) at p. 123). This is often
termed as a reversal of the burden of proof, because
otherwise in environmental cases, those opposing the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">                                                            128</span>
         changes would be compelled to shoulder the
        evidentiary burden, a procedure which is not fair.
        Therefore, it is necessary that the party attempting to
        preserve the status quo by maintaining a less-
        polluted state should not carry the burden of proof
        and the party who wants to alter it, must bear this
        burden. (See James M. Olson, Shifting the Burden of
        Proof, 20 Envtl. Law p.891 at 898 (1990). (Quoted in
        Vol. 22 (1998) Harv. Env. Law Review p. 509 at 519,
</p><p id="p_313">        550).
</p>
<p id="p_314">        37. The precautionary principle suggests that where
        there is an identifiable risk of serious or irreversible
        harm, including, for example, extinction of species,
        widespread toxic pollution in major threats to
        essential ecological processes, it may be appropriate
        to place the burden of proof on the person or entity
        proposing the activity that is potentially harmful to
        the environment. (See Report of Dr. Sreenivasa Rao
        Pemmaraju, Special Rapporteur, International Law
        Commission, dated 3.4,1998, para 61).
</p>
<p id="p_315">        38. It is also explained that if the environmental risks
        being run by regulatory inaction are in some way
        "ascertain but non-negligible", then regulatory action
        is justified.. This will lead to the question as to what
        is the non-negligible risk'. In such a situation, the
        burden of proof is to be placed on those attempting to
        alter the status quo. They are to discharge this
        burden by showing the absence of a 'reasonable
        ecological or medical concern. That is the required
        standard of proof. The result would be that if
        insufficient evidence is presented by them to alleviate
        concern about the level of uncertainty, then the
        presumption       should     operate    in   favour   of
        environmental protection. Such a presumption has
        been applied in Ashburton Acclimatisation Society v.
        Federated Fanners of New Zealand [1988] 1 NZLR 78.
        The required standard now is that the risk of harm to
        the environment or to human health is to be decided
        in public interest, according to a 'reasonable persons'
        test. (See Precautionary Principle in Australia by
        Charmian Barton) (Vol. 22) (1988) Harv. Env. L. Rev.

appellate jurisdiction relating to environmental laws. The NGT

Act, 2010 was enacted for effective and expeditious disposal of

cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of

forests and other natural resources including enforcement of

any legal rights relating to environment. In relation to NGT, the

legislature, in its wisdom, has specifically excluded the

application of the procedure under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_204"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure,

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_206">Evidence Act</a>') in terms of Section 19(1) and 19(3) of the NGT

Act. On the contrary, Section 19(2) of the NGT Act empowers

the Tribunal to have the power to regulate its own procedure.

In terms of its <a href="/doc/1384966/" id="a_207">Section 19(5)</a>, NGT is a judicial Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_320">132. Section 20 of the NGT Act further recognises the

application of the principles of sustainable development,

precautionary principle and polluter pays principle by the

Tribunal while adjudicating upon disputes on environment.

prescribed under the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_208">Evidence Act</a>, is excluded, the Tribunal

has to state its own procedure, including recording of evidence,

but the same essentially has to be in consonance with the

 applicant to non-applicant. In environmental cases, normally

the damage to environment or public health is evident by itself,

res ipsa loquitur. The cases of environmental degradation,

damage and health hazards are obvious by themselves as a

result of some industrial activity or development. In that event

and keeping in view the very object of the NGT Act, it will be

unacceptable to require the applicant to discharge his primary

onus by strict number of events and their details.

was held that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur serves two

purposes. Firstly, that an accident may by its nature be more

consistent with being caused by negligence for which the

opposite party is responsible than by any other cause and that

in such a case, the mere fact of the accident is prima facie

evidence of such negligence. Secondly, it is to avoid hardship in

cases where the claimant is able to prove the accident but

cannot prove how the accident occurred. Recourse to this

principle is also permissible where there is no direct evidence

brought on record. These stated principles apply more often

than not to motor accident cases and can squarely be applied

to cases of environmental pollution resulting from industrial

activities or development.

<p id="p_323">135. Under the provisions of the NGT Act, any aggrieved person

can approach the Tribunal for redressal of his grievances in

relation to environment within the ambit and scope of Sections

14, 16 and 18 of the NGT Act. The legislative object appears to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">                                                                131</span>

not be circumscribed by strict rule of locus standi in legal

prescriptions.
</p>
<p id="p_324">
</p><p id="p_325">136. Once an applicant approaches the Tribunal with a

complaint    of   environmental    injury    or   environmental

degradation or health hazards resulting from negligence, or

incidental occurrence of emission or discharge of gases or

effluents in violation of the prescribed standards, then such an

applicant discharges the primary onus by instituting a petition

in the prescribed form, supported by an affidavit, which then

shifts upon the industrial unit, developer or the person

carrying out the activity complained of, to establish by cogent

and reliable evidence that it has not caused pollution or health

hazards by carrying out its activities; all the expected norms of

discharge have been strictly adhered to by that unit; and any

harm, if caused, was neither the result of any negligence nor

violation of prescribed standards. Upon discharge of such onus,

which is certainly much heavier, by the developer/industrial

unit, it will then again be for the applicant to establish to the

contrary. In other words, heavy onus lies upon the industrial

unit or the developer to show by cogent and reliable evidence

that it is non-polluting and non-hazardous or is not likely to

have caused the accident complained of.

Commission, held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_328">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">        "119. It is this decision which was the subject-matter
        of challenge in this Court. After referring to the
        different concepts in relation to environmental cases
        like the 'precautionary principle' and the 'polluter-
        pays principle', this Court relied upon the earlier
        decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_211">Vellore Citizens' Welfare
        Forum v. Union of India</a> (AIR1996SC2715) and
        observed that there was a new concept which places
        the burden of proof on the developer or industrialist
        who is proposing to alter the status quo and has
        become part of our environmental law. It was noticed
        that inadequacies of science had led to the
        precautionary principle and the said 'precautionary
        principle' in its turn had led to the special principle of
        burden of proof in environmental cases where burden
        as to the absence of injurious effect of the actions
        proposed is placed on those who want to change the
        status quo. At page 735, this Court, while relying
        upon a report of the International Law Commission,
        observed as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">        'The precautionary principle suggests that where there
        is an identifiable risk of serious or irreversible harm,
        including, for example, extinction of species,

        ecological processes, it may be appropriate to place
        the burden of proof on the person or entity proposing
        the activity that is potentially harmful to the
        environment.'

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">        120. It appears to us that the 'precautionary principle'
        and the corresponding burden of proof on the person
        who wants to change the status quo will ordinarily
        apply in a case of polluting or other project or industry
        where the extent of damage likely to be inflicted is not
        known. When there is a state of uncertainty due to
        lack of data or material about the extent of damage or
        pollution likely to be caused then, in order to maintain
        the ecology balance, the burden of proof that the said
        balance will be maintained must necessarily be on the
        industry or the unit which is likely to cause pollution.
        On the other hand where the effect on ecology or
        environment of setting up of an industry is known,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">                                                                     133</span>
         what has to be seen is that if the environment is likely
        to suffer, then what imitative steps can be taken to
        offset the same. Merely because there will be a change
        is no reason to presume that there will be ecological
        disaster. It is when the effect of the project is known
        then the principle of sustainable development would
        come into play which will ensure that imitative steps
        are and can be taken to preserve the ecological
        balance. Sustainable development means what type or
        extent of development can take place which can be
        sustained by nature/ ecology with or without
        mitigation."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_329">138. Therefore, the stated principle could be a valid dictum for

environmental adjudicatory process.
</p>
<p id="p_330">139. In the backdrop of these legal principles, now we must

revert to the facts of the case in hand. We have already held that

the incident, as projected by the Board, was not reliable, trust-

worthy and in any case, could not be the foundation for passing

such a punitive direction. Further, we have also held that it was

a case of calibration and not actual emission at the relevant

point of time. The reports - pre and post date of the alleged

incident - fully tilt the case in favour of the appellant-company

rather than the case advanced by the Respondent-Board. The

Chairman of the Respondent-Board has also not exercised the

delegated power subject to the limitations placed upon him and

in fact did so in a somewhat arbitrary manner.

</p><p id="p_331">140. Shutting down an industry amounts to 'civil death' of the

company. A direction of closure in relation to a running unit not

only results in stoppage of production but has far reaching

economic, social, and labour consequences.    Before directing the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">                                                                   134</span>
 civil death of a company, the decision making authority is

expected to have before it some reliable and cogent evidence. An

inquiry into the incident or accident of breach by the industrial

company should be relatable to some reasonable scientific data.

There should be a direct nexus between the leakage of gas, the

source of leakage and its effect/impact on ambient air quality

and public health. These are the sine qua non and not conditions

to be satisfied post-order.
</p>
<p id="p_332">141. We have also held above that there is no direct or even

indirect evidence to show that there was no possibility of leakage

of gas or excessive emission from any other industry except the

appellant-company. The Respondent-Board in fact has not even

brought its case with reasonable probability in contradistinction

to the above beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_333">142. The action taken by the Board on 29th March, 2013

directing closure of the appellant-company's unit was not as

much of a preventive direction with reference to precautionary

principle as it was a punitive measure, recourse to which was

taken on the premise that there was excessive emission on 23rd

March, 2013 and it had caused health hazards to the people

residing 6-8 kms. away from the appellant-company's unit. It

could not be prevented as according to the Respondent-Board

itself, the event had already happened and it was not an

anticipated action. At best, it was partially preventive and

primarily punitive so that firstly, the people do not suffer eye

irritation, throat irritation or suffocation in future and secondly,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">                                                                 135</span>
 because complaints in that regard had already been received.

The parameters for taking punitive action are entirely different to

the ones that may be required for passing directions as per

precautionary principle. Since there was no reasonable scientific

data and the Respondent-Board itself did not even care to collect

stack and ambient air quality samples post-23rd March, 2013, we

fail to understand as to how such an order could be passed,

particularly in view of the admitted position that there are large

number of industries in S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_212">IPC</a>OT and out of which quite a few

industries are heavy and 'red' category industries in relation to

causing pollution. They were admittedly discharging gases. It is

also equally true that the alleged health problems could result

from discharge of other gases besides SO2. The order passed by

the Respondent-Board is not based on precautionary principle

but is a punitive direction in terms of <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_213">Section 5</a> of the

Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. As a condition precedent to

punitive action, it ought to have been established that there had

been excessive emission from the stack of the appellant-

company's unit and that the ambient air quality analysis showed

presence   of   SO2   primarily   attributable   to   the   appellant-

company's plant and then it had travelled to the villages 6-8 kms

away and had affected the health of its' residents. Once this was

established as a ground for punitive action, that itself could form

a valid basis for passing the preventive order in relation to

future. In the case of punitive action, it should be tested on the

touch-stone of validly proved action while in a preventive order, it


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">                                                                   136</span>
 could be done as per a reasonable apprehension of a prudent

person. Stringent proof and specific scientific data is the very

crux for passing such direction and absence thereof would vitiate

the action taken.
</p>
<p id="p_334">143. Furthermore, the scope of 'merit review' by the Tribunal is

not confined to the Wednesbury's principle. Besides this, other

considerations like no evidence, no specific and scientific data or

abuse of authority can be additional grounds that can be

considered    by      the   Tribunal   while   determining   such     a

controversy. In view of the detailed discussion, we have no

hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the punitive order

dated 29th March, 2013 passed by the Respondent-Board is not

sustainable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_335">144. Having dealt with the various facets of this case, another

ancillary point of some public importance needs to be addressed

by us before we part with this file. It has come in evidence by way

of affidavits of the respondents as well as of the doctors that

there are serious health problems persisting in the area of the

villages afore-indicated. All these villages are within a distance of

6-8 kms. from S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_214">IPC</a>OT Industrial Complex established by the

State Government. The doctors have, by necessary implication of

their   affidavits,    attributed   the   cause   of   termination   of

pregnancies of young women to the release of some gases from

different industries in that area. Furthermore, the people, more

often than not, complained of eye burning, throat irritation and

suffocation resulting in problems relating to breathing. Despite


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">                                                                     137</span>
 filing of complaints at various quarters of the State Government,

including the Respondent-Board, no effort had been made by the

authorities to carry out any study or collect proper data so that

the residents of these villages are able to get a clean and decent

environment, more particularly with reference to air. It is not

only a statutory but also a Constitutional right of all the persons

living in the vicinity of this industrial cluster and other industries

located in that area to have clean, healthy and pollution-free

environment. It was expected of the State Government and the

Respondent-Board to carry out its statutory obligation and

consequently deal with the legal rights under the environmental

laws of the affected persons to redress their grievance against

polluted environment.
</p>
<p id="p_336">145. The respondents and even the interveners have placed

material on record to show that prior to and post the alleged date

of occurrence, i.e. 23rd March, 2013, the complaints of similar

kind have persisted over a passage of time.        According to the

affidavit of one of the doctors, young women had to terminate

their pregnancies, probably, as a result of inhalation of

obnoxious gases.     Continuous health hazards, particularly in

regard to the termination of pregnancies with young ladies, is a

matter of very serious concern and one would have expected

these authorities not only to have undertaken due study in that

regard, but also taken both corrective and preventive measures

in relation to pollution arising from these industrial clusters and

affecting the villages afore-referred.    There is no explanation

 whatsoever, much less, a reasonable case advanced on behalf of

these official respondents for their failure to advert themselves to

such a serious human health problem totally relatable to

environment.       The provisions of NGT Act declare that a direct

violation of specific statutory environmental obligations by a

person by which the community at large is affected or is likely to

be affected by the environmental consequences, will be a

substantial question relating to environment; which show the

intent of the legislature that environmental violations affecting

the community have to be treated with all rigours of law and

thus, this Tribunal cannot overlook such specific instances.

Thus, the present would be a fit case which requires issuance of

specific directions by the Tribunal to protect the environment of

these villages and health of the people residing therein.


Conclusion and Directions :
</p>
<p id="p_337">
</p><p id="p_338">146. The Legislature has mandated that the Tribunal while

deciding   cases    must    apply   the   principle   of    sustainable

development, precautionary principle and polluter-pays principle.

We have discussed above the first two principles, in some detail.

The principle of sustainable development requires us to take a

balanced view between industrial development and protection of

environment.        The    cumulative     view   of   the   facts   and

circumstances of the present case shows that the case at hand is

not a case of promoting development at the cost of the

environment. It has not been established that the industrial



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">                                                                     139</span>
 activity carried on by the appellant-company prejudicially and in

any way compromises either the environment or the interests of

the future generations. Furthermore, the alleged incident of 23rd

March, 2013 is not attributable to the activity of the appellant-

company. There is no cogent or reliable evidence or reasonable

scientific data, even by necessary implication, to contribute the

leakage of SO2 in excess of the prescribed parameters to the

plant of the appellant-company. Nothing on record justifies the

invocation of precautionary principle.     In fact, it is a punitive

action in the garb of a preventive measure. As far as the third

principle of polluter-pays is concerned, this does not require any

deliberation by this Tribunal in face of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Sterlite (appellant-company)

itself. It was brought to the notice of the Supreme Court that for

some period, the industry had operated without consent of the

Board. Taking it to be a case of environmental pollution, the

Supreme Court, on the basis of the polluter pays principle

directed the industry to pay a sum of Rs.100 crores. Thus, there

is no occasion for the Tribunal to examine that aspect

subsequent thereto which in any case is a matter of days and

particularly when the industry has to operate its industrial

activity with the consent of the Respondent-Board.         We also

have, in clear terms, held that exercise of delegated powers by

the Chairman was beyond the prescribed limitation and it also

suffered from the vice of arbitrariness.
</p>
<p id="p_339">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">                                                                 140</span>
</p><p id="p_340"> 147. The economic factors and their consequences are relevant

considerations for the Tribunal when it is determining the

substantial questions of environment and allied disputes raised

by the parties. Of course, such relevancy has a limited role and

irretrievable degradation of environment only for economic

reasons is not permissible as per the settled canons of

environmental     jurisprudence.          SO2,   a   raw     material   for

manufacture      of     various   final     products,      for    instance,

pharmaceutical        products,   pesticides,    sulphur         phosphate,

fertilizers and even used by the pickling plants etc., is a by-

product   in   the    manufacturing       process    of    the   Appellant-

Company. Thus, it would always be the effort on the part of the

appellant-company to minimize the emission of SO2 to ensure

least economic loss. As a business person of common prudence,

efforts would be made to maximise the use of gas and not

minimise the profits. It is of some significance to notice that the

emission of SO2 would mean, on the one hand economic loss to

the appellant company and a complete waste for it, on the other.


</p><p id="p_341">148. The environmental restrictions must operate with all their

rigour but no action should be suspicion-based which itself is

not well-founded.       Precautionary principle should be invoked

when the reasonable scientific data suggests that without taking

appropriate preventive measures there is a plausible indication of

some environmental injury or health hazard. The Tribunal, in

exercise of its power of merit-review and being an expert body

itself has to examine all aspects of such cases whether they are

these three aspects, we are of the considered view that the

passing of the following order is necessitated in the facts and

circumstances of the present case:
