       and conditions of the agreement. He submitted that since it is also

       a case of theft of State revenue, the petitioner being one of the

       directors of the Company in whose favour settlements of sand

       ghats were made is liable to be prosecuted. He argued that the

       petitioner cannot take a plea of vicarious liability as he had

       actively participated in the excavation of excess sand from the

       sand ghats. According to him, it is the petitioner, who was the

       executive agent of the Company for the purposes of excavation of

       sand. He pleaded that though the petitioner has obtained

       environment clearance and was allowed to excavate the sand and

       there was capping limit per month for excavation of sand ghats,

       after verification of monthly returns filed by the petitioner, it was

       found that the Company had crossed the environment clearance

       capping limit. He urged that since the investigation into a

       cognizable offence is going on, it would not be proper to interdict

       the FIR at the stage of investigation.

       the terms and conditions of the capping limit of environmental

       clearance, a case for prosecution is made out. She submitted that

       the investigation would reveal the correct facts. According to her

       also, since the allegations made in the FIR do attract the

       ingredients of a cognizable offence, it would not be proper for this

       Court to consider the case of the petitioner on merit. She has urged

       that as the Company, being juristic person has violated the terms

       and conditions of the licence granted for excavation of sand, there

       is no illegality in institution of the FIR against the petitioner, who

       was the executing agent-cum-director of the Company.
