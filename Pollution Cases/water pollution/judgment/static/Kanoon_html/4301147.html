     THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS

                      ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard Sri F V Patil, learned Advocate appearing

for    petitioner,    learned   HCGP   appearing    for

respondents-1 and 2 and Sri Gurudev I Gachinmath,

learned Advocate appearing for respondents-3 &amp; 4.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   :3:</span>
</p><p id="p_2">     2.       By consent of learned Advocates appearing

for the parties, writ petition is taken up for final

disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     3.       Petitioners with intention to establish two

industries,      claim   to       have   obtained     permissions,

approvals and licences from the statutory authorities

including      consent       as    prescribed    under        Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air

(Prevention     and   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control       of   Pollution)    Act</a>,   1981

(hereinafter referred to as '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>' and '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>'

respectively for sake of brevity) and contend that despite

such consents, approvals and licences issued by the

statutory     authorities,    Special    Divisional     Magistrate

without there being authority of law has assumed

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_5">Section 133</a> Cr.P.C. and has passed

the impugned order - Annexure-J dated 25.10.2013 and

seeks for quashing of the same.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             :4:</span><p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     4.      Learned HCGP appearing for the State would

support the impugned order contending that Sub

Divisional    Magistrate   is   empowered   to   pass   a

conditional order as has been done in the instant case

on 10.06.2013 - Annexure-G and on account of said

order having not been complied, an order of injunction

has been passed on 25.10.2013- Annexure-J which is

in the interest of general public and he is yet to pass a

final order and as such, this Court should not interfere

with the said orders.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     5.       Perusal of the case papers would indicate

that undisputedly petitioners have obtained sanction for

discharge of effluents both under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air

Act</a> as per Annexures-B and B1 dated 31.03.2012 from

Pollution Control Board. Said consent has been given

by respondent No.4 in exercise of its power under

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">Section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_9">26</a> of the Water Act and <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            :5:</span>




the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a> subject to conditions stipulated in the

schedule to said consent orders.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">      6.   On a representation given by residents of

locality where petitioners have set up their industry,

Sub Divisional Magistrate has initiated proceedings

against petitioners under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_12">Section 133</a> of Cr.P.C. alleging

that public nuisance is being created by the industries

run by petitioners. He is said to have conducted spot

inspection on 05.06.2013 and issued notices to both

petitioners and the complainant to appear before him in

the enquiry to be held on 06.06.2013. Said proceedings

came to be adjourned to 10.06.2013. On said date the

petitioners and their advocate appeared and undertook

that they would not create any public nuisance and

would stop such nuisance if any. After considering the

rival contentions, first respondent passed an order of

injunction restraining the petitioners from running the

industry   within   10   days    from   the   order   dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            :6:</span>




10.06.2013 - Annexure-G. For reasons best known,

consents given under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a> or <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a> by fourth

respondent to the petitioners to run the industry were

not   produced   before   first   respondent.      However,

undertaking was given by petitioners that effluents

being discharged by the industry would be stopped. In

view of this undertaking given by the learned Advocates

appearing for petitioners as well as petitioners in the

enquiry conducted by first respondent, order dated

10.06.2013 came to be passed by first respondent

directing petitioners to stop all activities of industries

run by them as noticed hereinabove. Subsequently, on

25.10.2013 petitioner No.1 has filed a memo before first

respondent enclosing consent/permission granted by

fourth respondent as also Safety Certificate issued by

the Director of Industries and Boilers.         Though said

memo filed along with documents were received by first

respondent, has proceeded to pass the impugned order

dated   25.10.2013    -   Annexure-J     restraining    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            :7:</span>




petitioners from running the industries by issuance of

injunction merely on the say of some of residents that

petitioners have continued to discharge the effluents.


</p><p id="p_11">     7.    A perusal of order dated 25.10.2013 would

clearly indicate that first respondent has not taken into

consideration consent given by the fourth respondent as

per Annexures-B and B1 under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a>

and permission granted by the Director of Industries

and Boilers which is at Annexures-C &amp; C1 and has

proceeded to direct the petitioners to stop the operation

of their industries.   In view of the fact that fourth

respondent - State Pollution Control Board has already

issued consent under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Air Act</a> to the

petitioner to run their industry, it would be needless to

state that fourth respondent and its officers would be

empowered to ascertain as to whether conditions

stipulated by the fourth respondent on the petitioners-

industries while giving consent have been adhered to or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             :8:</span>




whether there is infraction of said conditions stipulated

and if there is any public nuisance created, first

respondent would be at liberty to proceed against the

petitioners in accordance with law. There cannot be any

dispute with regard to power to be exercised by fourth

respondent or its officers in this regard.


</p><p id="p_12">     8.    Be that as it may. First respondent in order

to prevent the breach of public nuisance          would

undoubtedly be empowered to exercise his powers

under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_19">Section 133</a> Cr.P.C. The mandate of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_20">Section

133</a> Cr.P.C. is required to be followed which is not

forthcoming from the impugned order, inasmuch as,

from the perusal of impugned order at Annexure-J it

would clearly indicate that first respondent has not

taken into consideration the consent orders issued by

the Pollution Control Board - fourth respondent to the

petitioner-industries. Impugned order do not disclose as

to whether petitioners have complied with the terms and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             :9:</span>




conditions set out in the respective consent orders

issued by fourth respondent.       It was incumbent upon

the first respondent to examine as to whether petitioner-

industries have established effluent treatment plant and

complied      with the   conditions imposed     under     the

relevant consent orders or not and thereafter first

respondent could have passed orders in accordance

with law. However, without undertaking such an

exercise,   first   respondent    has   proceeded   to   pass

virtually an order of injunction against petitioner-

industries.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">     9.        In that view of the matter, I am of the

considered view that it would suffice and it would meet

the ends of justice if first respondent is directed to

examine the claim of petitioners in the light of memo

filed by them on 25.10.2013 - Annexure-H and proceed

to pass orders afresh in accordance with law after

affording opportunity to all parties.
