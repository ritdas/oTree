  Motion

30/08/2017 Mr. Ajay Kumar Mishra, Senior Advocate with Mr. Ankit Singhal,
            Advocate for the petitioner.

            Mr. Arun Sao, Deputy Advocate General for the State/respondent</pre>
<p id="p_1">            No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Mr. Sudhir Kumar Bajpai, counsel for respondents No.2 and 3.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Mr. V.V.S. Murthy, Senior Advocate with Mr. Shantanu Kumar,
            Advocate for respondent No.4.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            Mr. S.C. Mehadia, counsel for respondents No.5 and 6.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            This writ petition has been filed calling in question legality and
            propriety of the order issued by respondent No.3 granting permission
            to respondents No.5 and 6 to establish Common Bio-Medical Waste
            Treatment and Disposal Facility for capacity two ton per day at
            Patwari Halka No.20, Khasra No.70/(1, 2, 5) at Village Siltara,
            Dharsiwa, Distt. Raipur subject to fulfillment of the conditions
            mentioned therein.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            When the hearing commenced, Mr. Bajpai, learned counsel for
            respondents No.2 and 3 would take a preliminary objection that the
            writ petition is not maintainable as the reliefs claimed are covered
 under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 (for
short, 'the Act, 2010'). Further elaborating his submission, he would
submit that the present writ petition is barred by <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_2">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_3">15</a> and
<a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_4">16</a> of the said Act as well as under the provisions of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, as the order
impugned is appealable and also barred by clause 13 of the Bio-
Medical Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989. Therefore,
this writ petition be dismissed primarily on this count.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Mr. Ajay Kumar Mishra, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
petitioner, would submit that in the writ petition no such fundamental
question or questions relating to enforcement of any legal right
relating to environment is involved and question also does not arise
within the enactment in Schedule I and no such relief as claimed can
be granted by the National Green Tribunal as such, this Court has
jurisdiction to hear the writ petition by which the petitioner only claims
to protect its commercial interest, as the work in question to establish
Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility has
been granted to it by order dated 7-4-2003 for Raipur, Bhilai and Durg
and now, contrary to that order, the impugned order has been passed
on 31-3-2012 permitting respondents No.5 and 6 to establish the
CBWTF at Raipur for District Raipur and just in order to protect its
commercial tax and seeking quashment of order Annexure P-1, this
writ petition has been filed by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Mr. Mehadia, learned counsel appearing for respondents No.5 and 6,
would support the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_9">I have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered their rival
submissions.
</p><p id="p_10"> In order to consider the dispute raised by the parties, it would be
appropriate to notice the definition of the term "substantial question

</p>
<p id="p_29">A focused glance of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_37">Section 14</a> of the Act,
2010, would show that the Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction over all
civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment
(including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment), is
involved including the question arising out of the implementation of
the enactments specified in Schedule I. <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_38">Section 15</a> speaks about
relief, compensation and restitution that can be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_30">The question would be whether the writ petition filed by the petitioner
for enforcement of his commercial interest i.e. for quashing the order
Annexure P-1 dated 31-3-2012 can be entertained, whereby the
Chhattisgarh   Environment     Conservation     Board   after   granting
permission to the petitioner to establish such a CBWTF for Durg again
granted such a permission to respondents No.5 and 6. The petitioner
is not seeking any quashment relating to environment but only
seeking quashment of the order relating to establishment of such a
facility to respondents No.5 and 6 which the petitioner is legally
entitled and which has been granted by bypassing his interest to
respondents No.5 and 6.
</p>
<p id="p_31">In this connection, Mr. Ajay Kumar Mishra, learned Senior Counsel,
would cite a judgment of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench)
delivered   in W.P.No.6360/2015      (<a href="/doc/178757236/" id="a_39">Central   India   AYUSH Drugs
Manufacturers Association and others v. State of Maharashtra and
 others</a>) decided on 28-9-2016 in which in paragraphs 16, 21, 24 and
27, Their Lordships of the Bombay High Court held thus,

     "16. Section 14 of the N.G.T. Act, empowers the Tribunal to
     settle disputes. All civil cases specified in sub-section (1)
     thereof are amenable to its jurisdiction and sub-section (2)
     specifically provides for all disputes arising from questions
     referred to in sub-section (1) are to be heard and settled by it.
     An application for adjudication of such disputes cannot be
     entertained by the Tribunal, if it is made beyond a period of six
     months from the date of cause of action. It has been given
     power to condone delay of period not exceeding 60 days.
     <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_40">Section 15</a> points out relief, compensation and restitution which
     Tribunal is empowered to grant under <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_41">Section 15</a> (3).
     Application for grant of any compensation or relief or restitution
     of property or environment under <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_42">Section 15</a>, cannot be
     entertained by the Tribunal, if it is not made within a period of 5
     years from the date on which cause therefor first arose. Again it
     has been given power to condone delay for a period not
     exceeding 60 days. Under <a href="/doc/53865536/" id="a_43">Section 16</a> Appellate jurisdiction of
     National Green Tribunal has been specified. It can entertain an
     appeal filed by a person aggrieved against 10 orders as
     specified therein, which include enactments mentioned in
     Schedule-I of the N.G.T. Act. Appeal is required to be filed by
     the aggrieved person within a period of 30 days, and the
     Tribunal can condone delay of a period not exceeding 60 days.
     Under <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_44">Section 17</a>, if death or injury to any person (other than a
     workman) or damage to any property or environment has
     resulted from an accident or adverse impact of any activity or
     operation or process, under any enactment specified in
     Schedule-I, the person responsible for it has to give such relief
     or pay compensation, as specified in <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_45">Section 17</a> (1). <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_46">Section 18</a>
     deals with the procedure for filing an application or appeal to the
     Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_32">     21. Perusal of Section 14 of N.G.T. Act, reveals that civil cases
     covered under <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_47">Section 14(1)</a> are referred to as disputes in sub-
     section (2). These disputes therefore, must be civil in nature,
     must arise out of implementation of enactments specified in
     Schedule-I and therein substantial question relating to
     environment must be involved. If these three ingredients are
     satisfied, bar under <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_48">section 14(1)</a> gets attracted. Thus all civil
     cases are not cognizable by National Green Tribunal, tough
     they may arise out of implementation of Schedule-I enactments,
     if substantial question relating to environment does not arise
                  therefrom. In <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_49">section 14(1)</a> words "including enforcement of any
                 legal right relating to environment" are inserted after the word
                 "environment". Thus, issue of enforcement of a legal right
                 relating to environment or a substantial question relating to
                 environment must surface and form subject-matter of a civil
                 case arising out of implementation of Schedule-I enactments.
                 Then only National Green Tribunal will have jurisdiction under
                 <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_50">Section 14</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_33">                 24. When <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_51">Section 14(c)</a> is read along with and construed with
                 <a href="/doc/187339837/" id="a_52">Section 2(c)</a> and (m), it is clear that civil cases which can be
                 considered by the National Green Tribunal must affect
                 environment. If it is not affecting environment, the Tribunal will
                 not have jurisdiction. In present facts, relief sought for do not
                 directly or indirectly affect environment.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                 27. Here, considering the jurisdiction given to the National
                 Green Tribunal only to decide civil cases, where substantial
                 question involved is in relation to environment, it is apparent
                 that the NGT cannot be said to be conferred with the absolute
                 jurisdiction to adjudicate all types of disputes or even all civil
                 disputes. A limited jurisdiction to deal with specific type of civil
                 disputes is only made available to it. Bare reading of Section
                 28 of the N.G.T. Act prescribing the bar of jurisdiction also
                 substantiates this. Thus, power to pronounce upon the vires of
                 any statutory provision or of any subordinate legislation can not
                 be read into any of the provisions which confer either appellate
                 or original jurisdiction upon National Green Tribunal. The
                 Parliament which has deliberately employed wide or liberal
                 words while laying down the compass or the scheme of N.G.T.
                 Act, has not used such words while phrasing <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_53">Section 14</a> of that
                 Act or conferring jurisdiction upon National Green Tribunal. On
                 the contrary, its intention to limit the power to decide certain
                 specified nature of disputes is apparent. We find that the
                 scheme of N.G.T. Act does not permit National Green Tribunal
                 to decide upon the vires of any of the enactments which confer
                 appellate or other jurisdiction upon it and find mention mention
                 in Schedule-I of N.G.T. Act. It also does not empower it to
                 examine validity of any Rules or Regulations made under these
                 enactments."
</p>
<p id="p_35">            In a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_54">Bhopal
            Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan and others v. Union of
            India</a> and others1 Their Lordships have held that environment issues
1 (2012) 8 SCC 326
        and matters covered under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_55">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 in
       Schedule-I should be understood and litigated before the National
       Green Tribunal only, and not before any High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_36">       Following the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_56">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_57">15</a> of the Act,
       2010 read with the decision rendered by the Bombay High Court in
       Central India AYUSH Drugs Manufacturers Association (supra), I am
       of the considered opinion that in the present petition, the petitioner
       has not raised any substantial question relating to environment within
       the meaning of <a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_58">Section 2(m)</a> of the Act, 2010, but has only raised
       question relating to enforcement of his commercial interest with
       regard to establishment of said facility at Raipur which has already
       been granted to it and according to the petitioner, it has already made
       huge investment for establishment of such a plant.          The question
       before this Court is whether respondent No.3 is justified in granting
       permission to respondents No.5 and 6 in ignorance or bypassing the
       permission granted to the petitioner herein.         Therefore, no such
       question covered under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_59">Section 14</a> of the Act, 2010 is involved in the
       present petition and the Court is not called upon to consider any
       question or enforcement of any legal right relating to environment.
       Accordingly, I am of the considered opinion that this writ petition is not
       cognizable by the National Green Tribunal and this can be entertained
       by this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_60">Article 226</a> <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_61">/ 227</a> of the Constitution of India.
       Thus, the preliminary objection raised on behalf of respondents No.2
       and 3 is overruled and the matter is directed to be listed for final
