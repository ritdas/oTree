<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. S.J. MUKHOPADHAYA)
 

 


 

	A
writ petition, Special Civil Application No.4830 of 2011 was
preferred by the petitioner against order dated 8th April
2011 passed by the respondent - Gujarat Pollution Control Board
under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974, whereby the petitioner's manufacturing unit at Plot No.27,
GIDC Estate, Jhagadia, District Bharuch was directed to be closed and
it was ordered to disconnect electricity and water connection with
immediate effect.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	When
the matter was taken up on 20th April 2011, learned Senior
Counsel informed that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board in the
meantime stayed the impugned order by order dated 9th
April 2011. Taking into consideration the aforesaid fact, the Court
permitted the writ petitioner  to withdraw the case with the
following observations:
</p>
<p id="p_3">"It is expected
that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board will reconsider the matter
and will pass appropriate order. In case of any adverse decision,
they shall pass a reasoned order."
</p>
<p id="p_4">	The period of stay
thereafter having not extended, again the writ petition has been
preferred with similar relief as was prayed in earlier case.   Today,
when the matter is taken up, learned counsel for the petitioner
submits that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board has again extended
the stay for a period of 3 months by order dated 2nd May
2011, a copy of which has been produced before this Court.  In the
circumstances, no further order is required to be passed. As was
observed earlier that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board is expected
to take a final decision in the matter, we direct them to take such
decision and pass a reasoned order within three months.  However, if
any adverse decision is taken or stay is vacated, it will be open for
the petitioner to move this Court for appropriate relief. The writ
Petition stands disposed of with aforesaid observation.
