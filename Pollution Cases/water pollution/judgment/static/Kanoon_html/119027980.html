APPENDIX I

QUESTIONNAIRE rssurzn BY rm: LAW COMMISSION on
CAP-ITAL PUNISHMENT

1. Are you in favour of retention or abolition of capital
punishment?

2. (a) What, in your opinion, is the object of capital
punishment? Does the existing law sufficiently achieve
that object?

(b) In particular, do you think that the sentence of
death acts as a deterrent?

3. (a) Would you like to retain the sentence of death
for all or any of the offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4"> the Indian Penal Code</a>
which are at present punishable with deathl?

(b) Are there any other oﬁiences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5"> the Indian Penal
Code</a> or any other law which, in your opinion, should be
punishable with death?

4. The relevant provisions in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6"> the Indian Penal Code</a>
vest in most cases a discretion in the court to award the
sentence of death or the lesser sentence of imprisonment
for life. Is the vesting of such discretion necessary and
are the provisions conferring such discretion working
satisfactorily? If not, have you any suggestions to make
in this behalf?

5. If the vesting of such discretion is necessary, what
should be the considerations which should weigh with the
court in awarding the lesser punishment of imprisonment
for life? Is it possible to codify such considerations?

6. (a) Is it possible to divide murders into different
categories for the purpose of regulating the punishment
for murder?

1. Th: relevant sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> and the oﬁences
coicerned are as fol1ows:---

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_8">Section 121-Waging</a> war against the Government.

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_9">Section 132-Abetment</a> of mutiny by a member of the armed forces,

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_10">Section 194-2nd</a> paragraph--False evidence leadirg to conviction
of innotent person and his execution.

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_11">Section 302-</a>--Murder.

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_12">Section 303-</a>--Murder by a life convfct.

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_13">Section 305-Abetment</a> of suicide by child or insane person.
S::t'o1 31'-. -Xttemfit to mwrcier by life convict.

Star" I Dicoity with murder.



2

(b) Is it possible to divide murders into two cate-
gories----
(i) murders punishable with death;
(ii) murders not punishable with death.

If so, what kinds of murders would you include in cate-
gory (i)? «

7. (a) Are you in favour of the view that the normal
sentence for murder should be imprisonment for life, but
in aggravating circumstances the court may award the
sentence of death?

(b) If so, what, in your opinion, should be the aggra-
vating circumstances?

8. Should there be a provision in the law requiring the
court to state its reasons for imposing a sentence of death
or the lesser punishment of imprisonment for life?

9. Do. you consider that even if the sentence of death
is retained, certain classes of persons should not be
punished with death, e.g., children below a particular age,
women, etc.? What classes of persons should, in your
opinion, be excluded from the sentence of death?

10. At present the Supreme Court has limited jurisdic-
tion when a High Court has passed, conﬁrmed or upheld in
appeal a sentence of death (<a href="/doc/1446285/" id="a_14">article 134</a> of the Constitution
and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_15">section 411A</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>). Are you
in favour of enlarging the powers of the Supreme Court
so that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court as a
matter of right in all cases in which a sentence of death
has been passed or conﬁrmed or upheld by the High
Court?

11. (a) Have you any suggestions to make with res-
pect to the power of the President and the Governor to
grant pardon, reprieve, respite or remission in respect of
the punishment of death or to suspend, remit or commute
the sentence of death under articles 72 and 161 of the
Constitution and the power of the Government to suspend,
remit or commute such sentence under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_17">sections 401-402</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">
Criminal Procedure Code</a>?

(b) What, in your opinion, should be the prjnciples
which should guide and the procedure which should be
followed in the exercise of these powers?

12. At present, the sentence of death is carried out by
hanging. Have you any suggestions to make.with respect
to the manner in which a sentence of deathrr ' "carried
out?

A.I.R. 1952 Supreme Court 159--
1952 S.C.R. 526
(Fazl Ali, B. K. Mukherjea and Bose JJ.)
(Judgment by Bose J)

The appellant was convicted of the murder of a small
boy of 5 years and sentenced to death. On the facts, the
Supreme Court allowed the appeal ﬁled with special leave,
and acquitted him of the charge of murder and kidnap-
ping. He was, however, convicted of an offence under
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_37">section 201</a> following Begu v. The King Emperor'. The
Court pointed out, that where the murder committed is
particularly a cruel and revolting one, it is necessary to
examine the evidence with more than ordinary care, lest
the shocking nature of the crime might prevent a dis-
passionate judicial scrutiny of the facts and law.

(Patanjali Sastri, C. J. Mukerjea, Chandrasekhara Aiyer,
Bose and Ghulam Hasan JJ.)
(Judgment by Chandrasekhara Aiyar J.).

Sentence of death was, in this case, replaced by the
sentence of transportation of life, having, regard to the
time that had elapsed since the offence and to the fact
that the probable motive was one of prevention of cruelty
to a helpless women--to a wife who was ill-treated by
her husband. (In this case, the husband was murdered
by the accused. The husband used to ill--treat his Wife.
The accused murdered the husband for protecting her
from this cruelty).

(Mahajan, Bose, and Jagannadhadas JJ.)
(Judgment by Bose J .)

Death Sentence should ordinarily be imposed for
murder. [<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_41">Section 367</a> (5),<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_42"> Criminal Procedure Code</a> was
not referred to.] But, when the trial judge has imposed
the lesser punishment for reasons which are such that a
judicial mind could properly act on them, the appellate
Court should not interfere with the discretion.

In the instant case, the Sessions Judge convicted the
appellants under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_43">section 302</a>, Indian'<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_44"> Penal Code</a> and sen-
tenced them to transportation for life, as it was not possi-
ble to determine who inﬂicted the blows which were fatal
and who took a lesser part. The case was one in which
"no one has been convicted for his own act but is being
held vicariously responsible." The Punjab High Court
enhanced the sentence to death. The Supreme Court
held, that the Sessions Judge had a discretion which had
been judicially exercised. The discretion was his, and not
the High Court's.

Sentence reduced to transportation for lifel.

The accused, a woman of 20 years, was convicted of

occurrence, about an hour before sunset, she was seen
proceeding with the deceased in the direction of the scene
of occurrence. She came home Without the deceased in

The cloth was found to be stained with human blood, and
two ornaments of the deceased seen on the person of the
deceased when she was going towards the scene of murder,
were discovered at her instance from the thatch of her

The appellant was convicted of the murder of an old
woman of 70 years. The woman had died as a result of
shock caused by injuries on her chest. The circumstances
were such that the only reasonable inference was that the
injuries were caused by the appellant. The appellant had
an opportunity for the same and also strong motive to do
away with the old woman. He was in great hurry to
cremate the corpse and to dispose of the dead body.

He was convicted under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_48">section 302</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_49"> Indian Penal Code</a>
and sentenced to death by the Sessions Judge. The High
Court dismissed his appeal and conﬁrmed the sentence.
Having regard to these circumstances and to the fact that
the appellant did not care to inform the relations of the
dead woman, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction.
(Sentence was also upheld).

(Judgment by Fazl Ali J.)

In this case, which was heard by special leave on
appeal from the decision of the High Court at Nagpur,
the Supreme Court altered a conviction under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_51">section 302</a>,
Indian Panel Code into one under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_52">section 304</a>. This was a
case of sudden quarrel between the accused and the de-
ceased, which ensued in free ﬁght between the two parties
in which each party assaulted the other with sticks. The
accused dealt only one blow on the deceased, which re-
sulted in his death. The Sessions judge acquitted the
accused, while the High Court on appeal convicted him
under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_53">section 302</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_54"> Indian Penal Code</a> and sentenced him
to transportation for life.

On appeal, the Supreme Court held that this was a
case falling under the Fourth Exception to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_55">section 300</a> and
therefore. came within the Second Part of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_56">section 304</a>. The
accused had dealt only one blow, and the High Court's
observation that it could not be said that he had not taken
under advantage or acted in a cruel manner was not sup-
ported by the evidence.

(Sentence altered to rigorous imprisonment for ﬁve
years).

(Mahajan, B. K. Mukerjee and Jagannadhadas JJ.)
(Judgment by Mukherjee J.)

This was a case of cruel and premeditated murder for
which the appellant had been sentenced to death under
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_58">section 302</a>. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal
filed with special leave. As regards the argument of the
appellant that a good deal of time had elapsed since the
death sentence was imposed and that it should be com-
muted to one for transportation for life, the Supreme
Court observed that it was true that in proper cases an in-
ordinate delay in the execution of the death sentence may
be regarded as a ground for commuting it, but "We desire
to point out that this is no rule of law and is a matter
primarily for consideration of the local Government. If
the Court has to exercise a discretion in such matters,
the other facts of each case would have to be taken into
consideration."

(In the case before the court, there was no extenuating
circumstances and the murder was regarded as a cruel
and deliberate one, and therefore the court did not order
commutation).

There was circumstantial evidence to the effect that
the accused and the deceased were seen together at a parti-
cular time and that immediately after the murder, the
accused went to one B with gold, etc., and then next morn-
ing to a goldsmith with gold and silver. The silver was
identiﬁed as habitually worn by the deceased. The
Sessions Judge acquitted him of the oﬁence under sec-
tion 302,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_60"> Indian Penal Code</a> but convicted him under sec-
tions 394 and 323. Accused appealed. Government also

(Judgment by Das J.)

The appellant, though he did not inﬂict any blow, yet
shared the common intention to kill the deceased and was
present on the spot with his lathi. He was convicted under
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_65">section 302</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_66"> Indian Penal Code</a> read with <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_67">section 34</a> and
sentenced to death by the Sessions Judge. On appeal, the
High Court conﬁrmed the conviction and sentenced.

On appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction
and sentence. Counsel for appellant pleaded for mercy,
as he himself did not inﬂict any blow. The Supreme Court
rejected this plea, as the accused had shared the common
intention and was present on the spot with his lathi, While
his brother actually dealt the blow on the sleeping man.
"If there is any extenuating circumstances outside the
record, the appeal must be to authorities other than the
Courts of Law.".

(B. K. Mukherjee, S. R. Das and Bose J.J.)
(Judgment by Bose J.)

When appellate Judges who agree on the question of
guilt differ on that of sentence, it is usual not to impose
the death penalty, unless there are compelling reasons. So
observing, the Supreme Court in this case reduced the
sentences of death of two persons (to transportation for
life) in View of the fact that in the High Court, there was
difference of opinion regarding them, not only as to guilt
but also as to sentence.

(Also discusses <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_71">section 34</a>, Indian Penal Co-de).

NOTE :----Where there is a diﬂerence of opinion as to guilt, certain other small
points also arise:---«

(a) Is the third Judge bound to agree with the acquitting opinicn,
in me absence of strong and compelling reasons? There is
some controversy In re Nzmiah, A.I.R. I959 A.P. 313, 318,
Paragraph 15, Uma Maheshwaran I. answered this in the
afﬂrmative disagreeing with In re Sitaramayya, A.I.R. 1953
Mad. 61, 63 (Paragraph 5), 66 (paragraph 18). For a contrary
view, see Mistri 1). King I.L.R. (1949) I Cal. 43. It would
seem that the third Judge is not bound by any such limitation.

(Bhagwati, Venkatarama Ayyar, Sinha JJ.)
(Judgment by Sinha J.)

The appellant was in intimacy with the wife of the de-
ceased and this was the motive for the crime. On the night of
the occurrence, the appellant and the deceased went out
together, and only the appellant returned. Blood stained
marks were seen on appellant's shoes during the investi-
gation, and he was arrested. Thereafter blood-stained
clothes were also discovered with him. A sword was re-
covered at the scene of offence at his instance, and there
was other evidence also. He was convicted and sentenced
to death. The conviction was upheld by the Allahabad
High Court, which conﬁrmed the sentence also.

While discussing the appeal filed on certiﬁcate granted
by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1461463/" id="a_76">article 134(1) (c</a>), the Supreme
Court very strongly criticised the High Court for granting
the certiﬁcate. The High Court's order was described as
erroneous. There was no substantial question of law or
principle involved and the High Court would not be
justiﬁed in granting a certiﬁcate. Attention of the High

(Bhagwati and Chandrasekhara Aiyar, JJ.)
(Judgment by Chandrasekhara Aiyar J.)

The appellant, a retired military Jamadar was charged
with the murder of a young boy aged about 16 years. They
along with others went to attend a marriage in another
village and went to the house of the bride to take the
midday meal. Some persons has settled down in their
seats and some had not. The appellant who was very
drunk and intoxicated, asked, the boy to step aside a little
so that he may occupy a convenient seat, but the boy did
not move and the appellant whipped out a pistol and shot
the boy in the abdomen. The boy died. It was found
that though the appellant was under the influence of drink,
he was not so much under the inﬂuence that his mind was
so obscured that there was incapacity in him to form the
required intention.

His drunkenness and absence of pre-meditation were
taken by the Sessions into account regarding the sentence.

24
He was therefore convicted of murder under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_79">section 302</a>,
but awarded the lesser penalty.

An appeal to the PEPSU High Court was unsuccess-
ful. The Supreme Court granted special leave, limited to
the question, whether the offence committed fell under
<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_80">section 304</a> of the Penal Code, having regard to the provi-
sions of <a href="/doc/420874/" id="a_81">section 86</a> of the Penal Code.

The Supreme Court held, that while it was true that
drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of enter-
taining requisite intent should be taken into consideration
along with other facts proved inorder to determine whether
or not he had this intent, yet in this case the drunkenness
had not proceeded to that degree. The accused had failed
to prove such incapacity as would have been available to
him as a defence. The oifence was not reduced from
murder to culpable homicide and "the conviction and
sentence are right.".

The case contains an excellent discussion of the effect
of drunkenness and approves of the proposition laid down
by the House of Lords in D.P.P. V. Board1 and summarised
in Russel on Crime, 10th Edition, page 63 on the subject.

and Sinha JJ.)
(Judgment by Bose J.)

Appellant was convicted under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_83">section 302</a> for murder-
ing one 'A' and sentenced to death. There was longstand-
ing litigation in which the appellant and the deceased were
on opposition sides. There was a ﬁght between the son-in-
law of the deceased and the appellant. The deceased, not par-
ticipating in the ﬁght, merely asked the son-in-law to stop
ﬁghting, and said that he would settle their dispute.
Thereupon the appellant stabbed the deceased with a pen-
knife which he drew out from his Waist, and hit him on
the chest causing injury which eventually killed the
deceased. The injury was sufficient in the ordinary course
of nature to cause death. Two special facts to be noted
are, that the ﬁght was started by a slap by the son-in-law
on the face of appellant, resulting in a minor scufﬂe
between the two: and that the pen-knife was drawn out
by the appellant from his waist. He was convicted under
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_84">section 302</a> and sentenced to death.

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction and held
that exception 4 to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_85">section 300</a> did not apply, since it was
impossible to say that there was no undue advantage
taken when the accused stabbed the unarmed person who
had no threatening gesture and merely wanted to stop

ﬁghting.

1. I920 A.C. 479.



25

On the question of sentence the Supreme Court made
the following observations while reducing it to transpor-
tation of life:------

"VVe feel the lesser sentence is called for, because the
slap on the face evidently made the appellantwho appears
to be a hot--blooded man lose control of himself. That
would not afford justification for killing an innocent by-
stander who intervened with a mild admonition to the
appellant's adversary to stop ﬁghting. But We feel that
on the question of sentence this is not the type of case in
which the death sentence is called for. There was no pre-
imeditation and the knife was not ready in the hand but
was drawn from the waist after the appellant had been
slapped and the qurrel between the (son-in-law) and
him had started."

observed' as follows:------

"The circumstances disclosed in the evidence
point to the conclusion that the oﬁence was committed
after a pre--concerted plan to set ﬁre to the cottage
after the man had as usual occupied the room and

X and Y Were charged under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_90">section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_91">34</a> Indian
Penal Code with the murder of S. Both were armed with
riﬂes and had the common intention of killing B, but the
shot ﬁred by them at B resulted in the death of S. Some of
the injuries received by S were sufficient in the ordinary
course of nature to cause death, but it was not established
which of the two accused was responsible for those fatal
injuries. The Sessions Judge convicted both and passed
the sentence of death. The High Court in the conﬁrma-
tion proceedings conﬁrmed the sentence of death on X
but reduced the sentence on Y to transportation for life.

X appealed by special leave to the Supreme Court, the
appeal being limited to the question of sentence only. Con-
tention of X was, that the common intention to kill B
could not, by <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_92">section 301</a>, be transferred to the murder by
B of S, because there was at no time any common inten-
tion to murder S. Held, on the evidence on record there
was nothing which could necessarily lead to the conclu-
sion that it was the appellant X who was responsible for
inflicting the fatal injuries on the deceased. If it was
doubtful as to who out of the two responsible, there was
nothing to choose between X and Y. If Y was awarded
the lesser penalty, there was equally good reason in
favour of X also. Further, the act of the Appellant X
would certainly fall within <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_93">section 326</a> involving trans-
portation for life. Under these circumstances, there was
no justiﬁcation for conﬁrming the death sentence award-
ed to X. The High Court should not have distinguished
the case of X. Conviction under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_94">section 302</a> read with 34,
conﬁrmed, but sentence reduced to transportation for life.

In this case, there Was no tangible evidence (direct or
circumstantial) of the murder. The Supreme Court observ-
ed, "It IS true that in law a conviction for an offence does
not necessarily depend upon the corpus delicti being
found." But, on the evidence, the Supreme Court gave
the beneﬁt of doubt to the appellants as regards the

oﬁence of murder, and set aside the conviction for murder
and sentence of death confirmed by the High Court of

Allahabad.

The case was one of conspiracy to extort Rs. 10,000
from one C by kidnapping and murdering his son aged
about 14 years. On the facts, the Supreme Court regarded
it as proved that the appellants had kidnapped the boy.

and dragged him out of his shop to the road, and the first
appellant gave him several blows in the front part of the
chest with an "aruval" (cutting instrument about 2 feet
long including the handle). K fell down on his back and
cried out for help. His wife tried to rescue him and put

</p>
<p id="p_3">The Supreme Court, while dismwssmg the appeal, after
positions of importance. First, it was argued that the pro-
positions of importance. First, it was argued that the pro-
secution case was based entirely on the evidence of one
witness----the wife of the deceased, (the 'other witnesses
being not reliable) and that conviction in a capital case
could not be based on a single witness. The court rejected
this argument as totally untenable. It drew attention to
<a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_105">section 134</a> of the Evidence Act, under which no particular
number of witnesses was required for proving any fact,
As far back as 1872, it said, the legislature, having con-
sidered the pros and cons, had decided that it should not
be necessary for the proof or disproof of a fact to call a
particular number of witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_4">If the Legislature were to insist upon plurality of wit-
nesses, cases where the testimony of a single witness only
could be available in proof of the crime would go un-
punished. If the testimony of a single witness is found to
be entirely reliable, there is no legal impediment to the
conviction on such proof. Moreover, if courts were, irres-
pective of the quality of the evidence of a single witness, to
insist on plurality of witnesses, they would be indirectly
encouraging subordination of witnesses in situations where
only one witness is available. There might be exceptions
to this rule, for example, in cases of sexual offences or of
the testimony of an approver. But where there are no
such exceptional reasons operating, it becomes the duty
of the court to convict, if it is satisﬁed that the testimony
of a single witness is entirely reliable. The court had, in
this case, no reason for not accepting the testimony of the
wife "which is the only reliable evidence in support of
the prosecutionl.

death should not have been imposed on him. This was
repelled by the Supreme Court as Mizaji fully shared the
common object. He also carried the pistol from his house
and must have been taken to have carried it for using
it and he did use it. "Merely because a son uses a pistol

also struck the appellant's party. The deceased received

were acquitted (as the evidence did not prove the case

raised by the appellant was that since 10 persons out of 13
had been acquitted, the remaining 3 persons could not

A number of points were involved in this case. But for
the present purpose, the case is noted for its discussion of
the law relating to grave and sudden provocation consti-
tuted by confession of adultery by a wife to her husband.
The court pointed out, that words and gestures may also
under certain circumstances cause grave and sudden pro-
vocation in India. On the facts of the case, it was held,
that though the confession by the wife of the accused of
illicit intimacy with the deceased had caused momentary
loss of self-control, yet after this the accused drove his
wife and children to a cinema, left them there, went to
his ship and took revolver and loaded it, did some oﬁicial
bus'ness and drove his car to the oﬂice of the deceased
and then to his ﬂat and then went to the bed room of the
deceased and shot him. Interval between the time of his
leaving his house and the time for murder was 3 hours--
sufﬁcient for regaining self-control. Hence the case did
not fall within exception 1 to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_122">section 300</a> and the accused
was rightly convicted of murder. (The High Court had,

234</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_126">239</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_127"> Criminal Procedure Code</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_128">section 271</a>

to joint trials for offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_130">section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_131">section 307</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_132">
Indian Penal Code</a> were decided. But for the present
purpose, the point of importance is one of sentence on B.
B armed with a gun and R armed with an axe passed the
ﬁeld of L. L asked B Where he was going. He replied that
he was going for shooting birds. L turned back. B ﬁred
two shots at L who fell down and died. B and R then
proceeded southwards and after going about seven fur-
longs met Bhagwan who questioned where he was going.
B said that he was going to shoot crocodiles. Bhagwan
said that there were no crocodiles and asked B to go back.
When Bhagwan turned South, B ﬁred a shot at him. Bhag-
wan sat down and B again ﬁred at him and again ﬁred
two more shots. Bhagwan died.
</p>
<p id="p_30">B was found guilty under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_133">section 302</a> Indian Penal Code
for murders of L and of Bhagwan and sentenced to death
for both the murders. He was also found guilty under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_134">section 307</a> and convicted and sentenced to 8 years'
rigorous imprisonment. (This was in respect of an
attempt to murder later, after the villagers had pursued the
appellant). R was found guilty under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_135">section 302</a> read

with <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_136">section 34</a> and sentenced to life imprisonment for the»

murder of L. and of Bhagwan. He was also found guilty
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_137">section 307</a> read with <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_138">section 34</a> and sentenced to 5
years rigorous imprisonment.
</p>
<p id="p_31">(There were points regarding irregularities, etc., not
relevant for the present purpose). It was urged on be-
half of B, that the sentence of death was too severe, as
the shots at L were the result of the provocation consti-
tuted bv certain conversation with B and there was no
motive for shooting at L. This argument was repelled,
ﬁrst, because the courts below had not believed B's ver-
sion of the conversation and secondly, because the con-
versation even if believed was not such as to provoke B to

ﬁring at L twice. Further, there was no justiﬁcation for'
ﬁring at Bhagwan without provocation. Hence sentence»

of death was not reduced by the Supreme Court.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">33</span>
<p id="p_32">As regards R, however, it was held that the evidence
did not prove the offence against him and that his running
away from the scene was merely the result of his antici-
pating popular reaction. He was acquitted.

Majority judgment of Kapur, Subba Rao and Shah JJ
held that as both the trial court and the High Court had
found that the deceased, wife of the accused, had died as
a result of burns caused by ﬁre set to her clothes by the
accused who had sprinkled kerosene oil on her and this
ﬁnding was supported by her dying declaration against
which no cogent reasons were given, the conviction based
on such evidence was sustainable.

On appeal by the State the accused was sentenced by the
High Court to death. The accused applied for certiﬁcate
to appeal to the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/1050900/" id="a_140">article 134(1) (a</a>),
but the certiﬁcate was refused and the Supreme Court gave
special leave under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_141">article 136.</a> Ultimately, however, in
this case the majority of the court held that the appellant
was entitled to a certiﬁcate under <a href="/doc/1050900/" id="a_142">article 134(1) (a</a>), because
since the appellant had in the trial court been acquitted of
the offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_143">section 302</a> and convicted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_144">section
304</a>, Part I, the High Court's order reversing the acquittal
and substituting an acquittal under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_145">section 304</a> was one of

must have ended in the complete acquittal, and must
include a case where the accused is acquitted of murder
but convicted of a lesser offence. 1

and was dismissed. Question of sentence was not as such

in itself, the declarant suddenly collapsed so that his thumb
impression could not be aﬁixed in his life time and was
taken by the Sub--Inspector after his death on the statement

had no improper motive in taking the thumb impression

(Judgment by the Chief Justice.)

These appeals from judgments of different High Courts
were heard together as raising common question of law
regarding the special Criminal Court Ordinance. For our
purpose, the case is of interest only for the observations
regarding death sentence. lln one of the appeals before the
court, the death sentence had been imposed several months
ago and the appellants had been lying ever since under
threat of execution, delay having been caused largely by
the time taken in proceedings regarding constitutionality
of the ordinance creating the courts, etc. The Court
observed, that it had power to substitute lesser sentence
where there had been in ordinate delay (in cases which
came before it) even though the sentence when originally
imposed was right. But this was a jurisdiction which
any court should be slow to exercise, being a jurisdiction
closely entrenching on the powers and duties of the execu-
tive. Accordingly, in cases Nos. 40, 41 and 42, the court
refused to reduce the sentences from death the transporta-
tion, in view of the other circumstances of those cases.
(But, the courts said, it had no doubt that the executive
would give full consideration to the period that elapsed
and the mental suffering undergone by the convict.).
</p>
<p id="p_43">In case No. 47, the appellant was a young man of 25,
twice widowed, who had killed his aunt (father's wife)



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">35</span>

and who had, after being senten
reason while awaiting the execution and was now detained
as a lunatic. The court reduced his sentence to transpor-
tation for life on the ground that the appellant probably
suffered from an unbalanced mind.

This case is of importance for the proposition laid down
(by Zafrulla Khan J., Spens C. J. Concurring) that in a
case of conviction under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_151">section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/1060179/" id="a_152">section 149</a>,

transportation for the life could not be accepted. The
question of sentence is to be decided on the facts of each
case. (On the facts of the case, it was held that since
there had been a ﬁnding that the appellants were among
the seven or eight persons, who inﬂicted large number of
injuries, the sentence of death was appropriate).
</p>
<p id="p_46">Varrdachariar J. had, on the facts some difficulty in
sustaining the sentence of death on accused No. 1, as he
had a doubt whether accused No. 1, inﬂicted any wound.
But, since the question was bound up with inferences of
facts with which "it was not the ordinary practice" of the
Federal Court to interfere, and since his brother judges
thought that death sentence was justified, he left the
matter there.

The Bombay Special Bench of Abdul Kedar Allm-akhia°
is interesting. The appellant had been convicted by Lokur
J. and a special jury under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_154">section 302</a>, Renal Code for the
murder of his own daughter and only child--a girl of about
14 years--a.nd found by unanimous verdict to be guilty
and sentenced by the Judge to transportation for life.

the conviction and sentence were set aside, and the case
sent to the next Sessions to be dealt with according to law.
The reasons for setting aside the conviction were these.
The accused had asked the committing Magistrate for
legal aid. But, at the opening of the Sessions, he was-
arraigned to plead without counsel. So arraigned and
asked to plead, he said that he was guilty. In the charge'
to the jury, the judge referred to the plea of guilty, though
the judge made it clear that he (the Judge) did not accept
the plea and that the plea was not before the Jury. These»
two "irregularities--taking the plea of guilty without
counsel, an-d referring to it in the charge to jury--were-
held to vitiate the trial. (Stone C.J.2 also observed that
without proper safeguards, the plea of guilty should not
be accepted. These safeguards he said, must include the
accused's representation by counsel who must be in a
position to answer the questions of the Court with regard
to whether the accused knows what he is going and the
consequences of his plea and also a medical report or
medical evidence upon him). Lacuna in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_157">section 272</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_158">
Criminal Procedure Code</a> Was also pointed out by Sen J.

not wish to convict him in exercise of the discretion con»

In this case, the Sessions Judge of Meerut requested
the High Court to set aside the conviction recorded by his
predecessor (and affirmed in appeal by the High Court),
on the ground that on certain material that had since come
to the knowledge of the District Magistrate the conviction
was wrong. This application by the Sessions Judge for
revision, it was held, could not be entertained. The Dist-
rict Magistrate may, it was suggested, refer the matter to
the Local Government for exercising its power under sec-
tion 401 and 402,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_161"> Criminal Procedure Code</a>.

from epileptic ﬁts and, because of that, was liable tolnse
self-control on the slightest provocation. He was sent-
enced to transportation for life. The High Court upheld
the conviction and sentence. It also made a recommenda-
tion to the State Government for exercise of the preroga-
tive of mercy, under <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_178">section 401</a> Cr. P.C. and for "substan-

In this case the fatal attack was not premeditated and
the victims were injured in the heat of passion on a
sudden quarrel. There was, however, no ﬁght and the

livered with a "dang" on the head and therefore the court
observed, the assailant must be deemed to have intended
to cause bodily injury which he knew was likely to cause
death. Conviction under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_183">section 302</a> was upheld, but

one hand, the accused was responsible directly for the
murder of the wife and constructively for that of the
husband, and that the double murder was committed after
premeditation and in cold blood. On the other hand, the
accused was a boy of 17 and, while youth alone was no
extenuating circumstance, there was the additional cir-
cumstance that the accused had no personwl enmity with
the victims and was probably a tool in the hands of the
victims' enemies who had been acquitted by the Sessions
Judge. Hence the sentence was reduced to transportation
for life. '

A.I.R. 1929, Patna 161, = I.L.R. 8 Patna 181,
(Courtney--Terrell, C. J. and Macpherson J.)
(Judgment by the Chief Justice)

In this case, 18 persons were convicted by the Sessions
Judge under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_185">section 302</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_186"> Indian Penal Code</a> for the murder
of a constable M. Two of them were sentenced to death,
and the remaining to transportation for life. The facts
were these. The accused Who had been sentenced to death
had long been suspected as dangerous criminals implicat-
ed in various dacoities and robberies. There were com-
plaints of thefts against them, and also a proceeding under
<a href="/doc/291822/" id="a_187">section 110</a> Cr. P.C.\' pending against them. One prosecu-
tion witness in one of these proceedings lodged an infor-
'mation at a police station, charging the appellants and
other unknown persons with the theft of 6 bullocks. The
F.I.R. was recorded and a police party sent to the village
for investi'g_ation. Thereafter, a party consisting of cons-
table M (deceased) and another constable, etc., was sent
'to arrest the appellants by the Sub-Inspector. Two hours

<p id="p_104">after this, the Sub-inspector himself, set out, taking with:
</p>
<p id="p_105">him a shot gun and six cartridges. When he arrived near
the place, he heard an outcry that the constables he had
sent had been beaten. He went to the spot and found the
constable M (deceased) with his arm broken and bound
in a sling, and the other constable had marks of lathi
blows. It appears that constable M when he tried to
arrest appellants S and I was resisted, and then_ about 14
or 15 men including the appellants ran up with lathis and
beat the constables inﬂicting the injuries. The Sub-
Inspector, again, after recording the F.I.R. for this inci-
dent, went in the direction of the house of appellant S for
investigating the matter of the theft and for arresting the
appellants. His party was again opposed by a big mob
of persons armed with spears and lathis. The Sub-
Inspector's party included the injured constable, M.M
tried to remonstrate with the mob, but he was immediate-
ly struck down by a spear wound in the chest and a lathi
blow on the head, each of which wounds was separately
of a fatal character. The attack by the mob still continu-
ed, and the Sub--Inspector had to ﬁre. Three persons in
the mob, R. S. and J. armed with spears, took refuge in a
house, R. S. ("id J. were arrested by force by the police.
</p>
<p id="p_106">The High Court, while conﬁrming the conviction, re-
jected the argument that those appellants who had been
sentenced to death should be awarded the lesser sentence.
The argument was, that where a large number of persons
had participated in a murder and where it may be un-
desirable that a large number should undergo the death
penalty, only those who took the active part were selected
for death penalty. The High Court rejected this as un-
sound. In its opinion prima facte all the persons convict-
ed should be sentenced to death penalty, and it was only
Where special circumstances were shown in favour of any
individual that the court should sentence him to the lesser
penalty. There were no special circumstances in favour
of the appellants who were sentenced to death. In its
opinion, R. S. and J. armed with lethal weapons and tak-
ing a foremost place in the assault should also have been
sentenced to death, but it was not the practice of the
Court, except in extreme cases, to enhance the sentence.
(Hence their sentence was not enhanced).

(C. C. Ghose J. on difference of opinion between Cuming J.
and S. K. Ghose J.)

Accused was charged with murdering his wife. The
wife was staying with her father, and apparently there



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">43</span>

was at the time of marriage some arrangement that accus-
ed should stay with the father--in-law (as a ghar-Jamai).
The accused was not satisﬁed with this arrangement, and.
went away to his house. The girl remained with her
father, though she did go to her husband's house from
time to time. Relations between the accused and the
father--in-law were not cordial. On the day of occurrence,
the accused went to his father-in-law's house and stayed
there for a day and also on the next day. Next day even-
ing he went out returned at night, and, after taking his
meal retired to the upper room, where his wife joined him;
and the door was bolted. Next morning, the aunt of the
wife, seeing that the wife did not come down, went up-
stairs to call her. On pushing the door, she found the
wife dead in a pool of blood with a number of wounds.
The accused was not there. He remained absconding for
six weeks and surrendered himself after a proclamation
was issued and his property attached.
</p>
<p id="p_108">On these facts, in the Sessions Court, ﬁve members of
the Jury found him not guilty and the remaining four
found him guilty. The Sessions Judge referred the case
to the High Court under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_189">section 307</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_190"> Criminal Procedure
Code</a>. Both the Judges hearing the reference in the High
Court agreed about the guilt of the accused; but there was
difference of opinion about the sentence. Cuming J.
observing that it was a cruel and brutal murder perpe-
trated apparently without motive on a defenceless girl
in her sleep, thought that there was no ground for not
giving him the sentence of death. Quoting <a href="/doc/940370/" id="a_191">section 367(5)</a>
Criminal Procedure Code (as it stood then), he observed:--
</p>
<p id="p_109">"It is clear that the sentence of death has been
considered as the normal sentence and the sentence of
transportation for life as the abnormal sentence for
which reasons are required to be given."
</p>
<p id="p_110">S. K. Ghose J E' regarded the sentence of transportation
for life as sufficient. First, he pointed out, the murder'
was committed in a ﬁt of desparate resentment in circum-
stances for which the accused was not entirely to be blam-
ed. Secondly, the accused had borne a uniformly good'
character, had been good towards his wife's relations and
not outwardly quarrelsome. Thirdly, his last visit was
one of many that had ended in failure. Fourthly, it was
found that the weapon had not been taken by the accused,
but was already there in the room, being a sacriﬁcial knife

editor of the C.W.N. See (1929) 33 C.W.N. (journal) page 185.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">44</span>
<p id="p_111">kept in the room. (The father-in-law of the accused was
a professional sacriﬁcer, who kept the knife there to avoid
its use by chi-ldren.) The provision in the Criminal Pro-
cedure Code, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_192">section 367</a>, was regarded by S.K. Ghose J.
as a one of procedure only. It did not take away the
Court's duty to see that in a particular case the punish-
ment ﬁtted thecrime. Reasons for death sentence, it was
true, were not required to be stated by any express provi-
sion in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_193">section 367</a>, "but these reasons must exist in the
mind of the Judge. It is unthinkable that the Judge will
pass a sentence of death in preference to the alternative
sentence without good and sufficient reasons.".
</p>
<p id="p_112">The matter was referred to C. C. Ghose J. owing to
this difference of opinion. C. C. Ghose J. agreed with
S. K. Ghose J. that the facts of the case justiﬁed the lesser
sentence, because the accused committed the murder in
the fit of desperate resentment, and was a mere lad of 20
years. Moreover, his repeated visits had ended in failure.
"The. question of appraising the sentence to be passed on
a prisoner is at all times a difficult one. But I think in
this case it would not be straining the language of sec-
tion 367 if I were to hold that the prisoner should be
sentenced to transportation for life." (Apparently, he
agreed with S. K. Ghose J. on the interpretation of sec-
</p>
<p id="p_113">'tion 367<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_194"> Criminal Procedure Code</a> also, though the point

is not discussed in his judgment.)

(Raza and Pullan JJ.)

Accused was found guilty of murdering a small boy of
six, for his ornaments. He was sentenced to transporta-
tion for life. For imposing the lesser sentence, the
Sessions Judge had given three reasons----(i) the accused
was a young lad of 18; (ii) he may still reform; and (iii)
there was no premeditation. The Local Government ap-
plied in revision for enhancement. The Chief Court
heard the appeal of the accused also regarding conviction.
</p>
<p id="p_114">' The Chief Court upheld the conviction.
</p>
<p id="p_115">As to sentence, the Chief Court observed that there is
no law which justiﬁes a court in not passing a sentence
of death on any person merely because he is young. All
persons who can understand the nature of their acts are
liable to the extreme penalty of the law. Youth may be
taken into consideration where the accused is not able to
understand the nature of his act or acts under the inﬂuence
of others. But this was deliberate murder for greed.
Next, the consideration that the accused may still reform



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">45</span>

"should be excluded entirely in all questions where a

capital sentence can be inﬂicted. It is not for the legis-
</p>
<p id="p_116">lature to reform murderers." The sentence of death was
primarily a deterrent one. The lesser sentence was im-
posed where some extenuating circumstance was there and
it was not necessary in the interest of the public at large
that the sentence of death should be inﬂicted. The
sentence was enhanced to death.

the sentence as quite proper, as this was a cold-blooded
and premeditated murder at a time when 'the deceased
was peacefully engaged in his plough and was unarmed.

at about "rotiwela" (between 10 and 11 in the morning)

ence, M struck "her several times with the buttend and of
the gun. The accompanying three children could oﬁer no

In this case the High Court enhanced the sentence of
transportation for life to death in the case of all the three
accused. The facts of the case were, that the three accus-
ed murdered one P who was acting as a lambardar and
who used to assist the police in criminal matters. He used'
to give information to the police concerning crimes com-
mitteed by two of the accused. Some days before the-
murder, a relation of one of the accused told P that he
should stop giving information to the police, failing which
something would happen to him. Thereafter, P and his:
nephew were attacked by the three accused who had hid-
den themselves to wait for P's arrival. 15 injuries were



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">49</span>

inflicted on P, out of which 10 were on the head. The
Sessions Judge awarded the lesser sentence on the ground
that it could not be said which of the accused gave a fatal
blow.
</p>
<p id="p_138">The High Court rejected this approach. The mere fact
it was impossible to say who actually inﬂicted the fatal
wound was not a reason for a lesser punishment when the
court was satisﬁed that there was a common intention to
murder, brutally carried out and that all persons took part
in the beating, the result of which was death. In this case
there were no less than 10 wounds on the head; and pro-
bably each of the accused gave a blow on the head; the
only other alternative was that While only One accused
was beating the head, the others were giving blows on the
body. It would make no difference if either of these alter-
natives was the fact. Hence the sentences were enhanced
to death.

In this case, the High Courtcnhanced the sentence of
three persons from transportation for life to death.
</p>
<p id="p_161">The Sessions Judge, while convicting them of murder
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_222">section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/115231/" id="a_223">148</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_224"> Indian Penal Code</a> had impos-
ed the sentence of transportation for life on the ground
that all the accused were young men of 20 or belou_&gt; and
none of the injuries inﬂicted to the deceased were indivi-
dually fatal. The High Court strongly criticised this atti-
tude. The normal sentence for murder was death; the
Judge could give reasons for imposing the lesser 'penalty
but the reasons given by him were not conclusive and
were open to revision. "It is only when any.well recog-
nised ground is found to exist that the judge is justified
in withholding the capital punishment". (The High Court
then proceeded to enumerate a few extenuating circums-
tances' but it made it clear that the classiﬁcation was not
exhaustive or absolute). It regarded age as insuﬂicient
ground for leniency, since the offenders were not of ex-
treme youth and had not acted under inﬂuence of any
elder. The fact that the injuries were not individually
fatal, was also regarded as irrelevant to sentence (though
it might be relevant on the question where the offence
was murder). Again, the Sessions Judge had expressed
the View that it would be extremely hard to send all the
four accused to gallows. The High Court pointed out, that
every sentence worked hardship on the man sentenced
and on others. But that was not a circumstance that ever
entered into a judicial determination of the sentence to
be awarded. Sentence enhanced to death.

The accused committed 4 murders in succession and
was sentenced by the Sessions Judge after conviction under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_226">section 302</a> to death. The persons murdered were one
woman and three children. It appears that he was not
on _ good terms with his wife, and because of their bad re-
lations, the wife left his house to stay with her sister. In
spite of his request she did not return. This had enraged
him. Next morning the Wife Wanted some money and

I . Paragraph 8 in the A.I_R,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">52</span>

made a request to the accused, whereupon the accused got
enraged and threw the keys on her. The wife picked up
the keys and went near the money box. This further en-
raged the accused, who, (to prevent and punish his wife)
proceeded to the ﬁrst floor where the box was kept. The
minor son of the brother-in--law (wife's brother) of the
accused was the ﬁrst to be the subject of the anger of the
accused, who killed him by causing not less than 13 in-
juries with a sharp knife. He then attacked his wife.
When his wife was rescued by the wife of his brother-in-
law with a daughter in the lap, they were killed by the
accused. The accused also injured another young daugh-
ter of the accused's brother-in-law.
</p>
<p id="p_166">On his appeal to the High Court, the High Court con-
ﬁrmed the conviction. A plea of insanity was taken on
behalf of the accused in the Appellate Court, though not
in the lower court. The Court held that insanity of the
nature required by <a href="/doc/1433889/" id="a_227">section 84</a> of the Penal Code had not
been proved. A crime is not excused by its own atrocity.
No experf had been called to prove his mental condition,
and a mere opinion by one Doctor that the accused may
have been in a temporary ﬁt of mania at the time of the
incident did not help very much. The Court was, however,
of the opinion that the sentence ought to be altered to
one of transportation for life. The accused had no motive
to kill the woman and her three children. The motive,
if any, was against the wife, who however was not killed.
It was in evidence that the accused loved and used to feed
the children killed by him. There was no prearrangement,
no accomplice and no secrecy. Under a strong and sudden
impulse without any motive he had committed the mur-
ders. He was completely unhinged, and had lost the bal-
ance of his mind, and acted abnormally under an impulse
which proved too strong for him. These were extenuating
circumstances which impelled the Court to modify the
sentence. The Court reduced the sentence to transporta-
tion for life and also recommended to the Provincial Gov-
ernment that the case may be dealt with under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_228">section

Ezlotive of the crime was dispute regarding niuiaiiuii of

ditional Sessions Judge convicted the appellant of the
offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_231">section 302</a> Indian Penal Code and sentenc-

ing the lesser sentence was, that the appellant was not

the murder but took part in the murder simply to oblige
R.
</p>
<p id="p_174">On appeal to the High Court, the High Court confirmed
the conviction and regarded the above reason for impos-

of a brutal kind and there were no extenuating circum-

a circumstance. However, though the State made an ap-

not grant it, considering the fact that the appellant had

This was a case of double murder by a youth aged 16.
He murdered one G by cutting his neck with an "aruval"

(Wanchoo C. J. and Ranawat J.)
(Judgment by Wanchoo C.J.)

The appellant in this case was convicted of murder of
a boy aged 14 years and sentenced to death by the Sessions
Judge. A marriage party had come to the village and was
staying in a mango-grove (bageechi). In that connection.
a lot of drinking had been going on since the morning, and
the appellant was also one of those who had been drink-
ing. At about 6 p.m. while the deceased boy was picking
raw mangoes in the "bags-echi" with another boy, the
appellant turned up in the bageechi with a gun, went
past the people who were sitting there and suddenly shot
at the boy from a distance of about 10 paces. The boy fell
down and died. The other boy was slightly injured.
</p>
<p id="p_235">The appe1lant's theory was, that the gun went off by
accident and that he was intoxicated and did not know
what happened, because he was not in his senses.
</p>
<p id="p_236">These pleas were not accepted by the Sessions Judge.
On appeal to the High Court, the High Court also did not
accept the pleas on the facts. It also pointed out, that
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_264">section 300</a>, Fourth Exception,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_265"> Indian Penal Code</a>
read with illustration (d), an imminently dangerous act
was sufficient to bring the case within <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_266">section 300</a> and it
was not necessary that the gun should be aimed at a par-
ticular person. In the case before the court, further the



GU

evidence was that the appellant shot at the boy. Where
a person takes the risk of shooting at another, the act
would ordinarily be an imminently dangerous act which
just in all probability cause death etc.

However, as regards the sentence the High Court
pointed out two important features of the case:---
</p>
<p id="p_237">(in) There was no satisfactory evidence of motive.
(The father of the deceased had deposed that the
deceased had told the father that the deceased had
accidentally found the appellant having sexual in-
tercourse w3th his widowed sister-in-law). Assuming
that this was admissible, the High Court was hesitant
to accept this as a motive, and held that there was
no clear motive.
</p>
<p id="p_238">(ii) Though the appellant was responsible for
the natural consequences of his acts and guilty under
see 302, in the circumstances of the case intoxication
afforded as a sufficient excuse for not exacting the
extreme penalty of law. Since there was no evi-
dence for motive and the appellant was certainly
drunk, the sentence was reduced to transportation
for life'. In support of the reduction of sentence in
case of intoxication, the following cases were cit-ed:----

The appellant and one X intercepted two persons,

got hold of the cycle and asked one of the accountants to

</p>
<p id="p_252">9'2

The High Court conﬁrmed the conviction on the merits.
The argument, that since there was no pre-arrangement
to kill the accountant, the appellant could not be convict-
ed under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_278">section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_279">section 34</a>, was repelled.
"VVhen two persons start together for committing robbery
and one of them is armed with a revolver and the other
with knife, we may presume that the intention of these
two persons is to use the weapon if the necessity should
arise. . . ." Hence, the shooting was committed in further-
ance of the common intention and it was unnecessary to
established a pre-arranged plan for the murder of the
victim.
</p>
<p id="p_253">As regards sentence, having regard to the fact that it
was X who ﬁred the shots from a revolver and the injury
caused to the surviving accountant by the appellant was
of simple nature, the court felt that the ends of justice
would be met by reducing the sentence of death to one of
transportation for life.

The trial was held in the Sessions Division of the High
Court of Calcutta by S. K. Sen, J. They both appealed.
</p>
<p id="p_264">The facts were these. While the deceased was engaged
in conversation with one G, the two appellants came up.
The deceased told the appellants that he was having some
private conversation with G and they were intruding and
should move away. Appellant K said that he had no in-
tention to do anything of the kind and challenged the de-
ceased to do What he could. The deceased repeated his
request, but without any heed. Hence the deceased put
his hand on the back of appellant K and pushed him a few
cubits, whereupon appellant, A shouted out to appellant K
to strike the deceased down. Appellant A also grabbed
the deceased by the hands and held him fast. Appellant K
whipped out a knife and inﬂicted several injuries on the
person of the deceased, who later expired in the hospital in

the night.
</p>
<p id="p_265">The High Court, while conﬁrming the conviction, re-
duced the sentence on K to one of transportation for life



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">64</span>

in View of one feature of the case, "which bears very per-
tinently on the question of sentence and requires atten-
tion". That was this'. After the appellants had refused
to quit the place, it was the deceased who ﬁrst laid his
hand on Appellant 'K' and further started push1ng--the
pushing being of a somewhat vigorous kind. He was re-
sisted because each was pushing the other, and it was
during such affray that the knife was suddenly whipped
out and steel took the place of bare hands. "In those
circumstances, it appears to me that although no sudden
and grave provocation, such as would reduce the crime
from murder to a lesser offence can be made out, yet there
was such provocation as bears pertinently upon the
question of sentence, even if the provocation might have
been caused by the conduct of the ﬁrst appellant him-
self and, therefore, might not be a lawful excuse for the
act done by him". Hence the extreme penalty was not
called for. There was pushing, pushing for considerable
time and pushing between men who are notoriously or
excitable nature. (The Court made it clear that this did
not mean that an excitable person is entitled to go about
in the streets and do people to death whenever his will is
opposed. In this case, the physical assault was commenced
by the deceased and when the struggle grew, the fury of
the ﬁrst appellant fanned by the second appellant rose).
Hence the sentence on ﬁrst appellant 'K' was reduced.
(The sentence on the other appellant was maintained).

chayat the appellant and his father had kept in their

of abuse between the father of the deceased on the one
hand and appellant's father on the other hand. At the
sound of the exchange of abuse, the appellant's brothers
ran out of their house armed with sticks and the deceased
came out of his father's house. On the arrival of the

on him and the appellant spread him on the left side of

injury which had penetrated to a depth of 4% inches in-

<p id="p_289">The High Court, while conﬁrming the conviction, en-

was set aside as the offence was not committed for any
monetary gain.) The Court observed, that the normal sen-
tence for murder was death, and the discretion in award-
ing the sentence must be judicially exercised. In the in-
stant case, there was no extenuating circumstance. Some
2 or 3 years ago, the deceased and his brothers had been
convicted of an offence under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_306">sections 323</a> and <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_307">324</a> Indian

the accused to argue (as was done in the Sessions Court)
that they were in danger of their lives. If, with a View to
taking the law into his own hands, the accused planned
murder for wreaking vengeance, the proper sentence
should be death and not lesser one. Sentence enhanced.

The appellant had been convicted by the Sessions Judge
of murder of one M and sentenced to death. (He was also
convicted of an attempt to commit the murder of M's
daughter). On the Thursday preceding the day of occur-
rence a bullock belonging to the appellant's family had
died. On Saturday, the appellant's father went to one
"Bhagat", who told him that bullock had died due to witch-
craft practised by M. Annoyed at this, the appellant, be-
fore sunset, came with a "tangi" in his hand to the field
in which M and his daughter was watching the crops. He
gave several blows to M and killed him on the spot and
dragged M's body to a well at a distance of about 195 feet
and threw the body in that well. M's daughter raised hue
and cry, whereupon the appellant began to throttle her
with the intention of killing her. But one person heard
her cries and came to the place of occurrence, whereupon
the appellant left the daughter and went away saying, that
he would kill her mother.

The appellant, aged about 40 years, stabbed his wife
aged only 16 years. It appears that the appellant's wife
started frequently going to the house of a cousin of the
appellant and became intimate with him, and did not stop
the iminiacy in spite of the protests of the appellant. One
day, the appellant was sleeping in the "pial" of the house
and his wife was sleeping at the threshold of the house,
when the appellant heard a noise caused by the beating
of the coconut leaves with which the deceased was cover-
ing herself. Appellant asked her as to what the noise
was, and she replied that she was driving away mosqui-
toes. He again asked his wife as the dog was barking, but
the wife gave no satisfactory reply. Next morning, the
appellant questioned her about the previous night's inci-
dent, and the wife gave no satisfactory reply. On return-
ing fiom the ﬁeld, the appellant was found sharpening a
knife in the presence of the deceased and on being ques-
tioned, he replied that he was doing so to cut a goat. The
wife left his place and went to her uncle, being disgusted
with her husband's threats. A few days after, that, the
appellant stabbed and killed his wife. He was convicted
to murder by the Sessions Judge and sentenced to death.
</p>
<p id="p_297">The High Court conﬁrmed the conviction and sentence.
An argument was advanced before the High Court that the
conduct of the deceased provoked him to commit the act,
that the girl was unfaithful to him and that in spite of
repeated requests and threats the girl presisted in going
to Ms house and that in a ﬁt of passion the appellant stab-
bed her. High Court did not agree and pointed out that
the appellant had been sharpening his knife even in the
presence of the deceased and intended to use the knife
against the deceased. There was no circumstances at the
time of the commission of the offence which could be
taken into consideration for lesser penalty.
</p>
<p id="p_298">As regards the recommendation of the Sessions Judge
with regard to the desirability of commuting the sentence
to one of transportation for life, the High Court observed

In this case, 5 members of a family and a servant were
killed by the accused persons. Those killed included a
six months' old child. Injuries inﬂicted numbered 67. The
Court described it as a shocking crime which would per-
haps remain "unsurpassed in its ferocity". There was a
deliberate conspiracy to commit the murders and the con-
spiracy was carried out in a planned manner. Some of the
accused persons were acquitted and the remaining con-
victed, and out of those convicted some had been sentenc-
ed to death by the Sessions Judge. The conviction was
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_310">section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_311">sections 34</a>, <a href="/doc/1630403/" id="a_312">109</a> and <a href="/doc/1060179/" id="a_313">149</a>, In-

comprised conﬁrmation, State appeal against acquittal and
appeal against conviction by those convicted. The im-
portance of the case lies in the observations regarding
sentence and the ﬁnal order passed reducing the sentence
of accused Nos. 10 and 11 from death to imprisonment for
life.
</p>
<p id="p_305">The principle on which the reduction Was ordered Was,
that where several persons were involved in a murder'
and evidence was forthcoming to show who were the per-
sons who actually assaulted, then in a proper case the
court should discriminate 'between the various accused
on the ground of their major or minor part in the occur-
rence. After discussing several cases on the point whether
in a case of vicarious or joint liability or liability for com-
mon intention for the act of others, the court should dis-
criminate, the Court came to the conclusion that if a just

decision is to be arrived at, the Court Sh0ll1d f0110V_V the
principle laid down in Dalip Singh V. State of Punjabi to
the eﬁect that in cases where the facts are more fully
known and it is possible to determine who inﬂicted the
fatal blows and who took a lesser part, it would be a sound
exercise of judicial discretion to discriminate in the mat-
ter of punishment. The Court was not prevented from
doing so by the later Supreme Court case of <a href="/doc/64127/" id="a_315">Rishideo V.
State</a>'-', holding that the mere fact that the appellant did
not inliict a blow did not justify a lesser sentence. The
Court referred to What is known as the "Bawla murder

Determination of the right measure of punishment is a

may be that the trial court proceeded on wrong principle.
</p>
<p id="p_321">The assumption that the sentence of death was the nor-

pelled the contention that in a case of circumstantial evi-
dence the extreme penalty should not be imposedl. The
question of sentence was to be determined not with refer-
ence to the volume or character of evidence but with re-
ference to the fact whether there were any extenuating
circumstances. The Supreme Court case of Vadi Velu V.
State of Madras, A.I.R. 1957 Supreme Court 164 was cited
to the effect that the nature of proof had nothing to do
with the question of punishment. In the instant case,
there were no extenuating circumstances. Appellants act-
ed barbarously and killed 6 persons including 2 children
who were fast asleep. They committed the murders for
gain and were prepared for all eventualities and the mur-

In this case, the accused laboured under a strong delu-
sion that his wife was unfaithful. The brooding over the
character of the wife had an eﬁect on his mental faculties,
which effect was described by the medical witness as tak-
ing the form of temporary insanity. But it was not insa-
nity of the type mentioned in <a href="/doc/386905/" id="a_334">section 84</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_335"> Indian Penal

</p>
<p id="p_328">The High Court, while upholding the conviction, reduc~
ed the sentence to imprisonment for life, as the mental
state of the accused showed that it was not a proper case
for the extreme penalty. Tek Chand, J. pointed out that
according to medical evidence, the accused was sensible
in every respect but had a delusion about his wife's un--
faithfulness. This delusion did not mean that he was in-
capable of knowing the nature of the act, etc. Assuming
that his wife did have illicit relations, the law did not ex-
cuse taking the life of a faithless wife. But the circum-
stances of the case showed that the convict was unbalanc-
ed, was not quite normal and was labouring under an un-
shakable delusion. "A mental derangement which falls
short of unsoundness of mind as understood in law, is a
circumstance which must be taken into consideration in
awarding the sentence/'.

dian<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_341"> Penal Code</a> and sentenced to nine years' rigorous im-

cused and the deceased were strained, because of the
fact that the accused wanted to build some building on the
disputed land which the deceased did not like. There was
an altercation with exchanges of abuses between the ap-

the deceased with a lathi on the head. This single blow
caused the death of the deceased on the spot.
</p>
<p id="p_335">On appeal to the High Court, the High Court took the
View that the act of the txppellant clearly fell within sec-

injury had been inﬂicted intentionally; and if the injury
was such as was sufficient undoubtedly in the ordinary
course of nature to cause death, because, it had caused de-
pressed fracture of the skull and laceration of the brain

from her parent's house; then she came to a village and
obtained shelter in the cattle shed of one T. who, on dis-

She admitted that she had given birth to a child, but stated

It agreed that even in the absence of discovery or produc-

(Judgment by Tek Chand J.)

The accused was carrying on intrigues with a lady'
teacher in the Government Girls Middle School. He sus-
pected that M was also carrying on intrigues with that lady
teacher, and became jealous and exhorted the teacher not
to associate with M. The teacher persisted in mixing with
M, and the accused left her in anger. The teacher wrote a
letter to him that she would not have anything more to do
with M, but did not give up relations with M.
</p>
<p id="p_346">On the day of occurrence M came to her, stayed with
her and the two had meals together. At about 8.3') RM.
the accused came (all the way from Delhi) and knocked
at the door of the teachers house which was chained from
within. The teacher advised M to conceal himself behind
the outer door, so that M could escape while accused en-
tered. (She had recognised the voice of the accused). The
accused, suspecting that she was not alone, insisted that
he should bring some light. At that time M came up and
caught hold of the accused by the neck, whereupon the
accused attacked M with a "Chhura" (dagger), and M died
on the spot.
</p>
<p id="p_347">The accused was convicted of murder under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_349">section 302</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_350">

awarded him the lesser penalty of imprisonment

<p id="p_348">On appeal to the High Court, an argument was advanc-

there was no right of self-defence. It did not believe the
version that M had attacked the accused. But even if that
was true, that could not have caused in the mind of the
accused an apprehension of death or of grievous hurt. M
was unarmed, and on being taken unawares by the accused,
wanted to make good his escape. He was standing behind
the door so that he could run away. The accused was not
budging from the threshold, and was insisting on coming
face to face with his rival. "The moment he cast eyes on
him, he did not leave him till he had drawn blood by hav-
ing given him no less than 16 thrusts with his chhura."

(Judgment by Mudholkar J.)

The appellant was tried for the offence of the murder
of his wife. They used to quarrel quite often. On the
morning 0;" the date of offence. the appellant went to a ﬁeld
where his wife and others were carrying on Weeding
operations. When the appellant saw his wife. he talked
with her and struck her ﬁve or seven times with a knife,
causing serious injuries leading to her death the very day.
</p>
<p id="p_355">The appellant's defence was that his wife was a woman
of loose character, that the previous night he had seen her
entering, the house of a relation of one P with whom his
wife was carrying on intrigues, and that he also saw her
coming out of that house at about 1 A.M. Next morning,
when he Went to the ﬁeld, he asked his wife whether she
had gone to the house in question on the previous night.
The wife replied, "yes, I will go; it is my sweet will. If
you feel it so much then I will begin residing with P (the
man with whom she was supposed to have been carrying
on intrigue)". The appellant tried to pursuade his wife

'to improve her ways, but she said "if you are so much

ashamed, then get away from here. Why have you come
here and also used foul language". This enraged the
accused and he caught her hand; the wife retaliated by
kicking him, whereupon he lost his self-control and com-
mitted the offence. He therefore pleaded exception 1 to
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_355">section 300</a>. This plea failed.
</p>
<p id="p_356">He was convicted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_356">section 302</a>, but awarded the
lesser sentence of imprisonment for life. On appeal to the
High Court, the High Court rejected the defence of grave
and sudden provocation. If the appellant did not lose his
self-control the previous night and was thus sufﬁciently
strong willed, it was diﬁicult to accept the statement that
he lost his power by reason of something less grave which
happened in the ﬁeld later in the morning. Apart from
that, what occurred in the ﬁeld could not ordinarily be
regarded as grave and sudden provocation. (Passage from

I. See paragraph 32 in the A.I.R.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">79</span>
<p id="p_357">Holmes' v. D.P.P. that mere words do not amount to pro-
vocation cited)?
</p>
<p id="p_358">The High Court observed, that it would be extremely
hazadrous to apply the First Exception to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_357">section 330</a> to a
case of the kind merely on the ground that offences against
marital rights are made punishable by law in India. What
was to be considered was whether provocation was of a
kind which would cause a reasonable man belonging to
the social stratum of the accused to lose his self-control.
Adultery though frowned upon in India, was not uncom-
mon in the village community and even before the law
provided for obtaining a divorce, a customary form of
divorce prevailed in the village communities. Bearing
in mind these considerations it would not be right to
hold that the reaction of an Indian spouse from such a
community would be different from that of one in the
vwsstern countries.
</p>
<p id="p_359">Conviction upheld. As regards the sentence, the court
observed: --

In this case the accused was convicted by the Sessions
Judge under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_359">section 302</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_360"> Indian Penal Code</a> and sentenced
to imprisonment for life. His defence of insanity had been
reiected by the Sessions Court. The case was one of mur-
der by the accused aged 45 of his mother aged 70. The
only evidence of motive was that the accused used to quar-
rel frequently with his mother over the quality of food
which she used to serve. (The accused was unmarried).
</p>
<p id="p_363">On appeal to the High Court, the High Court on the
facts accepted his plea of insanity. It regarded the case
as one of epileptic insanity. The cousin of the accused
and other relations had given evidence that the accused
used to suffer frequently from epileptic ﬁts. The cousin
also swore that the accused would begin to show signs of
madness about 24 hours before the actual ﬁts and during
these periods the accused used to abuse his mother and
rush out of his house like a mad man, and that when the
ﬁts occurred the accused would fall down unconscious and
get up about half-an--hour later recovered. There was also
evidence that there were signs of an approaching epileptic

seizure noted on the day in question. The accused made
no attempt to conceal his crime. When the police arrived,
he was found sitting in the compound quietly and with his
dress and hands smeared with blood. Multiple instru-
ments had been used (bill-hook, wooden reaper and a stick
of ﬁre--wood). The facts showed that he was committing
the murder at a time when he was incapable of knowing
that he was doing something that was wrong or fontrary
to law. The case fell under section '84,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_361"> Indian Penal Code</a>

who take a lesser part, it is a sound exercise of judi-

cretion to refrain from sentencing all to death when
it is evident that some would not have been, if the facts
had been more fully known and it had been possible to
determine, for example, who hit on the head or who
only on a thumb or an ankle; and when there are no
means of determining who dealt the fatal blow, a judi-

Since the amendment of <a href="/doc/940370/" id="a_367">section 367</a> Criminal Procedure
Code in 1955 the theory that death is the normal sentence
fcr capital offences does not hold good. If there are ag-

larger interests of the society. If there are no aggravating
circumstances, the Court would be justified in giving the
lesser sentence. The fact that human life has been taken
does not justify the imposition of the extreme penalty of

The term "diversionism" has been adopted by Soviet authors to describe
a counter-revolutionary act of sabotage which in their eyes constitutes a
"diversionist manoeuvre", precisely in that it seriously hampers efforts to
build socialism (transIator's note under <a href="/doc/63881/" id="a_371">article 68</a><a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_372"> of the Penal Code</a> of the

which appears to the Court to be a sufﬁcient ground

tence passed on his conviction.
</p>
<p id="p_533">The Commonwealth Judiciary Act, 1903, as amended,

provides a right of appeal in criminal matters to the High
Court of Australia. Such an appeal from the Court of
Criminal Appeal is, in general, by special leave, which is
made on notice to the court, where an indictable offence
is involved.
</p>
<p id="p_534">Under Orders-in-Council of 2nd April, 1909, and 2nd
May, 1925, appeals lie to the Privy Council from the High
Court in criminal matters, only by special leave of the
Privy Council.
</p>
<p id="p_535">SOUTH AUSTRALIA1

Section 11 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act pro-
vides that any person who is convicted of murder shall
suffer death as a felon. On conviction for murder pro-
nouncement of sentence of death is automatic. It is the
only sentence which can by law be imposed. Whether
the sentence is carried into effect or commuted is a mat-
ter for the Governor of the State, with the advice and.
consent of the Executive Council, to decide.
</p>
<p id="p_536">There is no appeal to any Court against sentence of"
death as such, although of course an appeal against convic-
tion lies to the Full Court of the Supreme Court, sitting
as a Court of Criminal Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_537">An appeal on matters of law lies as of right; an appeal'
on a matter of fact or mixed fact and law lies only with
the leave of the Full Court.
</p>
<p id="p_538">Further appeals can be made to the High Court of Aus-
tralia and to the Privy Council, but only with the leave of
those tribunals.
</p>
<p id="p_539">TASMANIA1 (Australia)

Under the provisions of the Tasmanian Criminal Code»
Act, 1924, sentence of death is restricted to two crimes
viz., Treason (<a href="/doc/973062/" id="a_375">Section 56</a>) and Murder (<a href="/doc/1686746/" id="a_376">Section 158</a>) and
in both cases sentence of death is mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_540">Regarding appeals, see <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_377">section 401</a> of the Criminal
Code Act, 1924. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_378">Section 401(1)</a> states "A person convicted

the sentence is one ﬁxed by law."
</p>
<p id="p_546">As the sentence of death is one which is ﬁxed by law,
the position is that a person so sentenced has no right of
appeal against the sentence as such. But an appeal by a
person under sentence of death against his conviction is
regulated by numerous statutory provisions.

of Australia or to the Privy Council, or in succession to
the High Court of Australia and then to the Privy Coun-
cil.
</p>
<p id="p_550">Point (1) may be elaborated thus: There is an appeal
as of right against conviction on any ground of appeal
which involves a question of law alone, otherwise a cer-
tiﬁcate of leave is required. See section 567 of the Crimes

Act, 1958 (cited below):
</p>
<p id="p_551">In elaboration of Point (iii), special leave of the High
Court is necessary on appeals to the High Court. The
grounds are not prescribed by statute, so it is a matter of
discretion for the High Court. As to appeals to the
Privy Council, the appeal is only by leave. Such leave
may be granted by the Court giving the judgment
appealed from or by the Privy Council. The grounds on
which leave will be given are not prescribed by statute,
but depend (.-n the practice of the Court or the Privy
'Council, as the case may be.

against the sentence passed on his conviction." The right
in the case of sentence of death is not of great weight, as
the sentence of death is mandatory and cannot be varied
by a Court. Therefore, if a man is convicted of wilful
murder or treason, the sentence of death must be passed,
and unless commuted by the Executive Council, must be
carried out.

<p id="p_568">(i) Whether sentences of death are appealable as of
right to the highest appellate court?
</p>
<p id="p_569">Sentences of death imposed in a Federal District Court
are not appealable as of right to the highest appellate
court, the Supreme Court of the United States. Review
of a death sentence in the Supreme Court is limited to-
those cases wherein the Supreme Court in the exercise off
its discretion grants certiorart from the intermediate
Federal Court, the Court of Appealsl. Former section 681
of Title 18 allowed an accused the right to direct appeal
from a Federal District Court to the Supreme Court in
cases involving conviction of a capital offence. This sec-
tion was repealed by those sections of Title 28 which com--
pletely reorganised distribution of appellate jurisdiction
between the Supreme Court and the Circuit Courts of'
Appeals? Now a defendant sentenced to death in a
Federal District Court must appeal to a Circuit Court of'
Appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_570">(ii) which court bears the first appeal?
</p>
<p id="p_571">As indicated, the ﬁrst appeal in a case where the death-
sentence has been imposed in a Federal District Court
would be to a Circuit Court of Appeals. The Courts of
Appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from all ﬁnal deci-
sionsi' of the district courts of the United States, the
United States District Court for the District of the Canal
Zone, the District Court of Guam, and the District Court
of the Virgin Islands'. A defendant is entitled to a full
teview of his cases in a Circuit Court of Appeals. The
Court reorganization referred to in (i), supra which eli-
minated direct appeal to the Supreme Court in capital
cases infringed no substantial right of a defendant sen-
tenced to death to a full review of his case, for he may
take an appeal to a Circuit Court of Appeals as a matter
of right. It Was simply a suitation where the channel of
appeal was changed.
</p>
<p id="p_572">(iii) Are there any further appeal or appeals. If so, to
which court and on what grounds?

forth the guidelines for the Court to follow in deciding
whether to review a case on certiorari. They are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_579">19 CONSIDERATIONS GOVERNING REVIEW ON
CERTIORARI

</p><p id="p_580">1. A review on writ of certiorarér is not a matter of
right, but of sound judicial discretion, and will be granted
only where there are special and important reasons there-
for. The following, while neither controlling nor fully
measuring the court's discretion, indicate the character
of reasons which will be considered:----
</p>
<p id="p_581">"(a) Where a state court has decided a Federal
question of substance not therefore determined by this
court, or has decided it in a way probably not in ac-
cord with applicable decisions of this court.
</p>
<p id="p_582">(b) Where a court of appeals has rendered a deci-
sion in conflict with the decision of another court of
appeals on the same matter; or has decided an im-
portant state or territorial question in a way in con-
flict with applicable state or territorial law; or has
decided an important question of Federal law which
has not been, but should be, settled by this court, or
has decided a Federal question in a way in conflict
with applicable decision of this court; or has so far de-
parted from the accepted and usual course of judicial
proceedings, or so far sanctioned such a departure by
a lower court, as to call for an exercise of this court's
power of supervision.
</p>
<p id="p_583">2. The same general considerations outlined above will
control in respect of petitions for writs of certiorari to re-
view judgments of the court of claims, of the court of
Customs and Patent Appeals, or of any other court whose

determinations are by law reviewable on writ of certio-
rart"
</p>
<p id="p_584">Review by a Federal Court for a prisoner in Federal
custody may also be obtained under 28 U.S.C. 2255 to the

extent that relief is available under this section. It pro-
vides that;
</p>
<p id="p_585">"A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court estab-
lished by Act of Congress claiming the right to be re-
leased upon the ground that the sentence was lIl1p'",S€Ci in
Violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States,

</p><p id="p_586">1. 28 U.S.C. 1254

8-122 Law.
</p>
<p id="p_587">or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such
sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maxi-
mum authorised by law, or is otherwise subject to colla-
teral attack, may move the court which imposed "the sen-
tence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence . . . . . . .."
Thus, a murder indictment which charged that the crime
had been Committed on a Washington reservation but
failed to allege that the defendant or the victim was an
Indian, stated no basis for Federal jurisdiction, and even
though the defendant had pleaded guilty,' he could there-
after collaterally attack the charge in a<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_382"> s. 2255</a> proceed-
ingl.
</p>
<p id="p_588">This section, however, is not a substitute for appeal and
cannot be resorted to by a petitioner to review the suﬁ'i-
ciency of the evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_589">Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest
court of a state in which a decision could be had may be
reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States? A
defendant who has been sentenced under a state statute
which he claims is repugnant to the United States Consti-
tution or who claims deprivation of other Constitutional
rights may petition to have his case reviewed by the Su-
preme Court. Once again, the standards of Supreme Court
Rule 1.9 apply. A recent state case illustrates the attitude
of some members of this Court toward the granting of
certiorari in death cases. The case involved the imposi-
tion of the death penalty on a convicted rapist who con-
cededly had neither taken nor endangered human life. Al-
though certiorart was denied, Mr. Justice Goldberg, with
whom Mr. Justice Doublas and Mr. Justice Brennan join-
ed, dissented. He said,-
</p>
<p id="p_590">"I would grant certiorari in this case and in Snyder v.
Cunningham 169 Misc. to consider whether the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Consti-
tution permit the imposition of the death penalty on a
convicted rapist who has neither taken nor endangered
human life. The following question, inter alia, seem rele-
vant and worthy of argument and consideration---
</p>
<p id="p_591">"(1) In light of the trend both in this country and
throughout the world against punishing rape by death.
does the imposition of the death penalty by those
states which retain it for rape violate 'evolving
standards of decency that mark the progress of [our]

less universally accepted'?

deterrence, isolation, rehabilitation) be achieved as
effectively by punishing rape less severely than by
death (e_g_, by life imprisonment), if so, does . the
imposition of the death penalty for rape Corlstltllte
'unnecesary cruelty'?
</p>
<p id="p_596">Finally, a Federal court has the power to grant writs
of habeas corpus for the purpose of inquiring into cause
of restraint of liberty of anyone in custody under author-
ity of the state in violation of the Federal Constitution',
provided the applicant has exhausted all remedies avail-
able in the courts of the state and in the Supreme Court
of the United States by appeal or writ of certiorctrtz. Thus,
a defendant convicted of murder and sentenced to death
in a state court who claimed that his conviction violation
the Fourteenth. Amendment because of the admission in
evidence of a confession obtained while he was under the
inﬂuence of drugs and who had exhausted all state reme-
dies was held to be entitled to a plenary evidentiary hear-
ing in the Federal court on his habeas corpus application
in View of the fact that he did not get a full and fair hear-
ing on this question in the state courts3.

A1. Treason is now the only crime which is punishable

and lies to the Court of Appeal. On any ground of appeal
which involves a question of law alone, the appeal is as
of right. On any ground which involves a question of
fact or of mixed fact and law, the leave of the Court of
Appeal or the certiﬁcate of the trial or sentencing judge
that it is a "fit case for appeal" is required,

</p><p id="p_620">2. There is no longer any provision in the Crimes Act
or in any other New Zealand legislation providing for fur-
ther appeals from the Court of Appeal. There is stilli how-
ever, a right of appeal to the Privy Council by virtue of
the Royal prerogative. Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd
Edn., Vol. V, pp. 682 ff gives an adequate account of the
New Zealand position. Two points should however be
noted. In the first place. New Zealand Courts no longer
have jurisdiction in any case from the Independent State
of Western Samoa. In the second place, the Court of
Appeal in Woolworths N. Z. Ltd., V. Wynne (1952) N.
Z. L. R. 496 held that, it could grant leave to appeal to the
Privy Councli in certain circumstances (see Halsbury op.
cit. p, 685) but the legislation on which that decision was
based is now repealed. The result is, therefore, that spe-
cial leave to appeal must be obtained from the Privy
Council. and this is granted only in exceptional circums-
tances where " . . . . . . .. by a disregard of the forms of
legal process or by some violation of the principles of
natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injus-
tice has been done." Nadan v. The King. (1926) A. C. 482.

</p>
<p id="p_798">Analysis of the Burmese sections

The important changes made by the Burmese Penal
Code in the section relating to culpable homicide and mur-
der can be roughly analysed as follows:--
</p>
<p id="p_799">(1) Causing death by an act done with the intention
of causing death is murder in India in the absence of
the exceptional circumstances (mentioned in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_444">section 300</a>,
Exceptions, in India). But in Burma the exceptional
circumstances have been grouped with the section re-
lating to culpable homicide not amounting to murder,
and have been removed from the section dealing with
murder, for better understanding. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_445">Section 300</a>, Burma
and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_446">section 299(2)</a>, categories A to E, Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_800">(2) Where death is caused by an act done with the
intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to
cause death, it is only culpable homicide. The offend-
ers knowledge of the peculiar inﬁrmity of the victim
does not necessarily make it murder, but is a relevant
factor in proving the nature of his intention. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_447">Section
299(1)</a>, Burma, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_448">section 300A</a> (b), Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_801">(3) Causing death by an act done with the intention
of causing bodily injury as is sufﬁcient, etc., to cause
death--in this category, the words "in fact" have been
inserted before "is sufﬁcient"--apparently to make it
clear that it is not the subjective knowledge of the
offender which is here relevant, but (objectively) the
nature of the injury. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_449">Section 300</a>, Burma (If excep-
tional circumstances are present), <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_450">section 299(2)</a>,
Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_802">(4) Causing death by an act done with the know-
ledge that the offender is likely, by such act to cause
death, ceases to be culpable homicide and ceases to be
murder also, and merely becomes an offence punishable
as "causing death by negligence" under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_451">section 304A</a>,
the only special provision being that in such a case, the
imprisonment may extend to 10 years. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_452">Section 304A</a>,
latter half, Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_803">(5) Having made the substantive changes regarding
the offence of murder, so as to take out certain cate-
gories out of that offence, the Burmese Code divides
murders into two sub-clauses for the purposes of punish-
ment. If the murder is committed by a person--
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">117</span>
<p id="p_804">(a) being under sentence of transportation for
lite; or
</p><p id="p_805">(b) with pre-meditation; or

</p><p id="p_806">(c) in the course of committing any offence
punishable under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_453"> the Penal Code</a> with imprison-
ment up to 7 years:
</p>
<p id="p_807">the offender "shall be punished with death and shall
also be liable to fine" (no discretion to court to award
lesser sentence). <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_454">Section 302(1)</a>, Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_808">A person committing murder in any other case is
punishable with transportation for life or rigorous
imprisonment up to 10 years and also liable to ﬁne.
(Thus, the imprisonment need not be for life, as in
India). <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_455">Section 302(2)</a>, Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_809">(6) Punishment for culpable homicide which does
not amount to murder, has been simpliﬁed. Instead of
the t\vo categories mentioned in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_456"> the Indian Penal Code</a>,
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_457">section 304</a>, the punishment in Burma is transportation
for life or imprisonment of either description up to 10
years, and also ﬁne. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_458">Section 304</a>, Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_810">(7) Causing death by negligence----<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_459">section 304A</a>----
the punishment in India is two years' imprisonment
while in Burma, it is 7 years (or if the act is done with
the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, then 10
years). Further, in India imprisonment is not compul-
sory. because tine can be awarded without awarding
imprisonment while in Burma imprisonment is compul-
sory. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_460">Section 304</a>, Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_811">(8) Regarding attempt to murder, mere knowledge
is not enough and intention is required. Apparently,
mere knowledge or likelihood of death in a case of
attempt to murder is left to be dealt with by the ordi-
nary provision in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_461">section 511</a>. This appears to be con-
sequential on the removal of knowledge from the sec-
tion dealing with murder, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_462">Section 307</a>, Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_812">Attempt to commit culpable homicide not amount-
ing to murder--here also the Word "knowledge" has
been removed. This is also apparently consequential
on the removal of the element of knowledge from sec-
tion 299 and its placing under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_463">section 304</a>. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_464">Section 308</a>,
Burma.
</p>
<p id="p_813">Summary
The scheme appears to be-
</p>
<p id="p_814">(i) To concentrate on intention while dealing with
offences both under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_465">section 299</a> and under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_466">section 300</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_815">(ii) Further, even international acts punishable
under murder have been classiﬁed, as regards punish-
</p>
<p id="p_816">ment, mainly on the basis of pre-meditation (apart from
two special cases).

CRUEL MURDERS
We may refer to a few cases of cruel murder.
SUPREME COURT CASES

(1) One Fahim, cruelly murdered Mrs. Nelson, wife of
an American Missionary, at Handia on Varanasi-Allahabad
highway. (The husband had gone to Allahabad to get re-
paired a damaged tyre of his car, leaving behind his wife
in the Car). The Allahabad High Court conﬁrmed the
sentence of death. The Supreme Court refused leave to
agpgal against the High Court's judgment dated 8th Oct.
1 65 .
</p>
<p id="p_1199">(2) Unni, a naval rating conspired along with 4 others
to burgle the safe of the Naval Base Supply Oﬁice at
Cochin, and they decoyed Lt. Commander Mendanha from
his house on the pretext that he was wanted at the Naval
base. In a lonely place they caught hold of him, tied his
hands and legs, gagged his mouth with sticking-plaster,
and plugged his nostrils with cotton soaked in chloroform
and deposited him in a shallow drain. Unni was sentenc-
ed to death by the High Court of Kerala. The Supreme
Court upheld the conviction and the sentence'.
</p>
<p id="p_1200">(3) In a brutal murder, the accused killed a young girl
by cutting her into pieces. The Sessions Judge, Srinagar,
while ﬁnding him guilty of murder sentenced him to life

imprisonment on the ground that the accused had become
emaciated in the legs and was crawling. The High Court
observed. that this was no ground for leniency in the cir-
cumstances of the case, and enhanced the sentence to one
of deathl.
</p>
<p id="p_1204">(4) Wamanrao Kasture, a clerk, sprinkled kerosene on
the person of a woman and set ﬁre, which resulted in the
woman's death. Death sentence conﬁrmed by the Nagpur
High Court" as the crime was an atrocious one.
</p>
<p id="p_1205">(5) A student---Vijai Karan Singh, stabbed his Vice-
Principal, piercing through his heart, as a revenge for the
victim having sponsored action against the accused for
using unfair means at the examination. Death sentence
was conﬁrmed by the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow
Bench''').
</p>
<p id="p_1206">(6) Chinnaswami, a domestic servant murdered May-
yapan, his creditor by enticing him to his quarters. Death
sentence was conﬁrmed by the Punjab High Court, (Delhi
Bench').
</p>
<p id="p_1207">(7) Anti, appellant, mercilessly struck Shanker on his
head by a Kodali (a pointed digging instrument like an
axe). The death sentence passed by the Sessions Judge,
Santhal Parganas, was conﬁrmed by the Patna High Court".
</p>
<p id="p_1208">(8) The late Shri H. N. Sanyal, Solicitor-General of
India, was strangled to death at night by a party of persons
who entered his house at night, apparently for committing
theft. The murder was a gruesome one. The death sen-
tence was conﬁrmed by the High Court of Punjab (at
Delhi) on 25th January, 1966.
</p>
<p id="p_1209">(9) The recent sadistic murder tried at the trial known
as "Bodies on the moors" may be refered to7:----
</p>
<p id="p_1210">Sadism, sexual perversion and cruelty which
motivated a young couple to the "cold blooded" killing
of a girl of 10, a boy of 12 and youth of 17 and to bury
their bodies on lonely moors led to their being
given life sentences at the end of their trial yes-
terday at Chester. The case known as "bodies on the
moors" trial attracted reporters and psychologists
from all parts of the Western world and took up more
space in the British Press than any criminal case in
recent years.

The accused who were convicted were Ian Brady, a
clerk of 28, and Myra Hindley, a shorthand typist aged
23, his girl friend who worked in the same office and lived
together in the same house.
</p>
<p id="p_1218">Evidence at the trial brought out that the couple had
a library of books on murder' sadism and perversion, in-
cluding the works of Marquis de Sade. Smith had, ac-
cording to his statement, been at ﬁrst drawn in by them
and had heard Brady boast of having killed many persons.
Later when he witnessed Brady axing to death Evans who
had been inveigled into the house, he broke down and ran
to the police.
</p>
<p id="p_1219">Other discoveries by the police included a tape record-
ing of the frightened cries of a child identified as Lesley
Ann Downey, 10, whom the accused admitted to having
photographed in the nude but denied murder. The girl's
body had been found burried on the moors at a spot a
photograph of which was found in Brady's album. The
pathetic pleadings of the child were heard by the court
and the jury when the tape was played out during the
trial as also the commands of Brady and Hindley to the
girl.
</p>
<p id="p_1220">The police also produced a diary kept by Brady in which
there was the name of John Kilbride, 12, whose body also
was found on the moors near the other burial. Other ﬁnds
included a plan for disposal of bodies drawn up by Brady.
</p>
<p id="p_1221">The contention of the prosecution was that Brady was
a cold-blooded pervert who took pleasure in inflicting pain
on helpless children and who killed for kicks. Hindley,
it was brought out. had fallen under his spell and became
a willing convert to his bestial inclinations.
</p>
<p id="p_1222">A curious sidelight on the sensational Press in Britain
was thrown by the evidence of Smith. He admitted that
the News of the World had signed him on to give material
for article on the murder after the accused were convicted.
In the meanwhile they were giving a substantial weekly
allowance.

found that the story of

or improbable, and had
impressed four assessors
and the two lower courts.

</p><p id="p_1228">The appeal was dismissed.

in the wide range of mat-
</p><p id="p_1235">ters which can come up
before it under this article.
By virtue of this article,
we can grant special leave
in civil cases, in criminal
cases, in income-tax cases,
in cases whch come up
lefore different kinds of
tribunals and in a variety
of other cases. The only
uniform standard which
in our opinfon can be la-'d
down in the circumstances
is that Court should grant
special leave to appeal
only in those cases where
special circumstances are
shown to exist. The Pri-
</p><p id="p_1236">vy Council have tried to
lay down from time to
time certain principles for
granting special leave in
criminal cases, which were
reviewed by the Federal
Court in <a href="/doc/1878796/" id="a_512">Kapildeo v. The
King</a> (A.I.R. 37, I950 F.C.
</p><p id="p_1237">8o : 51 Cr. L]. 1057).
</p><p id="p_1238">It is sufficient for our pur-
pose to say that though
we are not bound to follow
them too rigidly since the
reasons, constitutional and
administrative, which some-
times weighed with the
Privy Council, need not
weigh with us. yet some
of those principles are
useful as furnishng in
many cases a sound basis
for invoking the discre-
</p><p id="p_1239">tion of this Court in grant-
</p><p id="p_1240">ing special leave. Gene-
</p><p id="p_1241">rally speaking, this Court
willnot grant special leave,
unless it is shown that
exceptional and special cir-
cumstances exist, that sub-
stantial and grave injustice
has been done and that
the case in question pre-

The Punjab High Court
upheld the convjct on and

of the evidence as to the
recovery of blood-stained

the appellants, was attack-

however, pointed out, that
these points had been put

any justiﬁcation for grant-

</p><p id="p_1426">reasons for reversal of the

</p>
<p id="p_1427">As regards tne first, the Court

observed, that while the
Supreme Court would not
interfere with the ﬁndings
of the High Court merely
because the conclusions of
the Supreme Court on the
evidence differed with those
of the High Court, yet
where the evidence was
such that no tribunal could
legitimately infer from it
that the accused was guilty,
the Supreme Court would
set aside the conviction.
</p><p id="p_1428">(Stephen Seneviratne Vs.
The King, A.I.R. I936 Privy
Council 289, 291 followed).
In this case, the evidence
was of such quality that
no legitimate inference of
guilt could properly be
drawn. There were certain
contradictions in the state-
ment of important prosc-
</p><p id="p_1429">cution witnesses. Again,
dying declarations stated
to have been made by the
deceased were made to
witnesses whose evidence
suffered from material eon-
tradictions. Ordinarily,
a dying decaration of this
kind would be insuﬂieient
for sustaining conviction
on a charge of murder.
</p><p id="p_1430">Next, the High Court had
disbelieved the evidence
of the doctor, saying that
his opinion was not in con-

notes that the expression
"substantialand compelling

</p><p id="p_1527">siderable diﬂiculties to

conclusion that the acquit-
tal was wrong. The Sup-
</p><p id="p_1530">reme Court pointed out,
that the appellate court had
full power to review the

acquittal was founded, that
the principles laid down
in Shea Swamp': case (64

of the Supreme Court, like

</p><p id="p_1532">ciently cogent reasons" or
"strong reasons" were not
intended to curtail the
power of the appellate court
to review the evidence and

doing so the appellate court
should not only consider
the matters on record hav-

</p><p id="p_1581">The appellants ﬁled the
present appeal after obtain-
ing special leave from the
Supreme Court. One of
the grounds of appeal was,
that the High Court had
not sufficient reason for
interfering with the orders
of acquittal; that the High
Court had mis-read the
judgment of the Additional
Sessions Judge and attri-
</p><p id="p_1582">buted to him statements

pointed out, that in appeals

of Appeal must examine
the evidence with particular
care, and must also exa-
</p><p id="p_1583">mine the reasons on which
the acquittal vxas based,
and should interfere only
when the view taken by
the acquitting Judge is
clearly unreasonable. In
earlier cases of the Supreme
Court, the words "com-
</p><p id="p_1584">pellng reasons" had been
used, and this had caused
diﬂiculty to High Courts
occasionally. In later years,
the Supreme Court had
avoided emphasis on "com-
</p><p id="p_1585">pelling reasons", but,
nevertheless, adhered to the
view, that ﬁalefore interfering
inana pe ,against an ac-
</p><p id="p_1586">quittal? the High Court
must examine not only
questions of law and fact
in all their aspects, but
also reasons which impelled
the lower court to acquit
the accused. If the Ap-

was clearly unreasonable,
that itself was a compelling
reason for interference.
</p>
<p id="p_1592">If the High Court has thus

approached the matter and
applied the correct prin-

will not ordinarily embark
upon a re-appraisal of the
evidence to ascertain whe-

right in its mew of evidence.
But if the judgment of the
High Court, while indicat-

High Court that the vew
taken by the trial court
was unreasonable, does not
disclose a careful exami-
</p><p id="p_1596">nation of the evidence. or
if the High Court has erred
on a question of law, or
obviously mis-read the evi-
dence, or mis-read the
judgment of the trial court,
the Supreme Court was
bound to appraise the evi-
</p><p id="p_1597">dence for itself and to
examine the reasons on
which the lower court ba-
</p><p id="p_1598">sed the acquittal and then
to decide whether the High
Court's conclusion (about

</p><p id="p_1600">rect. In the present case,
the judgment of the High
Court did not contain much
discussion of the evidence
and the judgment also re-

the High Court were under
some misapprehension in
thinking that the Addi-

held that the accused Bagh

SUMMARY or CAPITAL STATUTES 1N THE 18TH CENTURY IN
ENGLAND

In the 18th century in England the important capital
offences were these1:--
</p>
<p id="p_1685">(1) High Treason

Treason in all its manifestations was a capital offence
under the Act of 1351.2 <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_628">An Act</a> of 17963 incorporated seve-
ral provisions inserted in the meantime by enactments
orders passed between 1399 and 1547.
</p>
<p id="p_1686"><a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_629">An Act</a> of 17034 provided, that if any officer or soldier
out of England or upon the sea were to correspond with any
rebel or enemy or give them advice or intelligence by let-
ters, messages, signs or otherwise or to enter into any cor-
respondence with them without authority so to do, he shall
be guilty of treason. (By the annual Acts on mutiny and
desertion, olfenders found guilty of these offences were to
suffer death or such other punishment as the court martial
should impose).
</p>
<p id="p_1687">By a statute of 1792? which was passed as an emergency
measure, it was high treason to sell, supply or deliver to or
for the use of the French Convention or the armies in their
employ, during the war, any arms, etc., bank notes or pro-
visions without a licence from the Privy Council or to buy
land, etc., in France, etc.

(2) Offences against the protestant succession

Certain offences against the protestant succession were
capital. Thus_ one statute punished a person who endea-
voured to Qleprive or hinder any person who was next in
succession to the Crown according to the Act of Settlement
from succeeding to the Crown, etc.5

A person maliciously, etc., maintaining and aﬁirming
that any other person had any right or title to the Crown

otherwise than according to the Act of Settlement, was
punishable with death.7

holding such correspondence, etc., with a son of the pre-
tender'-' were punishable with death. All such acts were

Several statutes punished with death persons who, by
writing or teaching, maintained the spiritual authority or
jurisdiction of a foreign prince, or committed similar other
Acts."-4-5-5

Several other statutes supplemented or elaborated the
Acts mentioned above?-3-"

The following offences were capital':----
</p>
<p id="p_1732">(a) riotously to assemble (12 persons or more) and
not to disperse for an hour after the proclamation.
Thus, the offence was constituted by unlawfully, riot-
ously and tumultuously remaining or continuing to-
gether although no specific act had been committed;
</p>
<p id="p_1733">(b) opposing the making of the proclamation and
not to disperse within an hour after the making of the
proclamation had been opposed;
</p>
<p id="p_1734">(c) unlawfully to assemble to the disturbance of
the public peace and when so assembled unlawfully
and with force to demolish or pull down any church or
chapel, or any building for religious worship, certiﬁed
and registered, or any dwelling house, etc.

In an interesting case,5 it was held that if a person was

present at a riot and, by shouting and other expressions ex-
</p>
<p id="p_1735">cited the rioters in to demolish and to pull down a dwelling
house, he was, a principal in the second degree; because,
though he had himself taken no part in pulling down the
house, etc., or committed any offence, etc., his participation
in the offence amounted to aiding the abetting.

(10) Oﬁences against public health
Following offences were capital:----
</p>
<p id="p_1761">(a) Infected person having upon him infectious un-
cured sores, disobeying orders to remain in his house,"
</p>
<p id="p_1762">(b) Disobeying order prohibiting entry of vessel in-

vessel had come from infected place etc.; refusal to
conform with obligation to remain in quarantine;
and similar offences under an Act of 1753,3 re--enacte
later} 

(11) Smuggling

Smuggling, it appears, was carried on by great gangs
carrying ﬁrearrns or others offensive weapons, and several
oﬁicers of Customs and Excise had been "wounded, maimed,
and some of them even killed in execution of their office.''5
Hence an Act of 17465 made it a capital offence to assemble
armed. to the number of three Or more, in order to assist
in landing or carrying away prohibited, uncustomed or re-
landed goods; to pass, masked or disguised, with prohibited,
uncustomed or re--landed goods to maim or wound officers
going on boards. ship within a port; to shoot at or danger-
ously wound officers on board such ships in execution of
their duty, etc.

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_650">The Act</a> of 1746 was supplemented by an Act of 1784,7
making it a capital offence to shoot at or upon any ship,
boat or vessel belonging to His Majesty within four leagues
of the coast or to shoot at naval, customs and excise
officers.
</p>
<p id="p_1764">An act of 18123 relaxed the law, but still retained death
penalty for serious offences against the public revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_1765">An act of 1825'" consolidated the law again, and made it
still more lenient, but continued death penalty for certain
offences of smuggling, e.g., three or more persons armed
with ﬁrearms assembled to assist in the illegal exportation
of goods, etc., and persons shooting at a boat belonging to
the navy.

<p id="p_1792">(15) Bastard Child-Killing

An Act of 16231 enacted (in substance) that if any woman
who is delivered of any issue of her body, male or female,
which would be a bastard, she endeavours privately so.to
conceal the death thereof that it may not come to light (1.8.
the fact whether it was born alive or not is Concealed
by her action) then she shall suffer death as in the case of
murder unless she could prove at least by one witness that
the child was born dead. Thus, in substance, concealment
of birth amounted to a presumption of murder; this is ex-
plained by the fact that in such cases it was diﬁicult to
prove that the child had been born alive?
</p>
<p id="p_1793"><a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_664">This Act</a> evoked great controversy, particularly because
it was contrary to the presumption of innocence. Courts,
it appears, went to extreme limits in narrowing down its
scope, e.g., (i) by holding that there was no concealment if
the mother had called for help or had confessed that she
was about to have a child, or (ii) by requiring some sort of
evidence that the child, had been born alive, or (iii) by
holding that there could be no concealment if any person
be present, even though that person was privy to the guilt."
</p>
<p id="p_1794">One of the arguments used against the Act was that it
was inﬁnitely better that ten guilty persons should escape
rather than that one innocent person be hanged. This law
asserted that 10 innocent persons should be hanged, so that
one guilty person does not escape."
</p>
<p id="p_1795"><a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_665">The Act</a> was replaced in 1803 by a statute which re-
drafted the deﬁnition of the offence of murdering the bas-
tard children,5 bringing it in line with the general position.

<p id="p_1796">(16) Stabbing

In view of frequent outrages committed by person of
ﬂammable spirit and deep resentment, who, wearing short
daggers under their clothes stabbed a person on slight pro-
vocation," an Act was passed in 16047 which made it a capi-
tal offence without beneﬁt of clergy to stab or thrust any
person (who had not any weapon drawn or who had not
struck the party stabbing or thrusting) so that the person
stabbed or thrust died within 3 months, although it could

any member of a subject of His Majesty, was to suffer
death without beneﬁt of clergy.
</p>
<p id="p_1805">(18) Shooting in dwelling house

By an Act of 1722," a person wilfully and maliciously
shooting at any person in a dwelling house or other place
was punishable with death, whether or not his action re-
sulted in killing or maiming. The shooting had to be
malicious, and therefore should amount to murder if death
had ensued, and it must have been with a gun and other
instrument so loaded as to create danger for the party aim-
ed at, the probable consequence of which would be to kill
or maim and the gun, etc., also had to be levelled at him,

according to the Act as interpreted."

Originally, rape was a felony punishable with death?
This was regarded as too harsh, and the punishment was
replaced by a castration and loss of eyes." fhe punish-
ment was still further mitigated in 1275," by an Act which
reduced the offence to a trespass, and subjected the
guilty party to two years' imprisonment and a fine at the
King's will.5 But this lenience was said to have been pro-
ductive of terrible consequences, and it was found neces-
sary later to pass an Act" which made punishable by l'~1dg'
ment of life and member the ravishing of a woman, whe-
ther married, maid or other, where she did not consent,
neither before nor after?

<p id="p_1817">Passed under a statute in 1576? any person who feloni-

as well as his aiders and abettors, were to be tried by a

(25) Simple grand larceny

Theft not accompanied by any aggravating circum-

the stolen goods exceeded 12 pence, it was simple grand
larceny. Such larceny was originally punishable by whip-
ping, then with transportation for 7 years, and (by later
Acts) with imprisonment or ﬁne, by death with beneﬁt of
clergy, or if the beneﬁt was claimed, by burning in the
hand, etc. But a great number of statutes excluded from
the beneﬁt of clergy offenders guilty of certain kinds of
grand larceny. Of these offences, only a few may be men-
tioned here, such as stealing of horses, etc., feloniously
driving away, or stealing sheep, cows, etc., feloniously cut«
ting and taking cloth from the reck or tenter in the night
time." Theft of goods valued at 40 shillings in any ship,

Larceny committed in a dwelling house was known as
'Minnie compound larceny", and so was larceny from the
person of another. Larceny in a dwelling house_was
known as burglary. At common law it was felony within
the beneﬁt of clergy, but, by statutes it was made a capi-
tal offence without beneﬁt of clergy." A number of other
larcenies in houses, shops and warehouses were also made
capital by statutes.5

These statutes are too numerous to be discussed here.
(27) Larceny from the person

Two classes of larceny from the person were made
capital offences without beneﬁt of clergy, namely--
</p>
<p id="p_1841">(i) any person convicted of feloniously taking
away any money, goods or chattels from the person
of any other, privily without his knowledge, in any
place whatsoever (known as larceny calm et secrete

</p>
<p id="p_1842">(ii) Robbery, i.e., felonious taking of money or
goods of any value from the person of another, or in
his presence, against his will, by violence or putting
him in fear. We may note only the main statute,' re-
lating to a person who robbed any other person. or
comforted, aided, abetted, assisted, etc., any person to
commit the said offence.

(29) Blackmail

To send letters threatening injury to life 01' l91'0l39Tty
in order to extort money was a high misdemeanour at
common law, punishable by a ﬁne and imprisonment. In
1722," an Act was passed whereby a person who know-
ingly sent letters either unsigned or signed with a Fictiti-
ous name, demanding money was guilty of a felony w1th~
out benefit of clergy. A later Act passed in 17544 simi-
larly punished with death any person who knowingly sent
letters without a name or with a ﬁctitious name, threaTen-
tng to kill or to burn any house, although no money or

valuable effects had been demanded in it.

An Act of 19606 recited that many person within the coun-
ties of Cumberland, Northumberland, etc., had been (either
in their house or while travelling) carried as prisoners and
kept barbarously and cruelly until redeemed by great
ransom, etc., so that many persons had been forced to pay
a certain rate of money, corn, cattle or other consideration,
commonly called blackmail in order to be freed or pro-
tected in safety from the danger of such robbery, etc. For
all these offences, and for being privy, etc., thereto, capital
punishment was provided for by that Act.

At common law_ forgery was a misdemeanour only.
In 1562,? an Act was passed to broaden the legal concept
of forgery and to establish a new system of punishment.
<a href="/doc/1093366/" id="a_678">Section 1</a> of the Act recited, that the "Wicked, pernicious
and dangerous practice of making, forging and publishing
false charters, evidences, deeds, etc., had of late time been
very much practised", to the High displeasure of God and
the great injury of the subjects and this was due chieﬂy
to the reason that the punishments were small and mild.
After providing the punishment of cutting off ears, slitting
the nostrils, etc., for certain types of forgery, the Act (sec-
tion 7) punished offenders convicted for the second time
of forgery with death without beneﬁt of clergy. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_679">The Act</a>
was virtually superseded by later Acts, but formally re-
mained in force till 1830. There were certain other capital

forgery of deeds, bonds, bills, shares of public companies,
stamps, and marks, forgery of the seal of Bank of England,

question were feloniously punishable with death. One
of these statutes recited} that it often happened that mas-
ters and mariners of ships, having insured or taken upon
Bottomry, greater sums of money than the value of their
adventure, wilfully cast away, burnt or otherwise des-
troyed the ships, to the merchants and owners' great loss.
The impact of the Act, of 1717 lay in its extending the
offence to the owner, etc, who defrauded the insurers.
</p>
<p id="p_1871">(35) Coinage
Many offences connected with coinage, such as counter-
feiting, bringing false money into the realm, and impairing
coins were made capital offences.'

(36) Arson

Several kinds of arson were made capital by statutes
and it is enough to note the Act of 1722,5 which appointed
absolute capital punishment for setting ﬁre to any house,
barn or out-house, to any hovel cock, mow or corn, hay
or wood. A later Acté punished with death setting on ﬁre
any mine, pit, or delph of coal, etc,

Still another Act7 made it a capital offence to set on
ﬁre or otherwise destroy ships of war, on ﬂoat or in pro-
cess of building, arsenals, magazines, victualling offices, or
any of the buildings erected therein or belonging thereto?
</p>
<p id="p_1872">Several statutes made it a capital offence to set on

In the middle ages, piracy was regarded as a kind of
treason if the offender was not an alien. If the offender
was an alien, it was a felony. In more recent times, piracy
was held to be robbery or unauthorised depredation on

the high seas."
</p>
<p id="p_1886">It was not a felony at common law, and the ﬁrst sta-
tute made it a capital offence though not a felony, and

with death, and loss of lands, etc., as pirates, felons and

ENGLISH LAW or TREASON

.English Law of Treason

The relevant provisions of the treason Acts of 1351 and
1795 are quoted below :--

</p>
<p id="p_1896">Item, whereas diverse opinions have been before
this time in what case treason shall be said, and in
what not; the King, at the request of the lords and
of the commons, hath made a declaration in the man-

doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the
I~&lt;Iing, or of our lady his Queen, or of their eldest son
and heir; or if a man do violate the King's compa-
nion, or the King's eldest daughter unmarried, or the
wife of the King's eldest son and heir; or if a man
do levy war against our lord the King in his realm, or
be adherent to the King's enemies in his realm, giving
to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere,
and thereof be probably ('provalement') attained Of

a man slea (sic) the chancellor, treasurer, of the King's
justices of the one bench, or the other justices in eyre,
or justices of assize, and all oth'.er justices assigned to
hear and determine, being in their places doing their
offences [see Steph. Dig. Cr. L. (9th ed.) 59]. And it is to
be understood, that in the cases above rehearsed, and
ought to be judged treason which extends to our lord
the King, and his royal majesty: ....And if precase
any man of this realm ride armed covertly or secretly
with men of arms against any other, to slay him. or
rob him, or take him or retain him till he hath made
ﬁne or ransom for to have his deliverance, it is not
in the mind of the King nor his council, that in such
case it shall be judged treason, but shall be judged
felony or trespass according to the laws of the land
of old time used, and according as the case requireth."

</p>
<p id="p_1899">Certain other acts were declared to be felony-now
"treason felony", by the Acts of 1795 and 1848. Punish-

It is no longer necessary to have a minimum of two
witnesses to prove treason?
</p>
<p id="p_1900">As to treason which is not high treason, but merely a
felony, the punishment for imprisonment of life is laid
down by the "Treason Felony" Act.3

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_220">185</span>

The above comparison of the English and the Indian
provisions would show that, roughly speaking, the only
category of treason about which there is no speciﬁc men-
tion in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_692"> the Indian Penal Code</a> is that indicated by the
words of the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_693">English Act</a> "be adherent to the King's ene-
mies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the
realm or elsewhere." Under the words "adherent etc."
an actual adherence must be proved.1

The leading cases under this head are the under-men-
tioned. 2-" In one of those cases, Sir Roger David Case-
ment was tried for treason because he went to Germany
during the First World War and there actively endeavour-
ed to persuade other British Subjects (Irish Soldiers who
were prisoners in Germany) to join an Irish brigade
and assist Germany. He also took part in an expedi-
tion from Germany with the object of landing arms in
Ireland for supply to Irishmen for being used on behalf
of Germany. He was held guilty of treason by adhering
to the King's enemies elsewhere than in the King's realm.'

In the other case, William Joyce was tried for traitor-
ously contriving to aid the King's enemies ("adhering" to
as well as "giving aid and comfort" to the enemies in areas
Without the realm of England) by broadcasting to British
subjects propaganda on behalf of the enemies of the King.
</p>
<p id="p_1914">The words "giving aid etc." would cover any act done
by a British subject which strengthens or tends to streng-
then the enemies of the Queen in the conduct of a war
against the Queen or which weakens or tends to weaken
the power of the Queen and of the country to resist or
attack the enemies of the Queen.5

Regarding transmission of intelligence, an interesting
case is that of Stone." There, Lord Kenyon C. J. observed
that if the intelligence transmitted was such as was likely
to prove useful to the enemies in enabling them "to annoy
us, defend themselves or shape their attacks," sending such
intelligence with a view to its reaching the enemy was
undoubtedly high treason.
</p>
<p id="p_1915">Thus, it may be noted that under these heads there is
emphasis on enemies being adhered to or aided.

</p>
<p id="p_1929">"Communications with the enemy from which he
may derive information enabling him to shape his

for certain serious crimes (enemies of the regime, traitors.
spies and subversive-diversionists). In 1954, it was ex-

This position was repeated in the General Principles of
'Criminal Legislation laid down in 1958. Thereafter. in
1961-62, it has been extended to certain economic crimes.

does not appear to have ruled against this contention (ibid ; at pages 1432,
'I434, and 1435), and the jury acquitted the prisoner, apparently upon this
ground. <a href="/doc/480687/" id="a_696">In R. v. M</a>. (1915), II Ct. App. Rep. 207, at page 214, in which a

held that the truth or falsity of the infonnation supplied was immaterial

Taking of bribe was a capital offence in the Russian
Criminal Code of 1922. In 1927, it was changed to impri-

imprisonment up to 5 years for an ordinary offence, and
imprisonment up to 10 years for a second conviction or
bribery with extortion. The present position is as fol--

"Sahasa.----The word "Sahasa" is a generic term compris- Sahasa or
ing Various offences having the common characteristic of delibﬁfate
being attended with or accompanied by the use of force. :i'1g:§)gl:f1Sc'c
In its broader sense, therefore, it included certain offences '
which would also come under other descriptions of offences,
but in its restricted sense it was used to denote certain
speciﬁc offences such as mischief, robbery, murder, etc.,
characterised by deliberate and aggressive violence. Diﬂerence
Understood in this way, it differentiates itself from the between
'theft and kindred offences (steya) by the element of force gfegfa
which enters into its composition; the spring of action from I
which such an offence nroceeds is passion or rage. whereas
in cases of theft and other kinds of offences the spring of

</p><p id="p_2081">14--122 Law.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_227">194</span>
<p id="p_2082">action is avarice; to put it shortly offences of the former
kind are violent and aggressive in their character; while
offences of the latter kind are generally secretive in their
nature. Hence, the Mitakshara points out that although a
Saliasa (or violent offence) involves either theft, or verbal
abuse, or personal violence, or outrage of the modesty of a
woman as an element in its Constitution yet it differen-
tiates itself from them by the adjunct of aggressive vio-
lence which gives it a peculiar shape, and this differentia-
tion marks out that the offence should be visited with a
heavier punishment. There are three different degrees oi
this kind of oﬁence, of the first degree, intermediate and
grave, and different degrees of punishment were prescrib-
ed as appropriate to them. It was also laid down that if
several persons combined in striking another, they should
be visited with double the ordinary punishment, and fur-
thermore he who struck at the vital part was to receive
the severest sentence. In a case of Sahasa in the narrower
sense, as distinguished from dandparushia and SU'L'T€C.'i'a7't~
graham difference in caste did not lead to any difference in
sentence, but this must be understood as subject to the
general rule, that a Brahmin could never be capttally
punished, although in a proper case he might be chained or
imprisoned, or banished from the country branded with
marks of disgrace".
</p>
<p id="p_2083">C. Capital Punishment in Hindu Period

Before we deal in detail with the position regarding
capital punishment at each stage of the Hindu period, it
would be convenient to emphasize, by way of a rapid sur-
vey, the fact that capital punishment was in vogue at almost
every stage during the Hindu period.
</p>
<p id="p_2084">The emphasis on "Danda" (coercive authority of the
King) may be noticed. During the Vedic period (1500 to
600 B.C.) originated the doctrine of the Divine affinity of
the temporal ruler.'

The authority of the King was coupled with his obliga-
tion towards his subjectsf and the coercive authority
(danda) of the ruler was recognised as the cause of
Dharma."
</p>
<p id="p_2085">1. U. N. Ghoshal, A History of Indian Political Ideas, (Oxford Uni-
versity Press), (1959), page 20 ; He also refers to P. S. Deshmukh, The
Origin and Development of Religfon in Vedfc Litcraitre, (Cxford University
Press), (1933), Chapters 9 to 13.

P383) (1959), page 29-
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_228">195</span>
<p id="p_2088">In the pre-Maurya period (600 to 325 B.C.), the obliga-
tion of the King to protect his subject was developed. In
one of the earliest Smritis} the list of oﬁ°enders punishable
with death includes those who caused injury to the seven
constituents of the State, and those who forged royal edicts.
etc. A King who fails to inflict punishment (danda;-') on. a
guilty man. or who punished an innocent man, was, requir-
ed to undergo a fasting. Some of the Pali Texts of that
period, while emphasizing the importance of righteousness,
also emphasised the duty of the King to protect his people?
</p>
<p id="p_2089">Kautilyail explains, that a king who givesbut just
punishment does not destroy righteousness. Kautilya also
emphasises that danda (punishment) is the surest and most
universal means of ensuring public security."
</p>
<p id="p_2090">During the Maurya period (325 B.C. to 320 A.D.), follow-
ing Kautilyaf' the law of treason was developed. Various
acts of treason attracted the death penalty.
</p>
<p id="p_2091">The Smritis of Manu and Yajnavalkya emphasized the
King's duty to protect his subjects. An oft--quoted text of
Manu says, that danda rules all people, danda alone protects
tnem, danda is awake when others are asleep, and the wise
declare danda to be identical with the law; through fear of
danda all creatures, movable and immovable, "yield them~
selves for enjoyment", and swerve not from their duties.
When danda is applied after due consideration, it makes all
people happy, but when applied without consideration, it
destroys everything. If the King does not untiringly apply
danda against the wicked, the strong would roast the
weaker like ﬁsh in a spit. When dtmda walks about destroy-
ing sinners, the people are not disturbed, provided that its
wielder discerns we1l.7

Manu, therefore, emphasised the obligation of the King
to detect and punish all culprits, and included, among those
punishable with death, even thieves caught with stolen
goods and the implements of theft."

 In the dialogue between Yudhisthira and Bhishrna'-'
about danda. Bhishma states that danda is the means plac-
ed in the hands of the King for the smooth running of all
human affairs on the path of dharma.
</p>
<p id="p_2102">In the address of Kaninka Bhardvaja," danda is first
conceived in general terms to be a fundamental political
principle and a guard of the security of person and property
as well as stability of the social order. Secondly, the key
to this function is the principle that fear of danda is the
grand motive for the individual's obedience to authority.
Then, the purpose of the Divine ordination of danda in the
kings favour is stated to be the fulﬁlment of law. Thirdly,
the qualiﬁcations required for the king's use of danda are
discrimination and impartiality. At one place, Bhishmat
asked the king to slay without hesitation a person acting
against the interest of his kingdom, whoever he may be.
At another place? Bhishma declared the king in whose
Kingdom women are forcibly abducted, to be more dead
than alive. These passages are referred to in order to show
the emphasis placed in those times on protection of society.''

In the Buddhist Sanskrit and late Pali texts, one ﬁnds
references relating to death sentence. One work states. that
the king is one who rules and guides the world; he cen-
sures, ﬁnes and executes the man who transgresses his
commands; ruling in righteousness, he becomes clear to his
people.7

In another work,8 Asvaghosha states, that after the birth
of Buddha, Buddha's follower Shuddhodhana. while not
executing criminals, kept them under mild restraint, as
their release would not have been good policy."

<p id="p_2115">D. Principles of Punishment in Hindu Law

The principles of punishment have been well put by
Kautilya} Punishment, if too severe, alarm men; it too
mild, it frustrates itself. Punishment, according to deserts
should be encouraged. Punishment, properly determined
and awarded, makes the subjects conform to dharma (right),
artha (wealth) and lcama (desire). When improperly
awarded due to ignorance, under the inﬂuence of lust and
anger, it enrages even hermitg and (religious) mendicants,
not to speak of householders. Punishment unawarded
would verily foster the regime of the ﬁsh i.e. in the absence
of the upholder of law the strong would swallow up the
weak. Protected by the upholder they would prosper.
</p>
<p id="p_2116">A good summing up of the objects of punishment as
conceived in the Hindu period is found in a recent study."
</p>
<p id="p_2117">'If we analyse the implied and explicit purposes of
punishment. we find that punishment was conceived,
First, as a deterrent measures calculated to strike fear
into the hearts of the criminally minded and to check
their immoral and anti--social passions. This purpose
was served particularly by disproportionately severe
punishment and by "branding", "parading" and publiciz-
ing punishment. The second object was the prevention
of the possibility of the cu1prit's repeating the crime.
So, the culprit was imprisoned, fettered, killed, or exil-
ed. Retribution may be said to be the third motive of
punishment in two dii'fer::nt senses: retaliation, and
making the wrongdoer suifer the fruits of his own
i«:u"rma. The first is particularly noticed in the mutila-
ticn of that very limb by which the wrong was done
(e.g. cutting off ﬁngers or hand of a thief, the tongue
of a defamer). Punishments, fourthly, are conceived
to be an educative, and, therefore, a reformative process
also. Sukra points out that, consistent with the Vedic
teaching of non-injury to life. a culprit should be edu-
cated (siksayet) and made to work. He takes a very
modern socio-psychological View when he says (4.1.110):
"Such persons were corrupted by bad company. The
king should punish them and always educate them back
on to the right path." But punishment was thought to
be, not only reformative, but also purificatory in a
moral sense. This is more evident in the fact that
punishment also included different forms of repentance,

<p id="p_2119">confession, prayer, penitential starvation, and long
periods of penance (e.g. a Brahmin, while spared capi-
tal punishment, had to live even as long as twelve years
in the forest in austerity and celibacy to atone for

murder)'.
</p><p id="p_2120">E. Classiﬁcation of Punishment in Hindu Law

The classiﬁcation of punishment in Hindu Law has been
elaborately explained by Dr. P. K. Sen}

'The chapter headed Dandabhedah deals with the
usual four-fold classiﬁcation based on the text of
Brhaspati: Vag-Dancla, Dhig-danda, Dhana-danda and
Vadha-danda.
</p>
<p id="p_2121">"Vag dhig dhanam vadhas caiva
caturdha Kathito dameh,
Purusam vibhavam dosam J natva
tam parikalpayet;
</p>
<p id="p_2122">Brhaspati"
</p>
<p id="p_2123">"Punishment is four-fold, namely, admonition, re-
proof, ﬁne and corporal. It should be meted out after
considering the offender, his pecuniary condition, and
the crime committed by him."
</p>
<p id="p_2124">The ﬁrst, Vag-dcmda, may be taken to mean punishing
with words i.e. giving a solemn warning such as "Thou hast
acted most improperly." The second, Dhig-danda, means
punishing with strong censure such as "shame on thee,
thou miscreant"; it differs from the ﬁrst in intensity, not in
kind. The third, Dhana-danda, means punishing with ﬁne
which may be of two kinds, ﬁxed and fluctuating. In cer-
tain cases the ﬁxed ﬁne may easily be imposed. Certain
other cases do not admit of such easy handling. Allowance
must be made in the latter class of cases for some elasticity
in view of repeated inclinations to offence and other cir-
cumstances such as violence attending it. When the offence
is accompanied by violence the punishment must be grad-
ed according to circumstances, to ﬁt mathama sahasa (vio-
lence of the ﬁrst order), madhyama sahasa (vio-
lence of the second order), and uttam sahasa (violence of
the last or extreme kind).
</p>
<p id="p_2125">Vadha--d,anda requires detailed treatment. Vadha maybe
of three kinds pidana, angaccheda and pramapana. Pidana
(afflicting) is sub-divided into four modes: (i) tadana such
as whipping or flogging, (ii) avarodhana or restraint of
liberty by means of imprisonment, (iii) bandhana, restraint
of liberty by chaining, fetters and the like, Without actual

organs of the body. Manu mentions ten kinds of mutila-
tion. Brhaspati prescribes fourteen," referring to fourteen
parts of the body which may be mutilated, namely, hand,
leg, organ of generation, eye, tongue, ear, nose, half--tongue,
half--leg, thumb and the index ﬁnger taken together, fore-
head, upper lip, rectum and waist.
</p>
<p id="p_2127">Pramapana means capital punishment. it may be cf the
pure and the mixed Variety i.e., in the latter case mutilation
or some other form of punishment may be combined with
the death sentence. The pure variety again is of two kinds,
ordinary (avictram) and extraordinary (vicitram). The or-
dinary form of execution is by means of ordinary weapons
such as sword and the like; the extraordinary is by means
of impaling, or other awe-inspiring methods.
</p>
<p id="p_2128">t is noteworthy that according to Brhaspati Vag--o'a*r2a'a,
and dhig--danda, were within the jurisdiction of Vipras or
Pmdvivakas, whereas artha-danrlu and Vadha-danda were
within the sole jurisdiction of the King himself}

F. Different kinds of punishment in Hindu Law

The different kinds of punishment prescribed by the
Hindu Law, and some of the principles on which they were
directed to be administered, have been thus described by
Dr. P. N. Sen? "Yajnavalkya speaks of four classes of
punishment, viz., censure, rebuke, pecuniary punishment
and corporal punishment, and says that these should be
used either separately or jointly according to the nature
of the crime. Of these, mere censure was the lightest form
of punishment and rebuke came after it, pecuniary punish-
ment included fine and forfeiture of property and corporal
punishment included imprisonment, banishment, branding,
cutting of offending limbs, and lastly death sentence. It
goes without saying that the measure of punishment
depended chieﬂy on the gravity of the offence; if the offence
be not very serious, the punishment must be light, while if
the offence be serious the punishment must be severe

<p id="p_2130">G. Arguments against capital punishment in Hindu Law

Arguments against capital punishment are also met
with. This extract from an authoritative study may be

seen1 : -
</p>
<p id="p_2131">'It would be no exaggeration to say that the mind
of the intelligentsia must have been agitated on the
propriety or expediency of capital punishment. An in-
teresting evidence of this is to be found, in the Maha-
bharata (Chapter CCLVII of the Santiparva) in which
there is a discussion between King Dyumatsena and his
son Prince Satyavan. A number of men having been
brought out for execution at the Command of his
father, Prince Satyavan gives vent to his thoughts thus:
"Sometimes virtue assumes the form of sin and sin
assumes the form of virtue. It is not possible that the
destruction of individuals can ever be a virtuous act."
Thereupon Dyumatsena observes, "If the sparing of
those who should be killed be virtuous, if robbers be
spared, O Satyavan, all distinction between virtue and
vice will disappear". Satyavan rejoins, "Without des-
troying the body of the offender the King should punish
him as ordained by the scripture. The King should not
act otherwise, neglecting to reﬂect upon the character
of the offence and upon the science of morality. By
killing the wrongdoers, the King kills a large number of
innocent men. Behold! By killing a single robber, his
wife, mother, father and children, all are killed. When
injured by wicked persons the King should, therefore,
think seriously on the question of punishment. Some-
times a wicked person is seen to imbibe good conduct
from a pious person. It is seen that good children
spring from wicked persons. The wicked. therefore,
should not be exterminated. The extermination of the
wicked is not in consonance with eternal law. By
punishing them gently, by depriving them cf all their
riches, by chains and imprisonment, by disﬁguring them
they may be made to expiate their offences. Their re-
latives should not be punished by inﬂicting of capital
punishment on them.'

The sentiment and reasoning against capital punishment
is found in Sukraf according to whom. this bad practice
violates the Vedic injunction against taking any life, and
should be replaced by imprisonment for life. if necessary,
and a natural criminal should be transported to an island,
or fettered and made to repair the public roads. Fa Hsien

</p>
<p id="p_2136">'The punishments for theft are very heavy. In all Theft.
</p>
<p id="p_2137">cases of serious crimes the accused is sentenced to

death: he is impaled, hanged or drowned and often his

hands are hacked off and other tortures are inﬂicted for

the purpose of aggravating the punishment. The same.
punishments are ordained also in the case of burglary,
frequently repeated instances of picking pockets, rob-

<p id="p_2138">bery, stealing cows, horses or elephants or more than

10 Kumbhas of grains, more than 100 Palas of precious

cases amounting to many times the value of the stolen

theft as regards punishment and moreover taking part

in these crimes, abetting of every kind or refusing to

render help is regarded as equally criminal (Nr. 14, 12,

19 f, Y 2, 276, etc)'.

From the Manusmriti it appears that capital punishment
was awarded for theft of more than 10 "kumbhas"l. Rape
by a man of the lower caste with a woman of the higher
caste was a capital offence." Brahmins were not subject to
the death penalty." Mutilation of the particular offending

limb was also prescribed by Manuf'

J. Capital punishment and Buddhist rulers

It would appear, that in the fourth century B.C., capital
punishment was in force, and death penalty without torture
was administered for crimes accompanied with cruelty?'

Though, in the Buddhist period, the doctrine of Ahimsa
(non-violence) became prominent, the Emperor Asoka does
not seem to have abolished capital punishment totally. Re-
ference to capital punishment is found in his edicts."
</p>
<p id="p_2142">Vincent Smith7 observes---
</p>
<p id="p_2143">"The most pious Buddhist and Jain Kings had no
hesitation about inﬁicting capital punishment upon
their subjects, and Asoka himself continued to sanction
the death penalty throughout his reign. He was con-
tent to satisfy his humanitarian feelings by a slight
mitigation of the sanguinary penal code inherited from
his stern grandfather in conceding to condemned per-
sons three days' grace to prepare for death."8

Asoka's Pillar Edict IV has been thus translated":----

<p id="p_2144">'For as much as it is desirable that there should
be uniformity in judicial procedure and uniformity

the time of their conﬁnement the condemned men may
gain the next world and that among the people pious prac-
tices of various kinds may grow including self-control and
distribution of alms.'

There is a somewhat different version of. this Edict
given by some authors. Thus, Bhandarkarl gives the tol-
lowing translation:--
</p>
<p id="p_2156">"And even so far goes my order: to men who are
bound with fetters, on whom sentence has been passed
and who have been condemned to death, have
I granted three days as something rightfully and
exclusively their own. (In that interval) (their) re-
latives will indeed propitiate some (of the Rajukas)
in order to grant their life; and to propitiate Death,
they (i.e., the convicts) will give alms and observe
fasts pertaining to the next world? For my desire is
that even when the time (for their living) has expir-
ed they may win the next world and that manifold
pious practices, self--restraint and liberality may thus
grow among the people."
</p>
<p id="p_2157">In a recent study3, the position is thus stated:-----
</p>
<p id="p_2158">"Continuing his efforts to secure greater welfare
for his subjects, he orders a respite of three days be-
fore a death sentence is carried out. This is an act
of grace, since he recognizes that this time may,
in certain cases, be utilized to prove the innocence of
the condemned person or to secure his repentence.
It is curious that, despite his ﬁrm belief in Buddhism,
he did not abolish capital punishment. Doubtlessly
he regarded capital punishment as essential to the
maintenance of law and order, and, despite his per-
sonal convictions to the contrary, felt that justice in
the state must be based on recognised painful punish-
ments or pleasurable rewards4."

"Thus speaks the Beloved of the Gods, the king
Piyadassi: When I had been consecrated twenty-
six years I had this inscription on Dhamma engrav-
ed. My rajukas (rural oiﬁcers) are appointed over
many hundred thousands of people. In judgment and
punishment I have given them independent author-
ity, so that the rajukas may fulﬁl their func-
tions calmly and fearlessly and may promote the
welfare and happiness of the country people and bone-
ﬁt them. They will learn what makes for happiness
and unhappiness and together with those devoted to
Dhamma, they will admonish the country people that
they may obtain happiness in this world and the next.
The rajukas are eager to obey me and they will like-
wise obey my envoys who know my wishes. These
likewise will admonish (the erring rajukas) so that
they will be able to give me satisfaction.

able to care for the child satisfactorily, so my rajukas
have been appointed for the welfare and happiness of

functions fearlessly, conﬁdently, and cheerfully, I
have given them independent authority in judgment
and punishment. But it is desirable that there should
be uniformity in judicial procedure and punishment.

are imprisoned or sentenced to death are to be given
three days respite. Thus their relations may plead
for their lives. or, if there is no one to plead for them,
they may make donations or undertake a fast for a
better rebirth in the next life. For it is my wish that
they should gain the next world. And among the
people various practices of Dhamma are increasing,

<p id="p_2191">The position in Mahratta times was as follows4:----
</p>
<p id="p_2192">"For great crimes, the Sursoobedars had the power
of punishing capitally; Mamlitdars in such cases re-
quired the Peishwa's authority. The great Jagherdars
had power of life and death within their respective
territories. Bramins could not be executed; but state
prisoners were poisoned, or destroyed by deleterious
food, such as equal parts of ﬂour and salt. Women
were mutilated, but rarely put to death. There was
no prescribed form of trial; torture to extort confes«
sion was very common; and confession was generally
thought necessary to capital punishment. The chief
authority, in doubtful cases, commonly took the opi~
nion of his ofﬁcers; and some Mamlitdars in the Satara
country, under both the Pritee Needhee and Peishwa,
employed Punchayets to pronounce on the innocence
or guilt of the accused; but this system can only be
traced to the time of Shao; and though so well worthy
of imitation was by no means general, nor are its be-
neﬁts understood or appreciated in the present day."

<p id="p_2193">An interesting incident may be referred to in this (On-
nection5. Soon after the death of Madhavrao I, it was sus-
pected that Ragunathrao was privy to the murder, and he
asked Ram Sastri (the celebrated Chief Justice of Poona)
what was the penalty for the act. Ram Shastri not only
declared that capital punishment was the only penalty for
the offence, but declined to serve any longer under a
Peshwa who had murdered his own nephew. This was
roundabout the year 1774. Later on, in 1779, he was induc-
ed to return to Poona to resume his work, with an annual
salary of Rs. 2,000 and an allowance of Rs. 1,000 for his
palankeen.

were punished, according to the extent of their crimes,

and left to their fate. Perjury was punished by the
perjurer being made to make good the loss that de-

been punished by the cutting off of the right hand;
but this, like almost every crime at Poona, was com-
mutable for money. Women were never punished by
death for any crime. Turning them out of their castes,
parading them on an ass with their heads shaved, cutt-

CAPIIAL PUNISHMENT IN INDIA DURING THE MUSLIM PERIOD
I.--IN'rRonUc'roRY

During the Muslim times (Mughal times) the main
svstem of criminal law administered was the Quranic one.
The system had originated and grown outside India. Its
main sources were the Quran as supplemented and inter-
preted by case~law and opinions of jurists. Since all the
three sources were "trans-Indian",1 it became necessary
for Indian Qazis to have a digest of Islamic law. The last
such digest was the Fatawa-i-Alamgiri compiled by a syn-
dicate of theologians under the orders of Aurangzeb~'z

That portion of the Islamic Criminal Law which con-
stituted the crimes in the estimation of all nations. was
applied to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, e.g. adultery,
murder, theft, etc".
</p>
<p id="p_2204">In the Mughal period, Muslim sovereigns used to ad-
minister justice in person. Thus, Sultan Muhammad Tugh~
laq constituted himself the Supreme Court of Appeal and
used to keep four Muftis, to whom he used to say that
they should be careful in speaking that which they con-
sidered right, because if any one should be put to death
wrongfully the blood of that man would be upon their
head. If they convicted the prisoner after long discussion,
he would pass orders for the execution of the prisoner".

<p id="p_2209">Akbar's idea of justice may be gathered from ms ms-

talte away life till after the most mature deliberations'.
The Emperor himself was the ﬁnal Court of Appeal, and

The Indian Penal Code</a> was, it is said, inﬂuenced by the
French Penal Code and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_717"> the Code</a> of Louisianal; but the
foundation was the English law divested of technicalities.
Until it was enacted for a long time, the substantive law
0} the criminal courts consisted of the Muslim law, with
modiﬁcation made in some respects by the Regulations?
</p>
<p id="p_2228">The general criminal law enforced in the Upper Pro-
vinces also (until<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_718"> the Indian Penal Code</a> was enacted) was
the Muhammadan law as altered by British regulations

and judicial decisions".
</p>
<p id="p_2229">Even in Madras, "for want of anything better" the
Muhammadan criminal law as interpreted by law officers
and modified by enactment was applied until<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_719"> the Penal
Code</a> came into force"-5.
</p>
<p id="p_2230">It was only in Bombay that an attempt had been made
to codify the criminal law in 1827 by a Regulation".
</p>
<p id="p_2231">In view of this position, it is desirable to study briefly
the Muslim criminal law.
</p>
<p id="p_2232">The position regarding the criminal law applicable be-
fore<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_720"> Indian Penal Code</a> is thus stated7:--
</p>
<p id="p_2233">"By Warren Hastings' plan in 1772, the Muham-
madan Criminal Law was retained in the Criminal
courts subject to the interpretation of Government, or
of the subordinate English functionaries, where its
provisions were manifestly unjust. In 1790,
when the Governor-General accepted the Nizamut of
Bengal, the Criminal Courts then established were
directed to pronounce sentence according to the Muham-
madan law; and in cases of murder according to the
doctrines of Yusuf and Muhammads, as has been al-
ready noticed. The Muhammadan law was further
ordered to be continued in the like manner in the
Criminal Courts established in 1793"."

sons, not professing the Muhammadan faith, might

</p>
<p id="p_2244">At Madras, in the year 1802, provisions were made
respecting the administration of the Muhammadan
Criminal law in the Courts of the East--India Company,
similar to those enacted in Bengal by Regulation 9 of
1703".
</p>
<p id="p_2245">The Criminal law administered in the Company's
Courts at Bombay previous to 1827, was ordered to be
regulated by the law of the accused party: Christians
and Parsis to be judged on the principles of the Eng-
lish law, and Muhammadans and Hindus according to
their own particular laws3. The Muhammadan law
was to be regulated by the Fatwa of the law officers,
which was directed to be given according to the doc-
trine of Yusuf and Muhammad; respect which, and
the law of the Hindus, the Judges were enjoined to
refer to the translation of the Hidayah by Hamilton,
and of the Hindu laws by Halhed and Sir William
Jones; as likewise to a tract entitled "Observations",
which then constituted part of the criminal Code for
the province of Malabar and Salsette; etc." In 1819,
the Hindu Criminal Law was directed to be adminis-
tered to Hindus in the special Court'. The Native Cri-
minal Laws were abolished in the Bombay Presidency
in 1827, and a regular Code substituted in their place.
</p>
<p id="p_2246">The Muhammadan Criminal Law, even when
first reserved to the natives of the British territories
in India, was subjected to many important restrictions
in its application; and it has been so modiﬁed by the
subsequent Regulations in the Presidencies of Bengal
and Madras as to present no vestiges of its sanguinary
character, and but few of its original imperfections?"

<p id="p_2254">II.--MUsL1M LAW AS IN FORCE AT THE ADVENT or BRITISH'
RULE

General picture
For the present purpose it is unnecessary to give a
detailed discussion of the theory of punishment in Muslim

Law. But the following brief extracts from an authorita-
tive book will sufﬁcel, to give a general picture:-
</p>
<p id="p_2255">Classiﬁcation of Crimes
According to Muslim ideas of jurisprudence crimes-
</p>
<p id="p_2256">fall into three groups, namely:--
</p><p id="p_2257">(a) offences against God,
</p><p id="p_2258">(b) offences against the State, and
</p><p id="p_2259">(c) offences against private individuals.
</p>
<p id="p_2260">Punishment for the ﬁrst of these classes is "the i

right of God (Haqq Allah)", while for the other two
classes of offences the injured party may forgive or
compound with the wrong--doer. Thus, curiously
enough, manslaughter is not a violation of God's law
nor of the king's peace, but only a damage to the family
of the murdered man, which can be settled by paying
money compensation (called "the price of blood") to
the next of kin of the victim, Without the Executive
Head of the State or the Judge of Canon Law having
to take any further notice of it. It was only when the
relatives of the murdered man refused to accept money
damages and insisted on retaliation, that the quazi
had to pronounce the sentence of death and the execu-
tive to enforce it.
</p>
<p id="p_2261">The Institute of Timur puts the matter with great
clearness and force. He writes=--
</p>
<p id="p_2262">"Robbers and thieves, in whatever place they
might be found, or by whomsoever detected, I
commanded to be put to death." (Note: This, how»
ever, was not in exact accordance with Quranic
law.)

And I ordained that, if any one seized by vio-
lence the property of another, the value of that
property should be taken from the oppressor, and
be restored to the oppressed.
</p>
<p id="p_2263">Concerning other crimes--the breaking of teeth,
the putting out of eyes, the slitting and cutting olf of
the ears and nose, wine drinking and adultery,--1
ordained that whoever should be guilty of these, or
other crimes, they should be brought into the courts
of the ecclesiastical and lay judges--(the exact terms
being Qazi-i-Islam and Qazi-i--Ahdas,--ahdas meaning

I. ladunath Sarkar, Mughal Administration, (1952),"page's :31 toxic':-9:
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_246">213</span>
<p id="p_2264">"ritual impurity"); that the ecclesiatical judge should
decide on those causes which are determinable by the
sacred laws (Shara), and that those which did_ not
fall under his cognizance (urﬁ bashad, i.e., pertain to
the customary or secular law) should be investigated
and laid before me by the lay judge." (Davy's Insti-
tutes of Timur, pages 251 and 253, corrected by refer--
ence to the Persian text).
</p>
<p id="p_2265">Description of punishments allowed by Muhammadan law
The punishments for crimes were of four classes:--
</p><p id="p_2266">(a) Hadd.
</p><p id="p_2267">(b) Tazir.
</p><p id="p_2268">(c) Qisas.
</p><p id="p_2269">(d) Tashhir.
</p>
<p id="p_2270">Hadd (its plural being hadud), means a punishment
prescribed by Canon Law and considered as 'the right of
God', which, therefore, no human judge can alter.
</p>
<p id="p_2271">Hadd must take certain prescribed forms of punishment,
viz;
</p>
<p id="p_2272">(i) Stoning to death for adultery; scourging for
fornication [100 stripes].
</p>
<p id="p_2273">(ii) Scourging for falsely accusing a married
woman of adultery [80 stripes].
</p>
<p id="p_2274">(iii) Scourging for drinking wine and other intoxi-
</p>
<p id="p_2275">cating liquors. For a free man the punishment was 80
stripes for wine drinking.
</p>
<p id="p_2276">(iv) Cutting oﬁ the right hand for theft.
</p>
<p id="p_2277">(V) For simple robbery on the highway, the loss
of hands and feet; for robbery with murder, death
either by the sword or by cruciﬁxion.
</p>
<p id="p_2278">Tazir is punishment intended to reform culprit . . . . . . ..
tazir is inflicted for such transgressions as have no hadd
punishment and no expiation prescribed for them. The
kind and amount of tazir is left entirely to the discretion of
the judges . . . . . .The Judge can completely remit the tazir.
The process of trial is simple in contrast to that for hadd.
Hence attempt was often made to escape tazir by bribery
[Ency. Islam iv. 710].
</p>
<p id="p_2279">It was not the "right of God". It could take one of these
four forms:--
</p>
<p id="p_2280">(i) Public reprimand (tadib).
</p>
<p id="p_2281">(ii) Jirr, or dragging the offender to the door [of
the court house?] and exposing him to public scorn;
somewhat like putting a man in the pillory,

</p><p id="p_2282">(iii) Imprisonment or exile.

must not be less than 3, nor more than 39 (or 75
according to the Hanaﬁ School, as in Abu Yusui').
</p>
<p id="p_2284">We are told in the Hedaya, a Persian compilation of
Islamic law according to the Hanaﬁ school of jurists drawn
up by Mulla Tajuddin, Mir Muhammad Hussain, and Mulla
Shariatullah about 1780, that the above punishments should
be inﬁicted according to the offender's rank, and that
imprisonment and scourging were to be conﬁned to the
third and fourth grades of the people, the petty traders
and common labourers, respectively, (or as Manu would
have put it, the Vaishyas and Shudras),--while the lighter
forms of punishment were reserved for the nobility and
gentry; (Hedaya, 203-204; full details in Hughes, 632-634).

<p id="p_2285">As for tazir--bil-mal or 'chastisement in property' z'.e.
ﬁne, only Abu Hanifa pronounces it to be legal, but all
other learned men reject it as opposed to the Quranic law.
(Hedaya, 203) Aurangzeb, who was a strict Hanaﬁ and
himself well--read in Canon Law and the literature of pre-
cedents (fatawa), issued an order to the diwan of Gujarat
and also of other subahs, in 1679, to the effect that as ﬁne
was not permitted by Canon Law, every civil official
(amal), zamindar or other person found guilty of an
offence, should, according to the nature of his act, be impri-
soned or dismissed or banished, but not punished with
ﬁne, (Mirat-i-Ahmadi, i. 293).

<p id="p_2286">Private vengeance, public degradation, etc.

Qisas or retaliation: This was the personal right of the
victim or his next of kin, in the case of certain crimes
notably murder. If he demanded the legal punishment,
the qazi was bound to inﬂict it, and neither he nor the
king could exercise the_royal clemency by modiﬁcation or
abrogation of the sentence. If, on the other hand, the next
of kin of the deceased was satisﬁed with the money damag-
es, called "price of blood" (Arabic diya) offered by the
murderer, or pardoned him unconditionally, it was his
look-out, and neither the qazi nor the king was to take any
further notice of the crime. For minor oﬁence, the retalia-
tion was, as laid down by the Mosaic law, "a tooth for a
tooth and an eye for an eye", with certain exceptions.
(Hughes, 481, Encyc. Ist. ii. 1038).
</p>
<p id="p_2287">Tashhr or public degradation was a popularly devised
punishment of universal currency throughout the Muslim
world and even Hindu India and Medieval Europe. It is
neither recognised nor condemned in the law-books of
Islam, but was inflicted by all Muslim qazis and kings, and
even by the lay public, as it was a mild form of lynching:
'In India, the offender's head was shaven, and he was
mounted on an ass with his face turned towards its tail,
covered with dust, sometimes with a garland of old shoes

placed round his neck, paraded through the streets with
noisy music, and turned out of the city. "The judge may
blacken the face of the culprit, cut his hair or have him
led through the streets, etc." [Encyclo, Islam, i. 132.].
This last refers to the Arabian practice.
</p>
<p id="p_2288">As for offences against the State, such as rebellion,
peculation and default in the payment of revenue, the
sovereign inflicted punishment at his pleasure, because the
Quranic law gives no guidance here. Among the prevalent
modes of putting an offender to death were having him
trodden to death [the last being also sanctioned by medie-
val English law]. Tortures of various degrees of ingenuity
were resorted to. Theft (sarqa) is punishable with the
cutting off of one hand one foot. But if the oﬁender has
robbed and killed, he is to be put to death. . . .and his body
publicly exposed for three days on a cross or in some other
way. The punishment of death is here considered a haqq
Allah and blood--money is out of the question. All accom-
plices are punished in the same way. The judge can inﬂict
the above punishments, as hadd, only when all the legal
conditions are fulﬁlled. The legal inquiry has to be con-
ducted, witnesses are necessary, or a confession. If the
thief has given back the article stolen before the charge
is made, he is immune from punishment [Ency. lst, iv. 173-
174].

The Muslim Criminal Law compared more favourably
with the English Criminal law as it was in force at that
time. The English law still prescribed barbarous punish-
ments and contained some glaring anomalies, while, as
Hastings had declared, the Muslim law Was founded 'on
the most lenient principle and an abhorrence of blood-
shed". '

<p id="p_2294">A brief summary of Muslim law of homicide is quoted
below from one study':----
</p>
<p id="p_2295">The law of murder, for example, needed radical altera-
tion if life was to be made secure. Abu Hanifa, whose
opinions were generally accepted by the Bengal Judges.
had drawn a sharp distinction between the two kinds Of
homicide known by the terms Amd (wilful murder) and
Shabih--amd (culpable homicide not amounting to murder),
although such distinction was not recognised by the Quran.
The distinction was based on the method by which the
crime was committed. If a man killed another by striking
him with his ﬁsts, throwing him from the upper floors of
a house, throwing him down a well or into a river,
strangling him, or with a stick, stone, club, or any other
weapon on which there was no iron and which would not
draw blood, he was guilty only of shabih-amd, not of
murder. and he could not be capitally punished? A man
was guilty of murder only if he used a dab (knife) or
some other blood-drawing instrument, and was liable to
be sentenced to death3. Persons 'guilty of shabih-amd were
merely sentenced to pay the blood-ﬁne to their victims'
relatives if those relatives chose to accept it. Abu Hanifa.
however. had declared that if a man repeatedly committed
murder by strangling, he might be executed'. Abu Hanifa,
who was born in the eightieth year of the Jejira, had
never taken part in the administration of justice,
though he had been greatly revered as a virtuous and
scholarly theologian. It was said of him that he left his
writings and opinions open to the correction of his disci-
ples in so far as those opinions might be found to differ
from the Holy Tradition; but although these disciples,
Abu Yusuf and Muhammad, the former being Chief
Justice at Baghdad, did, it was said, help to bring their
master's doctrines into great renown, yet nevertheless they
entirely diﬁered with him regarding the punishment of
homicide, laying down the more rational doctrine that if the
intention of murder be proved, no distinction should be
drawn with regard to the method employed'. Abu Yusuf's
opinion, however, never came to supersede that of Abu
Hanifa, and the important point we have to notice is that

<p id="p_2300">the latter's view Was generally accepted and acted upon
in Bengal at this time'.
</p>
<p id="p_2301">In several other cases the Muhammadan Law which
was administered in Bengal did not permit murderers to
be executed. Provided they were Muslims, neither fathers
nor mothers suifered death for the murder of their children,
but were ﬁned; they were liable to be hanged only for
murdering other people's children. Grandfathers and
grandmothers enjoyed a similar immunity with respect to
their grandchildren; so did a Master for the murder of his
slave, or a man for the murder of his son-in--1aw, provided
that his daughter was actually living with her husband
at the time. Patricide or matricide, however, might be
punished with death'.
</p>
<p id="p_2302">Homicide was justifiable in the following cases: A
woman might kill a man who persisted in carrying on an
indecent conversation "with violence and il1--will"; a man
using a dangerous weapon in the streets of a town during
the night, or outside the town during the day, might legal-
ly be killed". Under certain circumstances a man might
kill his wife if he caught her in the act of adultery, and also
her paramour; and he might slay a man who attempted
to rape his wife or his slave girl. The authorities who were
followed in the Courts of Justice in Bengal differed some-
what on this matter. One law Book laid down that a man
might kill another who attempted to rape his wife or slave-
girl. Another authority maintained that an adulterer
might be slain provided that, if he "made a noise" to give
the offender a chance to desist; second, the adulterer
neither ﬂed nor desisted on hearing the noise; third, the
offender was a Mussulman; and fourth, the offender was
seen in the very act. A third authority stated: "A man
finding another with his wife, it is lawful for him to kill
him: should he know that the fornicator will cease his
attempt at his crying out, or frightening 'him with weapon
not mortal, he is not to slay him. Should he know that
his death only wil restrain him, itis permitted to slay him".
A fourth authority emphasises the necessity of producing
witnesses to prove the act of fornication. "If a murderer
shall state that he has slain anyone on account of fornica-
tion, and the heirs of the slain shall deny his allegation,
the murderer having no witnesses, his assertion being

man might slay a person caught in the act of robbing his

house'-'.
</p>
<p id="p_2304">But by far the most important reason why murderers
frequently escaped the death penalty was that provision
of the Muhammadan Law which gave to the sons or next
of kin the privilege of pardoning the murderer of their
parents or kinsmen. This misplaced power of life and
death made the fate of a murdered largely depend on the
caprice, venality, or indifference of the deceased man's

relatives.
</p><p id="p_2305">Detailed Analysis

A.--Homicide

The Muslim law of homicide (as administered at the
advent of the British rule) seems to have been elaborate.
Centain types of homicide were regarded as lawful and
justiﬁed. Further, "retaliation" for the murder was allow-
ed in certain cases. Homicide in self-defence or in the
prevention of adultery, rape or other serious offences or
at the express desire of the person killed was excusable, and
so was homicide committed under threat of death". Apart
from these, and apart from speciﬁed cases, homicide was
an offence and "wilful homicide"--Qatl-i-Amd4--was
punishable with death or retaliation where permissible. The
other types of illegal homicide were punishable with "ﬁne
of blood" (Diyut), and, in certain cases, by expiation and
exclusion from the inheritance'!

This brings us to the question of what was "wilful
homicide", and what were the other types of "illegal homi-

The policy of the British being to interfere as little as
possible with the Muslim Penal law, only such modiﬁca-

defects.

<p id="p_2372">In 1772, for suppressing robbery, a provision was made
that dacoits were to be executed in their villages, the vil-

could extend to death if that was the prescribed sentence

Judges were directed to commute the punishment to impri-

Regarding hostility to Government open hostility to the
British Government, or actual commission of any overt
act of rebellion against the authority of the same, or the
act of openly aiding and abetting the enemies of the British
Government were, in 1804, declared to be liable to the
immediate punishment of death and to the forfeiture of the
property, etc, of the convict'. The regulation provided for
trial by courts martial and was applicable during times of
war or open rebellion, but did not preclude2 the Govern-
ment irom causing the persons to be charged under Regu-
lations 4 of 1799 and 20 of 1803.
</p>
<p id="p_2426">Regarding robbery, Bengal Regulation 3 of 1805 made
special provisions". It had been brought to light that many
village watchmen and some police otﬁcers were concerned
in the preparation of robbery, or Connived at the commis-
sion of robbery. Hence the Regulation laid down that any
police officer convicted of robbery by open violence or of
murder, wounding, maiming or any other aggravating act.
in the prosecution of robbery or an attempt to rob was to be
sentenced to death. Any direct or indirect connivance at
any of these crimes on the part of any police officer was
to be considered as its actual commission and punishable
accordingly".
</p>
<p id="p_2427">By Bengal Regulation XVIII of 1817, persons convicted
of murder in prosecution of robbery, burglary or theft were
made liable to the sentence of death". By <a href="/doc/560927/" id="a_761">section 15</a> of
the same Regulation, exemption of Brahmins of Benaras
from capital punishment was abolished7.

<p id="p_2467">The broad features of the Muslim Criminal law, as alter-
ed by Regulations on the subject, before<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_782"> the Indian Penal
Code</a> was enacted, may be indicated.
</p>
<p id="p_2468">Regarding sentences. it was felt.'-2 that the discretion
which the Muslim criminal law left for henious crimes was
rather unlimited, and its administration became arbitrary
and uncertain. In the adjudiciation of punishment under
the discretion thus allowed, the position regarding sent-
ence (it was stated) was often governed by a consideration
of the degree of proof rather than the degree of guilt and
criminality of the act established against the accused. It
was considered necessary to amend the law on these points,
and that was done by a Bengal Regulationi'.
</p>
<p id="p_2469">Before this, the position was that the sentences of the
court were to be regulated by Muslim law except in cases
in which a deviation from it was expressly directed by any
Regulation".
</p>
<p id="p_2470">The operation of the law may be illustrated with refer-
ence to an actual case. Four persons were charged with
murder. The principal was sentenced to death, one con-
victed of being an accessory before the fact and of bring-
ing a false accusation of murder against an innocent person
was sentenced to imprisonment for life; the remaining two
convicted of privity of crime after the fact and concealing
their knowledge thereof, were sentenced to imprisonment
for three years"'.
</p>
<p id="p_2471">The rule of the Muslim law, that if any one of the gang
of robbers commits murder, the prescribed punishment is
inflicted on the whole, was maintained?
</p>
<p id="p_2472">In cases of murder, wounding or other personal injury,
a description of the weapon or other instrument said to
have been used in the perpetration of the act Was to be
recorded in the papers including such particulars as are
available to ﬁx the intent of the prisoner, the length of the
instrument, its general form. if not one in common use,

<p id="p_2481">It was recognised that there was a great difference
between an offence entered upon with deliberation and a
Criminal intent and one committed with premediation and
unprovoked by previous enmity and malice. Intoxication
was considered as a ground of mitigation for punishment
in certain cases, unless wilful'.
</p>
<p id="p_2482">In all cases where the Sessions Court condemns a pri-
soner to suffer death penalty or imprisonment for life,
it was to transmit a copy of the sentence to the Nizamut
Adawlut, and not to execute the sentence till the ﬁnal

</p>
<p id="p_2483">There seems to have been some controversy as to
whether a person who is compelled by another by a menace
of death to murder a third person, could be excused for
the murder. One View was, that in such cases the person
compelled, as the "instrument" rather than the author of
the homicide, and therefore, subject to discretionary
punishment only if the circumstances of the case so re-
quired. Another View was, that both the parties were

liable to murder."

From the Report No. 31 of the Indian Law Commissioners

would appear, that they were regarded as governed by
the English law. Act 31 of 1838 embodying the provisions
of criminal law passed in the ﬁrst year of Queen Victoria
amended the law on the subject. Its principal object was
to take away capital punishment in certain cases, and to
mitigate the rigour of the law in other respects.

l"tliCO.Vll\/Il:)l\'DA'l'IO;\KS or THE INDIAN LAW COIx/llVIlSSIONl7.'RS
Drajt Penal Code, 1837

The l)rai't<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_789"> Penal Code</a> (First Report) was prepared by
the lndian Law Commissioners and submitted in 1837.
After stating the reasons for proposing. the enactment of
a uniform<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_790"> Penal Code</a> to take the place of the rules of
Muslim laws and the various Regulations modifying it or
in Bombay codifying the Penal Law' and explaining the
scheme of the proposed Code", they proceded to set out
the recommendations in the form of a Bill. Under clause
40, one of the punishments to which offenders were liable
was death. The next was transportation". Clause 41 gave
power to commute the sentence of death to the Govern-
ment of the Presidency without the offender's consent.
The offences which were made capital seem to be the
following:----
</p>
<p id="p_2533">Clause 109--waging war etc.-- (death or transportation
for life or imprisonment of either description for life and
also forfeiture of all property).
</p>
<p id="p_2534">(Clauses 116 and 1l7--abetting mutiny etc.----only
transportation for life etc.)

(Clause 19l--Giving, etc., false evidence with the in-
tention, etc., that any person may be convicted of capital
oifence--transportation for life or rigorous imprisonment
not less than 7 years, etc. But where innocent person was
executed, it was regarded as culpable homicide.--see
clause 294, illustration (d).
</p>
<p id="p_2535">Clauses 294, 295 and 300--~murder------death or transpor-
tation for life or rigorous imprisonment for life and also
ﬁne.
</p>
<p id="p_2536">(There were lesser punishments for manslaughter,
voluntary culpable homicide with consent or in defence
and for causing death by rash or negligent act.)

Perjury--illustration (d) to clause 294 ran as fol1ows:----
</p>
<p id="p_2537">"(d) A with the intention or knowledge aforesaid
falsely deposes before a Court of Justice that he saw
Z commits a capital crime. Z is convicted and execut-
ed in consequence. A has committed the offence of

ing hurt in an attempt to commit murder--transportation

</p>
<p id="p_2543">Clause 380--Dac0ity with muirder---If any one of six or
more persons who are conjunctly committing dacoity com-
mits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those

also be liable for fine.
</p>
<p id="p_2544">We now come to the reasons given by the framers of
the 1837 Draft in support of the various provisions relat-
ing to the death sentence suggested by them. As regards

death sentence generally, their observations were as
fo1lows':--
</p>
<p id="p_2545">"First among the punishments provided for offenc-
es by this Code stands death. No argument that has
been brought to our notice has satisﬁed us that it would
be desirable wholly to dispense with this punishment.
But we are convinced that it ought to be very sparing-
ly inflicted, and we propose to employ it only in cases
where either murder or the highest offence against
the State has been committed".
</p>
<p id="p_2546">They were not apprehensive that they would be
thought to have resorted too frequently to capital punish-
ment. Rather they were afraid that people might criti-
cise<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_791"> the Code</a> as erring on the other side. In this context,
they discussed the question whether gang robbery, cruel
mutilation of the person and rapes should be punishable
with death. "These are doubtless offences which, if we
looked only at their enormity, at the evil which they pro-
duce, at the terror which they spread through society, at
the depravity. . . . which they indicate, we might be includ-
ed to punish capitally. But atrocities as they are, they
cannot, as it appears to us, be placed in the same class
with murder." "To the great majority of mankind, noth-
ing is so dear as life. And we are of opinion that to put
robbers ravishers, and mutilators on the same footing with
murderers is an arrangement which diminishes the security
of life?"
</p>
<p id="p_2547">They observed, that there was a close connection in
practice between murder and most of those offences which
came nearest to murder in enormity. The offender in

</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_267">236</span>
<p id="p_2556">those offences had always in his power to add murder to
his guilt. The same opportunities, etc., which enabled a
man to rob, to mangle, or to ravish, would enable him to
go further and to despatch his victim. By doing so, he
would remove the only witness of the crime. If the
punishment of the crime which he has already committed
be exactly the same with the punishment of murder, the
offender would have no restraining motive. "A law which
imprisons for rape and robbery, and hangs for murder,
holds out to ravishers and robbers a strong inducement to
spare the lives of those whom they have injured. A law
which hangs for rape and robbery, and which also hangs
for murder, holds out, indeed if it be rigorously carried
into effect, a strong motive to deter men from rape and
robbery, but as soon as a man has ravished, or robbed, it
holds out to him a strong motive to follow up his crime
with a murderl."
</p>
<p id="p_2557">Regarding crimes against property, the framers of the
draft observed'~', that a great shock would be caused to
public feeling if, While the most atrocious personal out-
rages (short of murder) were exempted from punishment
or death, that punishment was to be inﬂicted even in the
worst cases of theft, cheating, or mischief.
</p>
<p id="p_2558">Regarding the power of commutation it was observed
that it was evidently ﬁt that the Government should be
empowered to commute the sentence of death (without
consent of the offender) for any other punishment.
</p>
<p id="p_2559">Of some interest are the observations regarding com-
pensation for crime". The framers recognised that this
was a matter of the law of procedure, and of civil rights.
But they were decidedly of the opinion that "every person
who was injured by an offence ought to be legally entitled
to a compensation for the injury" and recommended that
in every case in which ﬁne was part of the punishment of
and offence, it ought to be competent to the tribunal which
has tried the offender (acting under proper checks) to
award the whole or part of the ﬁne to the sufferer, provid-
ed that the sufferer signiﬁes his willingness to receive
what is so awarded in full satisfaction on his civil claim
for reparation. They thought it likely that" this plan
would be in great majority of cases render a civil proceed-
ing unnecessary.
</p>
<p id="p_2560">We may now refer to their discussion relating to speci-
ﬁc crimes.

</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_268">237</span>
<p id="p_2565">Homicide.--The question of illegal omissions was elabo-
rately considered'. The 'expression "causing death" in the
deﬁnition of voluntary culpable homicide was explained,
and the View was expressed that acts or illegal omissions
which did not ordinarily cause death, or caused death very
remotely, need not be excepted. There was undoubtedly
a great difference between acts causing death immediately
and those causing a death remotely, or between acts certain
to cause death and those which cause death only under
very extraordinary circumstances. But the difference
was one to be considered by the tribunal when estimating
the effect of the evidence in a particular case, not by the
legislature in framing the general law. It would require
strong evidence, they said to prove that an act of a kind
which very seldom causes death, or an act which caused
death very remotely, has actually caused death in a parti-
cular case. It will require still stronger evidence to prove
that such an act was contemplated as likely to cause death.
But if satisfactory evidence proved that death was so
caused voluntarily, it need not in their opinion, be cxclud-
ed from the punishment for voluntary culpable homicide."
</p>
<p id="p_2566">The case of homicide by words was considered. A
verbally directs Z to swallow a poisonous drug. Z swal-
lows it and dies. This should be homicide in A and for
the purpose, speaking should be considered as an act3.
</p>
<p id="p_2567">Regarding the case of a person who died of a slight
wound which, from neglect or from the application of im-
proper remedies, has proved mortal, the framers saw no
reason in excluding it from the general rule. They noted,
that in India, fear, neglect and bad treatment were far
more common than good medical treatment'.
</p>
<p id="p_2568">The scheme of the proposed section relating to homi-
cide was that voluntary, culpable homicide was murder
unless it fell within three mitigated forms, namely, (1)
grave and sudden provocation (in which case it was "man-
slaughter"), or (ii) committed by consent or (iii) commit-
ted in defence?
</p>
<p id="p_2569">Regarding, provocation, the framers agreed that homi-
cide in such cases ought to be punished, in order to teach
men to entertain respect for human life and give them a
motive for governing their passions; but homicide commit-
ted in violent passion on provocation should not be visited
with the highest penalties of the law. To treat such a
person in the same way as the law treated a murderer

<p id="p_2575">would be highly inexpedient, would shock the universal
feeling of mankind and would engage the public sympathy
on the side of the oﬂender against the law'.
</p>
<p id="p_2576">Provocation by words was also considered, and the rule
of the English law not recognising the effect of anger
excited by words alone was criticised? If a man felt an
insult more than a wound, it did not show that he was a
man of peculiarly bad heart.
</p>
<p id="p_2577">Homicide by consent was treated as a mitigated form.
Such an act should be punishable, of course, because a
wise law--giver would desire to prevent such death, if it
were only for the purpose of making human life more
sacred to the multitude. Consent ought not therefore be
a justification for the intentional causing of death'? But
they felt that it should not be punished as severely as
murder, for these reasons:--
</p>
<p id="p_2578">(i) The motives which prompt man to the coin-
mission of the offence were generally far more respect-
able than those which prompted men to commit
murder;
</p>
<p id="p_2579">(ii) Such crime was by no means productive of so
much evil to the community as murder. It did not
produce general insecurity or spread terror through
society. When the law punished murder with seve-
rity, it had two ends. One end was that people may
not be murdered, and another that people may not
live in constant dread of being murdered; and the
second was perhaps more important that the ﬁrst.
This "property" of the offence of murder was not
found in homicide by consent'.
</p>
<p id="p_2580">It was also noted, that the burning of a Hindu widow
by consent was not (even under the law then in force)
punished as murder, though it was an oﬂence under the
Regulations in force in the Presidencies.
</p>
<p id="p_2581">Regarding homicide in self defence, the framers admit-
ted that they were "forced to leave the law on the subject
of private defence in an unsatisfactory state". They ex-
pressed the fear, that it must always continue to be one of
the least precise parts of every system of jurisprudence.
The portion of the law relating to homicide in defence
must necessarily partake of the imperfections (of law of
self-defence). The reason for treating this kind of homi-
cide as less than murder Was, that law itself invited men
to the very verge of the crime designated as voluntary
culpable homicide. The law authorised acts which were

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_270">239</span>
<p id="p_2584">very near to homicide, and this circumstance greatly miti-
gated the guilt'.
</p>
<p id="p_2585">The tojoic of causing death try say. rashness or negli-
gence as to indicate want of due regard for human life
does not seem to have been separately dealt with in the
notes, though clause 304 made it punishable with impri--

</p>
<p id="p_2589">Treason was discussed in detail. It was noted, that
there was some doubt as to whether the statute law of
England (regarding Treason) was binding on natives.
Apart from the Bombay Regulation 14 of 1827 (wherein
there was a sweeping clause empowering the courts to
award punishment in any case in which they conceived
that morality and social order required protection), treason
was not an offence under any other Regulation. "The
Mahomedan law might possibly be so Violently strained
as to reach it in Bengal and in the Madras Presidency."
But those provisions could not be retained. That is hy
a speciﬁc section was proposed on the subject. Regard-
ing the Royal person, it was felt that it was impro':oable
that any English King would visit the Indian dorninions,
and therefore specific provision was not necessary. But
levying of war against the British Crown should. it 
observed" be made punishable. The framers of the l83T

Code also explained1 why the anomalous position regard-
ing treason prevailed. The British Rulers in India, in the
beginning, disguised their real power "under the forms of
vassaiage", and left "the Mogul and his Viceroys the empty
honours or' a Sovereignty which was really held by the
Company". This policy was abandoned only slowly and by
degrees. Hence it was impossible to point out the parti-
cular time when the "natives" became British subjects.
</p>
<p id="p_2595">Reasons for making abetment of hostilities against the
Government in certain cases a separate offence (-instead
of leaving it to general abetment) were also explained?
</p>
<p id="p_2596">Firstly, the general rules of abetment would not reach
a person who, while residing in the British territories abet-
ted the waging of war by a foreign prince against the
British Government. (The foreign prince himself would
not be guilty of an offence by waging such war). Second-
ly, though in general, a person who is a party to the Cri-
minal design which has not been carried into effect ought
not to be punished as if the design had been carried into
effect. yet an exception should be made with respect of
High offences against the State. Crimes against the State
had this peculiarity that if they were successfully com-
mitted, the criminal was "almost always secure from
punishment." After murder, the murderer is in greater
danger than before murder. "But the rebel is out of danger
as soon as he has subverted the Government." Hence the
Penal law "should be made strong and sharp against the
first beginning of rebellion, against treasonable designs,
which have to be carried no further than plots and pre-
parations." For this reason, such plots and preparations
should not be left to the ordinary law of abetment.
</p>
<p id="p_2597">Mutiny----Detailed reasons for punishing abetment of
mutiny were given? A person who, not being himself
subject to Military law, extorts or assists those who being
subject to Military law, commit breach of discipline would
"be a proper subject of punishment". But the general law
respecting the abetting of offences will not reach him, be-
cause the Military delinquency which he has abetted would
not be punishable by this Code, and therefore would not
constitute an "offence". Explaining their approach regard-
ing punishment for such abetment, the framers of the 1837
Report stated that while the general rule which they had
adopted was that the punishment of the abetter should be
equal or proportional to the punishment of the person
committing the offence, yet in this case they had depart-
ed, for these reasons :--
</p>
<p id="p_2598">"But the Military penal law is, and must necessarily
be, far more severe than that under which the body of the
</p><p id="p_2599">1. 1837<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_792"> Draft of the Indian Penal Code</a>, Note

</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_272">241</span>
<p id="p_2602">people live. The severity of the Military law can be Justi-
tied only by reasons drawn from the peculiar habits and
duties of soldiers, and from the peculiar relation in which
they stand to the Government. The extension of such
severity to persons not members of the lvlilitary profes-
sion appears to us altogether unwarrantable." They also
added that if a person "not in Military" who abetted a
breach of Military discipline was made liable to a punish-
ment regulated "according to our general rule by the
punishment to which such a breach of discipline renders
a soldier liable, the whole symmetry of the penal law would
be destroyed." A person who induces a soldier to disobey
any order of a commanding officer would be liable to be
punished more severely than a dacoit, ravisher, etc.

_ Perjutry--The framers of the 1837 Draft expressed this
view :#

"If such false evidence actually causes death. the
person who has given or fabricated it falls under the
definition of murder, and is liable to capital punish-
ment. In this last point, the law, as we have framed
it. agrees with the old law of England, which. though
in our opinion, just and reasonable, has become obso~
lete"'.
</p>
<p id="p_2603">Dacot'ty----The following observations are interesting2:----
</p>
<p id="p_2604">"His Lordship in Council will perceive that we

the purpose of denoting, not only actual gang robbery,
out the attempting to rob when such an attempt is
made or aided by a gang."

they submitted their Second and concluding Reportz
(Second Report on<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_795"> the Indian Penal Code</a>) on 24th June,
1847. After this, Sir Lawrence Peel, Chief Justice of the

General), having received from the_ Government the
Report of the Law Commissioners, studied it and gave his
observations to the Government in 1848".
</p>
<p id="p_2612">It is not necessary to state each point dealt with_by
the Law Commissioners in 1846; but a few points which
are still of interest may be noted:----
</p>
<p id="p_2613">(a) Homicide--Death caused by words was speci-
fically dealt with in the discussion in the 1837 draft,
and the 1846 Commissioners also dealt with it in detail
and came to the conclusion" that if death is certainly
caused by words deliberately used by a person with
intention to cause that result, or with the knowledge
that in the condition of the party to whom the words
are spoken it is likely that the words will make such
an impression on him as to cause death, and without
any such excuse as it admissible under "General Excep-
tions", such person should suffer the penalty of culp-
able h0micide:----
</p>
<p id="p_2614">Here is the wilful doing of that which is known
to be likely to produce evil, manifesting the mens Tea.
essential to criminal responsibility, the evil produced
is death, the eﬁicient cause,--the words spoken. It is
scarcely agreeable to reason, that having traced the
effect to its cause, the law should refuse to acknow-
ledge it as an eifective cause; or that the Judge should
be obliged to say, it is true that the effect was produc-
ed by the operation of the Words, but Words in law
are not an act, therefore the speaker is not criminally
responsible.
</p>
<p id="p_2615">Death resulting from a slight wound which from
neglect or from the application of improper remedies
has proved fatal was considered in detai15.
</p>
<p id="p_2616">Provocation by words was speciﬁcally considered,
and the proposal in the original Code to cover such
provocation z'.e. not to recognise any distinction bet-
ween provocation by mere words or gestures and
other provocation, was approved".

<p id="p_2623">Other points relating to provocation were consi-
dered'.
</p>
<p id="p_2624">The topic of voluntary culpable homicide by con-
sent was considered and the proposed provision that
such homicide should not amount to murder was
approved, with a slight modification, namely, the con-
sent should have been given not only by a person
above 12 years of age but by a person capable of mak-
ing an intelligent choice?
</p>
<p id="p_2625">Voluntary culpable homicide in defence---the provi-
sion reducing it to manslaughter--was approved in
principle".
</p>
<p id="p_2626">Regarding punishment for murder, a comment on
the 1837 draft had been received from Mr. Hudleston,
:1 Judge of the Sudder Court of Madras," stated5--"I
prefer the provisions of our Regulations, which deﬁne
the grounds for mitigating the capital punishment."
On this comment, the 1846 Report noted'', that Mr. Hud.
leston had not speciﬁed the provisions which he had
in mind. "In the general law relating to murder in
the Madras Regulations, which Mr. Hudleston must
be understood to refer to, there is no such deﬁnition.
But a discretion is given to the Judges not to pass sen-
tence of death, if there appear to them to be "alleviat-
ing circumstances" in the case--a discretion suﬁ'icient-
ly arbitrary."
</p>
<p id="p_2627">The topic of rash or negligent homicide--clause
304 of the 1837 draft----was approved after discussion.7

The case of a man attempting to commit a rape on
a woman and in the attempt involuntarily causing her
death--clause 305, illustration in the 1837 draft--wa.s
considered, and the proposal in the draft approved''.
[The illustration was to the effect that in such a case,
the homicide was culpable but not voluntary, because
death was an effect wholly unexpected and unconnect-
ed with the intention and act of the party, except by
accident. Mr. Pyrne (Judge Sudder Court Bombay)
had stated that it was possible that rape of delicate
woman may cause death for example, rape was com-
mitted on an infant of 6 or 7 years of age; death
ensues therefrom}. (He had stated that a recent case

pointed out that it was voluntary culpable homicide
death being likely.
</p>
<p id="p_2637">(b) Abetment of suicide------Clause 306 of the 1837
Report had proposed the punishment of death (apart
from other alternative punishment) for abetment of
suicide of a child under 12 years, any insane person
etc. A comment from Mr. J. F. Thomas had been re»
ceived to the effect that the inducement to commit
such crimes must in the ordinary course of events be
so exceedingly slight that it scarcely seemed necessary
to place the offence on a level with the most atrocious
murder, and annex the penalty of death. In his opi-
nion, a lesser penalty would suﬂice to check the com-
mission of the crime. Mr. Thomas particularly refer-
red to the deﬁnition that "acts" included an illegal
omissions and pointed out that instances of suicides
which could be prevented by persons were numerous
and "at present they have not the most remote idea
that they are acting criminally" and that they should
not be held liable to the heavy penalties. As to this,
the 1846 Report1 observed that clause 306 was based
on the same principles as clause 298, second proviso
of the 1837 draft (homicide with consent of such per-
sons to be murdered), in as much as the offence of
causing death of persons concerned (z'.e. persons under
age or under disability) was regarded as murder even
though death was caused with their consent and,
therefore. clause 306----abetment of suicide--attached
the penalty of murder to the offence described there-
in, when committed in respect of a person under age
or disability. The clause was approved subject to
modiﬁcations regarding age of 12 years being replaced
by an age where a person could form an intelligent
judgment. It was also observed (regarding illegal
omissions) that the rule would fail to be applied
under these clauses chieﬂy in cases Where a person
bound to take care of the person of another had, by
an illegal omission of his duty, intentionally given
him the opportunity of killing himself or permitted
him to obtain the means of killing himself, or (second-
ly) also in the case where one person, seeing another
person preparing to destroy himself, (say by hanging)
allowed him to accomplish his purpose without any
attempt to prevent him, if, (as may be expected), the
law of procedure makes it a common duty incumbent
upon all men to assist in preventing offences about to
be committed in their presence. The intention here
in the second case would be inferable from the cir-
cumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_2638">_ (c) Attempt to commit murder--Atternpt to com-
mit voluntary culpable homicide was. under clause 309

</p><p id="p_2639">1. 1846 Report, pages IOI-I02, paragraphs 321----324.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_276">245</span>
<p id="p_2640">of the 1837 draft, punishable with imprisonment up to
3 years. The framers of the 1846 Report considered,
that this caluse was meant to apply . to attempts to
cause death under circumstances which, if death en-
sued, would make the offence to be voluntary culpable
homicide of one of the mitigated descriptions; 'because
attempt to commit murder was expressly provided for
by another clause 303. They therefore recommended
the necessary clariﬁcation? As regards attempt to
commit murder, clauses 308 and 320 had this effect,
that where hurt was caused, the offence would be
punishable with transportation for life or rigorous im-
prisonment for life but not less than 7 years and also
fine. No change was recommended on that clause?
</p>
<p id="p_2641">((1) Perjury--In the 1837 draft, clause 294, dealing
with voluntary culpable homicide read with illustra-
tion (d) thereto had this effect, that if A falsely depos-
ed before a Court of Justice that he saw another person
commit a capital crime and the other person was con-
victed and executed in consequence, A was guilty of
the offence of voluntary culpable homicide, (If A had
the intention to cause death or knowledge of likeli-
hood of his causing death, etc.). This proposal was
discussed in the 1846 Report. It stated'' that "the
offence in question falls naturally within the definition
of voluntary culpable homicide, which could not be
expressed properly in terms that did not cover it"
But, it went on to say,--"and but that we think it
desirable to restrict rather than to extend capital
punishment, and that it would be in effect an exten-
sion of it to make the perjurer liable to the convicted
of homicide, which would be murder under Clause 295,
when his false swearing has caused the condemnation
and execution of an innocent person, we would not
hesitate to recommend that this part<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_799"> of the Code</a> be
left untouched. For the reason last stated, however,
we would advise that the illustration (d) be omitted
under clause 294, and that Clause 191 in the Chapter
of offences against public justice be declared applica-
ble generally to the offence of giving false evidence. . . .
with the intention of causing a person to be convicted
of a capital crime, whether the object intended be
effected or not. The punishment which may be
awarded under this Clause is transportation for life,

or rigorous imprisonment for life or for a term not less
than seven years, and ﬁne.".
</p>
<p id="p_2642">(e) Dacoity with murder--By Clause 380 of the
1837 Draft, where a murder was committed by any
one of a gang of the dacoits, every one of the gang was

</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_277">246</span>
<p id="p_2644">ith death. The 1846 Report
noted, that by the Regulations in force in Bengal and
Madras, a single person going forth with an offensive
weapon with intent to rob and perpetrating etc. a
robbery, was also guilty of dacoity, and that by those
Regulations "leaders of gangs or other heinous offend-
ers convicted of a repetition of the crime or Without
such repetition of a degree of cruelty, violence, or other
aggravating criminality, which under the discretion
allowed by the Mahammadan Law were punishable
with death . . . . .." were liable to the sentence of death
if the case appeared to the Nizamut Adawlut to rend-
er such heinous offenders liable to such punishment.
It also noted, that by the Bombay Regulation 14 of
1827, <a href="/doc/1525862/" id="a_800">section 37</a>, gang robbery accompanied with force
was punishable in any of the modes speciﬁed in sec-
tion 3 (which included death). The 1846 Report how-
ever did not consider it advisable to extend the
punishment of death to any case other than that al-
ready given in clause 380 of the 1837 Draftl.
</p>
<p id="p_2645">liable to be punished w

It also noted the suggestion? that heads of gangs of
dacoits should be sentenced to death, because in such
cases death was desirable "as an example" to the country.
This was a suggestion by Mr. Giberne3, a Judge of the
Sudder Court at Bombay. The Report did not consider it
advisable to extend the punishment of death to any case
besides that dealt with in clause 380. But it did express
agreement with the suggestion of Mr. J. F, Thomas that
there ought to be a great distinction in adjudging punish-
ment between persons proved to be leaders, or regular or
habitual members of a gang following robbery as a pro-
fession on the one hand, and poor coolies enticed to swell
the number on the other hand. (Mr. Thomas had suggest-
ed' transportation etc. In the case of every leader, regular
member of the gang, every person armed with weapon
capable of inﬂicting death, etc.).

detail with the later discussions relating to the draft<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_801"> Indian
