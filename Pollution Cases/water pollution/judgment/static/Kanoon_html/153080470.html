Judgment on: 24.12.08




      PINAKI CHANDRA GHOSE, J. :                 This writ petition has been filed by

the People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC), is a voluntary non-

profit, non-political citizen action group founded in 1990.



</p><p id="p_7">      It is stated in the petition that the mission of PUBLIC is to improve the

environment of Calcutta and promote sustainable urban living by working with

Government Agencies, corporate citizens, other NGOs and stakeholders in a

consultative and implementational capacity. The focus areas of PUBLIC are airs,

noise pollution, land use planning including protection of open spaces and

conservation of heritage buildings.
</p><p id="p_8">        At the instance of the writ petitioners, the legal protection of the East

Kolkata Wetlands (hereinafter referred to as EKW) were protected through Public

Interest Litigation filed by petitioner No. 1. The said EKW has now been declared

as the international protected site by the Indian Government under the RAMSAR

Convention.    The petitioner has filed this application to ensure protection of

EKW.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">       It is submitted that respondent No. 8, Union of India is financing a project

for Construction of a Water Treatment Plant within the said area through the

Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (hereinafter referred to as

JNNURM) of the Ministry of Urban Development. It is also stated that the EKW

was originally protected by the order passed by this Court by an Order dated 24th

September, 1992 which is reported in 1993 (97) CWN 142, where the Court held

that an obligation has cast on the Government of West Bengal not to change the

nature and the character of the land of the said area demarcated by the Court in

the said judgment. Subsequently, the West Bengal Government came out with

an Ordinance No. VII to protect the EKW and finally with the East Kolkata

Wetlands (Conservation and <a href="/doc/1166740/" id="a_1">Management) Act</a>, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as

the said Act) was promulgated in place of the above mentioned Ordinance and

the said Act came into operation to provide for conservation and management of

the East Kolkata Wetlands and for matters connected therewith and incidental

thereto.
</p><p id="p_11">       According to the petitioners, a project for construction of a Water

Treatment Plant is being undertaken by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation

(hereinafter referred to as KMC) over an area of nearly 100 acres in the Mouza

Bonchtala, Dag No. 615-630, 633 (part), 634-636, 647 (part), 638-641, 642

(part), 643, 645, 648 (part), 649 (part), 650, 652 (part), 653 (part), 654 (part),

656, 658 (part), 673, 739, 745-757, 758 (part), 759-767, 763 (part), 768 and 770

(part) within the fringes of the boundary area of the EKW.



</p><p id="p_12">      The petitioner also learnt that a huge Water Treatment Plant for producing

30 MGD of treated water within the said area of EKW has been undertaken by

the KMC.    The petitioner had been co-opted as the member of a standing

committee under the said Act and petitioner No. 2 was nominated to represent

petitioner No. 1 in the said Standing Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      It is submitted that the construction of the said Water Treatment Plant

would result in release of large amount of effluence, at the time of construction,

in to a very large water body creating great amount of pollution and as such the

said Construction is not possible without the permission of the West Bengal

Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">      It is further submitted that without following the provisions of <a href="/doc/1034044/" id="a_2">Section 9</a> of

the said Act and in violation of <a href="/doc/513008/" id="a_3">Section 10</a> of the said Act, the Authorities are
 proceeding in the matter.     It is submitted that the Wetlands Management

Authority under the said Act was empowered to grant sanction for change of

character or mode of use of land.         Such change can be only made for

improvement and upkeepment of the local environment and its surroundings.



</p><p id="p_17">      It is pointed out that the entire action of granting of sanction by the

Management authority in respect of the said Water Treatment Plant is nothing

but a colourable exercise of power and to render the provisions of the said Act

nugatory.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">      It is further pointed out that such sanction has been granted by the

Authority in violation of <a href="/doc/641894/" id="a_4">Section 18</a> of the said Act. The said Water Treatment

Plant would also necessitate pipelines from the Water Treatment Plants to the

different points along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass from Garia to Ultadanga

to cater the treated water from the said Water Treatment Plant to the said areas.



</p><p id="p_20">      It is further pointed out that the said Water Treatment Plant would also

require roads for ingress and egress from the said site as well as for additional

covered area to house, a filter house, a chemical house, a control room, a godown

and open construction for clarifloculator and a covered reservoir. The petitioner

also states that the said Water Treatment Plant would also require a pump house

to pump the treated water and staff housing for maintenance and operation of
 the said Water Treatment Plant.    In these circumstances, it is submitted that

such action would destroy the fragile eco-system at the said wetlands area.



</p><p id="p_21">      Further point of submission is that effluence in the shape of sludge

containing alum would be produced from the said Water Treatment Plant as a

result of treatment of water for which provisions for disposal has to be made.

The petitioner apprehends that the said sludge may be dumped either in the

EKW or in a nearby water body or river channel further destroying the said

fragile ecosystem.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">      It is further submitted that the Water Treatment Plant would destroy the

EKW besides being in violation of the international obligations undertaken by the

Government of India under the RAMSAR convention and rules framed

thereunder, the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 24th September, 1992 and

the said Act of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">      It is further submitted that the attempt of the Government is to circumvent

the spirit of the Act by using public necessity as a guise to achieve the said

purpose.   In these circumstances, it is submitted that the respondents are in

violation of the international obligations undertaken by the Government of India.

It is further submitted that the said actions are in violation of the Inland

Fisheries Act and therefore, the same has to be stopped.
</p><p id="p_26">       Mr. Soumendra Narayan Mukherjee, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on

behalf of the petitioner submitted that the KMC did not obtain permission for the

construction of the Water Treatment Plant from the Pollution Control Board.



</p><p id="p_27">      He drew our attention to <a href="/doc/381888/" id="a_5">Section 3</a> of the said Act and submitted that the

authority has been constituted under the said Act of 1996. The functions and

the powers of the said authority have also been stated specifically under <a href="/doc/1086396/" id="a_6">Section

4</a> of the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">      According to him, no project can come through without the Management

Plan and according to him, no Management Plan has yet been finally prepared.

Thereafter, applications made before the said authority and the authority granted

the permission on that very day without application of mind. In this respect, he

also drew our attention to the Environmental Impact Assessment (hereinafter

referred to as EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (hereinafter referred to

as EMP) Reports submitted by the KMC respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">      Mr. Shakti Nath Mukherjee, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of

the KMC relying on the notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and

Forests, Government of India on         27th January, 1994 which was modified

subsequently on 4th May, 1994, 10th April, 1997, 27th January, 2000 and 13th

December, 2000 respectively submitted that the EIA or EMP report which was
 required in respect of the Projects has been specifically set out in Schedule I of

the Notification issued under Clause A of Rule 5(3)(a) of the Environment

Protection Rules, 1986. In the said Schedule, the Water Treatment Plant is not

included. Therefore, he submitted that for the purpose of construction of Water

Treatment Plant the EIA or EMP reports are not required to be prepared by the

KMC.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">        He submitted that the said project of (Water Treatment Plant) was duly

submitted by the KMC before the management authority for approval and the

said authority after deliberations made in the meeting, granted the approval by

an order dated 14th February, 2007 subject to compliance of the six conditions

mentioned therein.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">        He    further   submitted   that   in   compliance   of   those   conditions   a

supplementary EIA report was submitted before the said authority on July 4,

2008.        Upon receipt of the said supplementary EIA Report the management

authority on 15th July held a meeting and thereafter granted approval to the

KMC.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">        Mr. Mukherjee further contended that the said report was prepared in

consultation with the experts in the said field. He also submitted that the said

area of 20 acres has been chosen on the very fringe of the wetlands area. The

area chosen for the said Water Treatment Plant constitutes 0.00065% of the
 wetlands area and is located at the extreme end of the Western fringe of the

wetlands area and is abutting a major road, E.M.Bypass.           The said Water

Treatment Plant is located on Dag numbers which are indicated in the

supplementary EIA and EMP report and those Dag numbers are mentioned

under Table 3 of the said Act      of 2006 in Mouza Bonchtala and has been

classified as productive framing area and not as water body or water body

oriented area. According to him, the location of the Water Treatment Plant would

not be on water body or even substantially on water body oriented area. The

location will be on solid land which was previously used by KMC as a garbage

dumping site and is a part of Dhapa.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">      He further pointed out that such construction of Water Treatment Plant is

not likely to affect the final Management Plan as may be made by the authorities.

The Management authority has already issued an outline for conservation and

management of the EKW area. The said outline would show that the installation

of Water Treatment Plant on the productive farming area will not interfere with

the final Management Plan and the said project of (Water Treatment Plant) has

been undertaken and is to be funded by the Government of India in 35%,

Government of West Bengal in 35% and the rest in 30% by KMC under JNNURM.

The said Project has been sanctioned under JNNURM by the Government of

India. The sanction contains strict time limit and according to him, if the project

is not completed within the said time limit, the amount so granted has to be

refunded.
</p><p id="p_40">       Mr. Mukherjee pointed out that the extension can be obtained under the

said Scheme (JNNURM), if a major portion of the work could be undertaken. It is

also true that final Management Plan should be prepared by EKW management

authority but that would not be affected if the said Water Treatment Plant is

constructed at the said area. The said Authority has already approved the said

water treatment plant after being satisfied with the project. The installation of

water treatment plant in this fringe area of the wetlands would not interfere with

the final Management Plan at all. The said authority granted such approval after

considering the pros and cons of the project.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">      He further submitted that the measure has already been taken for disposal

of sludge emanating from the water treatment plant.         The sludge is to be

deposited in the sludge drying bed and upon being dried up the same would be

sold in the form of solid cakes which are utilised for brick manufacturing and

also for sanitary land filling.   Similar system for disposal of sludge is being

practiced at Palta and Garden Reach Water Treatment Plants. Selling of such

sludge is also a source of revenue of KMC.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">      He further pointed out that the potable water conforming Central Public

Health Environmental Engineering Organisation Standard will be produced

under this project. This aspect has been considered by JNNURM authority and

thereafter the fund has been allotted and sanctioned.
</p><p id="p_45">       He submitted that this kind of facilities is in accordance with the principle

of RAMSAR Convention and <a href="/doc/513008/" id="a_7">Section 10(5)</a> of the said Act of 2006.           The site

proposed is on terrestrial area and there is no question of any fauna and flora

within the site.   The Water Treatment Plant will provide potable water to the

various wards within the area of KMC covering Calcutta City as well as Calcutta

wetlands area.
</p>
<p id="p_46">
</p><p id="p_47">      He further submitted that this Water Treatment Plant shall improve the

local environment and would provide arsenic free water to the local inhabitants

and also to a large number of residents of this part of Kolkata. The water would

also be supplied to the arsenic prone area for the betterment of public health.

More than 10 lakhs residents of the said area will be benefited by the said Water

Treatment Plant.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">      He further pointed out that there will be no residence within the said water

treatment area and no arrangement has been made for staff quarters within the

said plant area since the work will be done only eight hours on each day.

According to him, no underground water or surface water is involved in this

plant, the water will come from the river Ganges through underground pipes

running from Bagbazar Mayer Ghat to this Project Water Treatment Plant.
</p><p id="p_50">       According to his further submission, no waste water will be disposed of or

go outside the area of Water Treatment Plant, the waste will be recycled, if there

is any residual alum in more than permissible limit that will also be detected

through scada system and will be neutralised. He further added that alum and

chlorine are normal ingredients for purifying water.



</p><p id="p_51">      His further point of submission is that the steps have been taken to

improve the living conditions of the residents, who are residing within the 14

wards of the KMC area and the KMC is bound to discharge its statutory

obligation.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">      Mr. Mukherjee further submitted that the Act of 2006 is a complete code

and 20 acres of land owned by KMC is not within the purview of Land Reforms

Act, 1955 and according to him, the said Act does not apply within the limit of

KMC. <a href="/doc/100623275/" id="a_8">Section 4(c)</a> of the said Act has no application in view of Section 1 of the

Land Reforms Act, 1955.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">      According to him, this project has been undertaken only to supply free

contaminated and arsenic free water to the inhabitants of the said area.



</p><p id="p_56">      Mr. Jayanta Mitra, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the East

Kolkata Management Authority submitted that before approval of the Project, the
 application was filed which was discussed by the said Management Authority in

the meeting and after discussion, the approval was granted. The said fact would

be evident from the minutes of the meeting held by the said Authority.



</p><p id="p_57">      According to him, the Committee was sure that no water body would be

filled up by the KMC for this Project and the matter was discussed at length in

the Meeting of the Committee and on number of occasions, the matter was

discussed in the meeting time to time held by the said Authority and thereafter,

the procedure for clearance of Project and Scheme followed all the terms which

should have been followed by the Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">      It is further submitted by him that the said Authority duly considered the

EIA and EMP reports which were submitted by the KMC and in view of the said

EIA and EMP reports comments were made with regard to the said Project by the

said authority.   Accordingly, the said proposal of KMC for construction of 30

MGD water treatment plant adjacent to Dhapa dumping ground, Mouza

Bonchtala was approved subject to the following conditions:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        1. Construction should be done in most eco friendly manner.
           Construction material should be carefully chosen so that they do
           not cause any environmental concern and blend perfectly with the
           surroundings.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        2. Before filling up any water body an equivalent water body may be
           created.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        3. Construction of shed should be kept minimum and that too should
           be restricted for the operational purpose only.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          4. Chemicals and other inventory are to be stored outside EKW area.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">         5. The front side of E. M. Bypass and the Basanti Road is to be
            covered with greeneries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">         6. The project may be executed under strict monitoring of EKWMA, at
            the designing and implementation stages."</blockquote><p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">      The said Authority by their letter dated 14th February, 2007, duly informed

the KMC about the said conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">      He further submitted that all steps have been taken by the authority and

the authority after considering the facts and circumstances of this case came to

such conclusion. He also pointed out that the said supplementary EIA and EMP

reports submitted by the KMC would show that the same has been prepared as

per requirement of law and the same has been taken care of all probable

situation and thereby in granting such approval, the authority proceeded with

their satisfaction.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">      Mr. Mitra further pointed out that the authority was constituted after

taking into account the authority of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and

the Chairman of the said Board is a member of the EKW Management Authority.

Therefore, he submitted that the Pollution Control Board duly represented in the

said authority. Therefore, whether consent is required by the Pollution Control

Board is immaterial since the permission was granted by the authority.
</p><p id="p_66">       During the pendency of this application the KMC handed over the

Environment Impact Assessment Report and subsequent thereto a further

supplementary Environment Impact Assessment Report was filed before the

Court. Subsequent thereto, the petitioners filed an application in the said writ

petition on 21st August, 2008 and submitted that the said Reports were prepared

by the KMC without consulting and/or obtaining permission from the West

Bengal Pollution Control Board.     It is further submitted that the said Report

cannot be called as an Environment Impact Assessment or the Management

Plan. The said Report so filed as EIA or EMP Report before the Court suffers from

lacuna.      It is also pointed out before us that the East Kolkata Wetlands

Management Authority (hereinafter referred to as the said EKWMA) under

<a href="/doc/145601893/" id="a_9">Section 4(f)</a> of the said Act of 2006 is to prepare action Plans conforming to the

resolutions and recommendations made from time to time under the RAMSAR

Convention and to update the land use of the said EKW.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">      According to the petitioner, no Management Plan has yet been prepared or

finalised.    Accordingly, it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that no

development should be permitted within the said area.



</p><p id="p_69">      It is further submitted that the development work is not permissible at all

within the said area. The Management Plan is still in the draft stage. The draft

stage is not in accordance with the RAMSAR principles. The petitioner further
 approached three different persons, according to the petitioners, they are well-

versed in environmental matters.        According to their opinion, the proposed

Project is erroneously and unjustifiedly selected the said site.



</p><p id="p_70">      It is further submitted that the said two Reports do not comply with the

Guidelines of the Government of West Bengal for Environment Impact

Assessment and the Project should be kept in abeyance until the Management

Plan is finalised.
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">      Further point of submission is that the Court should appoint an

independent Organisation or a Government recognised Local Organisation for the

purpose of examining the proposed plan for the said Water Treatment Plant, the

Environment Impact Assessment and the Environment Management Plan

submitted by the respondents for ascertaining whether this provides for sufficient

safeguards are otherwise accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">      On the contrary, it is submitted that all the required norms have been

followed in respect of the water treatment plan proposed to be constructed at

Mouza Bonchtala and all the requirements under the Rules were considered at

the primary stage, and the supplementary EIA or EMP Report was only advised at

the actual execution stage of the Project. The Management Authority requested

the KMC to provide the said EIA or EMP Reports for the purpose of effecting the
 Water Treatment Plant at the said area so that the additional precaution, if any,

is required by the Management Authority, could be done.



</p><p id="p_75">      The said EIA or EMP Reports submitted by the KMC would show that the

same has been prepared as per requirement of law and the same has been taken

care of all probable situation including adverse impact and beneficial situation

such as air, water, soil, noise, social conditions etc.



      It is further submitted that the said Authority gave approval to the KMC to

proceed with the said Project after satisfying themselves that the said Project

would not adversely affect wetlands' environment. The said EIA report is not a

statutory requirement for Water Treatment Plant under the Order or Notification

issued from time to time by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,

Government of India. Therefore, there is no reason to direct that the said Plan

should have been prepared in consultation with or with the permission of West

Bengal Pollution Board or any other independent Body.



</p><p id="p_76">      It is further pointed out that there is no question of change in land use if

the said Water Treatment Plant is constructed at the said area.       There is no

chance of changing the eco-system or there will be any violation of the Court's

order if the said proposed Project is constructed at the said area.
</p><p id="p_77">       Hence, it is submitted that the proposed site was chosen by the KMC to

have minimal impact on the wetlands environment and at the same time cater to

the needs of the local populace who face adverse impact of arsenic poisoning on

their health.   The said site is located on the fringes of the wetlands and not

located on any water body but on solid land previously used for the disposal of

garbage by the KMC.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">      In regard to the Management Plan for the EKW, the Court held that the

Director of the W.I.S.A. submitted his draft report of the Management Plan for the

said EKW at the meeting of EKWMA held on 15.7.08 when all the members of the

EKWMA were present including Petitioner No. 2.     The EKW system and the key

issues relating to the area and the resource pool available in the area were duly

described before the management authority. The background hydrology of the

EKW system being the allied system of Adigana, Bidyadhari, Noal, Seenti etc. was

described, and the necessity for connecting these with the present EKW system

to get regular freshwater discharge into the said EKW, was stressed.



</p><p id="p_80">      It is further pointed out that after considering the importance of the said

Plant, members decided to give their feed back in writing to the EKWMA. The

EKWMA will summarize these inputs and will convey the same to WISEA for

integration in the final version of the Management Plan.
</p><p id="p_81">          It is further pointed out that the area of EKW are not uniform in nature of

the land use and there are a number of categories of land, and not every area of

the EKW contain the kind of bio-diversity as portrayed in the opinions presented

by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">         The said EIA or EMP Reports have been approved by the said Management

Authority and no cogent reason has been shown by the petitioners to reconsider

the same.      Hence, it is submitted that the Court shall permit the KMC to go

ahead with the said Project.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">         The further point of submission is that the impact of two hazardous

chemicals - chlorine and alum have been duly considered with regard to the said

Project. All steps have been taken as it would be evident from the said Plan for

disposal of the products which would come out of the said Water Treatment

process.     It is submitted that there will be a significant benefit to the local

environment and also to the local population through this Water Treatment

Plant.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">         However, it appears that the Report has been filed by the Pollution Control

Board where it has been submitted that no application has yet been filed by the

KMC for granting consent to establish the said Water Treatment Plant, but the

Learned Senior Counsel for the KMC pointed out that the Chairman and
 Member-Secretary of the Board are acting as the members of the Management

Authority and they duly signed the permission granted by the said management

authority. Therefore, that cannot be a ground to reject the project.



</p><p id="p_88">      Further, it has been stated on behalf of the KMC that the part of Kolkata

City and its surroundings, wetland area are now subjected to threat of serious

contamination of arsenic in the ground water. It is imperative that the ground

water dependence is replaced and substituted by treated surface water supply for

which the 30 MGD water treatment project of Dhapa came into consideration.



</p><p id="p_89">      It appears that the Project requires 20 acres of land of regular shape and

size. Mouza Bonchtala is the only place where the KMC could locate 20 acres of

structure free land of its own with regular shape and size. In no other place,

KMC does have encumbrances free, bulk 20 acres of land in this way. Therefore,

the said fact also to be considered when the said land is easily available to KMC

without any hassle and for the development purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_90">
</p><p id="p_91">      The essence of the Project is that surface water will come from the river

Hooghly by sub surface pipelines to the proposed project site at Bonchtala where

the untreated raw surface water will be treated for distribution in the EKW area

and other areas within the KMC area. It is submitted that after considering all

the aspects of the matter, the Project was approved by the EKWMA.
</p><p id="p_92">       It is also pointed out that a resolution was taken in the Meeting of the

EKWMA and it would be evident that excepting petitioner No. 2 everybody agreed

and duly accepted the decision taken in the said Meeting. The conditions and

instructions as recorded in the said resolution has also been accepted by the

KMC in order to go ahead to implement the Project without any further delay.

The said Authority has already approved the Project to be implemented, since,

there is no infirmity and illegality in the decision making process, the

implementation of the Project should not be stopped on a flimsy ground.



</p><p id="p_93">      In these circumstances, it is submitted that the whole object and purpose

of the petitioners are to cause delay to the said Project of public interest on

trifling causes and reasons. Furthermore, the said Project is dependent on the

finance which has been sanctioned under the JNNURM. The total Project cost

has already been approved by the JNNURM under the Ministry of Urban

Development, Government of India. Therefore, at this stage, for the interest of

public of the said area at the behest of the petitioner, carrying on of the Project

should not be stopped.

</p><p id="p_116">      After perusing the said Act and the said Sections, it appears that the said

Authority has a right to grant permission for change of character or mode of use

of land in question and such permission to be granted after examining the case

and after receiving the order from the Collector and the Authority has a right for

granting sanction for change of character or mode of use of the land in question

in accordance with the procedure for granting of such sanction.



</p><p id="p_117">      It appears to us that the said water treatment plant as proposed to be

constructed at the said extreme end of the western fringe of the wetlands area

and is abutting a major road, Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.



</p><p id="p_118">      It further appears to us that as it has been submitted by Mr. Shaktinath

Mukherjee, the Learned Senior Advocate who drew our attention to Table three of

the said Mouza Bonchtala and submitted that the Water Treatment Plant would

not be on water body or even on water body oriented area, the location will be on

the solid land which was previously used by the KMC as a garbage dumping site.
</p><p id="p_119">       It further appears that the installation of Water Treatment Plant on the

productive farming area will not interfere with the final management plan and

that the project of Water Treatment Plant has been undertaken and is to be

funded by the Government of India, Government of West Bengal and the rest by

the KMC under a project sanctioned under JNNURM by the Government of India.

It further appears that the said sanction contain strict time limit and if the

project is not completed within the time limit, the amount so granted for, to be

refunded.
</p>
<p id="p_120">
</p><p id="p_121">      It further appears to us that if the said Water Treatment Plant is allowed to

be functioned/constructed at the said area a large section of population within

the eastern part of Kolkata as well as at EKW areas would be benefitted. It is

admitted that at the said area the people are suffering by using the contaminated

water with arsenic causing health hazards to the people residing at the said area

at large. It further appears to us if this Project is allowed to be constructed this

would certainly be a help to the residents of the said area and that would help

also KMC to cater arsenic free water to the said large area. The standard of the

potable Water would conform the standard of the Central Public Health

Environment Engineering Organisation Standard.        Such supply would remove

health hazards and would enable the large population at the said area to have

the arsenic free potable water at the said area which would be also taken into

account for the purpose of sanctioning the project by JNNURM.
</p><p id="p_122">         Mr. Mukherjee also dealt with the disposal of the large emanating from the

said water treatment plant and we are satisfied with the submissions made by

him and the system for disposal of such sludge as already been practiced at Palta

and Garden Reach Water Treatment Plants respectively by the KMC. Therefore,

we do not have hesitation to accept his contention. The proposal of KMC for

construction of the said plant as it appears was approved after discussion with

certain conditions which have been imposed by the said Authority.



</p><p id="p_123">        In our opinion, the point which has been urged before us that the

permission which was granted by the said Authority to the KMC without

considering the fact that KMC did not obtain a permission from the West Bengal

Pollution Control Board has no merit since the Chairman and the Member-

Secretary of the Pollution Control Board are party to the permission granted by

the EKWMA.
</p>
<p id="p_124">
</p><p id="p_125">        The EIA Report is not a statutory requirement for water treatment plant

project under the Order and Notification issued by the Ministry of Environment

and Forest, Government of India, from time to time. Therefore, in our opinion, it

is not necessary that the plant should be prepared in consultation with or with

the permission of West Bengal Pollution Control Board or any other independent

body.
</p><p id="p_126">       Hence, in our considered opinion, the EKW Act of 2006 has been

constituted the Management Authority and the said Authority has been

constituted in accordance with the said Act. After proper deliberations the said

authority has granted the permission to the KMC that too with certain

conditions.   We have also perused the said conditions and in our considered

opinion, if the said conditions are strictly imposed, the basic features of the Act

can not be jeopardized.
</p>
<p id="p_127">
</p><p id="p_128">      Therefore, in our considered opinion, the functions and powers of the

Management Authority has been specifically stated in the said Act that when the

Water Treatment Plant is to be constructed at the said area that should be under

the control of the said Authority and in our opinion, the said Authority has

enough power to control the environment situation at the said area.

required to be implemented taking a pragmatic view and not on ipse dixit of the

Court.
</p><p id="p_130">       The Court further held in paragraph 21 of the said judgment that relying

on the decision reported in (2006) 3 SCC 434 [Bombay Dyeing &amp; Mfg. Co. Ltd. Vs.

Bombay Environmental Action Group] that referring to a large number of

decisions, it was stated that whereas need to protect the environment is a

priority. It is also necessary to promote development stating:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">             "... the harmonization of the two needs has led to the concept of
      sustainable development, so much so that it has become the most
      significant and focal point of environmental legislation and judicial
      decisions relating to the same. Sustainable development, simply put, is
      a process in which development can be sustained over generations.
      Brundtland Report defines 'sustainable development' as development
      that meets the needs of the present generations without compromising
      the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs. Making the
      concept of sustainable development operational for public policies raises
      important challenges that involve complex synergies and trade offs."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      The Court further held in paragraph 22 of the said judgment as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">             "Treating the principle of sustainable development as a
      fundamental concept of Indian Law, it was opined that the development
      of the doctrine of sustainable development indeed is a welcome feature
      but while emphasizing the need of ecological impact, a delicate balance
      between it and the necessity for development must be struck. Whereas
      it is not possible to ignore intergenerational interest, it is also not
      possible to ignore the dire need which the society urgently requires."</blockquote><p id="p_131">
</p><p id="p_132">      In the decision reported in (2000) 10 SCC 664 [<a href="/doc/1938608/" id="a_30">Narmada Bachao Andolan

vs. Union of India] the Hon</a>'ble Supreme Court in paragraphs 123 and 124

respectively of the said judgment held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">              "123 - It appears to us that the precautionary principle and the
      corresponding burden of proof on the person who wants to change the
      status quo will ordinarily apply in a case of polluting or other project or
      industry where the extent of damage likely to be inflicted is not known.
      When there is a state of uncertainty due to lack of data or material about
      the extent of damage or pollution likely to be caused then, in order to
      maintain the ecology balance, the burden of proof that the said balance
      will be maintained must necessarily be on the industry or the unit which
      is likely to cause pollution. On the other hand, where the effect on
      ecology or environment of setting up of an industry is known, what has
      to be seen is that if the environment is likely to suffer, then what
      mitigative steps can be taken to offset the same. Merely because there
      will be a change is no reason to presume that there will be an ecological
      disaster. It is when the effect of the project is known that the principle
      of sustainable development would come into play which will ensure that
      mitigative steps are and can be taken to preserve the ecological balance.
      Sustainable development means what type or extent of development can
      take place which can be sustained by nature/ecology with or without
      mitigation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">             124 - In the present case we are not concerned with the polluting
      industry which is being established. What is being constructed is a
      large dam. The dam is neither a nuclear establishment nor a polluting
      industry. The construction of a dam undoubtedly would result in the
      change of environment but it will not be correct to presume that the
      construction of a large dam like the Sardar Sarovar will result in an
      ecological disaster. India has an experience of over 40 years in the
      construction of dams. The experience does not show that construction of
      a large dam is not cost-effective or leads to ecological or environmental
      degradation. On the contrary, there has been ecological upgradation
      with the construction of large dams. What is the impact on environment
      with the construction of a dam is well known in India and, therefore, the
      decision of A.P. Pollution Control Board has not application in the present
      case."</blockquote><p id="p_133">
</p><p id="p_134">      The legal position relating to exercise of jurisdiction by the courts for

preventing   environmental    degradation    and   thereby,   seeking    to   protect

fundamental rights of the citizens, is now well settled. The primary efforts of the

court while dealing with     environmental related issues, is to ensure that the
 enforcement agencies, whether it be the State or any other authority, take

effective steps for the enforcement of the laws. The court act as the guardian of

the people's fundamental rights. (see Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_31">Enviro-legal Action vs.

Union of India</a> (1996) 3 Supreme 741).
</p>
<p id="p_135">
</p><p id="p_136">      Furthermore, the courts have repeatedly felt that the needs of environment

require to be balanced with the needs of the community at large and the needs of

a developing country. The development of industry is essential for the economy

of the country, but at the same time, the environment and the ecosystems have

to be protected. It has been held that it was necessary to strike balance between

the necessity to preserve the environment on the one hand and the pressing need

for the industrialization of a backward state. (see <a href="/doc/138487/" id="a_32">Rajiv Ranjan Singh vs. State of

Bihar</a> in AIR 1992 Pat 86).     It was neither feasible nor practicable to have a

negative approach to the development process of the country or of the society,

since in a developing economy technological advancement ought not to be decried

at all, though, however, the same does not mean without any consideration for

the environment.    There must be a proper balance between development and

environment so that both can co-exist without affecting the other. The society

must prosper but not at the cost of the environment and in the similar vein the

environment must be protected but not at the cost of the development and proper

environment and administrative actions ought to proceed in accordance

therewith. It is necessary to recognize the danger in order to strike a balance

between the quality of life to be preserved and the economic development to be
 encouraged. (see <a href="/doc/45508/" id="a_33">Cheetri Pradushan Mukti Sangarsh Samity vs. State of Uttar

Pradesh</a> in AIR 1990 SC 2060).         However, the pollution created because of

development must commensurate with the carrying capacity of our ecosystems.

(see M. C. Mehta (supra). The Courts have explained further by saying that the

needle of the balance is the right to life and personal liberty enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_34">Article

21</a> of the constitution.       The right to life comprehends, inter alia, right to

environment, right to health care and the right to adequate heath delivery

system. However, the court will attempt to balance relevant consideration. (see

<a href="/doc/497388/" id="a_35">Sachchidanad Pandey vs. State of West Bengal</a> in AIR 1987 SC 1109).



</p><p id="p_137">      It is further held that one of the principles underlying environmental law is

that of sustainable development.         Sustainable development is defined as

development    that   meets    the   need   of   the   present   generation   without

compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their needs and this

principle requires such development to take place, which is ecologically

sustainable.   The two essential features of sustainable development are the

precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle. (see <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_36">M. C. Mehta vs.

Union of India</a> (2002) 3 SCJ 11). These principles are part of environmental laws

of India.
</p>
<p id="p_138">
</p><p id="p_139">      It is further held that mere violation of the law in not observing the norms

would result in degradation of environment would not be correct. (see Deepak

Nitrite Ltd. Vs. State of Gujarat (2004) 6 SCC 402).        The basic question was
 whether any construction should be allowed to be raised in and around a lake in

a city.
</p>
<p id="p_140">
</p><p id="p_141">          It is true that in respect of the public projects and policies which are

initiated by the Government, the Court would not become an approval

Committee.       If a considered policy decision has been taken which is not in

conflict with any law or is not mala fide and further it is not in the interest of the

public at large, in those cases the function of the Court is not to sit in appeal

over such a policy decision.
</p>
<p id="p_142">
</p><p id="p_143">          In the case of Narmada Bachao Andolan (supra), it has been held by the

Court that for any project which is approved after due deliberation, the Court

must refrain from being asked to review the decision just because a petitioner

files a public interest litigation alleging that such a decision must not have been

taken because an opposite view against the undertaking of the Project, which

view may have been considered by the Government, is possible.



</p><p id="p_144">          After considering the pros and cons of the said Project and the points

urged before us, we hold that the said Project, if implemented, can save a part of

the Kolkata city and its surroundings and also the local population from the

serious threat of contamination of arsenic in the ground water, and the

dependence on the ground water would be replaced and substituted by the

treated surface water supply for which the Project has been undertaken.
</p><p id="p_145">       In these circumstances, we are not in a position to stop the construction of

the said plant for the interest of public at large of the said area and accordingly,

we direct the said Authority to proceed with the construction of 30 MGD water

treatment plant adjacent to Dhapa dumping ground in accordance with the

conditions laid down by the Management Authority in their letter dated 14th

February, 2007. But we make it clear that without obtaining permission from

the competent authority no water body should be filled up by the KMC.



</p><p id="p_146">      We further direct the Management Authority to keep a close watch on this

Project so that there cannot be any violation of any provisions of the said Act in

any manner whatsoever.       The said authority is further directed to monitor the

work of the said Project and to submit monthly reports month by month until the

completion of the Project.
</p>
<p id="p_147">
</p><p id="p_148">      Although we have directed the Management Authority to keep a close

watch over the work of the Project, we think it would be proper for us to appoint

an independent Monitoring Committee who will monitor the work of the said

Project until it becomes operative. The said Monitoring Committee also has to file

by-monthly reports from time to time before this Court.



</p><p id="p_149">      However, we like to monitor the following issues for controlling and

maintaining the ecological balance at the said area by setting up the said
 Committee who shall monitor the construction of the said Project at the said

area.
</p>
<p id="p_150">
</p><p id="p_151">        Mr. Sabyasachi Sengupta, Vice-Chancellor, West Bengal University of

Technology, Dr. N. R. Banerjee, Vice- Chancellor, Bengal Engineering &amp; Science

University and Dr. Joydeep Mukherjee, Head of the Department, Environment,

Jadavpur University are hereby appointed as the Members of the said Monitoring

Committee who will monitor the work of the said Project.          The Monitoring

Committee would monitor the Project and would see that the following conditions

are followed in carrying out the said Project;
</p>
<p id="p_152">
</p><p id="p_153">        a) the construction should be done in most eco-friendly manner and

further the materials should be used for such purpose should not cause any

environmental hazards in the said locale and

</p><p id="p_154">        b)   no general permission can be granted for filling up any waterbody;

however if it is absolutely necessary for the proper function of the Water

Treatment Plant to fill up any waterbody, the same shall not be undertaken

without express permission of the Monitoring Committee and any other

competent authority. In case such permission is granted, it shall be obligatory for

the KMC to create an equivalent water body. The front side of the E. M. By-pass

and Basanti Road should be covered with greeneries, and the Project should be

under strict monitoring of the Management Authority at each and every stages.
</p><p id="p_155">       The Monitoring Committee shall continue to monitor the said Project until

it is in operation.   The by-monthly report should be filed by this Monitoring

Committee in respect of the said Project before this Court from time to time. All

costs, charges and expenses of the said Monitoring Committee should be borne

by the KMC.
</p>
<p id="p_156">
</p><p id="p_157">      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the applications are disposed of.



     I agree.
