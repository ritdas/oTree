	The petition qua the allegation of illegal quarrying operation has worked itself out, as the time period for which the lease was granted has already expired (17.9.2013). 
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. Learned counsel for the third respondent further states that for excessive mining, some penalty has been imposed, which has been assailed before Appellate Authority.  He also submits that no mining operation is being undertaken in view of the end of the lease.  Insofar as the fourth respondent is concerned, learned counsel submits that the allegation was that the 'No Objection Certificate' had not been obtained from the Pollution Control Board, and now the same has been obtained and a copy of the same has been handed over to the learned counsel for the petitioner and has also been placed on record.  Insofar as the fifth and sixth respondents are concerned, it is stated that the lease is over, but forfeiture of security deposit has taken place due to excessive mining, which order has been assailed in appeal.  
</p>
