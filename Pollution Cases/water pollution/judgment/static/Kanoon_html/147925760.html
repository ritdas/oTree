<p id="p_1">1.            A batch of 38 writ petitions was decided by a learned
Single Judge vide order dated September 30, 2010.           The said
decision has been followed subsequently by another learned
Single Judge. Instant appeals lay a challenge to the said decisions
pronounced by the learned Single Judges of this Court; and since
the reasoned decision is the one which was pronounced on
September 30, 2010, learned counsel for the parties conceded
that it is said decision which needs to be reflected upon by us in
the appeal(s).

the Delhi Pollution           Control Committee (DPCC)   to the    writ

bank guarantees submitted by the writ petitioners, which were
under threat of being invoked. The petitions have succeeded, not
in full, but in part. Directions have been issued to DPCC to take

Complexes, and (iii) Shopping Malls.                Actions were initiated or

the year 1974 and as amended in the year 1988 and with
reference to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the
Amending Act, the learned Single Judge has opined that the
legislative amendments carried out in the original <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_29">Water Act</a> were
intended to expand the scope of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_30">Water Act</a>.           The learned
Single Judge has highlighted that the expression „establish any
industry, operation or process or any treatment and disposal
system or any extension or addition thereto, which is likely to
discharge sewage or trade effluent‟ in clause (a) of Sub-Section (1)
of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_31">Section 25</a> made it clear that the requirement to obtain previous
consent to establish any industry, operation or process was no
longer restricted to trade effluent being discharged but would also
encompass if „sewage effluent‟ was discharged and with reference
to the definition of „sewage effluent‟ as per <a href="/doc/949252/" id="a_32">Section 2(g)</a>, has held
that the same would include sewage of any kind, including
domestic sewage.          The learned Single Judge has also noted the
expanded definition of „trade effluent‟ as per <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_33">Section 2(k)</a> of the
Water Act.       Noting the definition of the words „operation‟ and
„process‟ in para 12 of the decision, and thereafter noting the
decisions that purposive construction needs to be followed where
the mischief which existed before passing the statute was
detected and was intended to be remedied, the learned Single
Judge has concluded that collective operation or process of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                           Page 21 of 38</span>
 bathing in the bathroom and such processes as take place in the
toilet and cooking and washing in the kitchen would be operations
and processes contemplated by <a href="/doc/754307/" id="a_34">Section 25(1)(a)</a> of the Water Act
for its applicability to residential complexes. This is the conclusion
arrived at in para 16, but in the immediate next para i.e. para 17,
the learned Single Judge has lodged a caveat by stating that he
was not answering the question with reference to single storeyed
constructions.
</p><p id="p_8">8.            With reference to the commercial complexes i.e.
Commercial Shopping Complexes and Shopping Malls, the learned
Single Judge has held that the definition of „trade effluent‟ as per
<a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_35">Section 2(k)</a> would encompass all kinds of non-domestic sewage
and has thus held that these buildings would be governed by
clause (a) of Sub-Section 1 of Section 25 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_36">Water Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_9">9.            As regards the very act of constructing a building, in
paras 19 and 20, the learned Single Judge has held that the very
act of constructing a commercial shopping complex, shopping mall
or a residential complex would make applicable clause (a) of Sub-
Section 1 of Section 25 and for which the reasoning of the learned
Single Judge is that construction of commercial shopping or
residential complexes is likely to have impact on water pollution
because large quantities of water are used during construction and
are also discharged.
</p><p id="p_10">10.           Since, in all the cases, DPCC rose from the slumber

                       widest possible meaning and scope. This
                       approach is consistent with the SOR of the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">           "operation: An action, deed; exertion of force or
           influence; working, activity; an act of a practical or
           technical nature, esp one forming a step in a
           process."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">19.           The same dictionary defines „process‟, as noted by the
learned Single Judge, as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">         "process : The action or fact of going on or being
         carried on; a continuous series of actions, events or
         changes; a systematic series of actions or operations
         directed at a particular end."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">20.           As     noted         herein   above,   applying    purposive
construction, the learned Single Judge has held, in para 15, that
the two words „operation‟ and „process‟ have to be given their
widest amplitude and meaning.                 The purposive construction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                                Page 27 of 38</span>
 applied by the learned Single Judge is that widest amplitude needs
to be given to <a href="/doc/754307/" id="a_81">Section 25(1)(a)</a> of the Water Act.
</p><p id="p_21">21.           The error committed by the learned Single Judge is to
mechanically note the definition of „operation‟ and „process‟, and
ignore the sweep of the span of the two words.               We do so.
Operation is defined as an activity or an act of a practical or
technical nature, with emphasis of the acts forming „a step in a
process‟. The word „process‟ is a going on action or a continuous
series of actions „directed at a particular end‟. Thus, an operation
would be a working or an activity, where the core of the act
constituting the activity is of a practical or technical nature
especially one forming a step in a process, and since process is an
going on action or a continuous series of action directed at a
particular end, the conjoint reading of an operation and a process
or even if the two have to be read disjunctively would mean that
the expression „establish or take any steps to establish any
industry, operation or process, or any treatment and disposal
system or any extension or addition thereto, which is likely to
discharge sewage or trade effluent‟ would mean to take steps to
establish any industry, establishment or undertaking where the
operation or process i.e. activity is of a practical or technical
nature, at the core of which are ongoing acts, in a series, directed
at a particular end.          Thus, the act of ablution in the toilet or
washing vegetables and dishes in the kitchen of a residential
complex, within the precincts of residential flats, by no stretch of
imagination can be called or labeled as an operation or a process.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                             Page 28 of 38</span>
 to shopping malls and commercial shopping complexes on the
applicability of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_82">Water Act</a> is accordingly upheld and the view
taken pertaining to the applicability of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_83">Water Act</a> to residential
housing complexes is incorrect.
</p><p id="p_23">23.           A building where shops would be made and in which
shops goods or services would be sold as also shopping malls
would be buildings where operation and or process is carried on
for the reason they would be places where the activity carried on
is of a practical or a technical nature and at the core of which
activity would be ongoing acts, in a series, directed at a particular
end i.e. if goods are purchased and sold, the sale and purchase of
goods; and if service is rendered, the rendition of service directed
towards a particular end.          If from these buildings sewage is
discharged, since sewage effluent as defined in <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_84">Section 2(k)</a> of the
Water Act means effluent from any sewage system, if these
buildings are intended to be established, necessary permission
would be required from the Board under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_85">Water Act</a>.

constructing a building per-se is not an industrial activity the view
taken by the learned Single Judge that constructing a building,
whether to be used for a residential purpose or to be used for a
commercial shopping complex or for shopping malls would be an
industrial activity; running contrary to the aforesaid judgments is
incorrect.

<p id="p_25"> 25.           The reasoning of the learned Single Judge to expand
the scope of <a href="/doc/754307/" id="a_88">Section 25(1)(a)</a> of the Water Act; that the object of
the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_89">Water Act</a> was to control water pollution in its widest
amplitude and hence the reasoning that while constructing
buildings, water is used and sometimes discharged thus requiring
a wider meaning to be given, ignores that the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_90">Environment
(Protection) Act</a> 1986 deals with this larger issue in the context of
„environment‟ therein being defined to include water, air and land
and the inter relationship which exists amongst them and human
beings and other living creatures, plants and micro-organisms.
The said Act and the Rules framed under the said Act are wide
enough to cover exploitation of water and the impact thereof on
environment and we see no vacuum in the fight against
environmental         degradation,   by   understanding    the   various
expressions and their meaning in <a href="/doc/754307/" id="a_91">Section 25(1)(a)</a> of the Water Act
as adopted by us.
</p><p id="p_26">26.           A word on purposive construction. It simply means that
while adopting a purposive approach, Courts should seek to give
effect to the true purpose of legislation and must keep in view all
material that bears on the background against which a legislation
was effected and where more than one construction is possible,
the one which eliminates the mischief identified should be
favoured. But, where only one construction is possible, the Court
is not to strain backwards and then bend forward followed by
leaning to the left and then to the right to appropriate a space not
intended to be appropriated by the legislation.           <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_92">The Water Act</a>
requires prior permission to establish any industry, operation or

 process which is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent. It is
not intended to apply to all and sundry establishments.              It is
restricted to only when a building, housing an industry is sought to
be established or a building in which an operation or a process is
intended to be carried on where effluent or trade effluent would be
discharged.
</p><p id="p_27">27.           To summarize the position under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_93">Water Act</a> the
position may be summarized thus: „<a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_94">Section 25(1)</a> of the Water Act
would apply where a building is proposed to be constructed to set
up an industry or carry on an operation or a process as explained
in para 21 above and this would mean that the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_95">Water Act</a> would
not apply to buildings housing residential apartments/units.                It
would apply to all other buildings where effluent or trade effluent
is discharged, be they where manufacturing activity is carried on,
sale or purchase of goods is carried on or services are provided.
</p><p id="p_28">28.           Pertaining to the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_96">Air Act</a>, there is a material difference
in the language used in <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_97">Section 21</a> of the said Act, vis-à-vis the
language used in <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_98">Section 25</a> of the Water Act. Whereas the Water
Act requires a permission to establish any industry, operation or
process, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_99">Air Act</a> restricts its span to prior permission being
necessary only where it is intended to establish or operate any
industrial plant.
</p><p id="p_29">29.           Since the learned Single Judge has referred to the
unamended provision and has ignored the amendments carried
out to the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_100">Air Act</a> in the year 1988, we note that as per the
amended <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_101">Section 21</a>, the obligation to obtain the consent of the
State Pollution Control Board is only to establish or operate any

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                            Page 31 of 38</span>
 industrial plant in an Air Pollution Control Area.              <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_102">Section 2(k)</a>
defines an „industrial plant‟ to mean any plant used for any
industrial or trade purposes and emitting any air pollutant.
</p><p id="p_30">30.           The learned Single Judge has read the unamended
<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_103">Section 21</a> of the Air Act to mean that prior consent is needed to
operate an industrial plant.         Since the decision of the learned
Single Judge has not noted the language of the amended Section
where the words „establish or‟ have been inserted prior to the
word „operate‟, we need to re-look into the issue.
</p><p id="p_31">31.           Highlighting the definition of the words „industrial plant‟
as defined in <a href="/doc/840666/" id="a_104">Section 2(k)</a> of the Air Act, the learned Single Judge
has noted that the definition expands the meaning of the words
„industrial plant‟ to include a building used for a trade purpose and
with reference to <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_105">Section 21</a> of the Air Act has held that a building
where trade is carried on the prior consent would be required to
operate the building.
</p><p id="p_32">32.           Since     the    learned   Single   Judge   has    noted     the
unamended <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_106">Section 21</a> and since the amended <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_107">Section 21</a>
requires prior consent even to establish an industrial plant in an
Air Pollution Control Area, agreeing with the reasoning of the
learned Single Judge that in view of the extended definition of the
expression „industrial plant‟, which includes a building where trade
is carried on, the inevitable conclusion has to be that prior consent
under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_108">Air Act</a> would be needed where a building is proposed to
be constructed wherefrom trade would be carried on and since
from a shopping mall and from a commercial shopping complex
trade is carried on, we hold that prior consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_109">Air Act</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 32 of 38</span>
 would be required when commercial shopping complexes and
shopping malls are established i.e. at the commencement of the
process of establishment i.e. before the building construction
activity commences.
</p><p id="p_33">33.           As noted herein above, the learned Single Judge has
held construction per-se as requiring prior permission, both under
the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_110">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_111">Air Act</a>, and thus the learned Single Judge
has held that under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_112">Air Act</a>, consent during construction phase
would have to be obtained.
</p><p id="p_34">34.           For our reasoning herein above pertaining to the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_113">Water
Act</a>, the said reasoning of the learned Single Judge pertaining to
the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_114">Air Act</a> is overruled, but would make no difference to the final
conclusion arrived at by us pertaining to the applicability of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_115">Air
Act</a> when construction activity commences in respect of shopping
malls and commercial shopping complexes for the reason, prior
consent to establish the same is required on the language of
<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_116">Section 21</a> of the Air Act in view of the expanded definition of the
expression „industrial plant‟.     But, for residential complexes, we
hold that neither to establish nor to operate, (in fact the concept of
„to operate‟ is not even applicable to a residential complex), any
permission is required under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_117">Air Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_35">35.           The learned Single Judge has held that neither the
language of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_118">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act nor the language of
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_119">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act contemplates the power on the State
Pollution Boards to levy any penalty.
</p><p id="p_36">36.           The learned Single Judge has noted the decisions
reported as 1975 (2) SCC 22 <a href="/doc/32697172/" id="a_120">Khemka &amp; Co. (Agencies) Pvt. Ltd. vs.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                          Page 33 of 38</span>
 State of Maharashtra</a>, 1994 (4) SCC 276 <a href="/doc/1917195/" id="a_121">J.K.Synthetics Ltd. &amp; Birla
Cement Works vs. Commercial Taxes Officer</a> and 1997 (6) SCC 479
<a href="/doc/1854165/" id="a_122">India Carbon Ltd. vs. State of Assam</a> to opine that power to levy
penalty has to be conferred by a substantive provision in the
enactment.
</p><p id="p_37">37.           We concur with the reasoning of the learned Single
Judge in paras 58 to 64 of the impugned decision and thus do not
elaborate any further, but would additionally highlight that the
power to issue directions under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_123">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act and
the power to issue directions under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_124">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act, on
their plain language, does not confer the power to levy any
penalty. We would further highlight that under Chapter VII of the
Water Act, and under Chapter VI of the Air Act penalties and
procedure to levy the same have been set out. A perusal of the
provisions under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_125">Water Act</a> would reveal that penalties can be
levied as per procedure prescribed and only Courts can take
cognizance of offences under the Act and levy penalties, whether
by way of imprisonment or fine. Similar is the position under the
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_126">Air Act</a>. The legislature having enacted specific provisions for levy
of penalties and procedures to be followed has specifically made
the offences cognizable by Courts and the power to levy penalties
under both Acts has been vested in the Courts. The role of the
Pollution Control Boards is to initiate proceedings before the Court
of Competent Jurisdiction and no more.
</p><p id="p_38">38.           We would be failing not to note that on the issue of a
delegatee not being empowered (by law) to further sub-delegate
the delegated power, learned counsel for DPCC conceded to said

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                         Page 34 of 38</span>
 position and thus we leave undisturbed the view taken by the
learned Single Judge on the subject.
</p><p id="p_39">39.           Since our reasoning aforesaid results in the finding, by
way of interpreting the provisions in the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_127">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_128">Air Act</a>,
as requiring prior consent to establish and operate shopping malls
and commercial shopping complexes and the provisions being not
applicable to residential complexes, we declare void actions
initiated by DPCC pertaining to residential complexes and we
further hold that said writ petitions are allowed in terms of the
prayers made.         The impugned decision(s) by the learned Single
Judge(s) qua residential complexes is set aside.       Qua shopping
malls and commercial shopping complexes, since we have held
that prior permission is required under both Acts to establish
shopping malls and commercial shopping complexes as also to
operate them and noting that even DPCC was not too sure of the
legal position and thus misinformed a few applicants that no
permission was required and qua most persons permitted them to
commence and complete construction of shopping malls and
commercial shopping complexes, the question which now needs to
be answered is: Whether, pertaining to the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_129">Water Act</a>, Sub-Section
5 of Section 25 is the answer to what needs to be done and in the
absence of a similar provision in the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_130">Air Act</a>, what action needs to
be directed to be taken.
</p><p id="p_40">40.           The language of Sub-Section 5 of Section 25 of the
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_131">Water Act</a> makes it plain clear that the only solution to a situation
of a building being constructed to establish an industry, operation
or process without obtaining prior consent of the State Pollution

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                           Page 35 of 38</span>
 Control Board is the power of the Board to serve upon the person
concerned a notice imposing such conditions as might have been
imposed on an application seeking prior consent; and we find that
the learned Single Judge has correctly so opined and has rightly
issued the direction that the only way out, pertaining to the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_132">Water
Act</a>, is to permit DPCC to inspect the shopping malls and the
shopping commercial complexes and if it is found that pertaining
to discharge of sewage from these buildings any steps are
required to prevent water pollution, DPCC would be authorized to
issue notices requiring the owner of the building to take steps in
terms     of   the    notice       issued.   Pertaining   to   the     <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_133">Air    Act</a>,
notwithstanding there being no similar provision, but the concept
of a post decisional hearing may be made applicable with the
modification that no hearing would be required inasmuch as there
is no decision, but DPCC should be empowered to inspect the
shopping malls and the shopping commercial complexes and
pertaining to air pollution, if any deficiencies are found, to notify
the same to the owner requiring corrective action to be taken.
Needless to state, if the owners of the buildings do not take
corrective action, DPCC would always have the power to file
criminal complaints before the Courts of Competent Jurisdiction,
which Courts would alone have the power to impose fine and
additionally impose sentence of imprisonment upon the offending
persons.
</p><p id="p_41">41.            On the issue of Air Pollution, we would like to pen a
post-script pertaining to shopping complexes and shopping malls
for the reason the only activity of air pollution in these buildings

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                                     Page 36 of 38</span>
 would be through the air conditioning plants and generators
installed to supply electricity to the buildings in case of power
cuts, for the reason the trade of sale and purchase of goods in
these complexes does not entail any activity which causes air
pollution. We find that pertaining to DG sets, permissions in any
case have to be obtained from DPCC if the capacity of the DG set
is beyond a prescribed wattage and thus DPCC may suitably
reconsider all shopping complexes and shopping malls where
consent of DPCC has been obtained with respect to DG sets
installed as also air-conditioning plants installed in the buildings,
for if for the DG sets and air-conditioning plants, sanctions have
already been obtained, nothing further remains to be got
sanctioned under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_134">Air Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_42">42.           In a few cases, we find that since DPCC was not
permitting the buildings to be occupied, under protest, the owners
paid the penalty to DPCC and have immediately approached the
Court seeking refund and the same has been ordered for the
reason neither under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_135">Water Act</a> nor under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_136">Air Act</a> there
exists any power in DPCC to levy penalty or impose conditions of
furnishing bank guarantee.         The decision of the learned Single
Judge is correct in directing the bank guarantees to be discharged
and penalties levied to be refunded for the reason the said act of
DPCC is ultra-vires its power under the two statutes and the levy
of penalty is without any authority of law. In the decision reported
as 1997 (5) SCC 536 <a href="/doc/50793625/" id="a_137">Mafatlal Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. vs. UOI &amp; Ors</a> .,
under writ jurisdiction refund can be directed where the levy is
without jurisdiction and the same would include a penalty levied

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">LPA 895/2010 &amp; connected matters                           Page 37 of 38</span>
 without any jurisdiction. In the instant case the penalty levied is
unconstitutional being not sanctioned by any power vested in
DPCC either under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_138">Water Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_139">Air Act</a>. The impugned
decisions where penalty levied has been directed to be refunded
are upheld.
</p><p id="p_43">43.           The appeals filed by DPCC are dismissed and the cross
objections filed are allowed in terms of paras 27, 33, 34 and 39
above.
