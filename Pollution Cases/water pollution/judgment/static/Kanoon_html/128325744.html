<p id="p_1">         1.   Today, in the course of the hearing of this matter, Mr.
         Vyas, the learned counsel appearing for the G.P.C.B drew my
         attention to the consent order issued by the Gujarat Pollution

         concerned, the following conditions have been imposed;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "(1) The generation of industrial effluent from the

<p id="p_3">         3.   I am informed by Mr. Vyas that the G.P.C.B has yet to
         issue the Consolidated Consent &amp; Authorization to commence
         with the manufacturing of the product. Mr. Vyas gave a fair
         idea about the procedure, which has to be adopted by the
         G.P.C.B before granting the C.C.A. According to Mr. Vyas,
         before the C.C.A is granted, a team of G.P.C.B would visit the
         unit and carry out the necessary inspections periodically and if,
         ultimately, satisfied with the compliance of all the conditions,
         would, thereafter, proceed to issue the C.C.A. On one such
         inspection, the following was noted by the G.P.C.B.

              There will be no generation of any industrial waste water
              from manufacturing process. There will be requirement of
              fresh water 1.5 KLPD for cooling and 0.5 KLPD for
              domestic purpose. Domestic wastewater shall be dispose
              off through septic tank soak pit system. Unit will be zero
              discharge unit. Unit has installed Gasifier and Coal @ 600
              Kg/hr shall be used as fuel. The gases from the gasifier
              will be used as fuel in flash dryer. Unit has installed bag
              house (bag filter) with cyclone separator as part of their
              process part as well as       APCM. Unit has installed bag
              house (bag filter) single cone cyclone and bag house
              (bag filter) to stack attached to flash dryer and
              classification system     . There shall be no generation of
              Hazardous waster from this unit. Small residential area of
              Kabhai Na Muvada is about 225 meters away from this
              unit. Two storage godowns are noticed at about 300
              meters away from this unit. There is no person available
              to contact at the closed storage godown. Construction
              work of new unit M/s Bhagyoday Agro Industries is going
              on at about 1 km distance from this unit. "
</p>
<p id="p_5">         4.   I take notice of the fact that the unit is likely to utilize
         about 1500 to 2000 liters of fresh water per day. This water
         will be utilized for the purpose of cooling the unit as well as for
         the domestic purpose.      The domestic waste water will be
         disposed of through the septic tank/soak pit system. The report
         further indicates that there is a residential area by the name
         Kabhai Na Muvada at a distance of 225 meters. I inquired with
         Mr. Vyas about the position so far as the groundwater level in
         the area is concerned keeping in mind the fact that there are
         agricultural fields of different individuals surrounding the unit.
         If the unit is going to consume about 1500 to 2000 liters of the
         groundwater per day, whether it will have any impact on the
         groundwater level and whether it is likely to prove detrimental
         to the interest of the farmers. I inquired with Mr. Vyas that if
         this 2000 liters of water has to be disposed of through septic
         tank/soak pit system, whether the fertility of the soil is likely
         to be affected.</p><pre id="pre_2">

         manufacturing of the product will commence.

<p id="p_7">         6.   Mr. Hakim, the learned counsel appearing for the
         petitioner invited my attention to an order passed by the
         Collector, granting the N.A. Permission dated 12th August,
         2016. Mr. Hakim, thereafter, invited my attention to the
         statement of the respondent No.7 recorded on 20th August,
         2016 by the local Gram Panchayat. The statement reads as
         under;

              signed below."
</p>
<p id="p_10">         7.   Indisputably, as on date, the respondent No.7 has not
         been able to obtain any permission from the Gram Panchayat
         to put up the unit. Obtaining of the permission from the Gram
         Panchayat is one of the conditions imposed in the N.A. order.
         In the statement of the respondent No.7, an undertaking was
         given that he would not proceed further with the construction
         of the unit in the absence of the requisite permission of the
         Gram Panchayat. However, it seems that the construction has
         been completed and the G.P.C.B has also proceeded to grant
         the consent order referred to above.

<p id="p_11">         8.   Mr.     Bhatt,     the   learned         counsel      appearing            for        the
         respondent No.7 submits that the unit is not going to cause
         any problems for the villagers as apprehended. According to
         Mr. Bhatt, the unit is not likely to cause any air or water
         pollution.    According to Mr. Bhatt, the unit is not going to
         generate any industrial waste water from the manufacturing
         process. Mr. Bhatt would submit that                          the apprehension
         expressed by the villagers about dusting in the air will also be
         taken care of as the bag house (bag filter) with cyclone
         separator has been installed. Mr. Bhatt pointed out that in the
         inspection report of the G.P.C.B, it has been stated that the
         unit has installed single cone cyclone and bag house (bag
         filter) attached to the fresh dryer and classification system.</p><pre id="pre_3">

         parties and having considered the materials on record, I am of
         the view that the picture is very hazy. The G.P.C.B will have to
         take due care and ensure about the apprehension expressed
         by the villagers as regards the dusting and groundwater level.
         Before granting the C.C.A, all the relevant aspects will have to
         be kept in mind by the G.P.C.B. What is important for me, as
         on date to consider, is the breach of the conditions imposed in
         the N.A. order.
</p>
<p id="p_13">         10.   Ms. Thakore, the learned AGP appearing for the State-
         respondents submitted that indisputably there is no permission
         or consent letter from the local Gram Panchayat for the
         purpose of putting up the industrial unit. The obtaining of the
         requisite permission from the Gram Panchayat is one of the
         conditions imposed in the N.A order and appears to have been
         breached. If that be so, then the Collector owes an explanation
         why no steps were taken to stop the construction of the unit
         and why it permitted the respondent No.7 to complete the
         construction. A more detailed inquiry is necessary on all the
         relevant aspects of the matter referred to above. I expect the
         State to file a detailed reply in this regard and I also expect the
         G.P.C.B and the respondent No.7 to clarify the issues further in
         details.
</p>
<p id="p_14">         11.   Post the matter on 28.07.2017 on top of the board. Till
         then, the G.P.C.B shall not proceed to issue the C.C.A in favour
         of the respondent No.7. Let there be one more inspection at
         the end of the team of the G.P.C.B so far as the dusting part is
         concerned. A copy of this order be provided to Ms. Thakore,
         the learned AGP appearing for the State for its onward
         communication.</p><pre id="pre_4">
