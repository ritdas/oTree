ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. S.J. MUKHOPADHAYA)
 

 


 

	The
writ petition in public interest has been filed by the petitioner for
a direction to the respondent authorities to stop the activities of
the 12th
respondent of establishing the industrial unit at village Nani
Tambadi, District Valsad.  Apart from the above plea, it is also
pleaded that the small agriculturists in the area have spent huge
amount for development of their land.  Now due to demolition of the
sub-canals while levelling the land by the 12th
respondent, the irrigation facilities to their fields will be
disturbed. It is also alleged that no prior permission has been taken
from the competent authority.  
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.	This
Court while issued notice on the respondents on 2.7.2010, prohibited
the 12th
respondent from making any further construction on the land purchased
by it.  The said interim order was allowed to continue subject to the
order that could have been passed in the petition for vacating stay
preferred by the 12th
respondent. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.	The
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 12th
respondent pressed the petition for vacating the interim order of
stay.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.	We
have heard the parties in detail.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.	It
appears that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board has granted
conditional permission under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>, 1974 and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>,
1981 wherein the following conditions have been laid down:-
</p>
<p id="p_6"> 1.	This
order is subject to the outcome of the final order of Honourable High
Court in SCA No. 6233 of 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_7">2.	You
can establish industrial plant only to manufacture TEXTURIZED YARN.
</p>
<p id="p_8">3.	You
must obtain all necessary approvals from various government
departments before to start construction.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.	You
must obtain N.A. permission from competent before to start
construction activities.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.	You
will have to obtain the environmental clearance from the competent
authority for the products which required prior E.C. before to start
construction activities for that product.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.	You
have to take all necessary precautions to control noise pollution. 
You will not carry out any activity which may crease pollution
related problem in surrounding area. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">6.	Per
contra, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 12th
respondent submits that the N.A. permission as has been ordered to
obtain is not required to be obtained in the present case.  Further,
according to him, the environmental clearance from the competent
authority is also not required as the products which the 12th
respondent intends to make do not require prior environmental
clearance before starting up the production activities.
</p>
<p id="p_13">7.	The
Collector, Valsad in his affidavit has given details of land being
Survey Nos. 102, 103, 104/1, 104/2, 105, 106 and 121 of village Nani
Tambadi, Taluka Pardi, District Valsad.  It is stated that the 12th
respondent intimated that they have started bona fide industrial use
as per Section 63AA of the Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Lands
Act, 1948 and they are required to intimate within 30 days as per the
Government of Gujarat Ordinance No. 3 of 1996 dated 26.6.1996.  Now
the matter has been intimated to the Collector by letter dated
25.2.2010. As per Section 65B of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and
Government Ordinance No. 2 of 1996 dated 26.6.1996, the 12th
respondent   occupant required to use the land for bona fide
industrial use is not required to take prior permission from the
Collector.  However, the 12th respondent is under an
obligation to intimate within 30 days and the post facto N.A
permission is required to be obtained after scrutinizing the
necessary papers.  After the intimation was given by the 12th
respondent on 25.4.2010, a large number of objections appears to have
been received from the villagers.  Therefore, no post facto N.A.
Permission is granted till date.
</p>
<p id="p_14">8.	Taking
into consideration the aforesaid facts, while we are not inclined to
vacate the interim order of stay for the present, allow the 12th
respondent to move before the competent authority to obtain necessary
permission as per the conditions imposed by the Gujarat Pollution
Control Board.  If such permission is sought for from the competent
authority, including the permission as already sought for from the
Collector, Valsad, the authorities will consider and decide the same
in accordance with law during pendency of the case and any such
decision shall be subject to the decision in this case.   It is
expected that the Collector, Valsad will decide the matter on the
application of the 12th respondent taking into
consideration the objections raised by the villagers on an early
date, preferably within one month.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	This
Civil Application stands disposed of.
