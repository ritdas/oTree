</p>
<p id="p_73">       a) The State Commission in the Impugned Order has not allowed
           nine Change in Law events, which are in issue in the present
           Appeal. The State Commission has allowed five Change in Law
           events of which two were allowed vide order dated 29.12.2015
           of the State Commission, which have not been challenged by
           any party and has attained finality.

           events. APRL has again approached the State Commission on
           these five events. APRL has claimed only four events (except
           MAT issue) before the State Commission in Petition No. 920 of
           2016. The State Commission vide order dated 8.6.2017
           rejected all the four claims of APRL. Against the said order,
           APRL has filed Appeal No. 284 of 2017 before this Tribunal
           which is pending. The State Commission has also not
           considered the prayer of APRL for payment of interest/ carrying
           cost on Change in Law claims.

           the Change in Law event is covered under <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_13">Article 10</a> of the PPA
           or not by analysing any increase in cost or revenue due to such
           event, whether the event is due to force of law, whether it has
           occurred after seven days before the bid deadline. If this
           criterion is satisfied then the said claim is required to be allowed
           under Change in Law.

           19.4.2017 in case of Sasan Power Ltd. v. CERC &amp;Ors. (Sasan
           Case) and has contended that the said judgement has dealt
           identical Change in Law events to hold that an imposition paid
           for carrying out the business if it has an impact on the revenue
           or expenditure of the Seller shall be considered as Change in
           Law and the provisions of the PPA shall be read in a manner

           Hon'ble Court regarding Railway being a business activity are
           limited to the finding regarding territorial jurisdiction in terms of
           Section 20 of CPC. The ratio that GoI carries a business of
           running Railways is not relevant to the issues involved in the
           present case. APRL is not making any claim against the
           Railways but the claim is to operationalise restitutive relief
           payable by the Discoms due to decision of Railway Board to
           change in/introduction of new surcharges under the PPA. The
           Hon'ble Supreme Court in Energy Watchdog Judgement has
           held that even a letter issued by Ministry of Power has force of

           Surcharge are merely components of dynamic pricing policy of

</p><p id="p_114">       j) The contention of APRL that only basic freight has been
           covered under the escalation formula is misconceived. The
           Change in Law clause cannot be interpreted based on nature of
           charges. Any grievance against components of escalation
           formula has different remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_115">       k) Arrangement of fuel is the responsibility of APRL. Any change
           in increase in sizing/crushing/ surface transportation charges is
           a contractual/ commercial issue between APRL and coal
           companies and such issues are not Change in Law. The
           contention that sizing charges have been issued under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_58">MMDR
           Act</a> is erroneous as under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_59">MMDR Act</a>, GoI only determines the
           grades and sizes of coal. The charges for particular grade and
           size is fixed by CIL which is a commercial activity.
</p>
<p id="p_116">       l) The bidders had an option to bid escalable and non-escalable
           component for energy charges. The escalation index notified by
           CERC has impact of change in price of coal and hence they
           cannot be considered as Change in Law. The bidders were
           aware of the escalation being allowed and should have bid
           accordingly. If all the charges were allowed to be made pass-
           through then there was no purpose of proving escalable and
           non-escalable components in the bid process.
</p>
<p id="p_117">       m) The claim of Forest Tax is also misconceived as no details have
           been provided by APRL including the notification regarding it.
</p>
<p id="p_118">       n) The claim of carrying cost is also erroneous as there is no
           provision in the PPA for such costs and the only provision in

           PPA is related to interest on late payment if the payment is
           delayed by the Discoms arising out of the claims from Change
           in Law events. The judgement of this Tribunal in case of <a href="/doc/59495574/" id="a_60">SLS
           Power Ltd. v. APERC &amp;Ors</a>. in Appeal No. 150 of 2011 has
           been relied. The NTPC case and Tata Power case relied by
           APRL are also differentiated from the present case in view of
           re-determination of tariff and specific categories where carrying
           cost is payable. Even in case interest is allowed the same shall
           not be at the rate of delayed payment surcharge but it should be
           on general principles of restitution.
</p>
<p id="p_119">       o) The State Commission has not given any directions on levy of
           Clean Energy Cess and Central Excise duty in the Impugned
           Order. The State Commission has stated that the same has
           been settled in accordance with the PPA. The Discoms had
           agreed to pay the said cess &amp; duty amounts for two years 2013-
           14 &amp; 2014-15 which has been directed by the State
           Commission vide order dated 29.12.2015. There is no
           agreement for payment of the said cess and duty beyond 2014-
           15 and also there is no direction in the Impugned Order for
           payment of the same beyond 2014-15.
</p>
<p id="p_120">       p) The relevant clause for applicability of taxes under Change in
           Law is the last bullet which is applicable on tax on supply of
           power and cannot be applied to any other bullet under the said
           clause. This is unlike other PPAs under <a href="/doc/1088591/" id="a_61">Section 63</a> of the Act as
           in case of Sasan Power Ltd., Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd., Adani
           Power's PPA with GUVNL etc. The wordings of the said PPAs
           are consciously different.

</p><p id="p_122">       q) The PPA does not define the word 'supply' but the same has
           been defined in the Act at <a href="/doc/1153824/" id="a_62">Section 2</a> (71) as sale of power.
           Thus, the PPA does not cover the taxes which are not on the
           taxable event of supply of power. In present case service tax,
           royalty on coal etc are not taxes on supply of power but other
           taxable events which are not covered in the PPA and cannot be
           allowed as Change in Law event. The judgement of Hon'ble
           Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/443222/" id="a_63">Godfrey Philips India Ltd. v. State of
           U.P</a>. (2005) 2 SCC 515 has been relied.
</p>
<p id="p_123">       r) Claims under PPA affect public interest and therefore rights and
           obligations and claims under PPA cannot be allowed based on
           understanding or waiver between the parties. The same has
           been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/108020655/" id="a_64">All India
           Engineer Power Federation &amp; Ors. v. Sasan Power Ltd. &amp;Ors</a>.

<p id="p_124">       s) Excise duty and Royalty on coal forms part of escalation
           formula notified for Section 63 PPAs. This has been confirmed
           by GoI vide communication dated 20.7.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_125">       t) The issue of fee for Consent to Operate is related to
           responsibility of APRL to obtain environmental clearances at its
           own cost and expenses as per PPA and cannot be passed in
           guise of Change in Law. The State Commission has erred in
           allowing such costs under Change in Law. Further, the amount
           involved on this account is within 1% of LC amount and
           accordingly impermissible under <a href="/doc/298655/" id="a_65">Article 10.3.2</a> of the PPA.

       u) The Change in Law Article under PPA is exhaustive in nature
           and not inclusive in nature as it uses the expression 'means'.
           On this issue the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case
           of <a href="/doc/483811/" id="a_66">Bharat Coop. Bank (Mumbai) Ltd. v. Employees Union</a> (2007)
           4 SCC 685 has been relied. Thus, specific entries under
           Change in Law has to be considered for any relief.
</p>
<p id="p_127">       v) There is specific clause in the PPA related to taxes, the general
           clauses dealing with laws in general have to be interpreted as
           necessarily excluding taxes. This principle has been dealt by
           Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/1101230/" id="a_67">South India Corporation (P)
           Ltd. v. Secretary Board of Revenue Trivandrum and Anr</a>. (1964)
           4 SCR 280. Further, it is a settled position in interpretation of
           statutes as well as interpretation of contracts that an
           interpretation would render a particular provision redundant is
           not an acceptable interpretation. On this issue the judgements
           of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/139043673/" id="a_68">JSW Infrastructure Ltd. v.

           compensation nor the date of compensation from which it
           becomes effective which is required in terms of the PPA.
           Therefore, the State Commission was required to decide the

       consideration on the issues raised in the instant Appeal as
       follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_131">       a) APRL has sought compensation on 19 Change in Law events.
           The State Commission has allowed compensation on account
           of change in Royalty on Coal, levy of Service Tax on
           transportation of goods by Railways and increase in fee for
           Consent to Operate. The State Commission has not considered
           the claim on account of Clean Energy Cess and Central Excise
           Duty as they were already settled in terms of the PPA. Further,
           the State Commission has not considered the claims on
           account of increase in MAT, change in service tax rate, CG
           Paryavaran Upkar, CG Vikas Upkar and restriction of ash
           content in coal to 34% as the same were claimed on

           hypothetical basis without incurring the same. These claims
           were made by APRL based on the order dated 30.1.2017 of this
           Tribunal.        Rest of the claims i.e. nine in numbers were
           disallowed by the State Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_132">       b) The State Commission has reiterated its findings while
           disallowing the said nine claims of APRL under Change in Law.
           The State Commission has based the Impugned Order
           considering the judgement dated 12.9.2014 of this Tribunal in
           case of Wardha Power v. MERC, CERC order dated 30.3.2015
           in case of GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd. v. Dakshin Haryana
           Bijlee Vitaran Nigam Ltd., CERC order dated 3.2.2016 in case
           of Sasan Power Ltd. v. MP Power Management Co. Ltd., GERC
           order dated 21.10.2011 and MERC order dated 20.4.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_133">       c) The Energy Watchdog case relied by APRL is misplaced as it is
           mainly related to change in Coal Policy and consequent revision
           of Tariff Policy. The said judgement does not lay down general
           principle of law that all notifications, policy, rule, ordinance,
           circular etc. issued by any Government Instrumentality under
           statutory powers shall have force of Law. In case of Sasan
           Power judgement passed by this Tribunal it has been held that
           <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_74">Finance Act</a> and various notifications issued by Govt. in respect
           of Change in Law events are covered under Change in Law

           perusal of <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_76">Article 10.1.1</a> of the PPA along with other provisions
           of the PPA, it becomes clear that every imposition by way of
           order, circular or notification issued by Indian Government
           Instrumentality does not qualify for compensation under Change
           in Law and every circular issued by MoR/CIL does not fall under
           <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_77">Article 10.1.1</a> read with definition of Law at <a href="/doc/1200881/" id="a_78">Article 1.1</a> of the
           PPA. Only such circulars which can be traced to the sovereign
           power of the government can be said to have force of law.

           CERC escalation rates take care of variation in base rate,

           vehemently submitted that in view of the well settled law by the

       pleadings available, the issues emerged in the instant appeals for
       our consideration are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_138">       A. APRL         vide     its    Petition      No.     RERC-577/15            has      sought
           compensation on 19 Change in Law events and carrying cost
           on the allowed compensation under Change in Law. The State
           Commission has allowed compensation only on three accounts
           namely change in Royalty on Coal, levy of Service Tax on
           transportation of goods by Railways and increase in fee for
           Consent to Operate. The State Commission has not considered
           the claim on account of Clean Energy Cess and Central Excise
           Duty. As per the State Commission the same were already
           settled in terms of the PPA. The State Commission has also
           dealt these claims in its order dated 29.12.2015. Further, the
           State Commission has not considered the claims of APRL on
           account of increase in MAT, change in service tax rate, CG
           Paryavaran Upkar, CG Vikas Upkar and restriction of ash
           content in coal to 34%.                These claims have been made by
           APRL through a separate petition before the State Commission
           and are not being considered accordingly in the present
           judgement. Rest of the claims of APRL nine in numbers were
           disallowed by the State Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_139">       a) The case of the Discoms is that the State Commission should
           have not allowed compensation on the said three accounts and
           contested that earlier allowed compensation on account of levy
           of Clean Energy Cess and Central Excise duty cannot be
           allowed from 2015-16 onwards. APRL has been aggrieved by
           disallowances under Change in Law and also disallowance of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                                         Page 32 of 83</span>

           carrying cost on compensation arising out of allowed Change in
           Law events.
</p>
<p id="p_140">       b) APRL and the Discoms have raised various questions of law
           related to disallowed/ allowed events under Change in Law. It
           would be prudent for us to analyse the disallowed/ allowed
           Change in Law events issue wise instead of taking the
           questions of law. It is a settled position in law that the rights and
           obligations of the parties arise from the PPA entered between
           them for procurement of power under <a href="/doc/1088591/" id="a_81">Section 63</a> of the Act. The
           present claims of APRL and the contentions of the Discoms are
           to be viewed accordingly. This requires analysis of the claims of
           the parties under the provisions of the PPA. The relevant
           Articles of the PPA dealing with Change in Law provisions relied
           upon by the parties are reproduced below:

<p id="p_157">           The Seller is required to produce documentary proof of the

           Procurers as per PPA.
</p>
<p id="p_158">       c) Before discussing the issues there is a need to address a
           common issue raised by the Discoms related to allowance of
           tax under Change in Law in terms of the PPA. According to the
           Discoms that as per the 5th bullet of the <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_85">Article 10.1.1</a> of the
           PPA change in tax or introduction of any new tax is only
           applicable to supply of power which also means sale of power if
           definition of supply is taken in terms of the Act. The Discoms
           have contended that if there is specific provision dealing with
           the tax under Change in Law then other provisions of Change in
           Law Article are not allowed to deal with the tax and as such no
           other tax implications are allowed to be covered under Change
           in Law under the PPA. The Discoms have also relied on some
           judgements of Hon'ble Supreme Court on this issue. We have
           gone through the said judgements and we observe that
           according to the judgements relied by the Discoms, the taxes

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                                         Page 37 of 83</span>
 Judgement in A. No. 119 of 2016 &amp; IA Nos. 668 &amp; 674 of 2016 and A. No. 277 of 2016 &amp; IA No. 572 of 2016



           once dealt in a particular clause of a contract then there is no
           scope for considering taxes under other clauses of a contract.
</p>
<p id="p_159">       d) APRL has submitted that the generator undertakes many
           activities to ensure supply of power to the Discoms. APRL has
           relied on the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
           <a href="/doc/970048/" id="a_86">State of A.P. v. NTPC</a> (2002) 5 SCC 203 wherein it has been
           held that the production (generation), transmission, delivery and
           consumption            are      simultaneous,            almost        instantaneous.
           According to the said judgement, the applicable taxes on inputs
           for generation of power can be construed to be taxes on supply
           of power. APRL has further contended that if the contention of
           the Discoms is accepted than the Change in Law provision
           would be applicable during the Operating Period and the
           applicability of the said provision will become redundant during
           Construction Period. There is some strength in the contention
           of APRL as there will be no applicability of Change in Law
           provisions if there are changes in tax/duties/levies etc. rates or
           imposition of new tax/duties/levies etc. during Construction
           Period and on input costs related to power generation.
</p>
<p id="p_160">       e) APRL has further contended that the reliance of the Discoms on
           the maxim 'expressum facit cessare tactium' meaning when
           express inclusions are specified, anything which is not
           mentioned explicitly is excluded is misplaced as the Hon'ble
           Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/6759/" id="a_87">Assistant Collector of Central Excise
           Calcutta Division v. National Tobacco Company of India Ltd</a>.
           (1972) 2 SCC 560 has held that the rule of prohibition by
           necessary implication could be applied only where a specified

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                                         Page 38 of 83</span>
 Judgement in A. No. 119 of 2016 &amp; IA Nos. 668 &amp; 674 of 2016 and A. No. 277 of 2016 &amp; IA No. 572 of 2016



              procedure is laid down for performance of duty or where there is
              an express prohibition.
</p>
<p id="p_161">       f) The Discoms have also reproduced the definition of Change in
              Law under different PPAs under <a href="/doc/1088591/" id="a_88">Section 63</a> of the Act. We have
              gone through the said provisions and we find that the other
              provisions of the PPA are similar to that in the other PPAs
              under <a href="/doc/1088591/" id="a_89">Section 63</a> of the Act except the fifth bullet which is
              additional specifically covering tax on supply of power. The
              judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court relied upon by the
              Discoms were under different context and could not be equated
              to the scheme of power procurement by Discoms under <a href="/doc/1088591/" id="a_90">Section
              63</a> of the Act which is based on guidelines issued by GoI under
              different scenarios wherein the treatment of taxes depends
              upon the specific conditions of the RFP and tariff quotes by the
              bidders.
</p>
<p id="p_162">       g) In view of our discussions as above and after duly considering
              the earlier judgements of this Tribunal, we are of the considered
              opinion that any change in tax/levies/ duties etc. or application
              of new tax/levies/ duties etc. on supply of power covers the
              taxes on inputs required for such generation and supply of
              power to the Discoms.

<p id="p_164">         i.     Now let us consider the nine claims of APRL/Appellant,

               convenience and brevity. APRL has submitted that the issue
               related to change in price mechanism of coal from UHV to
               GCV basis and levy of fuel adjustment component presently
               have no impact on APRL and the same have not been
               pressed upon. Accordingly, we are dealing with the other
               seven issues and the issue of carrying cost in this
               judgement.
</p>
<p id="p_165">         ii.   First, we take the three claims related to MoR i.e. increase in
               Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge and Port
               Congestion Surcharge on coal freight. Let us examine the
               impugned order of the State Commission on the said issues
               reproduced as below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                        "36. The Commission observes that the Busy Season
                        Surcharge on Coal Transportation has been imposed
                       by the Ministry of Railways. The increase made by
                       Ministry of Railways in our view cannot come within the
                       scope of 'Change in Law' as provided in the PPA
                        though it may increase transportation charges. The
                        increase has to be incurred by the Petitioner as an
                        additional cost in the coal cost which has to be to its
                        account. Merely because Railway under its power
                       imposes surcharge on coal transportation, it cannot be
                       equated to a surcharge levied as tax or cess of

                       was expected to take into account the possible revision
                       in these charges while quoting the bid. As already
                       stated, the Petitioner was expected in terms of para

                       2.7.2.4 of the RfP to include in quoted tariff all costs
                       involved in procuring the inputs. Since freight charges
                       are a cost involved for procuring coal which is an input
                       for generating power for supply to Discoms under the
                       PPA, the Petitioner cannot claim any relief under
                       change in law on account of revision in freight charges.
                       Accordingly, the claim of the Petitioner on this account
                       is disallowed. Therefore, Commission does not accept

                       was 2% on Normal Tariff Rate (Basic Freight + Busy

                       specified in Circular No. 58 of 2007 dated 29.05.2007.
                       Subsequently the GOI, Ministry of Railways, issued a
                       Rate Circular No. 38 of 2011 dated 12.10.2011 to
                       increase the Development Surcharge on Coal to 5% of
                       Normal Tariff Rate. The increase in Development
                       Surcharge from 2% to 5% squarely falls under the
                       definition of Change in Law as prescribed under the 1st
                       Bullet of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_92">Article 10</a> of the PPA.

                       The increase has to be incurred by the Petitioner as an
                       additional cost in the coal cost which has to be to its
                       account. Merely because Railway under its power
                       imposes surcharge on coal transportation, it cannot be
                       equated to a surcharge levied as tax or cess of
                       Finance Ministry under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_93">Finance Act</a>. Therefore, as
                       discussed at para 37, Commission does not accept the
                       claim.
</p>
<p id="p_167">                       50. In Commission's view, the levy of Port Congestion
                       Surcharge does not qualifying as an event of Change
                       in Law under 1st Bullet of <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_94">Article 10.1.1</a> of the PPA as
                       contended by the Petitioner. We observe that the levy
                       gets covered in fuel price escalation and hence cannot
                       be allowed as Change in Law.
</p>
<p id="p_168">           From the above reasoning it can be seen that the State
           Commission has disallowed the claim of APRL on Busy Season
           Surcharge and Development Surcharge by saying that these
           charges cannot be equated to a surcharge levied as tax or cess
           of Finance Ministry under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_95">Finance Act</a>. Further, APRL was
           expected to take into account the all costs involved in procuring
           the inputs/ possible revision in such charges while quoting the
           bid in terms of the RFP. In case of Port Congestion charges, the
           State Commission has observed that the levy is covered in fuel
           price escalation and hence cannot be allowed as Change in
           Law.

    iii.   It is held that the Port Congestion charges are levied by the
           MoR and the State Commission has observed that the levy is
           covered in fuel price escalation. The State Commission has
           erred to that extent. The claim of APRL for Port congestion
           charges have to be evaluated under transportation charges.

<p id="p_170">    iv.    Now let us analyse the provisions of the RFP. The relevant
           extract from the RFP is reproduced below:

               account all costs including capital and operating costs,

               in the Quoted Tariff. ......................"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_171">           From the above it can be seen that the tariff quoted by the
           Bidder has to be all inclusive tariff including capital and
           operating costs, statutory taxes, levies, duties and the
           responsibility of the same lies with the Bidder.
</p>
<p id="p_172">    v.     Perusal of the RFP reveals that the Bidder was required to
           quote escalable/ non-escabale inland transportation charges.

           CERC based on the freight rate circulars issued by MoR notifies
           the escalation rates for inland transportation of domestic coal.
</p>
<p id="p_174">    vi.    Before proceeding further let us consider the contentions of the
           Discoms that the circulars / notifications etc. issued by MoR do
           not have force of law. While claiming so the Discoms have
           relied on <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_96">Article 298</a> of the Constitution. The relevant extract
           from the Constitution is reproduced below:

<p id="p_175">           From the above it is manifest that, the <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_97">Article 298</a> deals with

<p id="p_191">           We have carefully gone through the said judgements and find
           that the Hon'ble Court has held that the terms of the contract
           have to be strictly read and natural meaning is to be given to it.
           Hon'ble Court has further held that outside aid in a contract can
           only be sought only when the meaning is ambiguous. In the
           present case too while interpreting the PPA we cannot
           artificially divide the circulars, notifications, rules etc. issued by
           Indian Government Instrumentality as issued under sovereign
           functions/ non-sovereign function of the Government.

  xiii.    From the above it is crystal clear that the Circulars issued by
           MoR       regarding         Busy       Season        Surcharge,          Development

<p id="p_193">  xiv.     It is also observed that the State Commission has concluded
           that the CERC Escalation Rates covers only the Base Freight
           Rate. This is obvious from the observations of the State
           Commission at various paras in the Impugned Order. The
           relevant extract from the Impugned Order is reproduced below:

               due to any reason including FAC gets reflected in the

                       from12.3.97. The Government also decided to allow

                       non-coking coal once in every six months by updating
                       the cost indices as per the escalation formula

                       2000 the Central Government has no power to fix the
                       prices of coal. Therefore, the prices of coal from CIL
                       and its subsidiaries were market based. Only the
                       pricing methodology was UHV basis at the time of bid

           has disallowed the levy of forest tax on the same premise as
           has been done in the Impugned Order.

<p id="p_230"> xxii.     It is observed that the claim of APRL for the said fee at the rate
           of Rs. 7/ton has been levied based on Chhattisgarh

           Chhattisgarh Transit (Forest Produce Rule) 2001 on coal mined
           and transported from SECL mines located in Forest area with
           effect from 1.11.2012. There was no such fee applicable as on
           cut-off date of the bid deadline. Accordingly, APRL could not
           have envisaged for factoring it in its bid. The levy of Forest
           Tax/Fee cannot be considered as a part of pricing mechanism
           for coal and hence it cannot form part of CERC Escalation
           Rates for coal. Accordingly, there has been increase in
           expenses related to coal due to such levy and the same falls

           perusal of the same we find that the tariff quoted by APRL
           comprises of Non- escalable and escalable components of tariff
           elements viz. Capacity Charges, Energy Charges and Inland
           Transportation Charges. There is no separate component
           surface transportation charges either in the bid or in the
           standard bidding documents. We observe that APRL was
           supposed to consider all the cost inputs for generation of power

           in Classification of Coal for Trainload movement. Let us first
           examine the findings of the State Commission on this issue.

               Base Freight Rate linked to the class of goods, includes the
               impact of change in class for railway freight for coal from 140
               to 150. Thus, the impact of change in freight rate due to
               change in freight class is being passed on through the CERC
               escalation rate. Therefore, the Commission does not
               consider this event as "Change in Law" as per <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_139">Article 10.1.1</a>
               of the PPA."
</p>
<p id="p_240">           The State Commission has held that the change in freight rate
           due to change in class for railway freight for coal is factored in
           through CERC escalation rate and hence same cannot be
           considered as a Change in Law event.
</p>
<p id="p_241">xxvii.     We also hold that such changes in classification of railway
           freight for coal is reflected in the escalation rate for
           transportation issued by CERC and hence automatically gets
           factored into the tariff and as such could not be considered as a
           Change in Law event. In the present case, although it was
           projected to be beneficial to the Discoms but the said benefits
           are automatically being passed on to the Discoms by a way of
           CERC escalation rates.

           The claims and counter claims of the parties have been taken
           into account while applying the said decision of this Tribunal in
           the present judgement. We straight way come to the relevant

               capital to cater the requirement of impact of Change in Law

<p id="p_244">               There is always time lag between the happening of Change
               in Law event till its approval by the Central Commission and
               this time lag may be substantial. As pointed out by the

               that in case of re-determination of tariff the interest by a way

               re-determined till the date of such re-determination of the
               tariff. In the present case after perusal of the PPAs we find
               that the impact of Change in Law event is to be passed on to
               the Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 by way of tariff adjustment
               payment as per <a href="/doc/430906/" id="a_141">Article 13.4</a> of the PPA. The relevant extract

               Law is to be done in the form of adjustment to the tariff. To
               our mind such adjustment in the tariff is nothing less then re-

               out of approval of the Change in Law events from the
               effective date of Change in Law till the approval of the said
               event by appropriate authority. It is also observed that the
               Gujarat Bid-01 PPA have no provision for restoration to the
               same economic position as if Change in Law has not
               occurred. Accordingly, this decision of allowing Carrying Cost
               will not be applicable to the Gujarat Bid-01 PPA."

           allowed Change in Law events are to be passed onto the

           been held that if there is a provision in the PPA for restoration of
           the Seller to the same economic position as if no Change in

           for such allowed Change in Law event(s).

           Accordingly, it has been contended that the said order dated
           29.12.2015 has attained finality.
</p>
<p id="p_255">    iv.    It is observed that in the Impugned Order, the State
           Commission has held that the issues of Clean Energy Cess and
           Central Excise Duty have been settled under Change in Law
           between the Discoms &amp; APRL in accordance with the terms of
           the PPA. The State Commission has not given any further
           direction for compensation on the said issues for the period
           beyond FY 2014-15. It is observed that the issue regarding
           Clean Energy Cess and Central Excise Duty are covered under
           Change in Law settled position between APRL and the Discoms
           and the same has also been held by the State Commission vide
           order dated 29.12.2015 which has not been challenged by the
           Discoms. Accordingly, this issue has attained finality and APRL
           is entitled to receive compensation on account of any increase
           in the Clean Energy Cess and Central Excise Duty. The
           contention of the Discoms that the said claims have to be
           examined by the State Commission for the period beyond 2014-
           15 is unsustainable as there can be no two interpretations on
           same issues under the same Change in Law provisions in terms
           of the same PPA. Even otherwise, as decided in the preceding
           paragraphs the change in taxes/ duties etc. which leads to
           increase in input costs for power generation is covered under
           the Change in Law provisions of the PPA. Accordingly, the
           changes in Clean Energy Cess and Central Excise Duty which
           could not be envisaged at the time of cut-off date are Change in
           Law events and APRL is to be compensated for the same.

<p id="p_258">    vi.    First, we take the issue of Change in Rate of Royalty payable
           on Domestic Coal. The relevant extract from the Impugned
           Order is reproduced below:

<blockquote id="blockquote_67">               "i. Change in Rate of Royalty Payable on Domestic Coal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_68">               18. The Petitioner has submitted that the Government of
               India, Ministry of Coal, issued a Notification No. G.S.R.
               349(E) dated 10.05.2012 to increase the rate of royalty on
               Coal from 5% to 14% ad-valorem on the price of coal.
               Therefore, the said enhancement in the rate of Royalty on
               coal squarely falls under 1st Bullet of <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_150">Article 10</a> of the PPA
               as an event of Change in Law and hence the Petitioner

               cannot be treated as tax but these constitute fee and the

               therefore do not qualify as change in law.

</p><p id="p_260">               21. The contention of the Respondent that royalty was in
               existence at the time of submitting the bid and hence does
               not qualify for change in law claim, has to be rejected as
               mere existence of levy on the date 7 days prior to the bid
               deadline will not disentitle the Petitioner from making the
               claim unless it is shown that royalty rate has not changed
               since then. Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the
               cases relating thereto has held that the royalty is a tax
               imposed on the minerals extracted which includes coal.
</p><p id="p_261">               22. Therefore, change in rates of royalty on coal falls within
               the 1st bullet of <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_152">Article 10.1.1</a> of PPA and the Petitioner has
               to be allowed the impact of change."
</p>
<p id="p_262">           The State Commission has concluded that as per the decision
           of Hon'ble Supreme Court the Royalty is a tax imposed on the
           minerals extracted and it falls within the 1stbullet of <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_153">Article
           10.1.1</a> of the PPA and hence APRL is to be compensated for
           the same.

<p id="p_263">   vii.    APRL has also relied on the judgement of this Tribunal in case
           of <a href="/doc/168827139/" id="a_154">Wardha Power v. Reliance Infrastructure Ltd</a>. in Appeal No.
           288 of 2013 wherein the PPA had same Change in Law
           provisions and this Tribunal has allowed Change in Law event
           on account of change in rate of Royalty. We have gone through
           the said judgement and we observe that the contentions on
           APRL are correct as this Tribunal has allowed compensation to
           Wardha Power due to increase in tax on coal. The relevant
           portion from the judgement is reproduced below:

               "26. The price bid given by the Seller for fixed and variable
               charges both escalable and non-escalable is based on the
               Appellant's perception of risks and estimates of expenditure
               at the time of submitting the bid. The energy charge as
               quoted in the bid may not match with the actual energy
               charge corresponding to the actual landed price of fuel. The
               seller in its bid has also not quoted the price of coal.
               Therefore, it is not correct to correlate the compensation on
               account of Change in Law due to change in cess/excise duty
               on coal, to the coal price computed from the quoted energy
               charges in the Financial bid and the heat rate and Gross
               Calorific value of Coal given in the bidding documents by the
               bidder for the purpose of establishing the coal requirement.
               The coal price so calculated will not be equal to the actual
               price of coal and therefore, compensation for Change in Law
               computed on such price of coal will not restore the economic
               position of the Seller to the same level as if such Change in

           the coal price computed from the quoted energy charges in the

               Government vide Gazette Notification dated 10.12.2010
               amended the above referred rules to increase the Fees from
               Rs. 61,000/- per annum to Rs. 2,49,000/-. Further, vide
               Notification dated 05.06.2015, the fees was revised to Rs.
               48,000 + Rs. 1000 per Crore of incremental investment
               above Rs. 50 Crore. It is submitted that the effect of the said
               Notification is that annual Fees required for Consent to
               Operate has increased to Rs. 2,12,34,000/-. The Petitioner
               has notified the same to the respondents vide letter dated
               22.10.2015. The event of increase in fee for consent to
               operate has led to increase in cost of generation and such
               increased cost needs to be reimbursed by the Respondents.

               required for supply of power at its cost is untenable as the
               cost to be incurred for operation of plant if increased has to

               deadline. It is further noted that the increase in fee for
               consent to operate was notified by Rajasthan Government
               and thus falls under third bullet of <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_158">Article 10.1.1</a> to qualify as
               change in law. Therefore, the extra amount is to be paid by
               the Petitioner to the Rajasthan Government every year as a
               fee for the "Consent to Operate". Such additional fee which
               was not envisaged at the time of bidding therefore falls under
               the last but one bullet, hence has to be allowed."
</p>
<p id="p_281">               From the above it can be seen that the State Commission
               based on the notification issued by Government of Rajasthan
               regarding change in the condition for 'Consent to Operate'
               has allowed the increase in fee for 'Consent to Operate'
               under Change in Law as it has resulted in recurring expense
               to APRL.
</p>
<p id="p_282">  xiii.    We have gone through the details related to 'Consent to
           Operate' and we observe that the Govt. of Rajasthan has
           changed the terms and conditions prescribed for obtaining any
           Consents, by a way of increasing the fee for Consent to
           Operate which affects the economic position of APRL and it
           falls under the fourth bullet of the <a href="/doc/664727/" id="a_159">Article 10.1.1</a> related to
           Change in Law of the PPA. The same has been observed by
           the State Commission and we do not find any error or perversity
           in the findings recorded by the State Commission.
