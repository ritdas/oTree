24(M)/1987, T.R.No.126/05 pending in the court of S.D.J.M.,

against the accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            The fact of the case lies in a narrow compass. The

Opposite party no.2 filed a petition of complaint bearing Complaint

Case No.33(M)/1988 for offences under <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_3">sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/861404/" id="a_4">42</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_5">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">44</a> of

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a> committed during

the period from 1.1.1987 on wards. Similarly, other complaint bearing

Complaint Case No.24(M)/1987, which is the subject matter in

Cr.Misc.No.21998 of 2005, was filed by Opposite party no.2 for

offences under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_8">section 33</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> for restraining the petitioners from carrying on

production in their factory namely M/s Bharat Sugar Mills, Sidhwalia

as they were discharging waste water and other trade effluents into the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                       3</span>




river Ghoghari without any treatment resulting in great apprehension

of pollution of water of the aforesaid river Ghoghari.

</p><p id="p_6">            It is submitted that the petitioner M/s Bharat Sugar Mills

was established in 1931 and the main allegations in the complaint are

that they were discharging trade effluents after 1987 without previous

sanction of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board .It appears from

paragraph 8 of the complaint case that earlier the petitioner Sugar

factory was given consent for discharge of its trade effluents for a

period from 1.4.1985 to 31.12.1988 by the State Board with

conditions inter alia that they would submit the effluent analysis report

during the working season monthly and that the effluents parameters

contained should remain within the permissible limit as fixed by the

Board. The petitioners further submit that the letter requesting for

renewal of consent dated 22.10.1986 was returned to the Sugar

Factory vide State Board's letter dated 8.1.1987 with request to send

Analysis report and time bound programme for installation of Effluent

Treatment Plant. The complaint was filed against M/s Bharat Sugar

Mills through its Executive President who was accused no.1 and then

the Executive President of M/s Bharat Sugar Mills Ltd. was made

accused no.2 in both the cases.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            The petitioners have stated in paragraph 10 of the petition

in Cr.Misc.No.21109 of 2005 that at the relevant time when alleged

offence was instituted, one G.P.Dhurka was the Executive President of

the company who died on 22.5.1995. In fact, he had appeared in the

case and taken bail. Petitioner no.2 B.K.Sureka was not even posted in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                        4</span>




the Sugar Mill at the relevant time when the alleged offence was

committed under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_10">section 33</a>, <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_11">41</a>, <a href="/doc/861404/" id="a_12">42</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_13">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_14">44</a> of the

Water(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a> (hereinafter referred

to as 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Water Pollution Act</a>').
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Counsel for the petitioners submits that <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_17">sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/861404/" id="a_18">42</a>

and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_19">43</a> provides for punishment for alleged violation of sub-section

(2) or sub-section(3) of <a href="/doc/303980/" id="a_20">section 20</a> or orders issued under clauseÂ© of

sub-section(1) of <a href="/doc/140281/" id="a_21">section 32</a> or directions issued under sub-section(2)

of <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_22">section 33</a> or <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_23">section 33A</a> for a term which may extend to three

months or with fine which may extend to ten thousand. He further

submits that no person either juristic or natural has been made an

accused in the instant case apart from two accused mentioned in the

complaint case. The company being juristic person cannot be sent to

jail and the company which was said to be represented through the

Executive President at the relevant time has died in the year 1995. He

further submits that petitioner no.2 was not an accused and the

prosecution case is pending since last 22 years and the as such

continuance of proceeding over 20 years would be violative of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_24">Article

21</a> of the Constitution and concept of speedy trial. In support of his

contention, he relied upon a decision in the case of P.Ramachandra

Rao Vs State of Karnataka, reported in (2002)4 SCC 578, particularly

para-29 at page-603.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned counsel appearing on

behalf of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board submits that the

petitioners cannot dispute that no offence has been made in the facts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                      5</span>




and circumstances of the case. The petitioner Sugar Mill after

1.1.1987 did not have any sanction of the Pollution Control Board for

discharging its trade effluents. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_25">Section 25</a> mandates that no person

without consent of the Board will establish or take any steps to

establish any industry, operation or process, or any treatment and

disposal system which is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent

into a stream or well or sewer. He submits that the aforesaid provision

would also apply to the existing lease and industry. He further submits

that <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_26">Section 33</a> authorizes the Pollution Control Board to make an

application to courts for restraining apprehended pollution of water in

streams or wells and as such complaint bearing Misc.Case

No.24(M)/1987      was    filed   which    is   subject    matter   of

Cr.Misc.No.21998 of 2005 He submits that the second complaint has

been filed for punishing the Opposite parties for discharge of trade

effluent without proper sanction. He submits that even if the erstwhile

Executive President of the Sugar Mill was made an accused who died

on 22.5.1995, still vicarious liability would continue against the new

incumbent.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             It appears that accused no.1 M/s Bharat Sugar Mills was

established in the year 1931. Nonetheless, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_27">section 26</a> of the Water

Pollution Act, 1974 provides that provision of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_28">section 25</a> will also be

applicable to the existing discharge of sewage or trade effluent by

existing lease at the commencement of the Act. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_29">Section 25</a> of the Act

provides restriction on new outlets and new discharges. It mandates

that no person without consent of the Board will establish or take any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                       6</span>




steps to establish any industry, operation or process, or any treatment

and disposal system which is likely to discharge sewage or trade

effluent into a stream or well or sewer.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            It is not in dispute that the accused persons have got

consent from the State Government till 1986 for discharge of trade

effluents. In 1986 the petitioners applied for consent for further period

which was not acceded. However, in March, 1990 the petitioner

company established its Effluent Treatment Plant. Thus, it appears

that for the period between 1.1.1987 to March, 1990 the Sugar Mill

did not have the valid consent for discharge of effluents.

</p><p id="p_12">            The issue is whether prosecution would be allowed to

continue against the petitioners even after 22 years or whether it could

at all continue against them, in view of the fact that one G.P.Dhurka,

was represented petitioner no.1, the company, and was also arrayed as

accused no.2 as well, died on 22.5.1995. Further more, whether

B.K.Sureka, petitioner no.2 in both the cases holding the post of

Senior Executive Vice President of the Sugar Mill having joined the

company much after 1990 can be prosecuted?
</p>
<p id="p_13">            In my view no person who at the relevant time was not

associated in any manner with the affairs of the company can be

criminally proceeded against. Petitioner no.2 joined the company

much after 1990 and as such the prosecution against him would be an

abuse of the process of the court and the same is hereby quashed.

</p><p id="p_14">            So far as petitioner no.1 namely M/s Bharat Sugar Mills

Ltd. is concerned, I find that it has not been controverted that the then
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                       7</span>




Executive President representing the company namely G.P. Dhurka

died on 22.5.1995. Had G.P. Dhurka been alive he could have been

prosecuted whether he continued to be the Executive President or not.

It is well settled that sentence of imprisonment can be passed only

against the natural person and not against juristic person. In this case,

as the then Executive President has died, I find that no sentence of

imprisonment can be legally passed against the company.

</p><p id="p_15">            However, the vicarious liability of the company, so far as

payment of fine is concerned, would subsist and the instant

proceeding at best can proceed only so far as it relates to imposition of

fiscal punishment. To the aforesaid extent I fully find substance in the

submission of learned counsel for the Pollution Board.

</p><p id="p_16">            This takes us to the next issue whether the proceeding

should be allowed to continue even for the purpose of imposition of

fiscal punishment against the company after 22 years of filing of the

complaint. It is not in dispute that the Sugar Mill regularly approached

the Water Pollution Board for consent for its effluent discharge which

was also granted up to 1986. Further consent was denied to the

petitioner company after 1986 despite its application. It appears that

within three years, the petitioner company established its Effluent

Treatment Plant in the year 1990 and thereafter it has regularly

obtained consent of the appropriate authority for discharge of its

effluent.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            It appears that no evidence or witness has been examined

in the instant case. In such circumstances allowing the proceeding to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              8</span>




       continue after 22 years would be violative of principle of speedy trial

       in the facts of this case. As such the instant proceedings arising out of

       Misc. Case No.33(M)/1988 and Misc. Case No.24(M)/1987 pending

       in the court of S.D.J.M. Gopalganj cum Special Magistrate, under

       Water(Prevention and Control of Pollution)Act, 1974 are quashed.

</p><p id="p_18">                   In the result, these two applications are allowed.
