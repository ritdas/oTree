                    R.S.A.No.405 of 2015

         ------------------------------------------------
       Dated this the 16th day of November, 2015


                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">           The plaintiffs in a suit for injunction are the

appellants in the second appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2.   Defendants 1 and 2 are running a dairy farm

in the neighbourhood of the residential property of the

plaintiffs. According to the plaintiffs, the conduct of the

defendants in running the dairy farm is causing nuisance to

them.    It is also their case that the defendants are not

complying with the directions issued by the Pollution Control

Board in the matter of running the dairy farm. The plaintiffs,

therefore, sought a decree of permanent prohibitory

injunction restraining the defendants from running their

dairy farm otherwise than in accordance with all the

requisite permissions and licenses and without causing any

nuisance. The defendants contested the suit. According to

them, they have all the requisite licenses and permissions

for running the dairy farm. They also contended that the

conduct of the dairy farm is not causing any nuisance to

anybody. They further contended that the suit is not

maintainable in the light of <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_1">Section 46</a> of the Air (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and <a href="/doc/598206/" id="a_3">Section 58</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_3">           3.    The trial court found that the suit is not

maintainable. The trial court also found that the plaintiffs

have not established that the conduct of the dairy farm is

causing nuisance to the public. Consequently, the suit was

dismissed. Though the plaintiffs took up the matter in

appeal, the appellate court confirmed the decision of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">R.S.A.No.405 of 2015           3</span>




trial court. The plaintiffs who are aggrieved by the

concurrent decisions against them have thus come up in this

second appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           4. Heard the learned counsel for the appellants.

</p><p id="p_5">           5. As noticed above, the case of the plaintiffs is

that the conduct of the dairy farm of the defendants is not in

accordance with the directions issued by the Pollution

Control Board and that the dairy farm of the defendants is

causing nuisance to them. While giving evidence, the first

plaintiff as PW1 has clarified that he has no grievance

against the Pollution Control Board which had given

permission to the defendants to run the dairy farm.        In

other words, the grievance of the plaintiffs in the suit

concerns non compliance of the directions issued by the

Pollution Control Board by the defendants, in the matter of

running the dairy farm and the nuisance caused by the dairy

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">R.S.A.No.405 of 2015          4</span>




farm. As such, the view taken by the courts below that the

suit is not maintainable in the light of the provisions

contained in the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution)

Act</a> and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>

may not be correct. However, it is seen that the plaintiffs

themselves have examined before the trial court on their

side the Environmental Engineer of the Pollution Control

Board, the Secretary of the Panchayat as also the Health

Inspector. Further, it has come out in evidence that though

there was an earlier complaint before the Human Rights

Commission concerning the alleged nuisance caused by the

dairy farm of the defendants, the same was closed by the

Human Rights Commission accepting the stand of the

statutory authorities that the dairy farm is not causing any

nuisance. From the aforesaid materials, the courts below

came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">R.S.A.No.405 of 2015           5</span>




established that the conduct of the dairy farm by the

defendants is causing nuisance to the plaintiffs. I do not

find any infirmity in the findings rendered by the courts

below that the plaintiffs have not established that the dairy

farm of the defendants is causing nuisance to them.          As

such, even though I do not agree with the view taken by the

courts below that the suit is not maintainable, I do not find

any reason to interfere with the impugned decisions.

</p><p id="p_6">           In the result, the second appeal is dismissed in

limine. However, it is made clear that the dismissal of the

second appeal will not preclude the plaintiffs from instituting

a fresh suit, if the dairy farm of the defendants causes

nuisance to them in future.
