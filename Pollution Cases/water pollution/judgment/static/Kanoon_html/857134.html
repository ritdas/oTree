     Date of Order: 10/02/97


     ORAL ORDER</pre><p id="p_1">:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     The applicant Vishal Textile MIlls by filing the
     Civil Application has prayed that the order of closure
     passed by this Court, on January 10, 1996 (Annex.II) may
     either be vacated or suitably modified.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     It appears that the Court was pursuaded to pass
     the said order in view of the fact that in the petition
     alongwith the affidavit, it is stated that nine units
     situated at "Haraniavas" opposite Narol Village, Narol,
     Ahmedabad were operating without obtaining consent under
     <a href="/doc/376419/" id="a_1">section 9</a> of the Water Act and were operating without
     treatment facilities as required under the law.       The
     order is in detail giving the names of the Unit and
     permission to move the Court after serving the copies to
     the other side.     It appears that the Unit instead of
     order of closure, continued the activity.. It is stated
     by learned Counsel Mr.Nanavati that during this period
     the   unit   processed   goods   worth    Rs.36,00,000/-.</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">     Mr.Nanavati,learned Counsel pointed out from the record
     of the original Special Civil Application that the
     treatment facilities were provided. There is inspection

     dated 10-11-1995, indicating that the " Unit was not in
     operation due to power failure. Unit was (has) provided
 primary and secondary ETP".      In Column no.13 of the
Inspection    Report    the    details     are     given.
Mr.Nanavati,learned Counsel submitted that no doubt the
Unit operated inspite of the order, but the order was
obtained on a false statement placed on the record at the
back of the Affidavit filed by D.K.Solanki, Asstt. Law
Officer, GPCB, dated 15-11-1995, which is on the record
of the Special Civil Application No.6904 of 1995. On the
back of internal page 2 of the affidavit (on the back of
Page no.9 of the paper Book) the names of eight units
mentioned at Serial Nos.      1,2,3,4,5,6,9 and 13 in the

facilities as per the report submitted by GPCB.
