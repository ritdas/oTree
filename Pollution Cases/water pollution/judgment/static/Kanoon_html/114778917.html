               but still those persons have been granted and,
               therefore           on        the        ground          of     parity,          the

     Pancholi      submitted             that       the    Court    may        also
     consider whether such report was subsequently
     called for by the authority or it was available
     or not when earlier two lease have been granted
     in favour of those two persons. He therefore
     submitted that on the ground of parity, the
     present petitioner ought to have been granted
     lease       and     the        present             petition      may        be
     entertained on the ground of equity and parity.

</p><p id="p_6">     4.      Though the submissions have been made, as
     it     appears      from           the     papers        including        the
     communication at Annexure-B that in the said
     order dated 17.10.2011 of the Collector, it is
     specifically stated that the land in question is
     near to the reserved forest area and because the
     wild life is found near said area, lease is not
     granted. The said order dated 17.10.2011 was
     subject       to        the        revision.          Admittedly,          the
     petitioner has also filed Revision, which came
     to    be    rejected          by    the       impugned     order      dated
     17.04.2013         for    the       grounds          mentioned       in   the
     application. The emphasis which has been made
     is    on    the    ground          of    parity         that   two    other
     persons have been granted lease in respect of
     the adjoining area bearing Survey Nos.941 and
     942     and   same       ground          or    limitation       would      be
     applicable. Therefore, the submission that same
     limitation         or         restriction             would     also        be
     attracted for the purpose of grant of lease qua
     those persons and when they have been granted,
     the petitioner also on the ground of parity is
     claiming      the        similar         treatment.        However        the
     submission         is     required            to   be    considered        in
     background of the facts. It is evident from the

 C/LPA/824/2013                                                 JUDGMENT



     letter/communication                     dated       17.10.2011             at
     Annexure-B refusing the grant of lease by the
     Collector        that       it     has     been      refused         on    the
     grounds        stated       therein        regarding        environment
     aspect. Even in the order of the revisional
     authority dated 17th April, 2013, it is stated
     that the report of the Forest Department is
     received dated 08.10.2011, which is the basis
     for         refusing         such         permission            qua        the
     petitioner. It is also stated that when the
     lease of two persons were granted in the year
     2010, the said report was not available and,
     therefore, since it has been granted, he cannot
     claim any parity. Further if the lease which
     has been granted qua two other persons would in
     any case expire now after a period of three
     years and, therefore, same treatment would be
     meted         out.        Therefore            now     there         is    no
     justification to entertain the present petition
     in      the     year        2013         for     entertaining             such
     application for the grant of lease inspite of
     the reasons stated in the impugned order passed
     by the Collector at AnnexureB dated 17.10.2011
     and     the     order        at     AnnexureH          passed     by       the
     Revisional             Authority               dated        17.04.2013.
     Therefore, the claim made by the petitioner on
     the     ground       of    parity        cannot      be    accepted        as
     there cannot be a parity and the mistake cannot
     be permitted to be perpetuated even if it is
     causing some hardship. But when the issue of
     environment is raised, it cannot be compromised
     and the High Court would declined to exercise
     the         discretion        under       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article         226</a>    of        the
     Constitution of India.

             granted in favour of those two persons, they
             would       adopt    the      same    criteria        and      would
             maintain       the     parity        for     the     purpose     of

     on record list of leaseholders in the same area
     along with details of the period for which such
     leaseholders are granted lease and whether they
     continue to hold lease till today. It is really
     painful       that    in     this       very        affidavit         it   is
     stated that the authorities have rejected as
     many as 51 applications and an impression is
     sought to be created as if the authorities are
     strictly implementing the policy of protection
     of forest and forest lands. The net effect of
     rejection of those 51 applications is that a
     monopoly is created in favour of a selected few
     whose names are set out in the least (sic-list)
     which       is      annexed       as         Annexure-1          to     this

     there are only six persons, who are permitted
     to excavate sand in this area. Against two of
     those       six     persons,       there        is    a     stay       order
     granted by this Court on 12.12.2012 in Special

manufacture of ceramic, (2) metallurgical purposes, (3)

optical purposes, (4) purposes of stowing in coal mines,

(5) for manufacture of silvicrete cement, (6) manufacture

of sodium silicate and (7) for manufacture of pottery and

glass       and       therefore,         MoEF       came    out       with       another

     "On the bare reading of the above, it is clear
     that the Projects relating to mining of minor
     minerals (sand) where the mining area was less
     than        5    hectares         were     not        covered       by     this
     Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_52">     This was a serious lacuna in law leading to a
     practice being adopted all over the country to
     split up the entire area into smaller portions
     to avoid recourse to environment law. With the
     intention            to   circumvent            the     rigour       of    the
     Notification,               the    persons        involved          in      the
     mining activity were getting leases of areas of
     less than 5 hectares so as not to require EC by
     MoEF/SEIAA. Persons of the same family, even
     different            firms,        putting            together,           would
     acquire          huge       areas,        but    create           leases     of
     portions there each less than 5 hectares in
     names of different individuals to ensure that
     no occasion arises for obtaining EC by taking
     undue advantage of the exception carved out in
     the Notification itself. It is on mining the

     on in this manner. Thus, not only resulting in
     non-compliance              of    the      environment             norms     as
     framed          by    the    legislators              but    even        losing
     genuine          payment          of      royalty           due     to      the
     Central/State             Authorities.            According          to     the
     Applicant, he relies on the reports where it is
     stated that the sand business in Haryana alone
     is Rs. 10 crores, in Punjab it is estimated Rs.
     2 crores a day, and in Orissa it is around Rs.
     15,000 crores. This is an indicator of what is

     such Government would be entitled to recover as
     its royalty in accordance with law.

<p id="p_53">     This matter came up for consideration before
     the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case
     of Deepak Kumar Vs. State of Haryana, reported
     in    2012(4)SCC629.             The     Hon'ble          Supreme       Court
     after           considering         various      aspects          and        the
     recommendations of the Committee appointed by
     them        -    vide    paragraph         22    of       the    Judgment,
     observed that minimum size of the land lease
     should be 5 hectares and mining lease should be
     for 5 years. In order to avoid mischief that
     was being played in terms of Notification of
     2006, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India                                      at
     paragraph 29 directed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">             "29.       We,    in     the     meanwhile,             order    that

<p id="p_54">     The above paragraph mandated that even mining
     activity carried on in the area less than 5

     from the MoEF/SEIAA, as the case may be. Thus,
     the     legislative           enactments         and       the    judicial
     pronouncement of the highest court of the land
     made it mandatory for all concerned carrying on
     the activity of mining minor mineral (sand) to

'environmental clearance' is not capable of giving any

     at all. The continued infringement of law, over
     a period of time, is made possible by adoption
     of    such        means      which        are    best       known       to   the
     violators of law. Continued tolerance of such
     violations           of      law     not        only        renders       legal
     provisions nugatory but such tolerance by the
     enforcement authorities encourages lawlessness
     and adoption of means which cannot, or ought
     not to, be tolerated in any civilized society.
     Law     should         not    only        be    meant       for     the      law-
     abiding but is meant to be obeyed by all for
     whom        it   has     been      enacted.        A    law     is      usually
     enacted because the legislature feels that it
     is necessary. It is with a view to protect and
     preserve the environment and save it for the
     future generations and to ensure good quality
     of     life        that      Parliament           enacted         the     anti-
     pollution laws, namely, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_28">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_29">Air Act</a>
     and     the       <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_30">Environment             (Protection)         Act</a>,       1986.
     <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_31">These Act</a>s and Rules framed and notification
     issued           thereunder         contain        provisions             which
     prohibit           and/or         regulate        certain         activities
     with        a     view       to    protect        and        preserve        the
     environment. When a law is enacted containing
     some provisions which prohibit certain types of
     activities, then, it is of utmost importance
     that        such     legal         provisions          are     effectively
     enforced. If a law is enacted but is not being
     voluntarily              obeyed,          then,        it     has       to    be
     enforced. Otherwise, infringement of law, which
     is actively or passively condoned for personal
     gain, will be encouraged which will in turn lead
     to a lawless society. Violation of antipollution
     laws not only adversely affects the existing

condition         precedent              and      until       such         environmental

clearance        was        granted,        any      development           of     land        or

creation of infrastructural facilities on the land were

unauthorized.              Similarly, the Hon'ble the Division Bench

on page No.147 of the judgment held that:-

               foundation goes then the superstructure would
               fall. In the present case also, once we hold
               that         the     construction             in     the      absence          of

of the Court to para-29 of the said judgment.                           By virtue

of the direction contained therein, it is obligatory on

the part of the State Government to ask for environmental

clearance     from        MoEF    before      granting        lease     or    minor

minerals including their renewal even for an area of less

than 5 hectares.

<p id="p_114">
8.5          Learned Advocate General then invited attention

of the Court to the fact that it is after the aforesaid

judgment [in the case of Deepak Kumar (supra)] an Office

Memorandum      dated       18.05.2012       is     issued    providing       that,

"all mining projects of minor minerals including their

renewal,     irrespective         of   the     size    of    the    lease     would

henceforth        require         prior      environmental            clearance".

Learned Advocate General submitted that in view of this

Office Memorandum, the State Government ought to have

granted leases and/or renewal of leases, irrespective of

the   size     of        lease,   only     after      insisting        for    prior

environmental clearance.

permitted to be carried on without taking EC either from

MoEF/SEIAA, irrespective of the size, as the case may

be".     Learned Advocate General fairly submitted that may

be because it takes time to get instructions percolated

at the level of the executing machinery and may be on

account     of      non-efficient         coordination            that    leases       may

have been granted or renewed ever after 26.09.2013.                                    But

Court is of the opinion that, 'rival submissions' may not

be the correct terminology because the submissions are

more in the nature of 'assistance to the Court to pass

appropriate orders in the matter' because the learned

Senior Advocate for the petitioner and learned Advocate

General appearing for the State shared the same anxiety

as     that    of     the     Court     and      that   is,        'protection      of

environment'.          (emphasis supplied).


10.1           This Court is of the opinion that the field is

covered by the directions issued by the Hon'ble the Apex

Court    in     its        various    pronouncements          in    such       similar

matters.        The question in the present matter is covered

is of the considered opinion that these directions are

required to be complied with by the State Government in

its letter and spirit.                   That being so, in the matter of

grant and /or renewal of lease, even in cases wherein

area     of     lease       is     less       than       5    hectares,       the      State

Government has to insist for environmental clearance from

grave but also multi-facet.                        There is a list produced on

the record of this case along with affidavit of one Shri

Sanjay        Vrajvihari         Dave,        Commissioner            of    Geology      and

Mining, affirmed 30.11.2013.                         In the said list, it is

mentioned that there are as many as 2887 leases operating

in the State of Gujarat within the periphery of 5 km. from

Sanctuary, National Park, Conservation Forest, Protected

Forest and Reserved Forest. (emphasis supplied).


11.1           This        Court    is        of     the      opinion       that      utmost

concerned        is        required        to       be       shown     by     the      State

authorities        so      are     as   these        leases      are       concerned     and

therefore, this Court is of the opinion that excavation

activities        in       these    areas          (leases)     should        be      stopped

immediately.            The State is hereby directed to see that

excavation        activities            are        stopped      and        possession      is

resumed by the State Government forthwith.                                    It is made

clear that any grant of lease in these areas should be

only   in   accordance        with    the    directions        given       by    the

Hon'ble the Apex Court, i.e. "... after having obtained

environmental clearance from the concerned authority (for

the present, in absence of SEACs and SEIAA, it is MoEF to

consider and grant environmental clearance).                          (emphasis

supplied)


11.2         The startling fact which has come to the notice

of this Court during the hearing of this matter is that

in the State of Gujarat, all leases are granted without

undertaking the exercise of auction.                     It is a settled law

that whenever any such lease is to be granted, the same

should be only and only by way of auction and not in the

manner in which it is granted so far.
</p>
<p id="p_143">
</p><p id="p_144">             Any excuse for not adhering to the exercise of

auction will not be acceptable by the Court of law and it

is expected from the State Government that the exercise

of   auction      will   be   made    as    vide     as    possible        and   as

transparent as possible.             For that, the State Government

may decide a suitable course of action and if required,

due weightage may be given to the latest technology like

''E-Tendering', etc., but the lease should be granted

only by way of auction.

11.3         So    far   as   grant    of        lease    or   even   for       that

reason renewal of lease after the order of the Hon'ble

the Apex Court dated 27.02.2012 in the case of Deepak

Kumar (supra) is concerned, the same illegal and also

contemptuous and therefore, it is deemed proper to direct

and accordingly it is directed that all leased operating

in the State of Gujarat either granted or renewed after

27.02.2012 must be discontinued and possession of the land

in    which    such        leases    operate       be    resumed       by    the    State

Government.         Once this is done, it will be open for the

State Government to grant lease for these areas afresh

only by way of auction.                     While auctioning, it be made

clear    in    the         auction    notice      that        leaseholder      will   be

allowed       to    operate      only       and        only    after    he     produces

environmental clearance before the Government.                                    Besides

that, as set out in Clause-(E) of para-4 of the affidavit

of Yogesh Bhalchandrabhai Raval, Geologist, affirmed on

12.02.2014 that, in all the auction notices, it will be

clearly mentioned that "it will be the responsibility of

the     successful           bidder      to     obtain         prior        Environment

Clearance and for that purpose, the State Authorities

will not be responsible in any manner and that even after

auction, activities will be allowed to be undertaken only

after the grant of Environment Clearance".                                    (emphasis

District of Patan, it is stated there are as many as 12

leases operation.               Interesting thing with regard to these

leases      is        that      these     leases         are     granted     for   the

unidentified land.               The land is not identifiable because

there 'no survey number is mentioned'.                            Only the name of

River is mentioned.                  Assuming that there is no survey

number for the riverbed then some other method ought to

have been employed to ascertain the identification of the

land.     Five of them are in riverbed of River 'Saraswati',

sic of them are in the riverbed of River 'Banas' and one

is in the riverbed of River 'Pushpav'.                                 The grant of

lease without mentioning survey number or any other mode

of identification of the land seems to be a 'magical

trick'.      In such circumstances, it is necessary that these

leases     should          be    cancelled        by      the    State     Government

forthwith, irrespective of the fact as to when such leases

were granted or renewed.                 (emphasis supplied).

possession be resumed by the State Government.                              The State

13.1          Learned      Senior      Advocate           for        the    petitioner

</pre><p id="p_153">invited attention of the Court to the fact that there are

certain cases, e.g. in the case of Prakash Quarry Works,

wherein date of grant of lease is 08.02.1985 and date of

last renewal is 03.01.2005 and the period for which it is

renewed is 10 years.            To take care of such leases and such

renewals, it is directed that all the leases in the State

of    Gujarat,     which   do    not     find        place      in    the    aforesaid

direction, should come to an end on the expiry of period

of 6 (six) months from today and the lease area be resumed

by the State Government.               Once that is done, it will be

obligatory on the part of the State Government to award

the    same      after     following          the         procedure         prescribed

hereinabove,        i.e.   by    auction            and    with       insistence      of

environmental clearance.            (emphasis supplied).

Raval,    Geologist,       below       Clause-(E)           of       para-4,     it   is

mentioned that, "However, in the event of the auction

being not feasible, provisions laid down under rules 6 to

10 of the Concession Rules, will be followed for the

grant of Quarry Leases".

circumstances in which auction will not be feasible.                                   If

the auction is not feasible, why there should be anxiety

on the part of the State Government to grant lease in

such area by taking recourse to Rules 6 to 10 of the

Concession Rules.                  The tenor of the aforesaid sub-para

seems to be that the State Government is keen on seeking

that the said is excavated from the area where auction is

not feasible.              It is a matter within the domain of common

understanding that whenever there will be demand of any

commodity like sand, there will be willing persons to

supply the same and those willing persons will obtain the

said by getting a lease for excavation.                               Once there are

willing      persons         to     obtain      lease,         'auction'      will     be

feasible.         Therefore, submission based on the aforesaid

sub-para       by     the      learned       Advocate          General       cannot    be

accepted and is discarded.                    In light of this discussion,

it is made mandatory for the State Government to grant

lease by auction and to insist for environmental clearance

in every single case.                (emphasis supplied).

Bureaucrats         may      not     make     it       clear     at    the    time    of

bidder will be refundable, in the event he is not able to

obtain environmental clearance.                        If that happens then it

will discourage people to come forward to participate in

auction.        The       learned      Advocate            for     the    petitioner

requested that the Court may issue general direction to

the State Government to clarify this aspect at the time of

auctioning.       Besides that, it may also be directed that

auctioning     should       take     place          only    after        giving   wide

publicity and it deemed proper, permitting auction through

electronic means like on-line or 'E' tendering.                            (emphasis

supplied).

accordingly.        In addition to that, it will also be in

fitness of things if the State Government makes payable a

fixed percentage of the tender amount at an initial state.

Remaining     amount        be     made       payable            after     furnishing

environmental           clearance,      after         which        permission      to

excavate be granted.          (emphasis supplied).

rightly pointed out that out of the compilation submitted

by the State running, into about 1000 pages, not in one

case, the State is able to point out that the lease was

granted by 'auction'.               Learned Senior Advocate for the

into huge monetary loss to the State Government-Public

Exchequer.      Taking into consideration the submission of
