<p id="p_1">       Petitioner is the Managing Partner of a Dairy Farm. According to the

petitioner, although he has all the licences, going by the averments in para 2

of the writ petition itself, the consent issued by the Pollution Control Board

was valid only upto 2005. It is stated that since then there has been various

inspections and on two occasions, the petitioner also has approached this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.     As at present, the position is that, following the hearing that was

conducted pursuant to Ext.P7 judgment, the Board issued Ext.P11, a direction

under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Section 33</a> A of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 requiring the petitioner to close the factory. Aggrieved by Ext.P11,

petitioner filed Ext.P12 appeal before the 6th respondent and the said appeal

is pending, but however, without any interim orders.

</p><p id="p_3">       3.     In the meantime, records show that there were certain

complaints and Ext.P15 shows that there has been a further inspection on

22/1/2009. Noticing that, despite having no consent issued by the Board and

ignoring Ext.P11, the unit was functioning, the Board issued Ext.P15,

direction under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_3">Section 33A</a> of the Act, requiring the 5th respondent to

disconnect the supply of electricity to the Dairy Farm.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.    Counsel submits that Ext.P12 appeal filed against Ext.P11, is

scheduled to be heard by the 6th respondent on 5/2/2009 and that in the

meanwhile, status quo as regards supply of power should be maintained.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.    In so far as the continuance of power supply is concerned, the

disconnection is ordered by Ext.P15 and the validity of Ext.P15 has to be

judged on the facts as stated in Ext.P15 itself. It is seen from the said order

that the unit was ordered to be closed by Ext.P11 dated 18/12/2008.

Subsequently, an inspection was conducted on 22/1/2009 and the unit was

found to be functioning. It was in these circumstances the said direction

has been issued. Admittedly, the unit does not have a consent issued in its

favour since 2006.    The functioning of the unit is also admitted by the

petitioner and the details of the transaction as seen from Ext.P14 also

supports this conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.    Resultantly, it can be seen that since 2006, the unit has been

functioning without consent and that despite Ext.P11 order of closure issued

on 18/12/2008, unit continued to function even on 22/1/2009, when the

inspection was conducted. If that be so, Ext.P15 order cannot be faulted.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.    However, having regard to the fact that Ext.P12 appeal filed by

the petitioner against Ext.P11 order is pending and that the mater is now

scheduled to be heard on 5/2/2009, I direct the 6th respondent to hear the

appeal and dispose of the matter without any delay.

</p><p id="p_8">     Writ petition is disposed of as above.
