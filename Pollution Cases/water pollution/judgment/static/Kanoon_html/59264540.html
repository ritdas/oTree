<p id="p_1">1.        This is an Application filed by Project Proponent,

raising preliminary objection regarding maintainability of

Main Application (Application No.13 of 2014), on the

ground that said Application is barred by Limitation as

well Applicant has no locus to file it, and hence the same

is liable to be dismissed. Secondly, that Original Applicant

(Amit Maru) is not an 'aggrieved person' and, therefore,

such Application under Section 14(1) (2) read with



                                                                              Page 3
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_1">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_2">18</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,

2010, is not maintainable at his behest.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.        The Project Proponent (M/s Windosor Reality Pvt

Ltd), has come out with a case that the plans for

construction of commercial building were issued by the

Planning Authority on 7.7.1993. The project work was

started long back. The construction work was going on for

about a period almost over and above 8/10 years. The

Project Proponent alleges that the building having 28

floors, 3 level podium and 2 voids, in total 33 floors, have

been constructed and that by itself must be deemed to be

a notice to the Applicant. So, it is not open for the

Applicant now to raise such a dispute under false and

frivolous allegations that 'cause of action' to file the

Application has arisen first on 23rd October, 2013. The

Applicant cannot raise such a dispute at a belated stage

by giving goby to the specific provisions of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_3">Section 14</a> (3)

read with <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_4">Section 18</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,

2010. The Hon'ble Bombay High Court and Hon'ble

Supreme Court interpreted the special enactments like the

<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_5">Arbitration Act</a>, 1998, the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_6">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 and held

that where a statute prescribes shorter period of limitation

and different scheme of limitation is provided under such

a Statute, the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_7">Limitation Act</a>, 1963, are

excluded and the Tribunal must apply the period of


                                                       Page 4
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 limitation as prescribed under the special enactment while

exercising its powers. So, when the special provision is set

out under Section 14(3) of the NGT Act, then time cannot

be extended any more by Application of <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of the

Limitation Act, 1963, or any such analogues provision.

</p><p id="p_3">3.        The jurisdiction exercised by the NGT is not

equivalent to writ jurisdiction available to the Hon'ble

High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and as

such declaratory relief sought by the original                       Applicant

(Amit Maru) cannot be granted since he is not 'aggrieved

person'         as      such        and        hence,   cannot   maintain    the

Application for want of locus standi. For this reason also,

the Application is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_4">4.        The Project Proponent would submit that the plans

of the construction were sanctioned by the Planning

Authority on 7.7.1993 and the construction work was

undertaken before about ten (10) years of filing of the

Application. It is stated that the construction work of the

building was very much going on within sight of the

Applicant since he is resident of nearby locality and could

have knowledge of the same. It is stated that the

Application is filed with ill-motive to pressurize the Project

Proponent in order to shell out certain amount without

any reason. In other words, it is stated that the




                                                                            Page 5
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 Application is filed with a view to blackmail the Project

Proponent or for some other consideration.

</p><p id="p_5">5.        According              to      the         Respondent     No.9,      (Project

Proponent) the 'cause of action' 'first arose' on 7.7.1993,

when the plans for construction of commercial building

were sanctioned by Municipal Corporation of Greater

Mumbai. The time cannot be extended by the Tribunal

beyond the prescribed period, as provided under <a href="/doc/86312185/" id="a_10">Section

14(3)</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. It is

alleged that the Applicant without having any locus standi

has filed the Application by way of making fishing inquiry

in the matter. On these premises, the Respondent No.9

sought dismissal of the Main Application.

</p><p id="p_6">6.          The        Original            Applicant         resisted    the     Misc.

Application. On behalf of the original Applicant, written

submission is filed, in addition to the oral arguments. It is

contended that the concept of 'limitation' is alien to the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment                (Protection)              Act</a>,   1986.   It   is    further

contended that the violation of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment (Protection)

Act</a>, 1986, can be dealt with at any point of time by giving

suitable directions. It is further averred that <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_13">Section 5</a> of

the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, may be invoked

by the competent Authority, as and when violation of the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_14">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, is brought to the

notice of the competent Authority. According to the


                                                                                  Page 6
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 original          Applicant,             the         construction     work       of      the

Respondent No.9, is carried out in violation of the Coastal

Regulation Zone (CRZ), Notification, 2011, as well as the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_15">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. The MCZMA has

taken due action on basis of the complaint made by him

on 23rd October, 2013, against gross violation of the CRZ

Notification, 2011, by the Respondent No.9. The original

Applicant would submit that view taken by the Hon'ble

Principal Bench, New Delhi, in Goa Foundation vs

Secretary,              MoEF           and           ors    (MA     No.49/2013            in

Application No.26/2012), is applicable to the facts of

present case. It is further contended that the Application

involves 'substantial question, relating to environment'

and       first      'cause         of     action'         challenging      illegality    of

construction work, first arose when legality of such

construction work came to the notice of the Applicant.

According            to      the         Applicant,          mere    fact     that       the

construction is of large scale and the building is of

substantial height, will not give due notice about legality

of the construction to any common man. The Applicant

alleges that when the Developer makes construction in the

private premises, concealing such activity from public

eyes, by surrounding the site by steel sheets/shutters and

get guarded it around the clock, and there is no access for

inspection of the property nor any information is available


                                                                                      Page 7
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 about violation of Law. It is further stated that view taken

by the Hon'ble Principal Bench in 'J. Mehta vs Union of

India and ors' (Misc Application Nos.507,595,644,649 of

2013, in Application No.88/2013), is applicable to the

facts of the present case. In view of such submissions, the

original         Applicant             sought         dismissal      of    the     Misc.

Application, whereby preliminary objections are raised by

the Respondent No.9 (Developer).
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.        We have heard learned counsel for contesting

parties. We have also perused the written submissions

filed by them. We have carefully gone through the case

laws cited by them.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.        In      view       of     these        rival   submissions,           following

questions need to be answered:
</p>
<p id="p_9">          i)        Whether the Original Application is

                    maintainable at the instance of the

                    Applicant or liable to be dismissed,

                    due to absence of locus standi?
</p>
<p id="p_10">            ii) Whether the Original Application is

                   barred by Limitation?
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.        As far as question of locus standi is concerned, the

Respondent              No.9,         would          submit   that        the    original

Applicant has filed the Application only with a view to seek

fishing inquiry in the matter, without bonafides. The

averments made by the Respondent No.9, may be


                                                                                    Page 8
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 reproduced for the purpose of understanding the main

plank of submissions in this behalf. They are:

</p><p id="p_12">            "The Respondent No.9 states that the Applicant has no locus

   standi to file the present Application as this Tribunal cannot deal with

   the matters as if it is public interest litigation. The Applicant is not

   affected by any of the acts of the Respondent No.9, while carrying out

   the construction activities on the said property and hence, he is not a

   person aggrieved within the meaning of <a href="/doc/192670971/" id="a_16">Section 18</a> of the said Act and

   hence has no locus to file the same. This Hon'ble Tribunal is a creation

   of statute for adjudicating dispute specifically provided under the said

   Act and cannot and does not have the power of constitutional Courts

   exercising their powers under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of

   India. The Respondent No.9 therefore, states that the Applicant is not

   having any locus to file the present Application."

</p><p id="p_13">10.       Perusal of the original Application, reveals that

grievance of the original Applicant is that the impugned

construction activity is carried out in violation of CRZ

Notification, 2011. Not only that but the competent

Authority issued stop work order of which copy is annexed

along with the Application. The original Applicant may not

be personally affected, being a neighbor or resident of very

same locality. Still, however, the original Applicant may

demonstrate as to how he has interest in the environment

of maintaining the coastal stretches of Mumbai. The

violation of CRZ Notification, 2011, if at all is found to

have been done by the Respondent No.9 that would give

certain          reasons           to       the      Applicant   to   raise    the


                                                                              Page 9
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 environmental issues. He may not have personal cause of

action. However, as a Member of the society, he may

agitate the environmental issues about violation of the

Laws like CRZ, in the interest of environment. At this

juncture, it is not necessary to go into the details of merits

of the Application. However, from the affidavit of Shri.

Raju Vasave, In-charge Regional officer of the MPCB, it

appears that the prosecution is initiated against the

Respondent No.9, under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_17">Section 15</a> of the Environment

(Protection) Act, 1986, read with Environment Impact

Assessment (EIA) Notification,2006. So also the affidavit of

Ajay Fulmali filed on behalf of the Respondent Nos.3 and

4, shows that the impugned construction work prima facie

is    not       in     keeping           with        the   environmental   norms.

Considering the prima facie material available on record, it

is difficult to say that the Application is totally bereft of

any reason and without locus standi.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11.       Now, the term 'environment' has to be interpreted

liberally. The environmental dispute cannot be cribbed,

cabined or put in the small compass of 'personal disputes'

or 'property disputes' or "disputed rights between two

groups" or "individual rights". The damage caused to

environment has to be looked from holistic angle. Any

person may raise environmental dispute irrespective of his

being personally affected due to the act of wrong


                                                                            Page 10
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 doer/polluter or violater of environmental Law/Norms.

The only barrier is that such a person shall not file the

Application with malafide intention. Secondly, he shall not

be totally alien. In other words, if it is demonstrated that

the Applicant is a person interested in protection of

environment, or at least restitution of environment, then

prima facie,              he      has       locus standi to         maintain      the

Application.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.       We may reproduce, for the purpose of ready

 reference, <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_18">Section 14</a> (1) and (2) of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_19">National Green

 Tribunal Act</a>, 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_16">          14. Tribunal to settle the dispute:-
</p>
<p id="p_17">          (1) The Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction over all civil

          cases       where       a    substantial   question   relating   to

          environment (including enforcement of any legal right

          relating to environment), is involved and such question

          arises out of the implementation of the enactments

          specified in Schedule I.
</p>
<p id="p_18">          (2) The Tribunal shall hear the disputes arising from the

          questions referred to in sub section (1) and settle such

          disputes and pass order thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_19">13.       On behalf of the Respondent No.9, it is argued that

the Application cannot be termed as 'person aggrieved', so

as to entertain the Application. We may point out that the

expression 'person aggrieved' is used only in context of

Section 16 of the NGT Act, 2010. Obviously, when any

Appeal is required to be filed, then it has to be filed by a

                                                                                Page 11
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 'person aggrieved'. But, an Application can be entertained

at the behest of any person, who is interested in

protection, restitution or otherwise securing maintenance

of environment. In any case, mere technical approach in

such a case will not be appropriate. The person even

though he has a legal grievance pertaining to probable

adverse impact on environment, or probable adverse

impact on environment, is entitled to approach the

Tribunal, with such an Application, inasmuch as <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_20">Section

14</a> (1) (2) of the NGT Act, 2010 will have to be read along

with <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_21">Section 15</a> and Section 20 of the NGT Act, 2010.

He/she will come within ambit of <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_22">Section 2(1)</a> (j) of the

NGT Act, 2010. In our opinion, protection of environment,

is related to the fundamental right guaranteed under

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_23">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and as such, anyone who

has      bonafide           intention           to   protect   environment     can

approach the Tribunal for the purpose of protection of

such right.
</p>
<p id="p_20">14.       In our opinion, prima facie, excessive construction

without having EC, does amount to violation of the

Environmental norms, at least, of the procedure to follow

the Environmental norms. <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_24">Section 14(1)</a> of the National

Green Tribunal Act, 2010, provides jurisdiction to the

Tribunal to deal with 'substantial questions relating to

environment' which also has to be read with <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_25">Section 20</a> of


                                                                             Page 12
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, even anticipated

action ought to be considered as 'substantial question

relating to environment'. In the present case, without EC

beyond           permissible               limits,      undertaking      of     huge

construction involves environmental issues like use of

Advocate invited our attention to the observations in case

of "Rana Sen Gupta vs (1) Union of India (2) State of West

Bengal (3) M/s Rashmi metaliks Ltd (4) West Bengal

Pollution Control Board" (Appeal No.54/2012). True, in the

given case the Appellant was held to be a person having

no locus standi to prefer the Appeal. It was held that "the

Appellant was not the 'aggrieved person' to challenge the order,

which was impugned before the NGT (Principal Bench)".

However, the said case can be distinguished on the facts.

Appellant Rana Sen Gupta was a person residing in

village, which was allegedly impacted on account of so

called activity. The allegations basically were that Rana
                                                                                Page 13
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
 Sen Gupta was a public spirited citizen. It was noticed,

however, that there was absolutely no tangible material to

start such a proclaimed status by Rana Sen Gupta. It was

also noted that his previous Appeal No.32/2011, had been

dismissed. Therefore, his locus standi was found to be

dubious. Another case relied upon by the Respondent

No.9, is of '<a href="/doc/101987865/" id="a_28">Ankur vs Maharashtra State Environment

Impact Assessment Authority' (Application No</a>.32/2012).

The facts of that case are also on different footings. The

Applicant alleged in the said Application that the Project

Proponent had encroached upon the agricultural field of

the farmers and other common land of the village. So

called encroachment was in respect of agricultural land

situated at village Kalane (district Sindhudurg), whereas,

the Applicant's address was of Pen (district Raigad). Both

these two (2) places were at a distance of 300/400 km

away from each other. There was material on record to

show that the Application was ill-motivated. Nothing of

that sort is found on record of the present case.

considered on basis of prima facie material.

became so notorious that any prudent person could have

noticed the same, being a sky rise construction. What the

Applicant           alleges         in     the       present   case   is    that     the

not known due to lack of information in respect of original

commercial building having 28 floors, 3 level podium, 2

voids, in all 33 floors and over a period of 8/10 years is

constructed, which itself could be treated as deemed

notice to the Applicant and, therefore, it is not open to

him now to raise such a dispute, which is nothing but

proclamation of omission and an attempt to extract easy

money from the Respondent. The Respondent No.9,

therefore urges to dismiss the main Application on the

ground that the Application is not maintainable for want

of locus standi. It is contended that view taken by Hon'ble

Principal Bench in "<a href="/doc/180993556/" id="a_33">Goa Foundation vs Union of India</a>"

may be deviated from by This Bench inasmuch as it is not

a binding precedent to be followed by this Bench. We do

not agree. Whether it is a binding precedent or not is not

the question which needs to be addressed at this juncture.

It is well settled principle that Judgment of a co-ordinate

Bench must be duly respected by another Bench. This

basic jurisprudential discipline shall be maintained to

follow principle of 'stair desists'. Hence, we are unable to

accept         the      contention             of    learned   Counsel   for     the

strenuously argued that the Application is barred by

limitation, in view of the fact that 'cause of action' for filing

of the Application 'first arose' on 7.7.1993, when plans for

construction of commercial building were sanctioned by

the MCGM. The Respondent No.9, states that after twenty

(20) years from the date of sanctioning the plan, now,

filing of such Application will open up unwarranted

issues, therefore the Application is totally misconceived.

The Respondent No.9, seeks to rely on the wording of

<a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_36">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_37">15</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,

provided there under. Learned counsel for the Respondent

 the limitation clause and, therefore, there will be no scope

for extension of limitation. It is argued that "the plain and

simple language of Section 14(3) of the NGT Act, i.e.

"unless it is made within a period of six months from the

date, on which the cause of action for such dispute first

arose", negates the principle of continuing cause of action.

If the plea of continuing cause of action is accepted within

the limitation, the statute would be eschewed of the

important and vital words "first arose".

Bhargav &amp; Ors. V. MoEF &amp; Ors" [Application No</a>.11 of

The observations in relevant paragraphs of the said
Judgment are as below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "23. From the very reading, it would be quite clear that the
          Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases only where a
          substantial question relating to the environment including
          enforcement of any legal right related to environment is
          involved and also the said substantial question should
          also arise out of the implementation and is included in one
          of the seven enactments specified under the Schedule - I.
          Even, if the applicant is able to satisfy the above
          requisites, the Tribunal can adjudicate the disputes only if
          it is made within a period of six months from the date on
          which the cause of action in such dispute first arose and
          the Tribunal for sufficient cause can condone the delay for
          a period not exceeding 60 days in making the application.</blockquote><p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">          24. Under <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_40">Section 15</a> of the Act, an application for relief
          and compensation to the victims of pollution and other
          environmental damage under the enactments specified in
          Schedule-I or for restitution of the property damage or for
          restitution of environment for such area or areas, the
          applicant could be filed within a period of five years from
          the date of which the cause of action for such

                                                                         Page 18
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
           compensation or reliefs first arose. Also, if sufficient cause
          was shown, the Tribunal is empowered to condone the
          delay for a period not exceeding 60 days. Significant it is
          to note that the expression "cause of action for such
          dispute first arose" is employed. By employing the above
          expression, the legislative intent indicating that the period
          of limitation would commence only from the date on which
          the first event constituting the dispute arose, is explicit.
          This is not only an indication but also the caution that the
          later dates on which subsequent events arose should not
          be taken into account for computing the period of
          limitation.
</p><p id="p_31">          28. Traite law it is that the special law of limitation, in any
          given enactment, will always exclude the general law of
          limitation. The NGT Act, 2010, a special enactment
          specifically provides period of limitation under <a href="/doc/139274824/" id="a_41">Section
          14(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/56252852/" id="a_42">15(3)</a>, as stated supra. The Principal Bench,
          NGT has already held in Jesurethinam &amp; Ors Vs. Ministry
          of Environment, Union of India &amp;Ors, reported in 2012 (2)
          FLT 811 NGT that, when a specific provision for limitation
          is provided under the special statute, the general
          provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_43">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 are inapplicable.
          Hence, the Tribunal is afraid whether the theory of
          continuing cause of action can be made applicable to the
          present factual position of the case for which the specific
          period of limitation is available under the NGT Act, 2010.
</p><p id="p_32">          30. A person who wishes to invoke the jurisdiction of the
          Tribunal or Court has to be vigilant and conscious of his
          rights and should not let the time to go by not taking
          appropriate steps. It is true that the provisions of law of
          limitation have to be construed liberally but the same
          cannot be applied to the present facts of the case for the
          reasons stated above. It is true that the Tribunal must
          adopt a practical approach which is in consonance with
          the provisions of the Act providing limitation. In the instant
          case, the period of limitation has begun to run long back.
          The period of limitation once commences operating; it
          does not stop but continues to operate with its rigour. An
          interpretation accepting the continuing cause of action
          would frustrate the very object of the Act and the purpose

                                                                            Page 19
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
           of prescription of limitation. In the instant case, it is
          contended by the respondent project proponent that
          nearly 600 crores have been spent and more than 50% of
          the work is over, hence, the project proponent who
          obtained the environmental clearance in the year 1986
          and has completed not less than 50% of the work by
          spending hundreds crores of rupees would be thrown to
          jeopardising his project at the long lapse of years.
          Needless to say, if it is allowed, it would be against the
          very intent of the law. Even it may be true that the
          applicants are aggrieved persons and it may even be true
          that there was violations of provisions of law but action
          should have been initiated within the prescribed period of
          limitation. In view of all the above, it can be well stated
          that the contentions put forth by the Learned Counsel for
          the applicants that the application was within time have to
          be rejected."
</p><p id="p_33"> 22.             In case of "Aradhana Bhargava" (Supra) the

 challenge was to EC. That was an Appeal under Section

 16 of the NGT Act, 2010. Herein, the challenge is mainly

 to the violations of the EC conditions. Both these matters

 are on different footings. We do not find parallels between

 them. Hence, Judgment in "Aradhana Bhargava" case is

 not applicable to the facts of the present case.

 in 'Nikunj Developers &amp; anr vs State of Maharashtra

 Environment Department and Ors' (MA No.347/2012,

         days from the date of communication of the order. That is,
         what an applicant is required to ensure before the appeal is
         heard on merits. However, the Tribunal has been vested with
         the jurisdiction to entertain the appeal which is filed after 30
         days from the date of communication of an order. This power
         to condone the delay has a clear inbuilt limitation as it ceases
         to exist if the appeal is filed in excess of 60 days, beyond the
         prescribed period of limitation of 30 days from the date of
         communication of such order. To put it simply, once the period
         of 90 days lapses from the date of communication of the order,
         the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay. The
         language of the provision is clear and explicit. It admits of no
         ambiguity and the legislative intent that Tribunal should not
         and cannot condone the delay in excess of 90 days in all, is
         clear from the plain language of the provision.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         20. As stated in the cases Hiralal RatanLal and India Houses
         (supra) the period of limitation statutorily prescribed, has to be
         strictly adhered to and cannot be relaxed and or departed
         from, on equitable consideration. Further, in construing a
         statutory provision, the first and the foremost rule of
         construction is that of literary construction. We do not see any
         reason to expand the scope of the provision and interpret the
         proviso to <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_44">Section 16</a> in the manner that Tribunal can be
         vested with the power of condoning the delay beyond 90 days.
         Such interpretation would be contrary to the specific language
         of the Section and would defeat the very legislative intent and
         object behind this provision. "

<p id="p_35">24.           So far as the question of limitation is concerned,

we will have to examine the averments of the Applicant.

The averments may or may not be proved in final analysis.

Still,      however,            it     cannot        be   overlooked   that     the

construction activity is stopped by the MCGM, after the

complaint was filed by the Applicant, as per order dated

January 6th, 2014. According to him, the construction

                                                                              Page 21

competent authority ought to have issued directions

under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_45">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

He submits that since the competent authority, did not

give any EC and the Respondent No.9, did not obtain any

permission from the MCZMA, for impugned construction

for the project in question, illegal construction is ongoing

activity, and can be challenged, because the 'cause of

action' is still continuing.                         He alleges that when he got

knowledge that the impugned construction was being

carried out without permission of the statutory authority,

though it falls in CRZ-I, area, he immediately filed

complaint dated 23rd October, 2013, but no action was

initiated by the MCZMA. It is for such a reason that he

filed the Application and claims that it is within limitation.

</p><p id="p_36">25.         It may be stated that originally, the MCZMA

granted permission for the construction of commercial

building in 1993. The sanction certificate was issued on

18.9.1997. In or about 2000, the Respondent No.9, came

into possession of land in question. On 26th December,

2001, the plans for residential building were approved by

the MCGM. In October, 2005, development rights were

issued for development of the property. The Respondent

No.9, obtained conveyance of the entire land and his name

was       mutated            in      the      Property      Register   Card.    The

 construction activity, no doubt, started long back. But the

real question is whether the conditions for continuation of

construction activity were followed by the Respondent

No.9?. The Respondent No.9, relied upon the case of

"Munnilal Girijanand v. State and others" (Application No.

45/2014). It was a case of Slum Rehabilitation Area (SRA)

project which had commenced in 2002, when it was not

governed by EIA Notification, 2006. The facts of that case

are of altogether different from the present case. Secondly,

it was found that the Applicants (Munnilal and others)

were litigating before different Forums, including the City

Civil Court, Hon'ble High Court and Apex Court                                in

respect of identical issue, before filing of the Application in

the Tribunal under Section 14 of the NGT Act, 2010. So, it

was a case of going from one Court to another for the

same the same kind of relief. In "J. Mehta vs Union of

India and Ors" (M.A.Nos.507,509,644 and 649/2013,

in Application No.88/2013) of the National Green

Tribunal (PB), considered the question of limitation in

following way:

          contend that since they have been flouting with impunity,
          the law, the terms and conditions of the EC for long, and

           Tribunal with clean hands and disclosed complete details,
          which were           exclusively within    their knowledge   and
          possession. In the normal course of business, Respondent
          No. 9 would have first entered into agreements with other
          persons for providing these premises, either on sale or
          lease, as the case may be. Then such buyers/lessees
          would start making constructional changes and provide
          infrastructure necessary for using the parking and services
          area for commercial purposes. Then alone, such persons
          would have started using the premises for such purposes.
          All these facts have been withheld by Respondent No. 9.
          Therefore, the Tribunal would be entitled to draw adverse
          inference against Respondent No. 9 in that behalf. In any
          case, Respondent No. 9 and other private respondents
          have converted the user of the premises contrary to the
          specified purpose and in violation of law and terms and
          conditions of the EC. Thus, even such an approach would
          support the case of the applicant and in any case the
          respondents cannot be permitted to take advantage of their
          own wrong or default.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          54. The cause of action is not restricted to 'in personam' but
          is an action available to any person in terms of Section 14
          of the NGT Act. It empowers any person aggrieved to raise
          a substantial question relating to environment including
          enforcement of any legal right relating thereto. Every citizen

          The applicant has been able to establish that he first came
          to know about the misuser and change of user, particularly
          with regard to adverse environmental impact, only in the
          middle of December, 2012 and immediately thereafter, he

          in its composite form, right to a plaintiff against the
          defendant to approach a court or Tribunal for a legal
          remedy or redressed of his grievance. Thus, the existence
          of a legal remedy to the plaintiff is a sine qua non for an
          actionable cause of action. In view of the above reasoning,
          we have no hesitation in concluding that the present
          application is not barred by time.
</p>
<p id="p_41">          56. Lastly but most importantly, now we have to deal with
          the question as to whether the breach of conditions of EC is
          likely to cause environmental and health hazards or not.
          We have already held that Respondent No. 9 has not only
          violated the specific terms and conditions of the EC dated
          27th November, 2006 but has also miserably failed to
          submit an application for reappraisal of the project.
          Furthermore, the said Respondent No. 9 has committed
          breach of the bye laws, fire safety measures, Corporation
          laws, etc. All the public authorities have specifically taken
          the stand that at no point of time, did they accord any
          permission or sanction for conversion of the parking area
          for commercial purposes and its misuser or unauthorized
          construction. In fact, according to them, they have taken
          appropriate steps against Respondent No. 9 in accordance
          with law. We have already noticed that this Tribunal is not
          concerned with the violations and breaches committed by
          Respondent No. 9 with regard to other laws in force but for
          environmental laws in terms of Schedule I to the NGT Act
          and its adverse impact on environment and public health.

</p><p id="p_42">          57. It has come on record that approximately 59 of
          commercial area has been increased by such unauthorized
          conversion and misuser. The terms and conditions of the EC
          have specifically provided that in the event of any change in
          the scope of the project, Respondent No.9 was expected to
          take steps for reappraisal of the project and take fresh EC,
          which admittedly, has not been done by Respondent No. 9
          despite lapse of considerable time. These violations would
          consequently have a direct impact on traffic congestion,
          ambient air quality, contamination of underground water,
          sewage disposal and municipal solid waste disposal besides

                                                                          Page 25
(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
           other adverse impact on population density in the area. With
          the significant change of commercial area by 59, the EC
          itself would be substantially affected and it would be for the
          authorities concerned to examine whether the EC can be
          continued or requires to be recalled. There is a drastic
          change in PSY with change in sq.ft. area as the EC was not
          intended for such area to which Respondent No. 9 has now
          expanded its activity. Furthermore, assessment of water
          requirement is based upon the number of users and other
          services in the area and this substantial change has
          fundamentally been altered and would have drastic and
          adverse effects on all these aspects. The EIA Report
          submitted by Respondent No. 9 itself shows that these are
          the various aspects, the variation of which is bound to alter
          the entire basis for grant of the EC. For instance, the parking
          for 1772 cars was to be provided in the project in terms of
          EIA report. For this purpose, the basement, lower ground
          floor in one block and the multi-level car parking in the Block
          2P had been provided. Major part of this area had been
          converted and used by Respondent No. 9 and other private
          respondents for commercial purposes. It is not even the case
          of Respondent No. 9 that the required number of cars can be
          parked in that building. The cars which could have been
          parked in the building now would have to be parked on the
          public roads/places leading to lowering the road capacity
          resulting in lowering the average speed of the vehicle,
          consequently increasing the air pollution."

</p><p id="p_44"> 26.         The term 'cause of action' is a bundle of facts.

 There cannot be two opinion about legal position that

 once the 'cause of action' starts running, then it cannot

 be stopped. In case of violation of Law, particularly, like

 CRZ         Notification,              violation    continues,   when       the

 construction activity goes on without hindrance. As

 stated before, the competent authority directed the

(J) M.A. No.65/2014 in Application No.13/2014 (WZ)
  Respondent No.9, to stop construction activity and

 therefore, the construction work now has come to halt. It

 appears prima facie that the question regarding alleged

 violation of CRZ, Notification, is yet to be determined by

 MCZMA.             Under         the       circumstances,   the   Application

 cannot be held as totally barred by limitation, inasmuch

 as the 'cause of action' is continuous and still remains

 unabated. In our opinion, question of locus as well as

 question of limitation ought to be decided on case to case

 basis.

<p id="p_45">27.         What is meaning of expression 'such disputes' in

relation to <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_47">Section 14</a> (2) of the NGT Act, 2010, would

depend upon facts of a particular case. One cannot be

oblivious of the fact that the Legislature has purposefully

used the expression 'such disputes' which imply plurality

of nature of dispute, which may be raised in various kind

of environmental litigations. Needless to say, it will not be

possible to accept straight jacket formula for applicability

of sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_48">Section 14</a>. Unless it can be clearly

gathered that the dispute has origin, which could be

referable to a fixed time of period due to its nature itself,

counting of time will not begin from the day one of fixed

staring point. Nobody will deny that once limitation period

commences, then it will not be arrested in the midst

thereof. Close scrutiny of sub-clause (3) of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_49">Section 14</a>, will


                                                                         Page 27

 make it amply clear that period of limitation will

commence from the 'date of cause of action' for such

dispute when it 'first arose'. If this sub-clause, is properly

bisected, the legal position which emerges, may be stated

in following way:

<p id="p_46">28.       We cannot overlook the material fact that 'first

cause of action' in respect of present dispute arose when

CRZ Notification's violation was noticed by the Applicant

and he made complaint to the concerned Authority. It is

important to note that though the MCZMA, is the

Authority to take action in the matter on its own, yet

failure to take such action by itself, would give rise to

'cause of action', because it is the breach of mandate

</p><p id="p_50"> 29. A plain reading of above Notification reveals that the

 Authority is empowered to take action including issuing

 directions            under          <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_55">Section        5</a>   of   the   Environment

 (Protection) Act, 1986. It is obvious, therefore, that when

 the Authority failed to take suitable action, when CRZ

 violation was complained and brought to the notice of the

 competent Authority, the 'first cause of action' had arisen

 to file the present Application. Apart from that, we cannot

 overlook the fact that the Applicant could not have

 knowledge of particulars of the EC granted in favour of

 the Project Proponent and, therefore, could have no

 reason to file such Application before verification of the

 fact that enormous construction was carried out in

 breach of the EC conditions and within CRZ area.

</p><p id="p_51">30.       Considered from the standpoint of above view, we

are of the opinion that "such disputes" in the present

Application arose when the MCZMA failed to issue

directions under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_56">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection)

Act, 1986, irrespective of knowledge that the construction

activity was in breach of the CRZ Notification. We are of

the opinion that the Applicant could have knowledge of

the nature of initial EC granted in favour of the project

Proponent. Secondly, initial construction activity was
                                                                          Page 30

 below 20,000 sq mtrs and, therefore, the Applicant might

be under impression that no EC was required. However,

project activity increased by leaps and bounds and,

therefore, he gathered knowledge that certain illegal

activity was going on. It is in the wake of such

'subsequent event' that he raked up the dispute in

question. Obviously, the cause of action 'first arose' for

such a dispute when knowledge of excessive project

activity was gained and that Competent Authority failed to

exercise powers under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_57">Section 5</a> of the Environment

(Protection) Act,1986, because 'cause of action' triggered

within limitation.

<p id="p_52">31.             In the final analysis, we hold that the present

is dismissed with no order as to costs.
