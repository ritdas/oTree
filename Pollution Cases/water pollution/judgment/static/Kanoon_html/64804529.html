              The petitioner by this writ petition prays for issuance of a

   writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the order bearing Memo

   No. T-8625 dated 8.12.2016 passed by the Chairman, Bihar State

   Pollution Control Board, Patna in purported exercise of power vested

   under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)

   have been issued for closure of the industrial plant of the petitioner

   with immediate effect with threat of legal action under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_4">section 37</a> of

        nature of mandamus commanding the respondents to permit the

        petitioner to operate the industrial plant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                   Mr. Y.V.Giri, learned Senior Counsel, has appeared for the

        petitioner alongwith Mr. Ashish Giri, to submit that it is pursuant to

        grant of consent to establish issued by the Bihar State Pollution

        Control Board under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_6">26</a> of the

        Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter

        referred to as 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>') and the provisions of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> of 'the

        <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>' granted by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board, Bihar,

        Patna (hereinafter referred to as 'the Board') bearing Memo No. 10727

        dated 5.10.2010 and the Environmental Clearance granted by the

        Government of India in its Ministry of Environment and Forests, as

        contained in their letter dated 17.1.2011, present at Annexure 2, that

        the unit of the petitioner was established at Bihiya in the district of

        Bhojpur in the year 2011 for manufacture of White Chrysotile

        Asbestos Fiber Cement Sheet and its accessories. According to the

        learned Senior Counsel, the consent orders issued under the two

        enactments were renewed from time to time and lastly for a period

        ending 31.3.2016, as contained in Annexures 3 series and 4 series. It

        is submitted that it is when the petitioner applied for renewal of the

        consent orders on 12.2.2016 for the period commencing 1.4.2016, that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                          3</span>




        the petitioner was served with a show cause notice dated 8.4.2016

        issued under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_11">section 21(4)</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a>' and <a href="/doc/813302/" id="a_13">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1004117/" id="a_14">26</a> of

        'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water Act</a>' putting the petitioner on notice on five counts

        mentioned in the show cause notice and requiring response from the

        petitioner as to why the consent application be not refused. An

        exhaustive reply was filed by the petitioner together with the

        necessary enclosures, a copy of which is present at Annxures 7 series,

        but by the order passed on 11.5.2016 the explanation given by the

        petitioner was rejected by the Chairman of the Board who while

        reiterating the allegations has rejected the applications filed by the

        petitioner for grant of renewal of emission consent order and

        discharge consent order filed on 12.2.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                   It is the submission of Mr. Giri that being aggrieved by the

        order dated 11.5.2016 of the Chairman, the petitioner has filed

        statutory appeal before the appellate authority giving rise to Appeal

        Case No. 28/2016, a copy of which is present at Annexure 9 and

        which has been admitted by the appellate authority, which consists of

        the Chairman cum Member, Board of Revenue, the Principal

        Secretary of the Industries Department and the Principal Secretary of

        Environment and Forest Department, vide order passed on 25.7.2016.

        A copy of the order sheet is enclosed at Annexure 10.

</p><p id="p_10">                   It is the submission of Mr. Giri that the appellate authority
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                           4</span>




        after taking note of the prayer of the petitioner for interim stay of the

        order of the Chairman of the Board whereby, the application for grant

        of renewal was refused, adjourned the matter to 12.8.2016 as manifest

        from the order sheet placed at Annexure 10. Learned Senior Counsel

        has referred to the date chart annexed at Annexure 10A to submit that

        since thereafter the matter has been taken up on four dates i.e.

        12.8.2016, 26.8.2016, 16.9.2016 and 17.10.2016 but neither any order

        was passed on the stay application nor any final order has been passed

        on the appeal and the matter remains pending. He submits that while

        the matter is pending consideration before the appellate authority

        which consists of three members including Mr. Vivek Kumar Singh,

        Principal Secretary, Environment and Forest Department, that the

        Chairman of the Board has been replaced and Mr. Vivek Kumar

        Singh, Principal Secretary, Department of Environment of Forest, has

        also been appointed as the Chairman of the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                   It is submitted that while on one hand the matter remains

        pending before the appellate authority to test the correctness of refusal

        to grant consent order, of which Mr. Vivek Kumar Singh is also a

        Member and on the other hand, as the Chairman of the Board, he has

        proceeded to pass an order for closure of industrial plant with

        immediate effect in purported exercise of power vested under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">section

        31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a>' and one of the grounds assigned for such order is,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                           5</span>




        that no relief has been granted by the appellate authority on the appeal

        filed by the petitioner. He submits that in such peculiar circumstances

        where the one of members of the appellate authority, also occupies the

        post of the Chairman of the Board, and would now be sitting as an

        appellate authority over his own orders, that the petitioner is before

        this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                   The submissions advanced by Mr. Giri to question the order

        of closure passed under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Air Act</a>' is that it is wholly

        without jurisdiction as the Chairman has not been vested with the

        powers of the Board. It is submitted that the order dated 8.12.2016

        passed by the Chairman under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_20">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a>', impugned

        at Annexure 11, is also in violation of the principles of natural justice

        as neither any notice nor an opportunity of hearing was granted to the

        petitioner before the order was passed. It is submitted that the law is

        well settled and any order visiting a person with civil consequences

        requires compliance with the rules of natural justice.

</p><p id="p_13">                   Mr. Giri, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

        petitioner, next submits that in view of closure order passed by Mr.

        Vivek Kumar Singh in capacity of the Chairman of the Board,

        impugned at Annexure 11, the appeal pending before the appellate

        authority, of which he is also a Member, in capacity of the Principal

        Secretary, Environment and Forest Department, has become empty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                              6</span>




        formality and a futile exercise. He submits that Mr. Vivek Kumar

        Singh having sat as an appellate authority over the order passed by the

        predecessor in the office of the Chairman, he could not have exercised

        the powers of the Chairman to order for closure of the establishment

        of the petitioner. He submits that this single aspect of the matter

        vitiates the entire decision making process.

                   It is the argument of Mr. Giri that the order of refusal to

        renew the consent order as well as the order of closure impugned

        herein, both are based on an inspection report, a copy of which is

        enclosed by the respondents at Annexure 'R/A' at running page 156 of

        the proceedings. According to Mr. Giri, this inspection report itself is

        inadmissible as it is contrary to the mandatory requirements present in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                           7</span>




        section 26 of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_24">Air Act</a>'. It is submitted that since the orders put to

        question before the appellate authority as well as the order of closure

        impugned herein are resting on an illegal inspection report, the

        moment the foundation for the two orders is removed, the super

        structure built thereon cannot survive. He submits that neither any

        prior notice was given to the petitioner prior to inspection nor the

        samples collected bears the signature of the representative of the

        petitioner nor a copy of the same was provided to him. It is submitted

        that the order of refusal to renew consent present at Annexure 8 as

        well as the order of closure passed under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_25">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_26">Air Act</a>'

        are non-speaking orders and have been mechanically passed. Learned

        Senior Counsel in reference to the judgment of the Supreme Court

        reported in (2010)13 SCC 427 (<a href="/doc/514236/" id="a_27">Oryx Fisheries Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of

        India &amp; ors</a>.), Paragraphs 36 and 40, submits that despite the law

        being settled on the duty cast on a quasi judicial authority, to assign

        reasons, the opinion has been ignored.</blockquote><p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">                   Learned Senior counsel in reference to the show cause filed

        before the Chairman against the proposed refusal for consent to

        Expert Committee of the Ministry of Environment, Govt. of India,

        present at Annexures 5 and 5A, submits that even on merits the orders

        are unsustainable and the specific stand taken by the petitioner has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                           8</span>




        been considered. It is the submission of the learned Senior Counsel

        that since both the orders are resting on an illegal inspection report

        and have been passed in a mechanical fashion, they are both rendered

        illegal and are fit to be quashed. Learned Senior Counsel in support of

        the said submission refers to a judgment of the Supreme Court

        reported in (2010)5 SCC 791 (<a href="/doc/1531209/" id="a_28">Mysore Urban Development

        Authority vs. Veer Kumar Jain &amp; ors</a>.).
</p>
<p id="p_17">                   It is the argument of learned Senior Counsel appearing for

        the petitioner that even if the appeal for quashing the refusal to grant

        consent order is pending before the appellate authority, but in the

        circumstances noticed where Mr. Vivek Kumar Singh, the Chairman

        of the Board, is also discharging the role of an appellate authority, the

        hearing in the appeal matter stands prejudiced and this Court can well

        mould the relief prayed in the writ petition in view of the peculiar

        circumstances existing. Learned Senior Counsel in support has

        referred to a Bench decision of this Court reported in 2015(1) PLJR

        639, Paragraphs 25 to 27, (<a href="/doc/37898695/" id="a_29">Manoj Kumar Singh vs. the State of

        Bihar &amp; ors</a>.).
</p>
<p id="p_18">                   The argument of Mr. Giri has been contested by Mr.

        Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Counsel representing the

        respondents, who appears alongwith Ms. Binita Singh. While raising

        objections as to the maintainability of the writ petition, he submits in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                          9</span>




        reference to the provisions underlying <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_30">Section 31</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_31">Air Act</a>' that

        any order passed under the said Act is appealable before the appellate

        authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_32">section 31</a>. He submits that the petitioner without

        exhausting the appellate remedy so available to it, has approached this

        Court directly and thus, the writ is not maintainable.

</p><p id="p_19">                   Responding to the issue of jurisdiction raised by Mr. Giri to

        question the order of closure under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_33">section 31A</a> of 'the Act', impugned

        at Annexure 11, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Board has

        referred to the provisions underlying <a href="/doc/1897355/" id="a_34">Section 15</a> of 'the Act' to submit

        that the Act itself empowers the State Board to delegate its power on

        the Chairman or Member Secretary or any other Officer of the Board,

        subject to such conditions and limitations as may be specified by a

        general or special order. Learned Senior Counsel next has referred to

        the supplementary counter affidavit filed in the present proceedings

        and with reference to the notification at Annexure 'R/C' and 'R/D'

        thereof submits that vide Agenda No.7 of the Resolution, the Board

        has in its meeting held on 12.1.2002 approved the proposal to delegate

        its power vested under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_35">section 33A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_36">Water Act</a>' and <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_37">Section 31</a>

        of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_38">Air Act</a>' on the Chairman. He thus submits that there is no

        infirmity in exercise of jurisdiction by the Chairman of the Board

        under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_39">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_40">Air Act</a>'. Learned Senior Counsel has also

        raised objections on non-joinder of parties as according to Mr.

        Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Counsel, the State would be a

        necessary party in the present proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                   Adverting himself to the merits of the contest, it is the

        argument of Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Counsel for the

        Board that Annexure 11 is a mere consequence of the refusal of

        consent order passed by the Chairman vide Annexure 8 and which is

        pending consideration before the appellate authority. It is argued that

        even in absence of the order of closure passed by the Chairman under

        <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_41">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_42">Air Act</a>', the petitioner could not have operated its

        unit in absence of a consent order. Learned Senior Counsel while

        admitting that the inspection report has not been supplied to the

        petitioner, refers to the show cause notice present at Annexure 6 to

        submit that the substance of the inspection report stands reproduced in

        the show cause notice dated 8.4.2016 and the petitioner was put to

        notice on five counts. It is, thus, argued that since the entire matter is

        pending consideration before the appellate authority and Annexure 11

        is only a consequential action taken by the Chairman, there is no merit

        in the contest raised herein.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                   Learned Senior Counsel responding to the argument of Mr.

        Giri that the order of closure passed by the Chairman in purported

        exercise of powers vested under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_43">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_44">Air Act</a>' is in

        hearing was given to the petitioner, he submits that there is no

        obligation cast upon the Chairman to give a hearing to the party

        concerned because there is no such stipulation provided in the

        statutory provisions. According to Mr. Kishore, learned Senior

        Counsel, since an order passed by the Board under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_45">section 31A</a> of 'the

        submit that the powers exercised under the enactments in

        consideration, are under the regulatory control of the National Green

        Tribunal and any order passed by the appellate authority is appealable

        before the National Green Tribunal. Learned Senior Counsel has

        referred to a judgment of the Supreme Court reported in (2012)8 SCC

        Senior Counsel, since there is a special forum provided for

        consideration of the issues concerning environmental pollution, the

        petitioner may be accordingly asked to exhaust the statutory remedy

        so available to it. Reiterating the legal position, he submits that the

        order impugned at Annexure 11 is appealable under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_53">section 31</a> of 'the

        <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_54">Air Act</a>' before the appellate authority and the petitioner should have

        exhausted the said remedy instead of approaching this Court in its writ

        jurisdiction.

        was found wanting on a number of issues and the explanation given

        by the petitioner did not satisfy the Chairman, that the consent was

        refused within four months of filing of the application by the

        petitioner seeking renewal, vide order placed at Annexure 8.

        itself, inasmuch as neither the order of refusal of consent takes into

        consideration the issues raised by the petitioner in his reply against the

        submitted his application for renewal of the consent order on

        Board to review its renewal of consent order from time to time subject

        to variation or revocation of any condition. The foundation for such

        alternative remedy has the following words of advice in paragraphs 10

        and 11 of the judgment:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                   "10. In the next place it must be borne in mind that there is no rule,
                   with regard to certiorari as there is with mandamus, that it will lie
                   only where there is no other equally effective remedy. It is well
                   established that, provided the requisite grounds exist, certiorari will
                   lie although a right of appeal has been conferred by statute,
                   (Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 11, p. 130 and the cases
                   cited there). The fact that the aggrieved party has another and
                   adequate remedy may be taken into consideration by the superior
                   Court in arriving at a conclusion as to whether it should, in exercise
                   of its discretion issue a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings
                   and decisions of inferior courts subordinate to it and ordinarily the
                   superior Court will decline to interfere until the aggrieved party has
                   exhausted his other statutory remedies, if any. But this rule requiring
                   the exhaustion of statutory remedies before the writ will be granted
                   is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion rather than a rule of
                   law and instances are numerous where a writ of certiorari has been
                   issued in spite of the fact that the aggrieved party had other adequate
                   legal remedies. In the King v. Postmaster-General; Ex parte
                   Carmichael, 1928-1 KB 291 (E), a certiorari was issued although the
                   aggrieved party had an alternative remedy by way of appeal. It has
                   been held that the superior Court will readily issue a cretiorari in a
                   case where there has been a denial of natural justice before a Court
                   of summary jurisdiction. The case of Rex v. Wandsworth Justices;
                   Ex Parte Read, 1942-1 KB 281 (F) is an authority in point. In that
                   case a man had been convicted in a court of summary jurisdiction
                   without giving him an opportunity of being heard. It was held that
                   his remedy was not by a case stated or by an appeal before the
                   quarter sessions but by application to the High Court for an order of
                   certiorari to remove and quash the conviction. At p. 284 Viscount
                   Caldecote, C. J., observed :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                           "It remains to consider the argument that the remedy of
                           certiorari is not open to the applicant because others were
                           available. It would be ludicrous in such a case as the present
                           for the convicted person to ask for a case to be stated. It
                           would mean asking this Court to consider as a question of
                           law whether justices were right in convicting a man without
                           hearing his evidence. That is so extravagant an argument as
                           not to merit a moment's consideration. As to the right of
                           appeal to quarter sessions, it may be that the applicant could
                           have had his remedy if he had pursued that course, but I am
                           not aware of any reason why, if in such circumstances as
                           these, he preferred to apply for an order of certiorari to quash
                           his conviction, the Court should be debarred from granting
                           his application."

                   Bom 46 (G), it was held that the High Court would not refuse to
                   issue a writ of certiorari merely because there was a right of appeal.
                   It was recognized that ordinarily the High Court would require the
                   petitioner to have recourse to his ordinary remedies but if it found
                   that there had been a breach of fundamental principles of justice, the
                   High Court would certainly not hesitate to issue the writ of certiorari.
                   To the same effect are the following observations of Harries, C. J., in
                   56 Cal WN 453 : (AIR 1952 Cal 656) (D) at p. 470 (of Cal WN) : (at

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                           "There can, I think, be no doubt that Court can refuse to issue

                           convenient and effective. But it appears to me that there can
                           be cases where the Court can and should issue a certiorari
                           even where such alternative remedies are available. Where a

                           and arrives at a decisions contrary to all accepted principles
                           of justice then it appears to me that the Court can and must
                           interfere."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                   It has also been held that a litigant who has lost his right of appeal or
                   has failed to perfect an appeal by no fault of his own may in a proper
                   case obtain a review by certiorari. (See Corpus Juris Secundum Vol.
                   14 <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_162">Art. 40</a> p. 189). If, therefore, the existence of other adequate legal
                   remedies is not per se a bar to the issue of certiorari and if in a
                   proper case it may be the duty of the superior Court to issue a writ of
                   certiorari to correct the errors of an inferior Court or tribunal called
                   upon to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions and not to
                   relegate the petitioner to other legal remedies available to him and if
                   the superior Court can in a proper case exercise its jurisdiction in
                   favour of a petitioner who has allowed the time to appeal to expire or
                   has not perfected his appeal e.g., by furnishing security required by
                   the statute, should it then be laid down as an inflexible rule of law
                   that the superior Court must deny the writ when an inferior Court or
                   tribunal by discarding all principles of natural justice and all
                   accepted rules of procedure arrived at a conclusion which shocks the
                   sense of justice and fair play merely because such decision has been
                   upheld by another inferior Court or tribunal on appeal or revision?
                   The case of 1889-22 QBD 345 (C) referred to in 1951 SCR 344 :
                   (AIR 1951 SC 217) (B) furnishes the answer. There the manager of a
                   club was convicted under a certain statute for selling beer by retail
                   without an excise retail license. Subsequently he was convicted of
                   selling intoxicating liquor, namely, beer without a license under
                   another statute. Upon hearing of the later charge the Magistrate
                   treated it as a second offence and imposed a full penalty authorised
                   in the case of a second offence by the latter statute. His appeal to the
                   quarter sessions having been dismissed, he applied for a writ of
                   habeas corpus and it was granted by the King's Bench Division on
                   the ground that the Magistrate could not treat the later offence as a
                   second offence, because it was not a second offence under the Act
                   under which he was convicted for the second time. Evidently the

                   point was taken that if there had been any error, irregularity or
                   illegality committed by the Magistrate, the quarter sessions could
                   have on appeal corrected the same and that the quarter sessions
                   having dismissed the appeal the Court of Queen's Bench Division
                   could not issue the writ of habeas corpus. This was repelled by the
                   following observations of Hawkins, J. :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                           "This is true as a fact, but it puts the prosecution in no better
                           position, for if the Magistrate had no power to give himself
                           jurisdiction by finding that there had been a first offence
                           where there had been none, the justices could not give it to
                           him."</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                               11. On the authorities referred to above it appears to us
                   that there may conceivably be cases - and the instant case is in point
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                   - where the error, irregularity or illegality touching jurisdiction or
                   procedure committed by an inferior court or tribunal of first instance
                   is so patent and loudly obtrusive that it leaves on its decision an
                   indelible stamp of infirmity or vice, which cannot be obliterated or
                   cured on appeal or revision. If an inferior Court or tribunal of first
                   instance acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of
                   jurisdiction or manifestly conducts the proceedings before it in a
                   manner which is contrary to the rules of natural justice and all
                   accepted rules of procedure and which offends the superior court's
                   sense of fair play the superior Court may, we think, quite properly
                   exercise its power to issue the prerogative writ of certiorari to correct
                   the error of the Court or tribunal of first instance, even if an appeal to
                   another inferior Court or tribunal was available and recourse was not
                   had to it or if recourse was had to it, it confirmed what a ex facie was
                   a nullity for reasons aforementioned. This would be so all the more if
                   the tribunals holding the original trial and the tribunals hearing the
                   appeal or revision were merely departmental tribunals composed of
                   persons belonging to the departmental hierarchy without adequate
                   legal training and background and whose glaring lapses occasionally
                   come to our notice. The superior Court will ordinarily decline to
                   interfere by issuing certiorari and all we say is that in a proper case
                   of the kind mentioned above it has the power to do so and may and

                   It is not in dispute rather it is an admitted position that the

        order put to challenge in this writ petition was passed without any

        notice and without any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. Mr.

        Shivendra Kishore, learned Senior Counsel, while trying to advocate

        that the order passed by the Chairman under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_164">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_165">Air

        rejection of consent, has somewhere left forgotten that the order is

        extreme in nature and visits the petitioner with severe penal

        consequences of extreme nature. It is rather surprising that even when

        the Chairman exercising powers of the Board intends to order for

        closure of operations in the establishment, he has not bothered to even

        put the petitioner on notice. What is even more worse is the fact that

        the Chairman has himself taken note of the pending proceedings

        before the appellate authority of which he himself is a Member and

        even though the prayer of the petitioner for interim relief has been

        adjourned by the appellate authority from one date to another, yet the

        alleged failure of the petitioner to obtain interim protection has been

        cited as one of the grounds for the order of closure. In other words,

        the failure of the appellate authority of which, the Chairman happens

        to be a Member, to pass appropriate order on the prayer for stay made

        by the petitioner, has gone against the petitioner and a default by the

        appellate authority is assigned as one of the grounds to order for

        closure.
</p>
<p id="p_41">                   It is absolute absurdity to attribute laches on the petitioner to

        obtain an interim order from the appellate authority even when the

        petitioner has made such prayer as back as on 25.7.2016 and the

        matter was posted for the purpose on subsequent dates on which the

        matter was taken up but no order was passed by the appellate

        authority. The concept of adherence to the principles of natural justice

        has been subject matter of plethora of judgments and even though the

        right to notice coupled with the right of being heard has been upheld

        as an essential prerequisite to such adherence, yet the executive

        that even if the Statute conferring power is silent with regard to giving

        a pre-decisional hearing to the person affected and the action taken

        involves civil consequences of grave nature, yet a minimum hearing

        has to be afforded to the person concerned. The obligation cast on

        bodies discharging statutory function of quasi judicial nature in

        ensuring compliance to the principles of natural justice has taken a

        shape of essential requirement and a right to notice coupled with right

        of hearing is the order of the day except where circumstances are

        exceptional and warranting immediate action. Such is not the case

        here. The appeal is pending and the Chairman is well aware of it. It is

        also not a case where the petitioner has been found wanting in

        ensuring compliance of the provisions of the enactments in question

        and if what transpires from the affidavit(s) filed by the parties in the

        present proceedings is true, then the action taken is the first, since the

        industrial unit was established in the year 2011.

        and a right to hearing to the person concerned but considering the

        effect of an order passed under the said provisions, in my opinion, a

        notice and a hearing is a sine qua non to such action. In the undisputed

        circumstances discussed, where the order impugned in the writ

        petition has been passed by the Chairman exercising power of the

        Board, without notice and opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, it

        violates the basic tenets underling the principles of natural justice for

        an order containing directions of such extreme nature, necessarily and

        essentially requires the person concerned to be put on notice with an

        opportunity to represent. The procedure not having been followed, the

        order is unsustainable.

<p id="p_45">                   In the undisputed circumstances existing where the

        Chairman, Sri Vivek Kumar Singh exercising the power of the Board,

        also happens to be the Member of the appellate authority constituted

        under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_173">section 31</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_174">Air Act</a>', not only the right to appeal vested in

        the petitioner stands forfeited, even otherwise Sri Singh cannot sit in

        appeal over his own orders or the orders passed by his predecessor in

        Office until he continues to discharge the functions of the Chairman

        of the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_46">                   The opinion expressed by this Court hereinabove are

        sufficient reasons to hold that the order dated 8.12.2016 passed by the

        Chairman, Bihar State Pollution Control Board in exercise of powers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                         29</span>




        vested in the State Board under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_175">section 31A</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_176">Air Act</a>' is illegal,

        an order passed without jurisdiction and also passed in violation of the

        principles of natural justice. In consequence the order dated 8.12.2016

        passed by the Chairman impugned at Annexure 11 to the writ petition

        is quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_47">                   The issue which comes next is whether and to what extent

        the relief prayed by the petitioner can be moulded specially where the

        appeal filed by the petitioner against the order of refusal of grant of

        consent passed by the Chairman on 11.5.2016 enclosed at Annexure 8

        to the writ petition is pending consideration before the appellate

        authority in Appeal No. 28/2016.
</p>
<p id="p_48">                   A rather peculiar situation has arisen in the present case.

        While the Principal Secretary, Department of Environment and Forest

        has been notified as a Member of the appellate authority constituted

        under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_177">section 31(2)</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_178">Air Act</a>' vide notification dated

        22/23.10.1990, the Principal Secretary, Environment and Forest

        Department, has also been given additional charge of the Chairman,

        State Pollution Control Board. A strange situation arises where the

        Principal Secretary, Department of Environment and Forest, would be

        sitting in appeal over his own order as a Member of the appellate

        authority constituted under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_179">section 31(2)</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_180">Air Act</a>'. Obviously

        since presently Mr. Vivek Kumar Singh, the Principal Secretary,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                       30</span>




        Department of Environment and Forest, holds additional charge of the

        Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board, he cannot be

        permitted to discharge the functions of an appellate authority

        constituted under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_181">section 31(2)</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_182">Air Act</a>' and would have to

        keep away from the appellate proceedings.       Meaning thereby the

        functioning of the appellate body so constituted under notification

        dated 22/23.10.1990 has become prejudicially effected. Even though

        the order of refusal to grant consent, put to challenge before the

        appellate authority by the petitioner, has been passed by Mr. Subhash

        Chandra Singh, who then held the post of the Chairman, but this

        would make no difference because Mr. Vivek Kumar Singh has

        stepped into the shoes of Mr. Subhash Chandra Singh as the Chairman

        of the Board and thus, until such time he holds additional charge of

        the Chairman, State Pollution Control Board, he cannot sit in appeal

        over any order passed by the incumbent occupying the post of the

        Chairman, State Pollution Control Board. In other words, the appeal

        filed by the petitioner, as of today, cannot be heard and even if Mr.

        Vivek Kumar Singh, Principal Secretary, Department of Environment

        and Forest, is not the author of the order refusing grant of consent

        passed by the Chairman, which is put to challenge in appeal, yet until

        such time that he occupies the post of the Chairman, State Pollution

        Control Board, he is hereby restrained from functioning as an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> Patna High Court CWJC No.421 of 2017                                                 31</span>




        appellate authority constituted under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_183">section 31(2)</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_184">Air Act</a>'.

</p><p id="p_49">                   The issue next is what happens to the petitioner because he

        is without an appellate remedy and the appeal cannot be heard until

        corrective measures are taken by the State Government in this regard

        either for posting of some other Officer as Principal Secretary,

        Department of Environment and Forest or as the Chairman, State

        Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_50">                   In the extraordinary circumstances existing and considering

        that the petitioner's industrial unit has been functional over the period

        of last five years and until the refusal to grant consent order was

        passed, there has been no complaints of any statutory violation by the

        petitioner, to any of the stipulations present in the enactments in

        question, I am of the considered view that until such time that a final

        order on the said appeal is passed by a duly constituted appellate

        body, the unit of the petitioner should be allowed to operate under the

        supervisory regulatory control of the State Board, who may carry out

        periodical checks as to the adherence by the petitioner to the pollution

        control limits prescribed under 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_185">Air Act</a>' and 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_186">Water Act</a>'.
