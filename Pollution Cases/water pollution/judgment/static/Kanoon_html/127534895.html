  and <a href="/doc/4285088/" id="a_9">Section 49(1)(b)</a> of the Act, 1974, before the Chief Judicial

  Magistrate, Janjgir stating inter alia that the Chhattisgarh State

  Power Generation Company Limited has established a thermal

  power plant at Marva, Janjgir of 2 x 500 MW for which

  environmental clearance has been granted by the Central

  Government, Ministry of Forest and Environment on 5-2-2008 and

  that was valid for a period of five years which has expired on 5-2-

  2013, but thereafter, this validity period has not been extended and

  no further / fresh environment clearance has been granted and the

  said power plant is allegedly being run by the said Company

  without further environment clearance which is punishable under

2.2) The petitioner arraigned in his complaint 25 persons as

accused persons which include present Chairman of the

Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited, present

and former Directors of that Company, Chairman of the

Chhattisgarh Pollution Control Board, former and present Directors

of that Board, Chief Engineer of the said Power Generation

Company, Regional Officer of the Chhattisgarh Environment

Conservation     Board,    Collector,    Janjgir-Champa;   Principal

Secretary (Housing and Environment), Chhattisgarh; Regional

Officer of Ministry of Environment; Member Secretary of the Central

Pollution Control Board; and Secretary of the Ministry of

Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
</p>
<p id="p_13">2.3) The said complaint was filed before the Chief Judicial

Magistrate on 17-8-2015 in which he called for the police

investigation report and statement of the complainant was recorded

on 26-10-2015.    On 6-5-2016, learned Magistrate directed that

report be called from the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation

Board which was submitted on 7-6-2016. Argument was heard on

20-9-2016 and ultimately, on 5-11-2016, learned Magistrate

dismissed the complaint holding that no sufficient ground for

issuance of process against the respondents has been made out

and further held that on the complaint of the complainant, on the

same subject, the National Green Tribunal, Bhopal has taken

cognizance.
</p>
<p id="p_14">2.4) Questioning that order, this petition under Section 482 of the
                                                         Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              Page 6 of 23</span>
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19">CrPC</a> has been filed by the complainant/petitioner stating inter alia

     that the learned Magistrate has committed grave illegality in

     rejecting the complaint taking note of the objection preferred by the

     accused persons which is wholly unsustainable and bad in law.

</p><p id="p_15">  3. Mr. Harsh Wardhan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner/

     complainant would submit as under: -
</p>
<p id="p_16">        1. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate has permitted the

           respondents / accused No.16 to 19 to participate in the

           proceeding even before the issuance of process and has

           considered reply, documents and objections filed by the

           accused persons, which is illegal, non est, impermissible and

           condemnable. Reliance has been placed upon the decisions

           of the Supreme Court in the matters of <a href="/doc/3304039/" id="a_20">Manharibhai

           Muljibhai    Kakadia     and      another   v.   Shaileshbhai

           Mohanbhai Patel</a> and others1 and <a href="/doc/214907/" id="a_21">Raghu Raj Singh

           Rousha v. Shivam Sundaram Promoters Private Limited</a>

           and another2 to buttress his submission.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        2. The defence of non-impleadment of company is of no help to

           the respondents. Some of the respondents are officers of the

           Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited and

           therefore relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in

           the matters of <a href="/doc/885425/" id="a_22">U.P. Pollution Control Board v. Modi

           Distillery3</a>, <a href="/doc/1814230/" id="a_23">U.P. Pollution Control Board v. Mohan</a>

2 (2009) 2 SCC 363
3 (1987) 3 SCC 684
                                                         Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               Page 7 of 23</span>

            Meakins Ltd. and others4 and <a href="/doc/710418/" id="a_24">U.P. Pollution Control

            Board v. Bhupendra Kumar Modi</a> 5, such non-arraigning the

            company as accused is a curable defect.
</p>
<p id="p_18">         3. The objections as to the requirement of a valid sanction is

            also not tenable, as the requirement of sanction is to be

            examined on case to case basis.        The said assessment

            would necessarily require examination and appreciation of

            evidence and material which can be undertaken only by the

            trial Court while examining the complaint on merit. Therefore,

            the issue of sanction has to be examined deeper by the trial

            Court after appreciating the evidence on record. Reliance

            has been placed upon the judgments of the Supreme Court

            in the matters of <a href="/doc/158339934/" id="a_25">Om Prakash and others v. State of

            Jharkhand</a> and another6 and <a href="/doc/1634320/" id="a_26">Parkash Singh Badal and

            another v. State of Punjab</a> and others7.
</p>
<p id="p_19">         4. On the basis of above-stated submission, he would finally

            submit that the impugned order be set-aside and criminal

            complaint be registered to the file of the Chief Judicial

            Magistrate, Janjgir-Champa for hearing and disposal in

            accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_20">    4. Mr. V.V.S. Murthy, learned Senior Advocate appearing for

      Chhattisgarh   Environment    Conservation    Board   and   Central

      Pollution Control Board, would submit that they have only


4   (2000) 3 SCC 745
5   (2009) 2 SCC 147
6   (2012) 12 SCC 72
7   2007 AIR SCW 1415
                                                           Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               Page 8 of 23</span>

     submitted the report as called by the trial Court and have not

     participated in the trial.    Since report was called by the trial

     Magistrate, the Boards were duty bound to submit report and they

     have not participated in the trial. Therefore, the argument raised

     on behalf of the petitioner that the respondents/accused persons

     have participated in the trial is not correct and is contrary to record.

     He would further submit that senior officers of Chhattisgarh

     Environment Conservation Board as well as the Member Secretary

     of the Central Pollution Control Board have unnecessarily, against

     the requirement of law, been arraigned as party respondents only

     just to harass them and this petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_27">Section 482</a> of the CrPC

     is nothing but a sheer abuse of the process of the Court which

     deserves to be dismissed with heavy cost.
</p>
<p id="p_21">  5. Mr. N.K. Vyas, learned Assistant Solicitor General for respondents

     No.22, 24 and 25, would submit that the offence is alleged to have

     been committed by the Company i.e. the Chhattisgarh State Power

     Generation Company Limited, but the said Company has not been

     arrayed as an accused therefore vicarious liability of their officers

     shall not come into play. Even otherwise, the senior officers of the

     Central Government are no way connected with the running of the

     Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited and they

     have been dragged for nothing. To buttress his submission in this

     point, he relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the matter

     of Nalin Thakor and others v. State of Gujarat and others 8. He

     would further submit that respondents No.22 and 24 are senior

8 (2003) 12 SCC 461
                                                         Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              Page 9 of 23</span>

     officers of the Central Government being Regional Officer, Western

     Region and Member Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest

     and Climate Change, respectively, and respondent No.5 is

     Secretary of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change,

     and without there being an averment as to their liability for such an

     act of a Company who even have not been arraigned as party, they

     have been impleaded, therefore it is a case where for no rhyme or

     reason they have been impleaded. It is not a bona fide petition and

     it deserves to be dismissed with heavy costs.

</p><p id="p_22">  6. Mr. Raja Sharma and Mr. Apoorv Kurup, learned counsel

     appearing for respondents No.1 to 4 and 6 to 15, would submit that

     the petitioner did not arraign M/s. Chhattisgarh State Power

     Generation Company Limited as party in his complaint filed before

     the Chief Judicial Magistrate, though the petitioner has sought to

     fasten vicarious / constructive liability upon the respondents for

     commission of offence under <a href="/doc/1255168/" id="a_28">Sections 39</a>, <a href="/doc/506633/" id="a_29">40</a> and <a href="/doc/1179809/" id="a_30">41</a> of the Air Act;

     <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_31">Sections 44</a>, <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_32">47</a> and <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_33">48</a> of the Water Act; and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_34">Sections 15</a>, <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_35">16</a> and

     <a href="/doc/69926654/" id="a_36">17</a> of the Environment Act.      They would also submit that the

     complaint alleging vicarious liability of respondents No.1 to 4 and 6

     to 15 is not at all maintainable without arraigning the Company

     itself as a party and without demonstrating their role and

     incriminating material against them.     They would place strong

     reliance upon a three-Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court

     in the matter of <a href="/doc/1322448/" id="a_37">Aneeta Hada v. Godfather Travels and Tours

     Private Limited9</a> and would also submit that Aneeta Hada's

9 (2012) 5 SCC 661
                                                          Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               Page 10 of 23</span>

      decision (supra) has been further followed in the matter of

      Standard Chartered Bank v. State of Maharashtra and others 10.

      They would contend that the petitioner failed to make any specific

      averment with respect to the present respondents indicating their

</p><p id="p_28">10. Before proceeding further, it would be appropriate to notice that as

   alleged by the complainant in the complaint filed before the

   Magistrate, the offence is said to have been committed by the

   Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited stating

   inter alia that environment clearance was granted by the Ministry of

   Environment, Forest and Climate Change in favour of the said

   Company on 5-2-2008 for a period of five years, but it was not

   extended further and it was being run without there being any

   extension of environment clearance illegally which is punishable

   under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_41">Sections 15</a>, <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_42">16</a> and <a href="/doc/69926654/" id="a_43">17</a> of the Environment Act and similarly,

   the condition incorporated in the consent dated 5-5-2008 by the

   Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board, particularly clause

   29 promising rehabilitation of 16 villages, has not been followed by

   the Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited. The

   power plant was being operated by the said Company without there

   being any consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_44">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_45">Water Act</a>

   which is punishable under the aforesaid provisions as incorporated

   in the earlier paragraph. Therefore, the principal allegation has

   been made against the Company and the offence is said to have

   been committed by the said Company under the provisions of the

   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_46">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_47">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_48">Air Act</a>, and

   thereafter, the Directors and other officers of the Company have

   been arraigned making them as accused in the complaint

   vicariously liable for the offence committed by the Company.

<p id="p_34">15. The aforesaid provisions of the three Acts namely the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_55">Environment

   Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_56">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_57">Water Act</a>, are pari materia provisions and

   they provide for responsibility of an offence which is committed by

   companies.
</p>
<p id="p_35">16. A focused glance of the aforesaid provisions would show that for

   the offence committed by the company, the officers of the company

   who were directly in-charge of and responsible to the company for

   the conduct of the business of the company are vicariously liable

   and on conviction, the company will be guilty of the offence and

   those officers will also be guilty of the offence. In other words,

   when the company is prosecuted for an offence; then only the

   officers directly in-charge and responsible to the company shall be
                                                              Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

      held vicariously liable and as such, unless the company is held

      guilty for the commission of offence, the officers of the company

      cannot be held guilty independently.         Thus, the officers of the

      company are vicariously liable for the offence committed by the

      company. Therefore, in order to prosecute the persons who were

      directly in-charge and responsible to the company for the conduct

      of the business of the company and in order to maintain valid

      complaint against the company who has allegedly committed an

      offence under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_58">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_59">Water Act</a> and

      the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_60">Air Act</a>, arraigning of that company as an accused in the

      complaint is absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_36">  17. "Alter ego" is a principle that one who defends another against

      attack stands in the position of that other person and can use only

      the amount of force that the other person could use under the

      circumstances. (See Black's Law Dictionary - Eighth Edition.) The

      concept of alter ego is used primarily to hold the controlling parties

      of a corporation personally liable instead of limiting liability to the

      corporate entity.
</p>
<p id="p_37">  18.The Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/159121041/" id="a_61">Sunil Bharti Mittal v. Central

      Bureau of Investigation11</a> while considering the corporate criminal

      liability held the principle that criminal intent of person(s) controlling

      company can be imputed to company based on principle of "alter-

      ego" and further held that when company is the accused, its

      Directors can be roped in only if there is sufficient incriminating

      evidence against them coupled with criminal intent or the statutory

11 (2015) 4 SCC 609

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                            Page 16 of 23</span>

   regime attracts the doctrine of vicarious liability. Paragraph 44 of

   the report states as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">         "44. When the company is the offender, vicarious
         liability of the Directors cannot be imputed
         automatically, in the absence of any statutory provision
         to this effect. One such example is <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_62">Section 141</a> of the
         Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In Aneeta Hada
         (supra), the Court noted that if a group of persons that
         guide the business of the company have the criminal
         intent, that would be imputed to the body corporate and
         it is in this backdrop, <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_63">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable
         Instruments Act has to be understood. Such a position
         is, therefore, because of statutory intendment making it
         a deeming fiction. Here also, the principle of "alter
         ego", was applied only in one direction, namely, where
         a group of persons that guide the business had
         criminal intent, that is to be imputed to the body
         corporate and not the vice versa. Otherwise, there has
         to be a specific act attributed to the Director or any
         other person allegedly in control and management of
         the company, to the effect that such a person was
         responsible for the acts committed by or on behalf of
         the company."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">19. The law with regard to arraigning the Company as an accused in

   case of commission of offence by Company is well settled and

   stands conclusively and authoritatively decided by the Supreme

   Court in Aneeta Hada (supra) in which Their Lordships of the

   Supreme Court were pleased to frame a question in paragraph 3 of

   its judgment, "whether the Company could have been made liable

   for prosecution without being impleaded as an accused and

   whether the Directors could have been prosecuted for offences

   punishable under the aforesaid provisions without the Company

   being arrayed as an accused". Their Lordships considered various

   authorities on the point and finally, in clear and unmistakable terms

   held in paragraph 59 that under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_64">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable

   Instruments Act, 1881, arraigning of a company as an accused for
                                                             Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 Page 17 of 23</span>

      maintaining the prosecution, is imperative. Their Lordships further

      held that the other categories of offenders can only be brought in

      the drag-net on the touchstone of vicarious liability as the same has

      been stipulated in the provision itself. Paragraphs 58 and 59 of the

      report state as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">            "58. Applying the doctrine of strict construction, we
            are of the considered opinion that commission of
            offence by the company is an express condition
            precedent to attract the vicarious liability of others.
            Thus, the words "as well as the company" appearing in
            the section make it absolutely unmistakably clear that
            when the company can be prosecuted, then only the
            persons mentioned in the other categories could be
            vicariously liable for the offence subject to the
            averments in the petition and proof thereof. One
            cannot be oblivious of the fact that the company is a
            juristic person and it has its own respectability. If a
            finding is recorded against it, it would create a
            concavity in its reputation. There can be situations
            when the corporate reputation is affected when a
            Director is indicted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">            59. In view of our aforesaid analysis, we arrive at the
            irresistible conclusion that for maintaining the
            prosecution under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_65">Section 141</a> of the Act, arraigning of
            a company as an accused is imperative. The other
            categories of offenders can only be brought in the
            drag-net on the touchstone of vicarious liability as the
            same has been stipulated in the provision itself. We
            say so on the basis of the ratio laid down in C.V.
            Parekh12 which is a three-Judge Bench decision. Thus,
            the view expressed in Sheoratan Agarwal13 does not
            correctly lay down the law and, accordingly, is hereby
            overruled. The decision in Anil Hada14 is overruled with
            the qualifier as stated in para 51. The decision in Modi
            Distillery (supra) has to be treated to be restricted to its
            own facts as has been explained by us hereinabove."

   the Environment Act, 1986; <a href="/doc/506633/" id="a_73">Section 40</a> of the Air Act, 1981; and

   <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_74">Section 47</a> of the Water Act, 1974, would show that <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_75">Section 141</a> of

   the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is a para materia provision to

   <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_76">Section 16</a> of the Environment Act, 1986; <a href="/doc/506633/" id="a_77">Section 40</a> of the Air Act,

   1981; and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_78">Section 47</a> of the Water Act, 1974, as such, the

   proposition laid down in Aneeta Hada (supra) reiterated in

   Standard Chartered Bank (supra), squarely applies to the facts of

   the present case, as in the instant case offence is alleged to have

   been committed by the Chhattisgarh State Power Generation
                                                       Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                           Page 19 of 23</span>

   Company Limited under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_79">Environment

   (Protection) Act</a>, 1986; the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_80">Air Act</a>, 1981; and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_81">Water Act</a>, 1974,

   respectively. It is, therefore, held that arraigning the company as

   an accused, since the offence is said to have been committed by

   the Company i.e. the Chhattisgarh State Power Generation

   Company Limited, in the complaint was the first and foremost

   requirement which has not been done and the said Company has

   not been arraigned as accused in the said complaint filed before

   the jurisdictional criminal court, only other persons who are either

   related with the Company currently or previously and officers of the

   Central Government and the State Government have been arrayed

   as party accused without assigning their specific role in running of

   the said company. The complaint as framed and filed only against

   the officers of the company without arraigning the Chhattisgarh

   State Power Generation Company Limited, who is alleged to have

   committed the offence, is held to be not maintainable in law.

</p><p id="p_41">22. At this stage, to be fair with Mr. Harsh Wardhan, learned counsel

   for the petitioner/complainant, the judgment cited by him in Modi

   Distillery's case (supra) to buttress his submission that non-

   arraigning the company is a curable defect and it can be cured if

   the order is set aside and the matter is remanded to the trial

   Magistrate, deserves to be noticed. The aforesaid decision was a

   two-Judge Bench decision which was considered by Their

   Lordships of the Supreme Court in Aneeta Hada (supra) in

   paragraph 52 of its judgment and Their Lordships held that the

   decision in Modi Distillery's case (supra) has to be treated to be
                                                        Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                Page 20 of 23</span>

   restricted to its own fact and it has further been observed by Their

   Lordships in paragraph 52 that "M/s. Modi Distilleries was arrayed

   as a party instead of M/s. Modi Industries Ltd.. Thus, it was a

   defective complaint which was curable but, a pregnant one, the law

   laid down as regards the primary liability of the company without

   which no vicarious liability can be imposed has been appositely

   stated". In view of the above, this decision cited by Mr. Harsh

   Wardhan is of no help to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_42">23. The other two decisions which Mr. Harsh Wardhan has cited are

   Mohan Meakins Ltd.'s case (supra) and Bhupendra Kumar

   Modi's case (supra) to highlight the fact that environmental

   offences are of a serious nature, because they concern and effect

   large section of the society and are not liable to be considered

   lightly by the courts, and on such technical pleas, the accused

   persons cannot be allowed to escape the clutches of law. These

   two cases are clearly distinguishable on facts, as it has been held

   relying upon the larger bench decision of Aneeta Hada (supra) that

   arraigning of company is an imperative requirement for maintaining

   a maintainable complaint to prosecute the Company and its

   responsible officers.        Therefore, these judgments are also not

   helpful to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_43">24. In view of the aforesaid, it is held that in view of the provisions

   contained in <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_82">Section 16</a> of the Environment Act, 1986; <a href="/doc/506633/" id="a_83">Section 40</a>

   of the Air Act, 1981; and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_84">Section 47</a> of the Water Act, 1974, where

   the offence is said to have been committed by the company,
                                                          Cr.M.P.No.56/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                              Page 21 of 23</span>

     arraigning of the company as a party in the complaint is a condition

     precedent in order to make a valid and maintainable complaint to

     prosecute the company and its responsible officers and in absence

     of company being arraigning as accused in a complaint, the said

     complaint is held to be not maintainable in law.

</p><p id="p_44">  25. The first question is answered accordingly.

     Answer to question No.2: -
</p>
<p id="p_45">  26. Having answered question No.1 and having regard to the

     conclusion reached herein-above that the complaint as framed and

     filed is not maintainable in law, question No.2 is not required to be

     decided, yet with all fairness to counsel for the petitioner, the issue

     is taken-up for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_46">  27. The scheme of Chapter XVI of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_85">CrPC</a> shows that an accused

     person does not come into the picture at all till process is issued.

     This does not mean that he is precluded from being present when

     an enquiry is held by a Magistrate. He may remain present either

     in person or through a counsel or agent with a view to be informed

     of what is going on. But since the very question for consideration

     being whether he should be called upon to face an accusation, he

     has no right to take part in the proceedings nor has the Magistrate

     any jurisdiction to permit him to do so. (<a href="/doc/1758785/" id="a_86">See Chandra Deo Singh

     v. Prakash Chandra Bose</a> alias Chabi Bose and another 15,

     Balraj Khanna and others v. Moti Ram16, Manharibhai Muljibhai

   the trial and they have already submitted a report in which they

   have also submitted report that similar plea is pending before the

   National Green Tribunal and taking note of that plea, it appears that

   the learned Magistrate has rejected the complaint. Entire order

   sheets of trial have been placed before this Court.           A careful

   perusal of the order sheets would show that on each date of

   hearing, the complainant has appeared through his counsel and

   presence of any officer or any Advocate on behalf of the

   respondents has not been recorded except on 14-10-2016. It has

   been recorded in the order sheet dated 14-10-2016 that " vukosnd }kjk

   been recorded that on behalf of the respondents one document has

   been produced, that has been taken note of. Therefore, it is not

   established that accused persons No.16 to 19 have participated in

   the proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_48">29. Mr. N.K. Vyas, learned Assistant Solicitor General, has also raised

   a plea that their officers are the officers of the Central Government

   and without prior sanction under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_87">Section 197</a> of the CrPC, the

   complaint was not maintainable.        In view of the finding arrived

   herein-above, I deem it inappropriate to deal with the aforesaid

   submission, as the complaint is held to be not maintainable. It is

   left open to be considered and decided in appropriate case.

</p><p id="p_51">       31. So far as the question of cost is concerned, this Court is inclined to

          impose heavy cost upon the petitioner taking into account the

          manner in which he roped in the senior officers of the said

          Company, Chairman of the said Company, senior officers of the

          Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board, Central Pollution

          Control Board and senior officers of the State Government and the

          Central Government without assigning their specific role and

          without placing adequate incriminating material against them, but

          considering the fact that the complaint was dismissed without

          issuing notice to them and learned counsel for the petitioner has

          submitted that the petitioner would be careful in future and would

          not indulge in such a practice, this Court decided not to impose

          cost upon the petitioner except warning the petitioner to be careful

          in future and not to repeat this practice.
