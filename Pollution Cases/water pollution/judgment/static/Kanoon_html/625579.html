HEADNOTE:
    <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_4">Section  3</a>	of the Water (Prevention  of  Pollution	 and
Control) Cess Act, 1977 provided that water cess was payable
by every person carrying on any specified industry and every
local  authority, for the purposes of the Water	 (Prevention
and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.  "Specified  industry"
was  defined  in the Act meaning any industry  specified  in
Schedule 1. There were 15 items under Schedule I,  including
"processing of animal or vegetable products industry", under
Entry 15.
    The question for consideration in the batch of  appeals,
writ  petitions	 and transferred cases arising	out  of	 the
notices	 issued by the concerned assessing  authorities	 de-
manding water cess from the sugar manufacturers was  whether
sugar manufacturing industry fell under Entry 15 of Schedule
I  of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_6">Control of  Pollution)	Cess
Act</a>, 1977.
    Disposing of the appeals, writ petitions and transferred
cases, this Court,
    HELD: 1. In the context in which the word 'vegetable' is
used  in Entry 15, Schedule I of the Water  (Prevention	 and
<a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_7">Control	 of Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977,	'vegetable  product'
means product of or made of or out of
524
vegetable. 'Vegetables' as understood in common parlance are
not products of manufacture unless it is said that  agricul-
ture is an industry for certain purposes and vegetables	 are
products  of  that industry. In order to bring	an  industry
within	any of the entries in Schedule 1 it has to  be	seen
what is the end product produced by that industry. Sugarcane
is not a vegetable though it may be an agricultural product.
If the botanic meaning of vegetable as referring to any	 and
every  kind  of plant life is to be given then some  of	 the
industries  listed  in Schedule I like	Paper  Industry	 and
Textile	 Industry and even Chemical Industry which are	cov-
ered by other entries could also be brought within Entry 15.
The  word  'vegetable' in the context does not	attract	 the
botanic meaning. The sugar manufacturing industry does	not,
therefore,  come within Entry 15 of Schedule I of  the	Cess
Act. Consequently, the manufacture of alcohol from molasses,
which is a by product of manufacture of sugar, could not  be
considered to be an industry within Entry 15 of Schedule  I.
[534 C-E, F]
    2.1 The word 'vegetable' has been defined in many  ways.
From  the botanic point of view 'vegetable' may include	 any
plant but in common parlance it is understood as referred to
edible plants or parts of edible plants. Unless the  botani-
cal  meaning  is  given to the word 'vegetable'	 it  is	 not
possible to conclude sugarcane as vegetable. [528 C]
    2.2 <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Pollution Act</a> may be a regulating Act, but <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_9">Cess	 Act</a>
is  a  fiscal enactment. Therefore, the Court  has  to	look
merely	at  what is clearly said. There is no room  for	 any
intendment and no room for bringing within the provision  of
the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_10">Cess Act</a> anything by implication. [533 <a href="/doc/727298/" id="a_11">E,F]

for  such words shall normally depend on the  nature,  scope
and  purpose of the statute in which it is occurring and  to
the fitness of the matter to the
525
statute.  The meaning given to the same word occurring in  a
social security measure or a regulating enactment may not be
apposite  or. appropriate when the same word is	 interpreted
with  reference to a taxing state. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_14">The Cess Act</a> is a  fiscal
enactment. [534 B]
    3.1.  Processing of vegetable products industry is	nor-
mally understood in the sense that it relates to  processing
of vegetables, which even after processing retain its  char-
acter as vegetable. [530 H,531A]
    3.2 Processing as generally understood in marine,  agri-
cultural  and food products industries is an action,  opera-
tion or method of treatment applying it to something. It  is
refining, development, preparation or converting of material
especially  that  in a raw state into  marketable  form.  In
manufacture  something is brought into existence,  which  is
different from that originally existed in the sense that the
thing produced is by itself a commercially different commod-
ity,  whereas in the case of processing it is not  necessary
to produce a commercially different article. [531 C,D]
    3.3 Processing essentially effectuates a change in form,
cantour,  physical  appearance or  chemical  combination  or
otherwise  by  artificial or natural means and in  its	more
complicated form involves progressive action in	 performing,
producing or making something. [533 A,B]

<p id="p_4">    In this batch of civil appeals, writ petition and trans-
ferred	case, a common question of law arises as to  whether
the  industries which manufacture sugar from sugar cane	 are
covered	 by Entry 15 of Schedule I to the Water	 (Prevention
and  <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_16">Control of Pollution Cess Act</a>, 1977 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_17">(Central Act</a> 36  of
1977) (hereinafter called the '<a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_18">Cess Act</a>').
    Originally	the Water (Prevention and Control of  Pollu-
tion Act), 1974 (hereinafter called the Act) was enacted  by
the Parliament under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_19">Article 252</a> of the Constitution with  a
view  to control the pollution of rivers and  streams  which
has  assumed considerable importance and urgency  in  recent
years as a result of increasing industrialisation and urban-
isation. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_20">The Act</a> is intended to ensure that the domestic and
industrial  affluence are not allowed to be discharged	into
water coarses without adequate treatment. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_21">This Act</a> is now in
force in almost all States and in all Union Territories. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_22">The
Act</a> provides for the constitution of a Central Board by	 the
Central Government and State Boards by the State Governments
concerned for the prevention and control of water pollution.
There  are also certain provisions relating to	constitution
of joint boards the details of which need not detain us. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_23">The
Act</a>  sets  out in detail the functions and powers  of  these
Boards.	 Chapter VI of the Act requires the Central  Govern-
ment  and  the	State Governments to provide  funds  to	 the
Central	 Board and the State Boards respectively for  imple-
menting	 the provisions of the Act. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_24">The Cess Act</a> 36 of	1977
provides  for  levy  of cess on water  consumed	 by  persons
carrying on certain industries and by the local	 authorities
with  a view to augment the resources of the  Central  Board
and  the  State Boards constituted for	the  prevention	 and
control of water pollution. <a href="/doc/223295/" id="a_25">Section 3</a> of the Cess Act  which
may  be	 termed as the charging section states	that  "there
shall be levied and collected a cess for the purposes of the
Water  (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,  1974	 and
utilisation thereunder". The cess is payable by every person
carrying on any specified industry and every local authority
and  is	 calculated on the basis of water consumed  by	such
person or local authority as the case may be for any of	 the
purposes specified in column I of Schedule II to the Act, at
such  rate not exceeding the rates specified in	 the  corre-
sponding  Entry in column II thereof as the Central  Govern-
ment  may by notification in the Official Gazette from	time
to time, specify. "Specified industry" is defined in the Act
as  meaning any industry specified in Schedule I. There	 are
15 entries in Schedule I and they read as follows:

<p id="p_5">    The	 concerned  assessing authorities have	in  all	 the
cases  under  consideration issued notices  demanding  water
cess  from the sugar manufacturers on the ground  that	this
industry falls under item 15 "processing of animal or  vege-
table products industry". The Punjab and Haryana High  Court
and  the Allahabad High Court have taken the view  that	 the
sugar manufacturing industries would come within Entry 15 as
"processing vegetable products industry". On the other	hand
the  Andhra  Pradesh High Court and Patna  High	 Court	have
taken the view that sugar manufacturing industries would not
come  within Entry 15 of the ist Schedule. A  writ  petition
which  was filed in the High Court of Karnataka,  Bangalore,
by  one	 of  the sugar mills in	 Karnataka  raising  similar
question has been withdrawn to this Court in transfer  peti-
tion  No.  276	of 1984 to be dealt with  along	 with  other
appeals	 raising identical question. Similarly another	writ
petition has been withdrawn from the Allahabad High Court in
Transfer  Petition  No. 277 of 1984 to be dealt	 with  along
with this group of cases.
</p><p id="p_6">The object of the Act is to control the water pollution	 and
to ensure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">528</span>
that  industrial affluents are not allowed to be  discharged
into the water coarses without adequate treatment. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_28">The	Cess
Act</a>  is not an enactment to regulate and  control  pollution
but  a	fiscal measure to raise revenue for  augmenting	 the
resources  of  the Pollution Control Boards.  The  levy	 and
collection  of cess provided under the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_29">Cess Act</a> is on  water
consumed by persons carrying on the industries specified  in
the  Schedule. The Cess is levied on the person carrying  on
the  specified industry. The question is whether  industries
manufacturing sugar is covered by Entry 15 that is "process-
ing of vegetable product industry".

it is defined as follows:

<p id="p_9">    The	 interpretation of one of the entries in Schedule  I
to  the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_31">Cess Act</a> came up for consideration in  Member-Secre-
tary, Andhra Pradesh State Board for <a href="/doc/918244/" id="a_32">Prevention and  Control
of Water Pollution v. Andhra Pradesh Rayons Ltd. and others</a>,
[1989] 1 SCC 44. The question for consideration was  whether
manufacturing of rayon grade pulp a base material for  manu-
facturing of synthetics or manmade fabrics is an industry as
mentioned in Schedule I to the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_33">Cess Act</a>. It was held:
.lm13
	    "Whether a particular industry is an industry as
	    covered  in Schedule I of the Act, it has to  be
	    judged  normally by what that industry  produces
	    mainly. Every industry carries out	multifarious
	    activities	to  reach its goal  through  various
	    multifarious   methods.  Whether  a	  particular
	    industry  falls  within the realm  of  taxation,
	    must  be judged by the predominant	purpose	 and
	    process  and not by any ancillary or  incidental
	    process  carried on by a particular industry  in
	    running its business."
</p><p id="p_10">	    This Court also observed:

	    industry. The subject is not to be taxed without
	    clear  words  for that purpose,  and  also	that

	    ER, 473, 485. Justice Rowlatt of England said  a
	    long  time ago, that in a taxing Act one has  to
	    look merely at what is clearly said. There is no
	    room  for  any intendment. There  is  no  equity
	    about a tax. There is no presumption as to	tax.
	    Nothing  is	 to  be read in, nothing  is  to  be
	    implied. One has to look fairly at the  language
	    used. See the observations in Cape Brandy Syndi-
	    cate v. IRC, [1921] 1 KB 64, 71. This Court	 has
	    also reiterated the same view in <a href="/doc/1338548/" id="a_37">Gursahai Saigal

products  such as canning, freezing, drying, salting,  smok-
ing, peeling or rilleting and any other methods of  process-
ing which the authority made by notification in the official
Gazette specified in this behalf. Thus processing as  gener-
ally  understood in marine, agricultural and  food  products
industries  is an action, operation or method  of  treatment
applying  it  to  something. It	 is  refining,	development,
preparation  or converting of material especially that in  a
raw  state into marketable form. It would be interesting  to
note  that this Act contains a Schedule of the	agricultural
or processed food products" which are to be governed by	 the
Act which reads as follows:

<p id="p_15">    In	CST v.A.R.Alladin, AIR 1964 Guj. 27  the  expression
"who  processes any goods" in the Bombay Sales Tax was	held
to  refer to the subjecting of any goods to a  treatment  or
process. In Addl. <a href="/doc/1428161/" id="a_46">CIT v. Farrukhabad Cold Storage</a>, 1977	 (2)
ITJ  202 held that processing of goods means that the  goods
must  be adopted for a particular use. The variety  of	acts
performed  in  respect	of goods or their  subjection  to  a
process	 need not be such as may lead to the  production  of
any new article. The act of subjecting ' goods to a particu-
lar temperature for a long period of time as in cold storage
amounts	 to processing of goods. On the other hand  manufac-
ture is a transformation of an article which is commercially
different  from the one which is converted. The	 essence  of
manufacture  is the change of one object to another for	 the
purpose of making it marketable. <a href="/doc/923724/" id="a_47">In Union of India v.  Delhi
Cloth  and General Mills</a>, AIR 1963 SC 79 this Court  pointed
out:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">	      "The  word  'manufacture' used as	 a  verb  is
	      generally understood to mean as bringing	into
	      existence	 a new substance and does  not	mean
	      'merely'	to  produce some change	 in  a	sub-
	      stance,  however	minor  in  consequence,	 the
	      change may be."</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">    In	the  same decision the following  passage  from	 the
Permanent  Edition  of Words and Phrases  from	an  American
Judgment was quoted with approval:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">	      "Manufacture implies a change but every change
	      is not manufacture, and yet every change of an
	      article is the result of treatment, labour and
	      manipulation. But something more is  necessary
	      and  there must be transformation, a  new	 and
	      different	 article must emerges having a	dis-
	      tinctive name, character or use."
    The	 essential point thus is that in  manufacture  some-
</blockquote><p id="p_17">thing is brought into existence which is different from that
originally  existed in the sense that the thing produced  is
by itself a commercially different commodity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">533</span>
whereas	 in  the case of processing it is not  necessary  to
produce a commer-   cially different article.
    Processing	essentially  effectuates a change  in  form,
contour,  physical  appearance or  chemical  combination  or
otherwise  by  artificial or natural means and in  its	more
complicated form involves progressive action in	 performing,
producing  or making something. Vide Com  Products  Refining
</p><p id="p_18">60. v. Federal Trade Commission, CCA. 7, 144 F.2d 211.
    In the decisions under appeal, the Allahabad High  Court
held that sugar mills will come within the meaning of  'pro-
cessing	 vegetable  products industry' in Entry	 15  on	 the
ground that the word 'vegetable' has been used in opposition
to  the expression 'animal' and that it could not  be  given
the  meaning  of  vegetables which are kept  on	 the  dining
tables for dinner purposes, and it has a wider amplitude. It
was further of the view that in interpreting the word  'veg-
etable'	 one  has to keep in mind the object for  which	 the
<a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_48">Cess Act</a> was made. The learned Judges then stated that sugar
industry  is one of the main source of causing water  pollu-
tion and since the object of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_49">Pollution Act</a> and the	<a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_50">Cess
Act</a>  were intended to control water pollution and since	 the
entries are to be given a wider meaning sugar industry would
be covered by the Act.
</p><p id="p_19">    The Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court also took a similar line
of reasoning and said that 'vegetable products'	 essentially
mean  what  belongs to the plant kingdom as opposed  to	 the
animal	kingdom. In another words the word  'vegetable'	 has
been used in contra-distinction to the word 'animal'. Though
the learned Judges were not prepared.to hold that sugar cane
is  vegetable, the word 'product' gives a  definite  colour,
meaning	 thereby  all that belongs to the  world  of  plants
would come within the entry.
</p><p id="p_20">    We are unable to appredate the reasonings of the learned
judges.	 <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_51">Pollution Act</a> may be a regulating Act but <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_52">Cess	 Act</a>
is  a fiscal enactment, as is held by this Court  in  Member
Secretary,  Andhra  Pradesh State Board for  <a href="/doc/918244/" id="a_53">Prevention	 and
Control of Water Pollution v. Andhra Pradesh Rayons Ltd</a>. and
Others (supra) and <a href="/doc/1959505/" id="a_54">Rajasthan State Electricity Board v.	 The
Cess Appellate Committee &amp; Anr., JT</a> 1990 (4) SC 123.  There-
fore  we have to look merely at what is clearly said.  There
is  no	room  for any intendment and there is  no  room	 for
bringing within the provision of the Act anything by  impli-
cation.	 Unless	 we give the botanical meaning to  the	word
'vegetable'  it	 is not possible to conclude sugar  cane  as
vegetable.
</p><p id="p_21">    The	 Patna	High Court in Civil Writ  Jurisdiction	Case
Nos.  4413 of 1981 and 2346 of 1983 M/s Champaran Sugar	 Co.
Ltd. v. State of Bihar &amp;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">534</span>
Ors.  held that sugar manufacturing industry would not	fall
under Entry 15 Of Schedule I. The Andhra Pradesh High  Court
also  seems  to be as the same view and it had	dismissed  a
Writ Petition without a speaking order.
</p><p id="p_22">    Construction  of words and the meaning to be  given	 for
such  words shall normally depend on the nature,  scope	 and
purpose	 of the statute in which it is occurring and to	 the
fitness	 of the matter to the statute. The meaning given  to
the  same word occurring in a. social security measure or  a
regulating enactment may not be apposite or appropriate when
the  same  word is interpreted with reference  to  a  taxing
statute. <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_55">The Cess Act</a> is a fiscal enactment. In the  context
in which the word 'vegetable' is used in Entry 15 'vegetable
product'  means product of or made of or out  of  vegetable.
'Vegetables'  as  understood  in  common  parlance  are	 not
products of manufacture unless we say that agriculture is an
industry for certain purposes and vegetables are products of
that  industry. In order to bring an industry within any  of
the entires in Schedule I it has to be seen what is the	 end
product	 produced  by  that industry. Sugar cane  is  not  a
vegetable  though it may be an agricultural product. If	 the
botanic	 meaning of vegetable as referring to any and  every
kind  of plant life is to be given then some of	 the  indus-
tries  listed in Schedule I like Paper Industry and  Textile
Industry  and  even chemical industry which are	 covered  by
other  entries	could also be brought within Entry  15.	 The
word  vegetable in the context does not attract the  botanic
meaning. The sugar manufacturing industry do not, therefore,
come within Entry 15 of Schedule I of the Cess Act.
    In	Civil Appeal (arising out of Special Leave  Petition
No.  814  of 1990) the appellant is Haryana  Distillery	 who
purchases molasses which is a by-product of the .manufacture
of  sugar and manufactures alcohol. Manufacture of  alchohol
was held by the High Court to come within Entry 15 of Sched-
ule  I as processing agricultural prOduct industry. We	have
held already that the industry manufacturing sugar itself is
not an industry within the meaning of Entry 15 and a fortio-
ri  the	 manufacture of alcohol from molasses could  not  be
considered to be an industry within Entry 15 of Schedule I.
    In the result we allow Civil Appeals (arising out of SLP
Nos. 15828 of 1989, 7496 of 1989, 778, 814, 830, 1286,	1433
of  1990 and SLP No  .............. of 1991  entitled  Upper

1986 &amp; 91 of 1989 and dismiss Civil Appeals (arising out  of

lute.
