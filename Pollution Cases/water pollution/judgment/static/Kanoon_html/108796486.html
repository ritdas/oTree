</p><p id="p_4">        Learned counsel for the State has brought to our notice
that the Pollution Control Board informed the District
Administration to take action of disconnection of electricity
supply in respect of eight dairies. The list of those dairies reads
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "Closure orders u/s 33 (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>, 1974,
       issued to the Dairies discharging their effluent
      directly to River Gour:-</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">       S.No. Name of the dairy             Date of issue
                                           of Notice
       1         Wahid Dairy, Goriyaghat 21/03/2014
       2         Rajjak Dairy on the bank 21/03/2014
                 of River Gour, Goriyaghat
       3         Gulsan Dairy, Goriyaghat 21/03/2014
       4         Munna Shripal, Saliwara 21/03/2014
       5         Khatri Dairy, Saliwara    21/03/2014
       6         Vijay Khatri Dairy,       21/03/2014
                 Saliwara
       7         Janta Dairy, Saliwara     21/03/2014
       8         Babbu Yadav Dairy,        21/03/2014
                 Goriyaghat

     He submits that the electricity supply has already been
disconnected in respect of these dairies. We place that
statement on record.
</p><p id="p_6">     At the same time, counsel for the said dairy owners
submitted, on instructions, that the statement made by the
counsel for the State is inaccurate. According to the said dairy
owners, the electricity supply is still continuing and is
uninterrupted.
</p><p id="p_7">     We are not examining this controversy, for the present,
as the hearing of these petitions is being deferred till 29th
April, 2014.
</p><p id="p_8">        In the meantime, we expect the petitioners to furnish us
information/details regarding the names of dairies area-wise
and separate list of dairies abutting the three rivers referred to
in the petitions.
</p><p id="p_9">      In the meantime, we direct the Secretary of Pollution
Control Board to depute responsible officials to carry out
surprise inspection before tomorrow in respect of eight dairies,
as it is submitted on behalf of those dairies that remedial
measures have been taken and the dairies have substantially
complied with all the requirements and have removed the
deficiencies pointed out by the Pollution Control Board by
ensuring that no water is discharged in the river abutting the
concerned dairy.
</p><p id="p_10">      Whether the used water by the dairies is the potential
cause of pollution because of storage, is also an issue to be
examined by the Pollution Control Board and report in that
behalf be submitted to the Court on the next date i.e.
29/4/2014.
</p><p id="p_11">      The petitioners are at liberty to accompany the officials
of the Pollution Control Board when the surprise visit will be
made by them provided the concerned petitioner is given one
hour prior notice in that behalf on mobile number, details
whereof are furnished to the counsel for the Pollution Control
Board.
</p><p id="p_12">        The petitioners are also at liberty to approach the office
of the Collector for collecting information to be supplied to the
Court. We hope and trust that appropriate response will be
given by the Office of the Collector keeping in mind that the
matter is now returnable on 29.4.2014 for furnishing that
information.
