                          This writ application has been filed by the petitioners

          for issuance of directions to hold and declare that the Bihar State

          Pollution Control Board (for short 'the Board') will not come

          appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the petitioners

          have filed the present writ application in representative capacity

          espousing the cause of all the employees, working as well as retired,

          of 'the Board', as the officers and employees of 'the Board' have

          authorized them to file the writ application on their behalf. He

          would submit that 'the Board' was constituted under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of

          the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (a

          of a body corporate with power subject to the provisions of 'the

          Act' to acquire, hold and dispose of property and to contract. He

          would submit that besides the objectives, which the Board had to

          achieve under 'the Act', <a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_5">Section 12(3A)</a> of 'the Act' provides the

          method of recruitment and the terms and conditions of service of

          officers and employees of 'the Board' by which they would be

</p><p id="p_19">                          3.    He would submit that 'the Board' having been

          conceived and constituted for the first time on 07.11.1974 is not

          having any of such regulation till date. However, on 08.08.1978, in

          its 2nd meeting, 'the Board', in absence of any such rules/regulations

          made by 'the Board', by its resolution decided to adopt the methods

          of recruitment applicable to the State Government officers and

          employees.

          for all its officers and employees in the State Bank of India, Main

          Branch, Patna and the Members Secretary of 'the Board' was

          authorized to operate the said account. It was decided to transfer the

          amount deducted for the purpose of G.P.F. by 'the Board' to the

          bank account in individual names for the purpose of provident fund.

          It was further resolved in the said meeting that pending framing of

          rules by 'the Board' in connection with provident fund, the

          withdrawal of the accounts will be made by the Member Secretary

          in accordance with rules relating to General Provident Fund.

</p><p id="p_21">                          5.     He would contend that in terms of the decision

          taken in 16th Board meeting dated 06.08.1983, after deducting

          provident fund amount from salary of each officer and employee of

          'the Board', the same were deposited in their respective provident

          fund accounts maintained at S.B.I., Main Branch, Patna.

</p><p id="p_22">                          6.     He would submit that 'the Board' in its 26th

          meeting held on 25.07.1986 decided that in absence of service rules

          for its employees, the service rules applicable for the employees of

          the Bihar State Government will be applicable to the employees of

          'the Board' also, but on 29.11.1994, 'the Board', in its 52nd

          meeting, all of a sudden decided to adopt 'the EPF and MP Act,

          1952' for its officers and employees. He would contend that the

          subsequent decision of 'the Board' to adopt 'the EPF and MP Act,

          1952' was a departure from its earlier decisions, especially the
 5   Patna High Court CWJC No.7268 of 2015 dt. 20 -06-2017

                                           5 / 12




          Board's decision taken on 25.07.1986, in the 26th meeting and the

          same was issued by 'the Board' in violation of the principles of

          natural justice and without serving any notice to its employees and

          without taking most of them into confidence.

</p><p id="p_23">                           7.     He would contend that the officers and employees

          of 'the Board' are entitled to get pension at par with the employees

          working in the State Government in the light of the Board's

          resolution dated 25.07.1986 and 'the Board' is duty bound to pay

          G.P.F.     and        pension    to       its   retired   or   likely   to   retire

          officers/employees in the light of previous decision of 'the Board'.

          filed their respective counter affidavits in the matter.

          behalf of 'the Board' submitted that the decision with regard to

          making available the benefits under 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952'

          was taken by 'the Board' with a pious intention in order to ensure

          the proper management of the provident fund of the Board's

          employees. She would submit that there was no denial of statutory

          retiral benefits to the employees. The same has also been accepted

          by the officers and employees of 'the Board'. She would submit

          that 'the Board' always tried to keep parity with the benefits given

          by the State Government to its employees. She would submit that
 6   Patna High Court CWJC No.7268 of 2015 dt. 20 -06-2017

                                           6 / 12




          'the Board', which is an autonomous body, has neither adopted the

          Bihar Pension Rules, 1950 nor it has taken any decision to pay to its

          employees pension under the said rules and, therefore, the

          petitioners cannot claim that on completing qualifying service of ten

          years they are entitled for pension as in case of the Government

          employees. She would contend that 'the EPF and MP, Act, 1952',

          can be made is applicable to any establishment where the

          employees along with employer choose to become part of the

          management under 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952'. In the present

          case also, the employees along with employer chose to become part

          of the management under 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952'. The

          employees, who missed in giving their consent for joining the

          arrangement did not subsequently file any objection or any

          reservation in joining into the arrangement under 'the EPF and MP

          Act, 1952'. She would contend that since 'the Board' has adopted

          'the EPF and MP Act, 1952' for its officers and employees, it has

          never resolved to implement the pension rules of the State

          Government officers and employees. She would contend that the

          decision taken by 'the Board', in its 26th meeting held on 25th July,

          1986, is not with respect to making the Bihar Pension Rules

          applicable to its employees.

<p id="p_26">                          10.     Mr. Prashant Sinha, learned advocate appearing
 7   Patna High Court CWJC No.7268 of 2015 dt. 20 -06-2017

                                           7 / 12




          for the respondent nos.3 and 4 would submit that this writ

          application filed in the representative capacity is not maintainable

          particularly when the petitioners are not even a registered trade

          union. He would submit that since the petitioner nos.2, 3 and 5 have

          already retired, they are being paid their pension under the

          Employees Pension Scheme, 1995. Similarly, there are several other

          retired employees, who are also getting pension under the

          Employees Pension Scheme, 1995. He would submit that if 'the

          Board' excludes all such employees from the purview of 'the EPF

          and MP Act, 1952', all such employees will be adversely affected.

          He would submit that 'the Board' never adopted the G.P.F. scheme

          of the State Government, rather it decided to open the P.P.F.

          account of the individual employees with the State Bank of India.

          According to him, the operation of the P.P.F. account cannot be

          made in accordance with the G.P.F. Rules of the State Government

          and, hence, the contention of the petitioners is totally misconceived.

</p><p id="p_27">                          11.     In reply, Mr. Chitranjan Sinha, learned Senior

          Advocate for the petitioners would submit that 'the Board' does not

          come within the purview of 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952' because as

          per <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_6">Section 16(1)(c)</a> of the said Act, if any establishment,

          constituted under any Central/State legislation, has its own rules

          with regard to Contributory Provident Fund or old age pension then
 8   Patna High Court CWJC No.7268 of 2015 dt. 20 -06-2017

                                           8 / 12




          said establishment is excluded from purview of 'the EPF and MP

          Act, 1952'. He would submit that 'the Board' till date has not

          formulated any rules and has adopted all the rules and regulations

          governing the State Government to its employees including the

          rules and regulations governing the post retiral benefits. He would

          contend that 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952' is basically for industrial

          and factory workers/labourers and not for employees like the

          employees of 'the Board', who are getting salary and all the pay

          revisions admissible to the State Government employees. For such

          employees, the ceiling of contribution prescribed under 'the EPF

          and MP Act, 1952' is very miniscule and inadequate to maintain the

          standard of living, which they are used to their pre-retirement. He

          would contend that the contention of respondent nos.3 and 4 that

          many retired employees of 'the Board' will be adversely affected

          since they are getting pension from their corpus built under the

          contributory provident fund under 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952' is

          false and misleading. He would submit that if this Court would hold

          that employees of 'the Board' do not come within the purview of

          'the EPF and MP Act, 1952' because of the bar under <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_7">Section

          16(1)(c)</a> all the retired employees of 'the Board' will become

          entitled for G.P.F. and old age pension, as applicable to the retired

          employees of the State Government and the benefits under the
 9   Patna High Court CWJC No.7268 of 2015 dt. 20 -06-2017

                                           9 / 12




          G.P.F. and old age pension, as applicable to the retired employees

          of the State Government, is much higher and lucrative, as compared

          to what the said employees are now getting. He would contend that

          the objections raised by the respondents are without any merit and

          are fit to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                          12.     I have carefully considered the rival contentions

          advanced on behalf of the parties and perused the materials

          available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                          13.     It is an admitted position that 'the Board' has

          been constituted under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> of 'the Act, which is a Central

          legislation. Thus, the question raised by the petitioners regarding

          the applicability or non-applicability of 'the EPF and MP Act,

          1952' with regard to 'the Board' is to be seen in the light of <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_9">Section

          16(1)(c)</a> of the said Act, which reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                             "16(1)(c): This Act shall not apply ... (c) to any

           any scheme or rule framed under that Act governing the benefits of

           Contributory Provident Fund or Old Age Pension. It is an admitted

           position on behalf of the parties that no scheme or rule has been

           framed under 'the Act' governing the benefits of Contributory

           Provident Fund or Old Age Pension so far. Thus, 'the Board' cannot

           be excluded from the purview of 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952'.

           in research and development relating to water pollution. Such an

           activity has been included under the schedule of employment of 'the

           petitioners on resolution of 'the Board' as contained in Board's

           Office Order dated 11.08.1986 for its exclusion from the purview of

           'the EPF and MP Act, 1952' is devoid of any merit because the said

           resolution only talks about adoption of service regulation applicable

           upon the employees of the State Government. It does not talk about

           framing of any scheme or rule governing the benefit of Contributory

           Provident Fund and Old Age Pension.

           'the Board' held on 15.09.1979, as contained in Annexure-2 to the

           writ application, clearly lays down that 'the Board' intended to open

</p><p id="p_36">                           18.    I am also of the opinion that such type of writ

           application in representative capacity by some of the employees of

           the 'the Board' cannot be entertained. Admittedly, out of the five

           petitioners in the present case, four have already retired and they are

           getting pension under the Employees Pension Scheme, 1995. There

           are several other employees, who may also be getting pension under

           the Employees Pension Scheme, 1995. They have not joined the

           writ application. The prayer made on behalf of the petitioners

           cannot be allowed without hearing those persons, who are getting

           pension under the Employees Pension Scheme, 1995 or, who are

           members of the Employees Pension Scheme, 1995.

                                                     12 / 12




                     employer have chosen to become part of the management under 'the

                     EPF and MP Act, 1952', if 'the Board' is excluded from the

                     purview of 'the EPF and MP Act, 1952', all such employees would

                     be adversely affected, as membership of the Employees Provident

                     Fund Scheme is sine qua none for getting pension under the

                     Employees Pension Scheme, 1995.

<p id="p_38">                                     20.    I am also of the opinion that since 'the Board'

                     has never issued resolution to implement the pension rules of the

                     State Government, i.e. the Bihar Pension Rules, 1950 for its officers

                     and employees, it would be highly improper for this Court to issue

                     any mandamus in this regard.

<p id="p_39">                                     21. Accordingly, the writ application, being devoid of

                     any merit, is dismissed.
