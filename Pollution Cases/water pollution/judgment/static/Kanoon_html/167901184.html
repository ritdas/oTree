     By this writ-application in the nature of a public interest
litigation, the petitioner, a resident of Jamnagar and a
Chartered Accountant by profession, has brought to our notice
that the respondent No.4, in collusion with the respondent
No.3, has constructed 26 shops on the common plot of the
respondent No.3 Society, without any permission from the
Jamnagar Urban Development Authority as well as the
Jamnagar Municipal Corporation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     In such circumstances referred to above, the petitioner

      pleased to direct the respondents to maintain status quo
      in relation to subject land and property. "
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">2.    The case made out by the petitioner in this petition may
be summarized as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.1   According to the petitioner, the respondent is a Co-
operative Housing Society, registered under the Gujarat Co-
operative <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_1">Societies Act</a>. The respondent No.4 is a builder and
developer of the land.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.2   The respondent No.3 Society entered into a development
agreement with the respondent No.4 for construction of around
26 shops on the common plot of the Society, which is even
otherwise not permissible in law.
</p>
<p id="p_11">2.3   According to the petitioner, after execution of such
agreement dated 28th September, 2011 referred to above, the
respondent No.4, without getting any plans sanctioned from
the competent authority or without seeking any appropriate
permission in that regard, proceeded ahead to construct 26
shops on the common plot of the respondent No.3 Society.
</p>
<p id="p_12">2.4   It is also the case of the petitioner that the officers of the
Jamnagar Urban Development Authority and the officers of the
Jamnagar Municipal Corporation connived with the respondent
Nos. 3 and 4 and failed to take appropriate action in that
regard at appropriate time. According to the petitioner, if the
respondent Nos. 1 and 2 would have restrained the respondent
No.4 in the first instance, then in such circumstances, the
respondent No.4 could not have proceeded to construct 26

shops on the common plot of the respondent No.3 Society.
</p>
<p id="p_13">2.5   According to the petitioner, no common plot which is
earmarked at the time of granting N.A permission can be
converted for any use other than for the purpose earmarked.
Even the General Development Control Regulations framed by
the authority prohibits construction on a common plot.
</p>
<p id="p_14">2.6   According to the petitioner, a common plot in any
residential society is meant for common use and common
purposes of all the members of the society, and the society, in
no circumstances could have entered into such an agreement
with the respondent No.4 for construction of shops.
</p>
<p id="p_15">3.    This Court, vide order dated 23rd January, 2014, directed
the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 to file affidavit indicating whether
the area in dispute is the common plot of the society in
question, and secondly, whether any permission had been
granted by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for making the
construction on the said common plot.
</p>
<p id="p_16">4.    Pursuant to our order referred to above, the respective
respondents have filed their affidavits.

<p id="p_19">"4. I say that after taking over the charge as Chief
Executive Authority of the respondent No. 1 on 11.
09.2012, when it has come to my knowledge that
respondent No. 3 society is doing construction in
common plot of the society without permission, I issued a
notice dated 11. 10.2012 to the respondent No. 3
Tarmamad Cooperative Housing Society Ltd., under Rule
11 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development
Rules, 1979 calling upon respondent no. 3 to stop
construction in the common plot and demolish the same
as the construction is in violation of Section 27 of the
Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976
and restore the original position of the common plot. I
say that before my appointment as C.E. A. of Respondent
No. 1, my predecessor also issued notices on 1.6.2012 &amp;
25.06.2012, under Rule 11 the Gujarat Town Planning
and Urban Development Rules, 1979 to respondent No.
3 Society for removal of the unauthorized construction. I
say that I have not received any reply from the
respondent No. 3 of my notice (No. 3)and therefore I had
taken decision and passed order on 6.3.2013 for removal
of the unauthorized construction made by the respondent
No. 3 society on common plot of dated 6.03.2013 served
upon the respondent No. 3 society is annexed hereto and
marked as "Annexure-R" to this reply .
</p>
<p id="p_20">5. I say that respondent no. 3 society challenged the
order dated 6.03.2013 passed by me under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_2">Section 36(5)</a>
</p><p id="p_21">(b) by way of filing the Regular Civil Suit No. 62 of 2013
in the Court of Learned 13th Addl. Senior Civil Judge,
Jamnagar and also filed application Ex. 5 for injunction in
the said suit. In the said suit, notices was issued by the
Civil Court upon the respondent no. 1, JADA which was
served upon the JADA on 16.3.2013 and on behalf of the
JADA reply to the application EX. 5 as well written
statement already        is filed before the Civil Court,
Jamnagar. I say that as per the advice that pending the
application for injunction under Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 w/r S
151 of the Civil Procedure Code, I cannot take action for
demolishing unauthorized construction made by the
respondent no. 3 Society. Due that reason I have not
implemented the order dated 6.3.2013. I say I have not
implemented the order due to pendency of application
for injunction application filed by the respondent no. 3
society as advised. I say that now the suit is posted for
hearing on 7th February, 2014.

      read contention and averment made in the memo of the

      guilty of making false allegation in the petition, and
      petitioner try to mislead Hon'ble Court and petitioner has
      not cared to file the present PIL in the prescribed format
      as per the High Court of Gujarat (Practice and Procedure
      for Public Interest Litigation) Rules, 2010 and as the
      subject matter of the present Writ Petition PIL is sub

deponent is hereby denied and as such just to create
sympathy the said allegation is made without substance
and if it is so then whether petitioner has approached to
the concerned police authority regarding the said alleged
threat to the petitioner and or to their family members.
This type of attitude and practice is to be depreciated
and as such no cause of action arises for the petitioner to
move the present PIL.
</p>
<p id="p_28">8. I say and submit that the petitioner has made false
statement in the present petition that illegal
construction is going on. The Photographs produced by
the petitioner himself on Page-22 to 24 as such
construction hass already completed and as per the say
of the petitioner no construction work is going on and
petitioner has made contrary statement to the evidence
produced on record.
</p>
<p id="p_29">9. I say and submit that the petitioner is not entitled for
any relief or interim orders by way of present PIL as the
cause narrated by the petitioner is already subject
matter of the Ld. Civil Court, Jamnagar and also before
the authority concerned for regularization and in this
type of circumstance if Hon'ble High Court will pass any
orders against the answering deponent in that event
Civil Court will be influenced and it will lead to serious
prejudice and to get remedy through appropriate forum
will also be affected, hence the petition deserves to be
dismissed with cost and further deponent would like to
declare that the present petitioner has filed the present
petition (PIL) with ulterior motive and as such members
of society are not having any complaint regarding, and
on the contrary the shops are constructed with a view to
get essential amenities to the society at large.
</p>
<p id="p_30">10. I say and submit that in the facts of the case there
does not appear to be any substantial public interest
involved in the matter and hence on this ground also the
writ petition is required to be dismissed.

<p id="p_31">11. At the outset I deny all the statements, averments
and the contentions made in the above writ petition.

petitioner has in fact acted in the malafide manner by

      suppressing vital facts/making false statements in the
      petition, which itself is sufficient to disentitle him for
      grant of any reliefs. I deny that the petitioner has made
      out strong prima facie case for grant of any relief. I deny
      that the petitioner has made out a prima facie case for
      grant of any relief as claimed, much less a case for any
      relief. I say t hat as no public interest has been evinced
      in the petition, the question of considering any test of
      alternative efficacious remedy does not arise in any
      case. "

      and the answering deponent reserves the right to file a

filed on 24.12.2013 and it was registered on 26.12.2013
and thereafter petitioner has prepared notice on back
dated of 26.12.2013 and submitted on 30.12.2013 to the
concern authorities that is respondents no. 1 and 2 a
view to fill up lacuna and that notices are cleverly
produced with the draft amendment on 09.01.2014 on
the first day of hearing and further I would like to draw
the kind attention of Hon'ble High Court that in the said
notice there is no whisper of filing of present PIL before
the Hon'ble High Court on 24.12.2013 and sorry for
repetition with a view to came out from the Para-6 of the
prescribed format and the reason canvassed is contrary
and very lose statement and baseless wild allegations
are made by the petitioner and this type of practice is to
be deprecated.
</p>
<p id="p_36">6. Further the answering deponent would like to draw the
kind attention of Hon'ble High Court that the petitioner
has filed two affidavits in support of present PIL ie.
23.12.2013 and 24.12.2013 and it is a matter of inquiry
that for what purpose two affidavits are prepared for on
petition on different dates and it is to be looked into the
seriously and it requires detailed investigation/inquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_37">7. The present petition of the petition is deserved to be
dismissed on the ground of suppression of material facts
that the same subject matter is pending before the Ld.
Trial Court of Jamnagar as initiated by the respondent no.
</p><p id="p_38">3. It is settled position of law that if the same subject
matter is pending before the one appropriate authority in
that event for the same cause PIL is not maintainable and
further the judgment relied by the petitioner in the
present petition are on different facts of circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_39">8. I say and submit that there is no cause of action for
the petitioner to file present PIL and this is filed with
some oblique motive and it is unnecessarily dragged on
respondents in the present petition as the base of the
petition itself is on false statements that construction
work is going but the photographs are produced by the
petitioner is in that as such it shows that the construction
work is already over and appropriate authority has
already incited effective steps what prayed in the present
petition.

      construction is done with a view to help the society and
      further public at large and as such there is no hazards as
      mention by the petitioner in the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      10. Looking to the sets of circumstance of the petition is
      frivolous and not generated the real cause of PIL and it
      requires to be dismissed with heavy cost that the said PIL
      is filed without verifying actual, factual and correct
      position and loose allegations are made which is
      unwarranted and just to create sympathy the said are
      mention in the present PIL and as such there is no
      evidence regarding the same."

and further it is also not in dispute that no permission has been
obtained either by the respondent No.3 or the respondent No.4
before putting up construction of 26 shops.
</p>
<p id="p_44">9.2   Mr. Oza submitted that in the first place the society itself
is at fault because it could not have entered into an agreement
with the respondent No.4 for construction of shops on the
common plot of the society. According to Mr. Oza, a common
plot cannot be used for any purpose other than the one for
which it is reserved.    Mr. Oza levelled serious allegations as
regards the highhandedness and brazen attitude of the
respondent No.4 in making such construction on the common
plot of the society.     Mr. Oza submitted that the authorities
were quite alive to the fact that such construction was being

made on the common plot, yet the authorities kept quiet and
permitted the respondent No.4 to complete the construction.
</p>
<p id="p_45">9.3     According to Mr. Oza, the illegal and unauthorized
constructions of buildings and other structure not only violate
the Municipal laws and the concept of planned development of
the particular area, but also affect various fundamental and
constitutional rights of other persons. Mr. Oza would submit
that this is a fit case in which the authorities should be
directed        to         immediately     demolish        the     unauthorized
construction and restore the common plot of the Society to its
original position.

whether we should direct the authorities concerned                              to
demolish the construction of the 26 shops made on the
common plot of the Society.

<p id="p_66">15.   The following facts are not in dispute:-
</p>
<p id="p_67">(a)     The respondent No.3 Society has entered into a
        development agreement with the respondent No.4
        builder, dated 28th September, 2011, by which it has
        been agreed that the respondent No.4 shall construct
        26 shops of around 125 to 150 square feet on the
        common plot of the Society, facing the main road.
</p>
<p id="p_68">(b)     Neither          the   respondent          No.3   has   obtained       any
        permission to enter into such an agreement, which is
        dehors the provisions of the Gujarat Co-operative
        Societies Act, from any competent authority under the
        Act, nor the respondent No.4 has obtained any
        permission for putting up construction of 26 shops on
        the common plot of the Society.
</p>
<p id="p_69">(c)     Without placing for approval any building plans for such
        construction and seeking appropriate permission from
        the authority, the construction of 26 shops has been
        completed on the common plot of the Society.

<p id="p_70">(d)     The Jamnagar Urban Development Authority initiated
        the proceedings in the year 2012, for demolition of the
        shops by issuing a notice under the provisions of the

        with law.
</p>
<p id="p_71">(e)     The notice which was issued by the authority for
        demolition was challenged by the Society, by filing a
        Civil Suit in the Civil Court at Jamnagar, however, till
        this date, the Exh.5 application praying for injunction
        has not been pursued.

<p id="p_73">17.   This petition portrays an extremely sorry state of affairs
at the end of the authorities, namely, the Jamnagar Urban
Development Authority as well as the Jamnagar Municipal
Corporation.       We are reminded of the observations made by
the Supreme Court in the case of Delhi Development Authority
Vs. Skipper Construction Company Private Limited and anr.
reported in (1996) 4 SCC 622, in connection with the menace
of illegal and unauthorized construction of buildings and other
structures. The observations are worth noting.

      means the rich and the influential class of the society)
      have made the " property career" the sole aim of their
      life. The means have become irrelevant in a land where

      contempt for it; the feeling that law is meant for lesser
      mortals and not for them. The courts in the country have
      been trying to combat this trend, with some success as
      the recent events show. But how many matters can we
      handle. How many more of such matters are still there?
      The real question is how to swing the polity into action, a
      polity which has become indolent and soft in its vitals?
      Can the courts alone do it? Even so, to what extent, in
      the prevailing state of affairs? Not that we wish to launch
      upon a diatribe against anyone in particular but Judges
      of this Court are also permitted, we presume, to ask in
      anguish, "what have we made of our country in less than
      fifty years"? Where has the respect and regard for law
      gone? And who is responsible for it ?

<p id="p_74">18.   It appears that the questions which were posed by the
Supreme Court remains unanswered even after almost two
decades of making such observations.
</p>
<p id="p_75">19.   According to the definition of "common plot" as contained
in the General Development Control Regulations of JADA, a
common plot shall mean a common open space exclusive of
margins and approaches, at a height not more than ground
level of the building unit.    The owner shall have to give an
undertaking that the common plot shall be for the common use
of all the residents and occupants of the building unit, free of
cost. On sanction of the development permission, the common
plot shall be deemed to have been vested in the Society/
Association of the residents/occupants. In case such Society or
the Association is to be formed, the possession/custody of
common plot shall remain with the competent authority until
such Association/Society is formed. The common plot shall not
be sold to any other person and it shall not be put to any other
use, except for the common use of the residents/occupants.

</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">20. Thus, from the above, it is very clear that under no
circumstances, any construction can be made on a common
plot. It is not the case of the Society that there was alteration
in the N.A plan, which was approved by the competent
authority under the Bombay Land Revenue Code, read with the
Rules and the common plot had ceased to be a common plot. It
appears from the agreement entered into between the Society
and the builder, which is on record, that the common plot has
continued as the common plot and the entire area of common
plot is resolved to be handed over to the respondent No.4 for
construction of 26 shops, which is not permissible in law. The
respondent No.4, in brazen defiance of the provisions of law,
proceeded ahead with the construction of the 26 shops without
any valid permission from the authority concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_79">21.   We are not at all impressed by the submission canvassed
on behalf of the Society as well as the builder that this public
interest litigation should not be entertained as a Civil Suit in
connection with the same subject matter is pending before the
Civil Court for adjudication.     Mr. Paul, the learned counsel
appearing for the respondent No.4 builder as well as Mr.
Nangesh, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent
No.3 Society have placed strong reliance on the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Santosh Sood (supra), however,
in our opinion, the said decision will have no application to the

case at hand. In the said case, a public interest litigation (PIL)
was filed by the first respondent before the High Court praying
inter-alia for the following reliefs:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      "(i) That the concerned authorities may kindly be
      directed to take immediate possession of the property in
      question from respondent No. 7 and cancel the order of
      transfer in the records of Municipal Council, Sheopur.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      (ii) That the authorities may kindly be directed to take
      strict disciplinary and criminal action against the officers
      who have indulged in the illegal act causing loss to the
      Government as well as Municipal Council, Sheopur.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      (iii) That the loss which has been caused may kindly be
      ordered to be recovered from the officers and other
      persons who are liable for the same."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_80">22.   In the said case, the appellant had obtained a loan from
one of the respondents, namely the State Bank of Indore, for
construction of the building, which was to be let out to the
Bank upon completion of the construction.       The respondent-
bank verified the title of the appellant and had also obtained
legal opinion as regards the title. The property was ready and
was thereafter let out on rent by the appellant to the Bank for
its use.     As it involved a substantial expenditure and also
public money, the Bank had serious apprehensions of being
dispossessed when the writ-petition (PIL) was entered by the
High Court.       Before the High Court, it was submitted by the
Bank that it was ready to pay the rent either to the respondent
No.7 or to the appellant, but in any event, not to both the
parties. It was apprehended by the Bank that if an order would
be passed by the High Court with regard to dispossession, it
would involve a huge loss pertaining to the furnishing and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                               Page 21 of 40</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">         C/WPPIL/347/2013                                         CAV JUDGMENT</span>




shifting      of the premises, besides loss of business due to
shifting. In such circumstances, permission was sought by the
Bank to deposit the rent with the appellant till the liquidation
of the loan amount due to the Bank. It appears that the High
Court      directed         the   respondents         for    taking    steps    for
dispossessing the appellant from the disputed land. It appears
that a Civil Suit was also filed before the Civil Judge with regard
to the selfsame property and in the said Suit, the petitioners
had obtained an injunction in their favour and the same was in
operation till the pendency of the Suit.                     It was during the
pendency of such Civil Suit that a public interest litigation was
filed by the first respondent before the High Court. The first
respondent contended that despite unsuccessful attempts on
the part of the appellant to establish ownership qua the land,
which in fact was vested in the respondent No.6 Nagar Palika,
the appellant, in collusion with its officers, managed to see
that it did not take steps for eviction.                    In the said PIL, the
appellant was also arrayed as one of the respondents. Before
the Supreme Court, it was argued that when a complicated
question of title by and between the appellant and the Nagar
Palika was pending before a Civil Court for its adjudication,
then     in such           circumstances,     a      public interest     litigation
involving a question of title to the property could not have
been entertained. In such circumstances, the Supreme Court
took the view that the public interest litigation should not have
been entertained and at the best, the High Court should have
directed the Civil Judge to take up the hearing of the Civil Suit
at the earliest.
</p>
<p id="p_81">23.     First, we are of the opinion that the Supreme Court has
not laid down as an absolute proposition of law that if a Civil



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                     Page 22 of 40</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">       C/WPPIL/347/2013                               CAV JUDGMENT</span>




Suit is pending, then in any circumstances a public interest
litigation cannot be entertained with respect to the same
subject matter and secondly, the facts in the said case were
altogether different. What appealed the most to the Supreme
Court was that in the Civil Suit, an injunction was also
operating, which had been confirmed till the final disposal of
the Suit, and further it involved a complicated question of title
by and between the appellant and the Nagar Palika.
</p>
<p id="p_82">24.   Such is not the position so far as the case at hand is
concerned. There is no question of any dispute as regards the
title to the property.     What has been challenged by the
respondent No.3 Society in the Civil Suit is the action of the
JADA in issuing notice for demolition of the unauthorized
construction. It may not be out of place to state that the Suit
was filed only with a view to stall the proceedings.            If the
Society as a plaintiff was so serious in pursuing the same, then
they would not have kept Exh.5 application for injunction
pending for consideration till this date.      The Society has never
bothered to pursue the Exh.5 application. The authorities also
are trying to shirk from their liability by submitting that since a
Civil Suit was pending, they thought fit not to go ahead with
the implementation of the notice. Mere pendency of the Civil
Suit without any order of injunction should not have precluded
the authorities to go ahead with the implementation of the
notice for demolition, which was made the subject matter of
challenge in the Civil Suit.

decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Meghwal Samaj
Shiksha Samiti Vs. Lakh Singh and ors., reported in (2011) 11
SCC 800, wherein the Supreme Court in paragraph 6 made the
following observations:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      "6.    The appellants contended that a civil suit filed by the
      villagers for a similar relief is pending and in view of it, the
      public interest litigation ought not to have been entertained.
      Mere pendency of a suit by others, will not affect the
      maintainability of the writ petition in public interest."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_84">26.   Mr. Oza, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
petitioner is justified in submitting that the authorities wanted
some excuse here or there to protect the respondent No.3 as
well as the respondent No.4, and therefore, have come forward
with a very feeble excuse that since the Civil Suit is pending,
they have restrained themselves from proceeding ahead.
</p>
<p id="p_85">27.   We are also not impressed by the submission of Mr.
Nangesh, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent
No.3 Society that his client has filed an application for
regularization of the construction under the provisions of the
Gujarat Regularization of Unauthorised Development Act,
2011. This again is one more dubious tactic adopted by the
respondent No.3 to salvage the situation. The respondent No.3
Society may have filed such an application, but in our opinion,
by merely filing such an application the construction which is
otherwise per-se illegal cannot be saved. The provisions of the
Gujarat Regularisation of Unauthorized Development Act, 2011
has no application to the case at hand. <a href="/doc/143764/" id="a_4">Section 5</a> of the Act,
2011 makes it very clear that it is only if a notice is issued to

2011, requiring such owner or occupier to remove or pull down

only after the notice of 2012 that the Civil Suit was also filed.
In such circumstances, in our opinion, the provisions of the Act,
2011 are in no manner helpful to the respondent No.3. In this
context, we may also refer to <a href="/doc/1126943/" id="a_6">Section 8(4)</a> of the Act, 2011,
which reads as under:-

obligation under the statute to see that the residential area
was not spoilt by unauthorized construction. The Court
observed that the scheme was for the benefit of the residents
of the locality and the municipality acted in aid of the scheme.
The rights of the residents in the area were invaded by an
illegal construction. The Court proceeded further to observe
that it had to be remembered that a scheme in a residential
area meant planned orderliness in accordance with the
requirements of the residents. If the scheme was nullified by
arbitrary acts in excess and derogation of the powers of the
municipality, the courts would quash orders passed by the
municipalities in such cases. The Court also proceeded further
to observe that the Court enforces the performance of

        municipal and other regulatory bodies turn blind
        eye either due to the influence of higher
        functionaries of the State of other extraneous
        reasons. Those who construct buildings in violation

and open spaces, the density of population, and the
location and use of buildings and structures. All these
have in our view and do achieve the larger purpose of
the public health, safety or general welfare. So are front
setback provisions, average alignments and structural
alterations. Any violation of zoning and regulation laws
takes the toll in terms of public welfare and conveniences
being sacrificed apart from the risk, inconvenience and
hardship which is posed to the occupants of building.

<p id="p_96">Though the municipal laws permit deviations from
sanctioned     constructions    being    regularised    by
compounding but that is by way of exception.
Unfortunately the exception, with the lapse of time and
frequent exercise of the discretionary power conferred
by such exception, has become the rule. Only such
deviations deserve to be condoned as are bona fide or
are attributable to some misunderstanding or are such
deviations as where the benefit gained by demolition
would be far less than the disadvantage suffered. Other
than these, deliberate deviations do not deserve to be
condoned and compounded. Compounding of deviations
ought to be kept at a bare minimum. The cases of
professional builders stand on a different footing from an
individual constructing his own building. A professional
builder is supposed to understand the laws better and
deviations by such builders can safely be assumed to be
deliberate and one with the intention of earning profits
and hence deserve to be dealt with sternly so as to act as
a deterrent for future. It is common knowledge that the
builders enter into underhand dealings. Be that as it
may, the State Government should think of levying heavy
penalties on such builders and therefrom develop a
welfare fund which can be utilized for compensating and
rehabilitating such innocent or unwary buyers who are
displaced on account of demolition of illegal
constructions. "

Council for Enviro-Legal Action Vs. Union of India, reported in
(1996) 5 SCC 281 with regard to infringement of law, are worth
noting.

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      "26. ...Enactment of a law, but tolerating its
      infringement, is worse than not enacting a law at all. The
      continued infringement of law, over a period of time, is
      made possible by adoption of such means which are
      best known to the violators of law. Continued tolerance of
      such violations of law not only renders legal provisions
      nugatory but such tolerance by the enforcement
      authorities encourages lawlessness         and adoption of
      means which cannot, or ought not to, be tolerated in any
      civilized society. Law should not only be meant for the
      law-aiding but is meant to be obeyed by all for whom it
      has been enacted. A law is usually enacted because the
      legislature feels that is is necessary. It is with a view to
      protect and preserve the environment and save it for the
      future generations and to ensure good quality of life that
      Parliament enacted the anti-population laws, namely the
      <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
      1986. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">These Act</a>s and Rules framed and notification
      issued thereunder contain provisions which prohibit
      and/or regulate certain activities with a view to protect
      and preserve the environment. When a law is enacted
      containing some provisions which prohibit certain types
      of activities, then, it is of utmost importance that such
      legal provisions are effectively enforced. If a law is
      enacted but is not being voluntarily obeyed, then, it has
      to be enforced. Otherwise, infringement of law, which is
      actively or passively condoned for personal gain, will be
      encouraged which will in turn lead to a lawless society.
      Violation of anti-pollution laws not only adversely affects
      the existing quality of life but the non-enforcement of the
      legal provisions often results in ecological imbalance and
      degradation of environment, the adverse effect of which
      will have to be borne by the future generations."

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      "10. ....     The same is that a feeling is gathering ground
      that where unauthorized constructions are demolished on
      the force of the order of courts, the illegality is not taken
      care of fully inasmuch as the officers of the statutory
      body who had allowed the unauthorized construction to
      be made or make illegal allotments go scot free. This
      should not, however, have happened for two reasons.
      First, it is the illegal action/order of the officer which lies
      at the root of the unlawful act of the citizen concerned,
      because of which the officer is more to be blamed than
      the recipient of the illegal benefit. It is thus imperative ,
      according to us, that while undoing the mischief which
      would require the demolition of the unauthorized
      construction, the delinquent         officer has also to be
      punished in accordance with law. This, however, seldom
      happens. Secondly, to take care of the injustice
      completely, the officer who had misused his power has
      also to be properly punished. Otherwise, what happens is
      that the officer, who made the hay when the sun shined,
      retains the hay, which tempts others to do the same. This
      really gives fillip to the commission of tainted acts,
      whereas the aim should be opposite. "

<p id="p_99">36.   In   the      aforesaid   context,         many   questions     remain
unanswered in the present case.                  What were the authorities
doing when the construction was in progress? It appears from
the photographs annexed with the petition that the common
plot is abutting the main road.                   Why did the authorities
maintained complete silence all through out and issued notice
only in 2012 when all 26 shops had already been constructed?
The answers to these questions are obvious.                  We have also
been informed that a criminal prosecution has also been
instituted against the respondent No.4 by one of the buyers of
the shop for cheating and the same has been taken cognizance
of by the Criminal Court.

      It is trite that the holders of public offices are entrusted with
      certain powers to be exercised in public interest alone and,
      therefore, the office is held by them in trust for the people. Any
      deviation from the path of rectitude by any of them amounts
      to a breach of trust and must be severely dealt with instead of
      being pushed under the carpet. If the conduct amounts to an
      offence, it must be promptly investigated and the offender
      against whom a prima facie case is made out should be
      prosecuted expeditiously so that the majesty of law is upheld

<p id="p_102">34.   The Supreme Court in numerous decisions has held that
no consideration should be shown to the builder or any other
person where the construction is unauthorized.           This dicta is
now almost bordering the rule of law. In M.I Builders Pvt. Ltd.

Supreme Court while dealing with the submission as regards
exercise of judicial discretion in moulding the relief in favour of
the prospective allottees of the shops which were unauthorized
constructed, observed that such a discretion could not be
exercised which encouraged illegality or perpetuated an
illegality.    The Supreme Court observed that unauthorized
construction, if it is illegal and cannot be compounded, has to
be demolished. There is no way out. Judicial discretion cannot
be guided by expediency. The Supreme Court observed that
the Courts were not free from statutory fetters. Justice is to be
rendered in accordance with law. It also observed that judges
were not entitled to exercise discreation wearing the robes of

judicial discretion and pass orders based solely on their
personal predilections and peculiar dispositions.

<p id="p_103">35.     Before parting with this case, we deem it necessary to
observe that a number of cases come to this Court pointing to
unauthorized constructions taking place at many places in the
State       by       the       builders        in       connivance      with      the
Corporations/Municipal officials. In a series of cases, this Court
has     directed           demolition     of     unauthorized        constructions.
However, it appears that it has no salutary effect in cases of
unauthorized constructions comeing to this Court.                          This case
should be a pointer to all the builders that making of
unauthorized constructions never pays and is against the
interest of the society at large. The rules, regulations and by-
laws are made by the Corporations or Development Authorities
taking in view the larger public interest of the society and it is
the bounden duty of the citizens to obey and follow such rules
which have made for their own benefits.
