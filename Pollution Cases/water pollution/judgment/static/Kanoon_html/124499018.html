                                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     This order shall decide an application under Order XII Rule 6 read 
with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short CPC) made 
on behalf of the plaintiff for passing a decree in favour of the plaintiff and 
against the defendants in respect of the prayer (ii) of the plaint on the 
basis of admissions made by the defendants in their written statement.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     In   the   present   application,   it   is   stated   that   no 
licence/permission/sanction has been filed by the defendants no. 1 to 3 
before this court to show that factories have any sanction from Municipal 
Corporation of Delhi; that the admission of running of factories in the 
residential   area   by   the   defendants   no.   1   to   3   has   been   made   by   the 
defendants no. 1 to 3 in their written statement; that the averments of the 
plaintiff   have   also   been   admitted   by   the   defendant   no.4;   that   the 
admissions made by the defendants are clear and unambiguous. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     The defendants no.1 to 3 opposed the present application by filing 
the   reply   taking   wherein   preliminary   objections   to   the   effect   that   the 
application filed by the plaintiff is apparently far­fetched, misconceived 
and   untenable;   that   it   does   not   spell   out   or   even   specify   any 
unequivocal/unambiguous admission of the defendants no. 1 to 3 which 
may entitle the plaintiff to seek and obtain a decree against the answering 
defendants in terms of some of the prayers made in the plaint; that it is 


Suit No. 171/2011                                                         Page 2/6
 well settled that the relief under Order XII Rule 6 CPC is discretionary 
relief and the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought as a matter of 
right.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     In reply on merits, it is contended that the licenses issued by the 
Municipal   Corporation   of   Delhi   to   the   answering   defendants   are 
displayed   outside   the   premises   of   the   answering   defendants.   Other 
allegations   of   the   application     have   been   denied   and   disputed   by   the 
defendants and prayed for dismissal of the application.     
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     I   have   heard   counsel   for   the   parties   and   perused   the   material 
available   on   record   carefully.   I   have   also   gone   through   the   judgments 
relied upon by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.       Having drawn my attention on paragraphs no. 16 to 19 of reply on 
merits of the written statement filed on behalf of the defendant no. 4 the 
learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that part prayer of the plaintiff 
is   admitted.   It   is   further   submitted   that   the   defendants   no.   1   to   3   are 
running polluting industries.   
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     Per   contra,  having   drawn   my   attention   on   the  photographs     the 
learned counsel for the defendants no. 1 to 3 submitted that photographs 
clearly   show   that   maternal   grandfather   of   the   plaintiff   was   raising 
construction in the property in question. It is further submitted that the 
plaintiff   has   come   to   the   court   to   seek   injunction,   however   the   court 
injuncted the plaintiff himself. It is further submitted that the property in 
question belongs to a private person and the defendants no. 1 to 3 started 
industries in it for making fiber sheets and it is not the case of the plaintiff 

Suit No. 171/2011                                                            Page 3/6
 nor it is claimed by the defendant no. 4 that the property in question 
belongs   to   the   defendant   no.4/DUSIB.   It   is   further   submitted   that   the 
property in question is freehold. It is further submitted that the pleadings 
to be read as a whole and not in piecemeal.  It is further submitted that 
this Court has no jurisdiction to try and entertain the present suit as the 
Central Pollution Control Board/State Pollution Control Board/Appellate 
Authorities   constituted   under   the   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Air   (Prevention   And   Control   of 
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) 
Act</a>, 1974 have jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     I have given my thoughtful consideration on the submissions made on behalf
of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     By   way   of   present   application,   the   plaintiff   is   seeking   passing   a 
decree in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants in respect of 
the   prayer   (ii)   of   the   plaint   on   the   basis   of   admissions   made   by   the 
defendants in their written statement. The contentions raised on behalf 
of the plaintiff is that in written statement the defendants have admitted 
prayer clause (ii) of the plaintiff. Prayer Clause (ii) of the plaint reads as 
under:­ 
          "direct   the   defendants   no.   4   and   5   to   remove/demolish   the   unauthorized 
          construction (by means of a decree of mandatory injunction) already raised 
          by the defendant no.1 in collusion with the defendants no. 4, 5 and 6 and also 
          direct the defendants no. 4 and 5 to take immediate and strict action against 
          the   defendants   no.   1   to   3   for   carrying   out   the   commercial   activities   and 
          running polluting factory in the residential area of Katra Sheikh Chand, Lal 
          Kuan, Delhi­110006 as mentioned in para 16 herein above. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.    In their joint written statement, the defendants no. 1 to 3 made the 
following contentions:­



Suit No. 171/2011                                                                   Page 4/6
          "These   factories/industrial   establishments   are   being   run   by   the   answering 
         defendants,   jointly   as   well   as   severally,   strictly   in   accordance   with   the 
         sanctions accorded to them by the authorities concerned. Today, for certain 
         reasons,   the   Municipal   Corporation   of   Delhi   has   been   insisting   that   these 
         factories/industrial establishments be shifted to approve industrial areas." 
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.    The defendant no. 4 raised the following contentions in its written 
statement:­
         "Therefore, defendants no. 1 to 3 have no right to raise any construction or 
         run any pollution creating activity, vice­versa the plaintiff has no right to do 
         the same in the suit property. "
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.    In the plaint, it is alleged by the plaintiff that polluting industries 
like,   printing   press,   dyes   and   chemical   of   cloth   are   presently   running 
either in the name of the defendants no. 1, 2 &amp; 3.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.     In para no. 16 of the reply on merits of the joint written statement 
of defence of the defendants no. 1 to 3, it is specifically denied that the 
printing press running in property bearing no. 1812 releases iron ore or 
that it is health hazard as alleged. In the said paragraph, it is also denied 
that dyer dying clothes and particularly chunnies and sarees is carrying 
on in second and third floor of the property no. 1812. In view of the above 
contentions,   these   allegations   made   by   the   plaintiff   in   the   plaint   are 
specifically denied by the defendants no. 1 to 3. Moreover, the defendants 
have nowhere admitted in the written statement that the industries being 
run in their properties are polluting industries. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">14.    Law is well settled that for judgment on admission under Order XII 
Rule   6   CPC   there   must   be   clear,   unambiguous   and   unequivocal 
admissions on behalf of the defendants. But, the plaintiff has failed to 
point out such clear, unambiguous and unequivocal admissions made on 
behalf of the defendants.

</p><p id="p_16"> 15.    Further, <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_3">Sections 46</a> of the Air (Prevention And Control of Pollution) 
Act, 1981 and 58 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 
1974  bar  the   jurisdiction  of  Civil  Court  relating  to  the  pollution  cases. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.    For   the   reasons   above­stated,     I   do   not   find   any   merits   in   the 
present application and the same is, accordingly, dismissed.
