</p><p id="p_2">            Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and learned A.P.P
     appearing for the State.
</p><p id="p_3">            Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the allegation
     against the petitioner is that the petitioner is the General Manager of M/s.
     Sangeeta Sales Private Limited which is involved in handling and transportation
     of coal from Amrapali Project of CCL to Prayagraj in the State of Uttar Pradesh
     and it is submitted that there is no dispute that the coal has been validly
     procured and transportation was to be done on point to point basis but there is
     deviation. It is submitted that the allegation against the petitioner is false.
     Drawing attention of this Court towards the order dated 30.08.2017 passed in
     W.P. (Cr.) No.483 of 2015, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as has
     been mentioned in the said order, a Division Bench of this Court in the case of
     Abhas Kumar Acksaria &amp; Others Vs. The State of Bihar &amp; Others (Cr.W.J.C.
     No.33 of 1991 (R) has held that "deviation by a truck carrying coal to a place other
     than its destination cannot be a criminal offence either under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8"> the Indian Penal Code</a> or
     under the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_9">Essential Commodities Act</a>." It is then submitted that the petitioner
     undertakes that in future he will ensure and take proper care regarding
     prevention of pollution by the vehicles engaged by his company for
     transportation of coal and he will ensure that no pollution is caused during the
     transportation. Drawing attention of this Court towards para-03 of the
        supplementary affidavit, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
       petitioner has no criminal antecedent. It is lastly submitted that the petitioner is
       ready and willing to co-operate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is
       submitted that the petitioner be given the privileges of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_4">              Learned A.P.P appearing for the State opposes the prayer for anticipatory
       bail of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_5">              Considering the submissions of learned counsels and the facts and
       circumstances stated above, I am inclined to grant privileges of anticipatory bail

       of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Latehar within six weeks from today and in
       the event of his arrest or surrendering, he will be enlarged on bail on furnishing

       not change his mobile number during the pendency of the case and he will
       ensure that in future he will take proper care regarding creation of pollution
       and he will ensure that no pollution is caused during the transportation and
       subject to the conditions as laid down under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 438(2)</a> of the Code of
