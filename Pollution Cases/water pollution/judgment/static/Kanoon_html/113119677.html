RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1.       The petitioner in W.P.(C)465/2011 acquired Plot No.1      Shopping

Mall, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi from the DDA and after obtaining inter

alia Environment Clearance dated 28 th November, 2006 from the Ministry

of Environment &amp; Forests has raised construction of its corporate office

thereon. The writ petition has been filed impugning the order dated 31 st

October, 2008 of the respondent Delhi Pollution Control Committee

(DPCC) directing the petitioner to pay Environmental Damages of 0.5% of

the total project cost of `90 crores and to furnish a Bank Guarantee, also

of 0.5% of the total project cost of `90 crores, valid for three years.

Though the petitioner had in compliance of the said order paid the damages

of `45 lacs and furnished the Bank Guarantee for `45 lacs but this writ

W.P.(C) 465/2011 &amp; W.P.(C) 1041/2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                   Page 2 of 16</span>
 petition has been filed seeking refund of the said `45 lacs and return of the

Bank Guarantee, owing to this Court in <a href="/doc/10484767/" id="a_1">Splendor Landbase Ltd. v. Delhi

Pollution Control Committee</a> 173 (2010) DLT 52 having held that the

respondent DPCC is not empowered to levy such damages and/or to

demand such Bank Guarantee.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.       The petitioner in W.P.(C)1041/2011 is a Developer of a hotel at Plot

No.27, Lodhi Road, New Delhi and similar damages of `2 crores were

levied on it also vide order dated 6 th February, 2008 which were paid.

Buoyed by the judgment of this Court in Splendor (supra), the writ petition

claiming refund of `2 crores has been filed. Though the Bank Guarantee

was also obtained from the said petitioner but the same has since been

returned.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.       Notices of both the petitions were issued. Pleadings were completed

in W.P.(C)465/2011. The counsel for the respondent DPCC has in the

course of hearing filed the counter affidavit in W.P.(C)1041/2011 also.




W.P.(C) 465/2011 &amp; W.P.(C) 1041/2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                    Page 3 of 16</span>
</p><p id="p_4"> 4.       The counsels for the petitioners have contended that they are

similarly situated as the petitioner in Splendor and other connected

petitions and the same order ought to follow.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       The counsel for the respondent DPCC has at the outset stated that

the respondent DPCC has preferred an intra court appeal against the

judgment of the Single Judge in Splendor and other connected petitions

and which is listed next before the Division Bench on 24 th August, 2011. It

was argued that the present petitions be adjourned till the decision of the

appeal aforesaid.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.       However the aforesaid contention of the counsel for the respondent

DPCC was not accepted. I am of the view that no purpose would be served

by keeping these petitions pending. It is deemed expedient that the

Division Bench considers all matters, from all facets and hears all counsels

in one go rather than in stages. The same is also necessary to avoid

multiplicity of litigation on the same issues. It was thus put to the counsel

for the respondent DPCC as to why not the present petitions be also

allowed and the respondent DPCC prefers intra court appeals in these cases

W.P.(C) 465/2011 &amp; W.P.(C) 1041/2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    Page 4 of 16</span>
 also so that the same can be heard on 24 th August, 2011 along with appeals

in Splendor and in other connected writ petitions.

</p><p id="p_7">7.       The counsel for the respondent DPCC has then argued:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              a. that the judgment in Splendor would not bind the present

                   cases as the same is per incuriam for not considering Indian

                   Council for <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_2">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India</a> (1996) 3

                   SCC 212. Attention is invited to para 60 of the said judgment

                   laying down that the Central Govt. is empowered under the

                   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 to take all measures as it

                   deems necessary or expedient to protect and improve the

                   quality of environment, including imposition of costs,

                   remedial measures on the offending industry. It is contended

                   that the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

                   Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

                   Pollution) Act</a>,1981 whereunder damages subject matter of

                   these petitions were imposed are in pari materia       to the

                   provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 and thus the

W.P.(C) 465/2011 &amp; W.P.(C) 1041/2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                       Page 5 of 16</span>
                    power to levy damages and demand Bank Guarantee is to be

                   read under Water &amp; <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>s also. It is contended that all the

                   judgments of the Apex Court relied upon in Splendor relate to

                   taxation and are not applicable to matters as concerned. It is

                   further contended that <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_8">Article 265</a> of the Constitution does not

                   apply to levy of damages for violation of statutory provisions.

                   It is argued that thus this Bench should re-look into the matter;</blockquote><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">              b. It is contended that in Splendor and other connected petitions,

                   the challenge was to the show cause notice and in none of

                   those cases any payments had been made or Bank Guarantee

                   furnished. It is argued that in both these petitions the

                   petitioners have already complied with the demand of the

                   respondent DPCC and cannot be permitted to challenge the

                   same now or to seek refund. It is further argued that while the

                   petitioner in W.P.(C)465/2011 had made payment without

                   prejudice to its rights and contentions, the petitioner in

                   W.P.(C)1041/2011 volunteered to deposit the amounts to

W.P.(C) 465/2011 &amp; W.P.(C) 1041/2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                          Page 6 of 16</span>
                    avoid closure and cannot now seek refund. It is urged that

                   both the petitioners as businessmen took a business decision

                   to make the payment instead of facing prosecution and closure

                   and cannot be now permitted to reprobate;
</p>
<p id="p_10">              c. It is contended that no refund can be claimed by way of writ

                   petition, especially when the judgment on the basis of which

                   the claim for refund is stated to have arisen has not attained

                   finality as yet;
</p>
<p id="p_11">              d. Attention is invited to a judgment dated 6 th July, 2011 in

                   W.P.(C)202/1995, titled Lafarge Umiam Mining Pvt. Ltd. v.

                   T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad             of the Apex Court

                   observing that penalty can be imposed on polluters;

              e. Principles of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel are invoked to

                   contend that the same deprive the petitioners from any relief.

                   Attention is also invited to judgment dated 16 th January, 2009

                   of this Court in W.P.(C) 7516/2007 titled <a href="/doc/113532302/" id="a_9">Regent Automobiles

                   exercise of powers under the Delhi Common Effluent

                   Treatment Plants Act, 2000 may not deem it appropriate to

                   take the extreme steps of closing down the unit but may issue

                   specific directions and as a measure to ensure compliance,

                   require furnishing of a Bank Guarantee;
</p>
<p id="p_12">              f. It is contended that the damages levied in both cases are fair

                   and the petitioners having taken advantage thereof by warding

                   off any other action against themselves, are now not entitled

                   to maintain this petition.

</p><p id="p_21">            (viii) That in Splendor and other connected writ petitions the

</p><p id="p_25">             (xi) It is contended that the payments being under coercion and

                   of estoppel arises.
</p>
<p id="p_26">9.       Propriety demands that all the aforesaid contentions be considered

by the Division Bench which is seized of the matter and not by this Bench.

The contentions of the counsels have been noticed only to make a record

thereof; else, Co-ordinate Benches cannot consider the matter when the

same is pending consideration in appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_27">10.      However it falls for consideration by this Bench, whether owing to

the petitioners having already made the payments and furnished the Bank

Guarantee demanded and having not considered the need to challenge the

same and having preferred these petitions only after the judgment in

Splendor, disentitles the petitioners from maintaining these petitions.

</p><p id="p_28">11.      The conduct of the petitioners does show that the petitioners at the

contemporaneous time were satisfied with the demand and readily

complied with the same. Even though the petitioner Bharti Realty Ltd.

made payment without prejudice, it did not immediately thereafter also
W.P.(C) 465/2011 &amp; W.P.(C) 1041/2011

 make any challenge. However one cannot also lose sight of the fact that the

said law is still at its nascent stage; there are no precedents, no past

practices. The petitioners thus could not be expected to know whether the

respondent DPCC was entitled to levy such damages or demand Bank

Guarantee. For a person to relinquish a right or claim, he must know the

same; a person cannot relinquish what he does not know he has. This is not

a case of ignorance of law. Even the Courts are still grappling with as to

what is the law in this regard. I am thus unable to hold that the petitioners

are disentitled from preferring these petitions or from claiming the reliefs

claimed for the reason of having accepted the demand. It cannot also be

lost sight of that the projects of the petitioners were at crucial stage then

with the petitioners having sunk in money and efforts in development also

besides the cost of the land. The Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1243245/" id="a_17">National Insurance Co.

Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab Private Ltd</a>. (2009) 1 SCC 267 has held that

whether a case of coercion is made out is a question of fact and dependent

upon several factors. The present, for the reasons aforesaid, is a case of

petitioners being coerced into making the payments and furnishing the


W.P.(C) 465/2011 &amp; W.P.(C) 1041/2011
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                    Page 12 of 16</span>
 Bank Guarantee, which this Court has held the respondent DPCC to be not

entitled to seek.
</p>
<p id="p_29">12.      The respondent DPCC cannot also be so allowed to illegally enrich

itself, if not entitled in law to the monies. The orders/demands impugned in

this petition, as per judgment in Splendor were beyond the jurisdiction of

respondent DPCC and thus non est. No benefit of such a void

demand/order can be retained by the respondent DPCC which is "State"

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_30">13.      I am otherwise also of the opinion that if the petitioners have

violated the Air &amp; <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water Act</a>s, then they ought to face the consequences

thereof as follow in law and cannot buy their way out of the said

consequences. To hold, the respondent DPCC entitled to retain the monies,

tantamounts to holding that the respondent DPCC would not be entitled to

take any other action which it may be entitled in law to take against the

petitioners for violations if any committed by the petitioners. The same

cannot be permitted.

</p><p id="p_32"> 14.      The next question which arises is, of the relief to be granted. This

Court in Splendor and in other connected writ petitions was not concerned

with the question of refund. The question of entitlement of the petitioners

to interest also arises.
</p>
<p id="p_33">15.      I am of the view that the petitioners cannot be held entitled to any

interest. The petitioners even though without prejudice, chose to comply

with       the      demand             rather   than   challenge   the   same    at      the

contemporaneous/relevant time. These petitions have also been filed after

considerable time (though within three years of the payment); in such

situation, the petitioners cannot be entitled to any interest.

</p><p id="p_34">16.      If the petitioners are to be held entitled to refund of the amounts

paid, liberty has to be necessarily granted to the respondent DPCC to

proceed afresh against the petitioners for the violations if any committed

by the petitioners. This Court in Splendor and other connected petitions

also left it open to the respondent DPCC to take action in accordance with

law.

                    respondent DPCC shall be liable for interest at 10% per

                    annum on the amounts and on the value of Bank Guarantee,

                    committed by the petitioners. It is made clear that such

                    actions to be taken by the respondent DPCC shall not be

                    the respondent DPCC had withheld the said actions owing to
