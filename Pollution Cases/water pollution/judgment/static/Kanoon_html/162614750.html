<p id="p_2">       2.    The     order    dated    25.11.2014   bearing   memo    no.   G      4578

       ( Annexure-6) passed by the Member Secretary, Jharkhand State

       Pollution    Control    Board    refusing    No   Objection   Certificate    for

       enhancement of production capacity under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a>             of the Water

       (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the

       Air(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 has been assailed by the

       petitioner in the instant writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3.    Learned counsel for the respondent no.2 to 4, Pollution Control

       Board submits that there is remedy of appeal under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_5">Section 28</a> of the

       Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_7">Section 31</a>

       of the      Air(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 before the

       Appellate authority constituted by the State Government, however

       within the limitation period prescribed for preferring an appeal.

</p><p id="p_4">       4.    In that view of the matter, on account of availability of alternative

       statutory remedy of appeal for the petitioner, this Court relegates the

       petitioner to pursue the appellate remedy before the Appellate Authority

       constituted by the State Government in terms of the aforesaid Acts

       within a period of 2 weeks. In case such an appeal is preferred, the

       Appellate authority would consider the question of delay in filing appeal

       sympathetically as the petitioner was pursuing his cause of action before

       this Court. The Appellate Authority thereafter would consider the matter

             and dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible, if it is filled in the

             prescribed format and fulfills other conditions, in accordance with law

             preferably within 16 weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this

             order.

<p id="p_5">             5.       The writ petition is disposed of accordingly. However, it is made

             clear that this Court has not gone into the merit of the matter.
