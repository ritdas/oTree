                                                     Date : September 4th, 2013


Justice M. Chockalingam , Judicial Member


</p><p id="p_6">       1) The Tribunal heard the learned counsel for the applicant and also for

the respondents. The case of the applicant, in short, is that the 1 st respondent's


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                 2</span>
 unit was involving in the manufacturing of bleaching liquid which has been a

cause for rampant air and water pollution in and around the village and the unit

has been operating without complying with the mandates prescribed under Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter called the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>s).

Though the 3rd respondent granted consent order in the month of September

2012, the 1st respondent in clear violation of the conditions prescribed that no

trade effluent was generated at any stage of the manufacturing process was

letting out the effluents that was generated during the process of manufacturing

into the neighbouring lands which has resulted in water pollution and made it

unsuitable for drinking purpose. The 2nd respondent who is carrying on the

manufacturing of plastic and rag pulp also letting out the effluents which are

even in semi-solid state into the neighbouring well and water bodies without any

effluent treatment which has virtually affected the primary source of water for

the villages and also caused serious water pollution. The 1st respondent was

involving in the manufacture of bleaching liquid illegally and in contravention of

the rules and regulations and has stored a large number of chlorine cylinders

within the premises without any safety measures at all have been taken and

without any approval under Gas Cylinders Rules, 2004. An information received

by the applicant under Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_4">Information Act</a> 2005 that at a time only 5

chlorine cylinders could be stored without licence. But the 1st respondent

without approval or licence from the 5th respondent, is illegally storing 60

chlorine cylinders in scant disregard of the Gas Cylinders Rules, 2004.

</p><p id="p_7">      2) Pursuant to the complaint by the public, an inspection was made by

the flying squad of the District Environmental Engineer on 27.2.2013 when it

was found that a large number of chlorine cylinders within the premises have

been stored without any safety measures. The counsel for the applicant would


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                3</span>
 further add that by the operation of the unit of the 1st respondent in a cavalier

and negligent manner, chlorine gas was released in air and atmosphere and the

neighbouring villages are seriously affected due to eye irritation and respiratory

problems and thus it has created a health hazard.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       3) Under these circumstances, in reply to a representation made by the

applicant to the 4th respondent on 26.6.2013, the 8th respondent by a

communication dated 8.7.2013 has made it clear that any chemical factory

where chlorine is stored or used, then it has to be classified as hazardous

industry. In view of the blatant violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water

Act</a>, there arose a necessity for filing this application for the relief that the 1 st

and 2nd respondents should be barred from operating the industrial units until

they obtain appropriate licences and approvals from the competent authorities

under Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> with a direction to the 7th respondent to seal the

electrical service connection and also with other directions to the 1 st and 2nd

respondents not to store any chlorine cylinders and not to release any untreated

effluents from the units.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       4) In reply to the above, it is contended by the learned counsel appearing

for the 1st ad 2nd respondents that the 1st respondent industry which is a

proprietary concern was established in the year 1995 while the 2nd respondent's

industry was established in 2010 and both the industries were operating after

getting the consent from the 3rd respondent. In so far as the manufacturing of

bleaching liquid, the 1st respondent has taken all precautionary and safety

measures so as not to let out any trade effluent from the company and cause

pollution and hence the allegations made by the applicant are baseless and

unfounded. It is submitted that the 3rd respondent has issued a consent order to

the 2nd respondent and the statement of the applicant that the 2 nd respondent's

unit was functioning without any consent order was factually incorrect and the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                   4</span>
 consent order issued by the 3rd respondent is valid upto 30.6.2013 and the

renewal application has been filed and pending for consideration with the

authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       5) It is, however, submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the 1 st

and 2nd respondents that both the industries were not functioning from 8.8.2013

and remain closed. Under such circumstances, the grievance of the applicant

alleging that   both the industries are functioning without consent or proper

permission and causing air and water pollution has got to be rejected.

</p><p id="p_11">       6) While the matter was pending, a direction was issued to the authorities

of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to ascertain the actual factual position

to make an inspection and file a report as to whether the units are functioning or

not. The respondent Nos. 3 and 4 has filed a status report and reply. A perusal

of the same would make it clear that pursuant to the orders of the Tribunal

dated 25.7.2013, the District Collector, Erode made orders on 21.8.2013 to

Revenue Divisional Officer, Erode to lock and seal the two units immediately

and the units were sealed by the Revenue Divisional Officer in the presence of

the Pollution Control Board officials on 24.8.2013. At this juncture, the learned

counsel appearing for the 1st and 2nd respondents would submit that though at

the directions of the Pollution Control Board in respect of the preventive

measures were carried out, the authorities should not have closed the units of

the 1st and 2nd respondents. It is pertinent to point out that pursuant to the

orders of this Tribunal, the units of the 1st and 2nd respondents were locked and

sealed on 24.8.2013. But even from the statement of the applicant, the units

were not functioning from 8.8.2013 onwards. If aggrieved by the said closure,

the remedies are always open to the 1st and 2nd respondents, if available and

advised therefor.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                5</span>
</p><p id="p_13">       7) The District Environmental Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control

Board, Erode has filed a reply submitting that the Revenue Divisional Officer,

Erode has sealed the units on 24.8.2013 and again the units were inspected on

30.08.2013 and found to be in sealed condition and not in operation. Hence it is

evident that both the units are in locked and sealed condition and not in

operation. Hence the grievance putforth by the applicant in respect of the

alleged pollution of air and water, even if true, has come to an end and hence

the reply of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board as made above, is recorded

and the application filed by the applicant can be disposed of. It is made clear

that without obtaining consent from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the

1st and 2nd respondents should not operate the units. Accordingly the

Application is disposed of and the contempt application filed by the applicant is

also disposed of.
