<p id="p_1">      Essential challenge in the writ petition is against

Exhibit-P7, which is only a show cause notice prior to a

closure order under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1974. I find that though there

is no substantive prayer in the writ petition seeking to set

aside Exhibit-P, the interim relief sought for by the

petitioner is in relation to Exhibit-P7. The averments in the

writ petition also relate to Exhibit-P7. Petitioner is entitled

to file objections to Exhibit-P7 and obviously the petitioner

will be heard by the Pollution Control Board on such

objections before taking any action under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">Section 33A</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1974.

</p><p id="p_2">      As regards the pendency of the application for renewal

of consent stated to have been submitted by the petitioner

and pending as Exhibit-P6, the Board            shall consider the

same in accordance with law and take appropriate decision

thereon, without delay.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The writ petition is disposed of as above.
