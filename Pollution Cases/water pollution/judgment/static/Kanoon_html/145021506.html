<p id="p_1">1.      Anil Products Limited is a Private Limited        Company

incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> 1956.           This Company

manufactures glucose, medicines, biscuits and other products by

using starch derived after processing maize. The Biscuits are

 having brand name "Kokay biscuits" The factory has its unit at

Kalyan Mill, Naroda Road, North Gujrat estate, Ahmedabad. (For

the sake of brevity, it will be referred hereinafter as "Anil

Products".) In the instant Application, "Anil Products" is arrayed

as     Respondent            No.3.   The    first   two    (2)   Respondents    are

Environment Department of the State of Gujarat and Gujarat

Pollution Control Board respectively. They have been arrayed in

the Application for the reason that they are the regulatory

authorities to enforce environmental laws, particularly, the Air

(Prevention          &amp;     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control   of    Pollution)     Act</a>    1981   and   Water

<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.      The Applicant claims to be interested in public cause and a

vigilant person. He is a Journalist. He alleges that he has no

personal interest in the litigation. He claims to have filed various

Public Interest Litigations in order to ventilate interest of local

residents of Ahmedabad and surrounding area, and for protection

of the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.      Briefly stated, the Applicant's case is that "Anil Products"

does not follow safety measures and environment Laws in the

process of manufacturing the starch and other products.                        The

factory premises of Anil Products are situated in the thickly

populated human locality. For manufacturing of the glucose and

other products, harmful chemicals are used as raw material. Anil

Products also uses Hydrogen gas during course of the process of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                                 3</span>
 production. The Hydrogen gas is stored in big tank and is used

while processing maize. The wet starch, the putrefied starch, the

starch under process which is stacked in the factory premises of

Anil Products, spread out foul smell in the area. The white ash

generated by the factory is emitted in the air and causes air

pollution.         The Air Pollution has resulted into health hazards

caused to residents of the area.         The factory of Anil Products

discharges large quantity of effluents of polluting nature, so also

poisonous gas is evaporated from sewage line and therefore, the

adverse environment impact is caused due to running of the

factory.       The boilers of Anil Products are outdated, improperly

maintained and discharge foul smell and the chemical waste is

drifted through sewage line of the residential area.      The starch

stored in the tank and open space of the factory is rotten,

becomes rancid and putrefied at a times and therefore, odour of

intolerable nature is experienced by members of the locality. In

spite of large number of complaints made by the Applicant and

other residents of the locality, no serious action was taken.

Although, sometimes, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board

(G.P.C.B.) ordered closure of the operation of the factory but again

allowed to re-operate. The actions taken against Anil Products by

the first two (2) Respondents are nothing but eye - wash and have

not proved to be deterrent.          The Applicant, therefore, sought

directions that the first two (2) Respondents shall take an effective

penal action against Anil Products to ensure permanent closure of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                   4</span>
 the operation of all the factory units situated in Bapunagar area of

Ahmedabad.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.      The first two (2) Respondents resisted the Application by

filing reply dated September 30th 2013. The reply Affidavit of

Respondent No.1 is rather cryptic. It does not give any specific

information regarding steps taken to deal with the environmental

problems due to factory units of Anil Products.       According to

Respondent No. 1 various regulatory actions were taken, time and

again, against Anil Products when violations of the Environmental

Laws were brought to their notice. It is averred that the direction

U/s. 33(A) of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>

1974, had been issued against Anil Products on January 18th

2010 when E.T.P. was found to be improperly maintained. It is

averred further that inspection was taken from time to time. It is

pointed out that during inspection dated January 1st, 2010,

violation of the provisions of Air (P, &amp; C,) Act 1974 had been

noticed and therefore, direction was issued on February 8th 2010

as per <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_5">Section 31(A)</a> of the Act. It is further averred that due to

non compliance of the conditions and breach of the provisions of

Environment and Pollution Laws, request for extension of the

C.C.A. validity was rejected vide order dated May 20th, 2010 which

was applied for by Anil Products.     Second time, Anil Products

applied for C.C.A. vide Application dated June 15th, 2010. That

Application was also rejected in view of the Inspection dated June

18th, 2010 when non compliance of the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                  5</span>
 found.        They further averred that closure order was issued on

October 15th 2010 when irregularities were found during course of

inspection of the factory premises of the Anil Products. It was only

after rectification of the defects that was done by Anil Products,

G.P.C.B. revoked the closure orders passed under the Air (P.&amp;C.)

Act and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment (Protection) Act</a> vide order dated May

4th, 2011 and May 11th 2011 respectively. The factory premises of

Anil Products have been inspected again and again.         A show

cause notice is issued on May 26th, 2012 when it was found that

Anil Products has committed breach of the provisions of the

Environment and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Pollution Act</a>. It is denied, therefore, that only

paper actions are taken against Anil Products which are "eye-

wash" and that the first two (2) Respondents are not regulating

the activities of the factory units of Anil Products. According to

them, as a result of constant monitoring and persuasion by the

Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Anil Products has installed latest

Air Pollution Control system, namely, Electro Static Pacificator

(E.S.P.) to curb emission of particulate matters from stack

attached to the steam boilers. So also, it has been compelled to

adopt fogger system, modification of Gluten Dryer, improving of

the coal yard area etc. It is also stated that the Pollution Control

Board will keep constant monitoring of the activities of Anil

Products to ensure that no pollution of what so ever kind is

generated. In other words, the first two (2) Respondents say that




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                  6</span>
 the regulatory mechanism has not failed in discharging their legal

obligations.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.      By filing an elaborate reply, Anil Products resisted the

Application on various grounds through counter Affidavit of Shri

Sunil      Narendra           Sheth.      According   to    Anil   Products,   the

Application is filed with intention to gain publicity with ill-

intention to politising the entire issue.                  It is denied that Anil

Products has committed any breach of Environmental laws. It is

stated that appropriate safety measures are taken to ensure that

no pollution would be caused outside the factory premises of Anil

Products. It is further stated that infrastructure at the factory of

Anil Products consists of boiler house, demineralization plant and

effluents treatment plants. There are dryers attached to different

plants which prevent most of the effluents and gaseous emission

from relieving directly into the open area. There is also U.A.S.B.

digester in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) which generate fuel

gas for the boilers that saves approximately 50 % of coal

consumption per day.                   The factory has complied with all the

conditions of the Water (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollutions) Act

1974 and Air (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollutions) Act 1981,

Hazardous Waste (Management, Handing and Transboundary

Movement) Rules framed under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment (Protection) Act</a>

1986. It is denied that Anil Product is a Polluting Unit. It is also

denied that the processing of starch and production of medicines

and other goods in the factory cause Health Hazards to the public


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                                7</span>
 members in the area around to the factory unit. However, it is an

admitted that due to fermentation activities, a particular kind of

smell is found in the factory premises which is present in the

bakery and starch Industry which is a natural result of such

process. The contention of Anil Product is that a large number of

improvements were carried out as recommended during course of

inspection of the G.P.C.B. and the factory adopted practice of

maintaining the quality of operations so as to ensure compliance

of the Pollution Laws. On these grounds, Anil Products sought

dismissal of the Application.

<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.      We have heard learned Counsel for the parties.              We have

perused the relevant documents brought on record.                  It may be

stated that we found that there was certain area of ambiguity in

the Ambient Air Quality monitoring conducted by the G.P.C.B. in

the area surrounding the factory of Anil Products. Therefore, by

order dated September 9th 2013, Department of Environment

Engineering M.S. University of Baroda was assigned work to

conduct the Water and Air monitoring study including Air

monitoring of the surrounding area, in order to verify whether the

standards enumerated in consent granted by the G.P.C.B. as on

January 18th 2011 have been complied with. We also directed the

said Department to submit report on subject of storm water

submitted the report. We shall deal with the said report during

course of discussions which will followed hereafter.

<p id="p_13">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                i) Whether Anil Products causes Air Pollution/Water

<p id="p_14">8.      Before we proceed to deal with merits of the matter, it would

be useful to no to the emission standards prescribed for Starch

 Manufacturing Industry.                 As per the Environment (Protection)

Rules 1986, the starch Industry (maize products) falls under entry

No.63. The Industry specific emissions standards laid down are

thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><pre id="pre_2">                Effluents: pH              -    6.5 - 8.5

                BOD                        --   100    (3 days of 27◦C) mg/lt

                Suspended Solids           --   150 mg/lt

</pre><p id="p_16">                Waste Water discharge 8 mᵌ/tonne of maize processed.

The standards mentioned above can be made more stringent or

less     stringent          depending    upon   the   conditions   and   local

requirements.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">9.      Starch manufacturing process includes a number of sources

of emissions. Most common are SO₂ and odorous vapor emissions

coming from the sleeping tanks, as well as from the gluten, feed

and dryers.            In addition, particulates are emitted for boilers,

loading sites, storage sites and product dryers. The fermentation

stage involved in manufacturing is important source of odorous

volatile emissions. There is no denial to the fact that due to

wetting &amp; fermentation process at stage pertaining to storage of

starch during the process for production of goods, spreading of

odour is inherent fall out which is unavoidable unless special care

is taken within the factory premises. The odour is likely to cause

nuisance to residents of the nearby locality. For, it is but natural

that they will be the passive inhalers of the odour mixed with air

and the particulate matters emanated from the stack of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                           10</span>
 factory. It is an admitted fact that Anil Products is situated in

midst of thickly populated locality and there is a school nearby

the factory premises. Nobody will deny, therefore, that if there is

Air Pollution caused by the stack emission of the factory, then the

residents of the surrounding locality and also students of the

school will be adversely affected being soft targets in as much as

they are compelled passive inhalers of the particulated matter,

emissions, odour emanating of from the stack of the factory.


Re :-- Points (i) &amp; (ii) :
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">10. In the wake of foregoing discussion, we shall now proceed to

examine the material aspects pertaining to the alleged violations

of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 and Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974, done by Anil

Products during maize processing within the factory premises.

We have noticed from the record that a large number of

complaints were made by the Applicant and various other

residents against Anil Products for spreading of foul smell in the

area.      It also appears that by Communication dated November

13th, 2001 the G.P.C.B. informed three of such complainants that

previous order of closure was passed against Anil Products due to

spreading of Pollution in the area but on basis of representation

made by the Company that a time bound programme will be

followed for rectification of the defects and that the Pollution will

be abated, the Anil Starch Products (Starch Mill) was permitted to

re-start the functioning.          The copy of time bound programme

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                  11</span>
 submitted by Anil Product for rectification of the defects is also

placed on record.                  It appears that the Applicant started the

expedition to pursue the matter through his newspaper so as to

arrest menace of the Pollution caused by Anil Products. He was

supported by a large number of residents who had participated in

making complaints to the G.P.C.B. It is not necessary to set out

the entire details of the complaints and the persuasion made by

the Applicant to go behind Anil Products with the cause of the

environment. Some of the complaints were considered to by the

authorities whereas some of the complaints were not at all taken

cognizance of. It appears that the Applicant went on publishing

public news items in news paper styled as "Deep Bhaskar" to

expose the pollution created by "Anil Products".


</p><p id="p_21">11. Perusal of the record shows that an incident of explosion had

occurred underneath sewage line of Anil Products situated in

Sarsapur area passing through storm water. This incident was

reported in the local newspapers in March 21st, 2003, besides

Deep Bhaskar "Gujarat Samachar" and Western Times dated

March 27th, 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">12. At this juncture, it may be appropriate to point out that Air

Analysis Report of stack emission conducted by the G.P.C.B. for

the samples collected during November 16th, 2010 to November

22nd, 2010 go to show that the results found were not in

accordance with the specific standards. Therefore, by order dated

January 31st, 2011, the consent to operate was revoked by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                          12</span>
 G.P.C.B. and Anil Products was accordingly informed. There are

other notices and directions issued U/s. 31(A) Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 issued by Anil Products by the

G.P.C.B. which go to show that the Industry was not following

norms of standard fixed to prevent Air Pollution. The Inspection

Report of the G.P.C.B. indicated various faults in the operation of

the Industry. For example; visit report prepared by the authorities

of the G.P.C.B. in respect of the visit dated October 19 th, 2011

(Annex-5) go to show that various deficiencies were noticed.       It

was found that the entry was not provided to the enclosure of the

Coal Storage yard at point source of dust emission. It was also

found that maintenance of Hazardous Waste Storage was poor;

part of sludge was drifted on open land out of the Hazardous

Waste Storage Area. It was recommended that the Industry shall

provide the leachate collection system into the husk handling to

prevent generated run of the leachate is Environment.


</p><p id="p_24">13. We have noticed from the record that during the course of

various inspections, the G.P.C.B. noted presence of foul smell in

the factory premises, foggers were not in operation and the E.T.P.

was not efficiently and regularly operated by Anil Products.

Instead of giving all details of each and every inspection report, it

would suffice to avoid repetition, if the observations of the visit

report dated November 9th, 2013 are reproduced for the purpose

of understanding the nature of Pollution generated by Anil

Products:

<p id="p_26">14. We may take note of fact that the G.P.C.B. gave notices, time

and again to Anil Products for rectification of the defects and at a

time of closure of the factory. However, on representation of Anil

Products and submission of undertaking to carry out the

improvements as per time bound programme, again consent to

operate was given. It is worthwhile to note that for the present

consent and authorization is granted to Anil Products for period

uptill April 21st, 2014. A copy of consent issued by the G.P.C.B. is

placed on record.                  The consent to operate shows that several

conditions have been imposed by the G.P.C.B. while granting said


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                                14</span>
 consent to operate. One of the important condition is related to

maintaining ambient air quality in factory area. GPCB has not

submitted records of regular ambient air quality monitoring

within industry premises or in the adjoining residential area.

GPCB could have used scientific and analytical tools in air quality

assessment to approximately work out the impacts of industrial

emissions on the nearly residential areas.

<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">15. The foregoing discussion and the documents on record

clearly indicate that Anil Products continued to generate Air

Pollution in the surrounding area through the stack emission. It

also failed to properly monitor hazardous waste discharge within

the factory premises. It is brought on surface of the record that

the G.P.C.B. was dis-satisfied with performance of Anil Products.

It was found during the course of various inspections that Anil

Products did not comply with Environmental norms. It was also

found that the emission levels of Anil Products were not in

keeping with the parameters of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>. So, the directions had been issued U/s. 31<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">(A) of

the Air Act</a> and stern action had been taken against Anil Products.

It is however, difficult to fathom as to how the G.P.C.B. accepted

credibility of assurance of Anil Products to improve the standards

and again issued the consent to operate inspite of the fact that the

earlier track record of Anil Products was dis-satisfactory.     The

private analysis reports produced by Anil Products are not

acceptable in as much as we are not aware whether the samples


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                 15</span>
 were collected during the course of operation of the factory and

also about the time of such collection. One cannot be oblivious of

the fact that period of collection of the emission samples would

cause much difference in the analysis report and there are

variables caused due to several factors.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">16. In the above backdrop we are more impressed by the report

submitted by Environmental Engineering, (Civil Engineering)

Department, M.S. University, Baroda.           The report shows that

there were still, certain defects in operation of the factory of Anil

Products. The monitoring activity was conducted by 4th and 5th

January 2014 by the Civil Engineering Department of M.S.

University, Baroda, at the factory premises.         The Industry was

informed to keep all the plants in operational condition during the

visit. The air quality samples were collected. At location No.1 the

ambient air quality was found to be rather exceeding the

standards. P.M. 2.5 and P.M. 10 concentration are observed to be

higher than the specified limits and could be attributed to the

Industry as Pollution source. It was noticed that there was odour

nuisance in and around the Industrial premises. So also, outside

the industry, the odour was recognized as of molasses which is

inherent odour of manufacturing process.              Inside industrial

premises, three types of odours were experienced


</p><p id="p_31">                1) Molasses odour due to manufacturing process.

</p><p id="p_32">                2) Odour due to putrification of husk and

</p><p id="p_33">           3) Hydrogen sulfide odour near ETP area even with the
                operation of foggers to control this odour.
</p>
<p id="p_34">        It was found that pH of Wastewater at the inlet of UASB is

found in acidic range, no prior neutralization was observed which

indicated poor efficiency of UASB process and may be reason for

the odour in ETP area.                 There was no settling system in the

treatment units. The old tanks in ETP were found partially filled

with waste water.                  There is a open drain for conveyance of

Gluconate Plant Waste Water to nearby manhole from where it

was taken to the ETP near the calcium Gluconate Plant.                   The

Domestic sewage generation was a higher side. No settling system

was observed treatment units named as tube settler was found to

be aeration unit with diffuses.

<p id="p_38">18. The conclusions drawn by the team of Experts of M.S.

University, Baroda are that over all dust particulate concentration

in and around the Industry was found on higher side. The ETP

and APC facilities could be updated for better disciplined

operations. The report also mentions that although the effluent


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                                  18</span>
 standards are compiled at the discharge point, it is technically

difficult to justify the reported quality of final effluent. This

observation is important and needs more follow up by GPCB.

Needless to say, Anil Products was found to be the Industry which

generates dust/particulate concentration of higher rate and more

than the prescribed limits. It also generates odour of excess

nature. Moreover, it does not handle Hazardous Waste in required

manner as per the Hazardous Waste Management Rules 2000.


We have gone through the responses of the Anil Products to the

Report of M.S. University, Baroda. We are not satisfied with the

response. We may record statement of learned Counsel for the

Anil Products that the recommendations of the Department of

Civil      Engineering,             M.S.   university,   Baroda    will   be   duly

implemented by Anil Products within specified time period, The

learned         counsel            expressed   readiness    to    abide   by    the

recommendations of the Department of Civil Engineering , M.S.

University Under these circumstances, we have no hesitation in

holding that Anil Products is proved to be the Industry which

generates odour and causes Pollution in the surrounding area.

Accordingly, both the points are answered in the Affirmative.


Re : Point No.3(a) &amp; (b) :
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">19. We have already observed that Anil Products was found to

have been causing odour in the surrounding area due to stack

emission as well as mis-handling of the stack of starch and the

processing of the starch. The foggers were not fully functional.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">(J) Application No.109(THC)/2013                                                 19</span>
 The conveyor belts were not enclosed as per the modern

techniques. Odour as well as gaseous particulate matter used to

emanates from the processes and stack of the factory. The factory

used to be closed down on some occasions but again was allowed

to re-start. Still, however, there was no complete pollution control

observed by Anil Products.                Hence, this is a fit case in which

"Polluters' Pays" principle will be applicable. The public members

of the surrounding area are the victims of such pollution. In this

view of the matter, we are of the opinion that Anil Products shall

pay compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- in general which shall be

deposited in the office of the Collector, Ahmedabad. This amount

shall be utilized for development of green belt or establishment of

play ground or appropriate park with jogging track in the area of

Bapunagar, Ahmedabad in the joint consultation and of the

Collector and Municipal Corporation as per the approval of plan

by the Municipal Corporation, Ahmedabad.
