ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">(Made by Ms.Indira Banerjee, Chief Justice)

	This writ petition has been filed seeking a writ of mandamus directing the Respondent Nos.1 to 5 to close down the industry viz. M/s.Strides Shasun Pharmaceuticals Limited at SF.Nos.167, 168,  Plot No.A1/A, A1/B, A1/C,  A2/B,  A2/C, A2/D and C8-3/C and C8-3/A S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>OT Industrial Complex, Kudikadu Village, Cuddalore - 607 005.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. It is the case of the petitioner that the industry run by the Respondent Nos.6 and 7 is a highly polluting industry and there is no extension of the consent order to run the industry and it is operating without a consent order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. It, however, appears that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had issued orders renewing consent till the period ending 31.3.2019, vide (i) Consent Order No.170814647843, dated 7.8.2017 under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974; and (ii) Consent Order No.170824647843, dated 7.8.2017 under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.   We are also informed that the industry has been operating since 1991.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board submits that all the consent orders are duly put up on the website of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and any one can look into these orders.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. The writ petition is not entertained and the same is dismissed.  The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board shall, however, continue to monitor the running of the industry and ensure that pollutants are not discharged as alleged in the writ petition.  This, however, is not to be construed as any finding of this Court that the industry is actually causing pollution.  No costs.  Consequently, W.M.P.No.6925 of 2018 is closed.
