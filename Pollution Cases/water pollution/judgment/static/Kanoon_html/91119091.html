<p id="p_1">1.		Heard
learned advocate Mr. Naik with Mr. Kunal Naik for Ms/ Trivedi and
Gupta, Mr. Rituraj Meena for respondent No.2 and learned Additional
Public Prosecutor  Mr. K. T Dave for respondent No.1. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.		On
18th June 2008 the following order was passed by this
Court (Coram: Hon'ble Ms Justice H.N. Devani).
</p>
<p id="p_3">Heard
	Mr.Rakesh Gupta, learned advocate with Mr.Kunal Naik, learned
	advocate for M/s Trivedi &amp; Gupta Advocates, learned advocates
	for the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Attention
	of the Court is drawn to the allegations made in the complaint to
	point out that the main allegation is that the petitioners have
	committed breach of the provisions of the notification dated 14th
	September, 2006 issued by the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests.
	 Referring to the notification dated 14th September,
	2006, it is pointed out that the same applies only to new projects
	or activities or on the expansion of modernization of existing
	projects or activities based on their potential environmental
	impacts.  It is submitted that insofar as the Company in question is
	concerned, the same has not undertaken any new project or activities
	or expansion or modernization.  It is submitted that, in the
	circumstances, provisions of notification dated 14th
	September, 2006 would not be applicable.  However, to be on the
	safer side, the Company has made application under the said
	notification dated 14th September, 2006, and the same is
	pending clearance before the concerned authority.
</p>
<p id="p_5">In
	the aforesaid circumstances, issue notice returnable  on 8th
	July, 2008.  By way of ad-interim relief, further proceedings
	pursuant to the Criminal Case No.1241 of 2007 pending before the
	learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Veraval, are hereby stayed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Mrs.M.L.Shah,
	learned Additional Public Prosecutor waives service of notice on
	behalf of the respondent No.1   State of Gujarat.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Direct
	service is permitted qua respondent No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_8">3.	
 Today, the matter was listed for further hearing  of ad interim
relief.  Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in all the
cases  submitted that what is recorded  in para 2 of the order dated
18th June 2008 is not satisfactorily answered by the
complainant. Learned counsel  appearing for the petitioner submitted
that lease deed for mining limestone,  was granted to the petitioner 
and thereafter  no new mining operation have been started by the
company after the issuance  of notification dated 14th
September 2006. Not only  that after issuance of notification, the
company had already applied for getting environmental clearance to
the Government of India  which came to be granted by certificate
dated 31st July 2008 by the Ministry  of Environmental 
and Forest of the Government of India. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.1		In
addition to  the above  learned counsel further submitted that  para
16 of the complaint  alleges breach of provisions  of notification
dated 14th September 2006 issued by the Ministry of
Environment  and Forests, Government of India, and admittedly  the
complaint  by  and large referred to the report  dated 10th
August 2006 of the mines area managed by the petitioner prior to 
issuance of the notification. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">3.2		Learned
counsel  further submitted that neither  the the petitioners have
constructed nor expanded their activities  which require any
clearance as per the above notification and therefore the respondent
is not  empowered to complain under this Act. Learned advocate
further submitted that incidentally  reference is made about
non-observation of certain provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>.
In view of above, according to the learned counsel  for the
petitioner ad interim relief  granted earlier to continue as interim
relief. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">4.		Mr.
</p><p id="p_12">Rituraj Meena  learned advocate submitted  that apart from the
alleged breach of notification dated 14th September 2006
as found  on the inspection of the site,    petitioner herein was
carrying out mining activity  by violating certain provisions of the
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>, water Act and environment clearance  was not obtained as
envisaged under the notification. Learned advocate further submitted
that the petitioner herein is supposed to follow and comply with the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>, water Act and provisions contained in
various notifications issued even prior to the notification dated
14th September 2006. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.		Thus
according to the learned counsel for respondent No. 2, the  complaint
 need not be stayed and ad interim relief granted by the order dated
18th June 2008 may be vacated. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">6.		Having
heard learned counsel appearing  for the parties and perusal of the
record including  the notification dated 14th November
2006 and the inspection report of the mines area of the applicant,
subsequent  certificate by Ministry of Environment  and Forests 
granting environmental clearance and the pleadings of the parties,
prima facie I am of the opinion that the allegations  in the
complaint  are for breach of notification dated 14th
September 2006 which came to be published in the Gazette and became
effective after  the visit to site  by the officer on 10th
August 2006 Besides applicability  of the environment <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_5">(Protection)
Act</a> 1986, specifically the penal provisions  for non-compliance  of 
provisions  of other Acts, namely the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> deserves
consideration at this stage. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">7.		Hence,
Rule  returnable on  12th November 2008. Learned advocate
appearing  for respective parties  waives service  of rule. By way of
Interim relief further proceedings of Criminal case  No. 1241 of 2007
registered before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class
Veraval are stayed till further order.  However, this will not
preclude  the respondent GPCB No. 2 herein  to take action in
accordance with law for breach  if any  by the applicant under
provisions of any other Act.
