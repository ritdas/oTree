<p id="p_1">         (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE J.B.PARDIWALA)


     By this writ application, the petitioner-purchaser of a property
in an auction proceedings conducted by the Kalupur Commercial
Cooperative Bank has prayed for an appropriate writ to quash and
set aside the demand notices dated 29th November 2011 and 15th
March 2012 respectively issued by the respondent No.2, Gujarat
Pollution Control Board, for the purpose of realizing the dues of the
erstwhile owner towards the water cess assessed by the assessing
order Nos.594 and 4274 with interest thereon.

<p id="p_2">          C/SCA/1977/2013                                ORDER




      The case of the petitioner may be summed up thus:
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The respondent No.4, Kinariwala Spinners Ltd. had availed of
financial assistance from the respondent No.3 Bank. It appears that
the respondent No.4 defaulted in making the payment of the sum
borrowed. Accordingly, the respondent No.3 initiated proceedings
under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
<a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 (for short "the
Securitisation Act"). As a part of the proceedings initiated under the
Securitisation Act, the property which was          mortgaged by the
respondent No.4 with the respondent No.3 Bank was put to auction.
In the auction proceedings conducted by the respondent No.3 Bank,
the petitioner herein emerged as the highest bidder. It also appears
from the materials on record that on payment of the sale price, a sale
certificate cum deed of conveyance was executed on 29 th December
2006 by the respondent No.3 Kalupur Commercial Cooperative
Bank in favour of the petitioner. Thus, on the issue of such sale
certificate, the ownership of the respondent No.4 got extinguished
and it vested in favour of the petitioner. The sale of the mortgaged
property attained finality on 29th December 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Almost after a period of five years, the petitioner was served
with a notice by the respondent No.2, GPCB, calling upon him to
deposit an amount of Rs.66,449/- towards the water cess for the
period between 1st April 2002 and 31st March 2003, and 1st April
2003 and 31st March 2004.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               Page 2 of 7</span>
<p id="p_5">          C/SCA/1977/2013                                  ORDER




      The petitioner being aggrieved by such recovery of water
cess at the instance of the GPCB has come up with this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The stance of the respondent No.3 Bank is that the subject
dues of the GPCB were neither           intimated nor informed by the
respondent No.4, i.e. defaulter to the Bank nor the GPCB had made
any demand thereof in response to the auction notice published by
the Bank. According to the Bank, they do not owe any liability so
far as the payment is concerned and at the best such liability could
be fastened upon the respondent No.4 or the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Mr.Ishan Patel, the learned advocate appearing on behalf of
the petitioner has submitted that he had purchased the property in the
auction proceedings on "as is where is" basis. He has drawn our
attention to the relevant portion of the sale certificate which reads as
under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "All other outstanding dues such as all rates, taxes, assessment,
      dues and duties and payments of Central and/or State Government
      or any other local body etc. now outstanding and/or chargeable
      upon the same as at present is agreed to be and shall be paid by the
      Borrower or the Bank on behalf of the Borrower.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">Thus, according to Mr.Patel, his client could not have been fastened
with such liability to pay the dues of the erstwhile owner towards
the water cess sought to be recovered by the GPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Mr.Patel, the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the

             C/SCA/1977/2013                              ORDER



petitioner has also drawn our attention to the relevant portion of the
Deed of Indemnity executed by the respondent No.3 Bank in favour
of the petitioner in addition to the sale certificate referred to above.
The relevant portion of the Deed of Indemnity reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "1.    The Bank has sold the said property more particularly
      described in the Schedule hereunder written, which belonged to
      KINNARIWALA as an Authorised Officer under the said Act,
      2002 as per offer of the Company wherein the Company has agreed
      to pay entire dues of Gujarat Electricity Board and rest of all
      Government or semi-Government, local authorities, dues just as all
      rates, taxes, assessment, duties which are payable by
      KINNARIWALA shall be paid by the Bank on behalf of
      KINNARIWALA being original owner of the said property. The
      Bank irrevocably agree and undertake to pay such duties as and
      when demanded by the Government or semi-Government
      Departments, local authorities for KINNARIWALA only on
      intimation or furnishing copies of such demand if received by the
      Company. In case of any dispute regarding any dues of
      KINNRIWALA the Bank shall settle the same without any
      objection of whatsoever kind or nature.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      2.     In the aforementioned premises and in consideration of the
      Company taking liability for discharge of GEB's outstanding dues
      in respect of the said Property, the Bank hereby undertakes to pay
      all outstanding dues save and except GEB's dues such as of
      Government (both Central and State) or semi-Government, local
      authorities by way of rates, taxes, cess, assessments, duties etc.
      which are payable by KINNARIWALA and accepts liability for
      the same and releases the Company from the payment of thereof
      and further undertakes to indemnify and to always keep
      indemnified against payment of such rates, taxes, cesses, etc. by
      the Company for and on behalf of KINNARIWALA or the Bank
      and all costs, charges and expenses incurred and damages suffered
      by the Company by reason of default in payment of
      aforementioned dues and discharge of liabilities."</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">      A plain reading of para 2 of the Deed of Indemnity would
suggest that the Bank undertook to pay all the outstanding dues save

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                Page 4 of 7</span>

and except the dues of GEB's such as of Government (both Central
and State) or semi-Government, local authorities by way of rates,
taxes, cess, assessments, duties etc. payable         by the defaulter. No
liability was fastened on the petitioner as the auction purchaser of
the property in question.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Mr. Patel thereafter has drawn our attention to <a href="/doc/1632123/" id="a_2">section 3</a> of the
Water Cess Act, 1977 which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "3. Levy and Collection of Cess

               rate, not exceeding the rate specified in the corresponding

<p id="p_12">      On the other hand, Mr.Vyas, the learned advocate appearing
for the Gujarat       Pollution Control Board submits that since the
petitioner purchased the property in the auction proceedings, all dues
of the erstwhile owner could be recovered through the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
having gone through the materials on record, the only question that
falls for our consideration in this petition is, whether the respondent
No.2 Gujarat Pollution Control Board, is justified              in seeking
recovery of the amount towards water cess from the petitioner being
dues of the erstwhile owner.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      Indisputably, the auction proceedings were finalized way back
in the year 2006. At the time of issue of the sale certificate also, the
petitioner was not fastened with any liability to make good the
payment due and payable by the erstwhile owner. The Kalupur
Commercial Cooperative Bank has also made its stance clear that
when the advertisement for public auction was issued, the GPCB



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  Page 6 of 7</span>
            C/SCA/1977/2013                             ORDER



had not made any demand towards the water cess. Mr.Vyas, the
learned advocate appearing for the GPCB has not been able to point
out any provisions of law or anything from the record to indicate
that such liability could be fastened upon the petitioner as purchaser
of the mortgaged property.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        We are of the view that in such circumstances referred to
above, the demand notices      dated 29th November 2011 and 15th
March 2012 respectively issued by the GPCB upon the petitioner
are not justified. However, we clarify that it would be open for the
GPCB to recover the requisite amount towards the dues of water
cess in accordance with law by initiating appropriate proceedings
before appropriate forum, but at least the same cannot be recovered
through the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_16">        For the aforementioned reasons, we allow this petition. The
impugned notices dated 29th November 2011 and 15th March 2012
issued by the GPCB are ordered to be quashed and set aside.
