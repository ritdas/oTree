ORAL
ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.		Heard
learned advocate Mr. Naik with Mr. Kunal Naik for Ms/ Trivedi and
Gupta, Mr. Rituraj Meena for respondent No.2 and learned Additional
Public Prosecutor  Mr. K. T Dave for respondent No.1. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">3.	
  Learned counsel  appearing for the petitioner submitted that lease
deed for mining limestone ,   was executed on 27th October
1986 and  no new mining operation have been started by the company
after the issuance  of notification dated 14th September
2006. Not only  that after issuance of notification, the company had
already applied for getting environmental clearance to the Government
of India  which came to be granted by certificate dated 31st
July 2008 by the Ministry  of Environmental  and Forest of the
Government of India. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.1		In
addition to  the above  learned counsel further submitted that  para
16 of the complaint  alleges breach of provisions  of notification
dated 14th September 2006 issued by the Ministry of
Environment  and Forests, Government of India, and admittedly  the
complaint  by  and large referred to the report  dated 10th
August 2006 of the mines area managed by the petitioner prior to 
issuance of the notification. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.2		Learned
counsel  further submitted that neither  the the petitioners have
constructed nor expanded their activities  which require any
clearance as per the above notification and therefore the respondent
is not  empowered to complain under this Act. Learned advocate
further submitted that incidentally  reference is made about
non-observation of certain provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.		Mr.
</p><p id="p_6">Rituraj Meena  learned advocate submitted  that apart from the
alleged breach of notification dated 14th September 2006
as found  on the inspection of the site,    petitioner herein was
carrying out mining activity  by violating certain provisions of the
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>, water Act and environment clearance  was not obtained as
envisaged under the notification. Learned advocate further submitted
that the petitioner herein is supposed to follow and comply with the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>, water Act and provisions contained in
various notifications issued even prior to the notification dated
14th September 2006. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.		Thus
according to the learned counsel for respondent No. 2, the  complaint
 need not be stayed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.		Having
heard learned counsel appearing  for the parties and perusal of the
record including  the notification dated 14th November
2006 and the inspection report of the mines area of the applicant,
subsequent  certificate by Ministry of Environment  and Forests 
granting environmental clearance and the pleadings of the parties,
prima facie I am of the opinion that the allegations  in the
complaint  are for breach of notification dated 14th
September 2006 which came to be published in the Gazette and became
effective after  the visit to site  by the officer on 10th
August 2006. Besides applicability  of the environment <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_5">(Protection)
Act</a> 1986, specifically the penal provisions  for non-compliance  of 
provisions  of other Acts, namely the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> deserves
consideration at this stage. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.		Hence,
Rule  returnable on  12th November 2008. Learned advocate
appearing  for respective parties  waives service  of rule. By way 
of interim relief  further proceedings of criminal case No.
339 of 2007 registered before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First
Class, Talala are stayed
till further order. However, this will not preclude  the
respondent GPCB No. 2 herein  to take action in accordance with law
for breach  if any  by the applicant under provisions of any other
Act.
