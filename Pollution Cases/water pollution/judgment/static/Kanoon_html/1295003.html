S.B. SINHA,  J:
</p>
<p id="p_2">	Section 72 of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968  provides for 
rule making power.  Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 72 of the Act  
read as under :
</p>
<p id="p_3">"(3)	Any rule under this Act  may be made with 
retrospective effect and when  such a rule 
is made the reasons for making the rule 
shall be specified in a statement to be 
laid  before both Houses of the State 
Legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_4">(4)	Every rule made under this Act, shall, 
immediately after it is made be laid 
before each House of the State Legislature 
if it is in session and if it is not in 
session, in the session immediately 
following for a total period of fourteen 
days which may be comprised in one session 
or in two successive sessions and if 
before the expiration of the session in 
which it is so laid or the session 
immediately following both Houses agree in 
making any modification in the rule or in 
the annulment of the rule, the rule shall, 
from the date on which the modification or 
annulment is notified, have effect only in 
such modified form or shall stand 
annulled, as the case may be, so however 
that any such modification or annulment 
shall be without prejudice to the validity 
of anything previously done under that 
rule."
</p>
<p id="p_5">	Sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act, therefore, confers power 
on the State to give retrospective effect to rules made thereunder, 
subject to the fulfillment of the legal requirements. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">The submission of Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel 
appearing on behalf of the respondents, is that it was not only 
mandatory to lay the said rule before both Houses of the State 
Legislatures inasmuch not only reasons for making the same with 
retrospective effect are to be assigned but also approval of the Houses 
was required to be obtained.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Strong reliance, in this behalf, has been placed on Union of India 
etc. vs. National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd. and Others etc. 
[(2001) 6 SCC 307]. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">  The submission of the learned counsel cannot be accepted for 
more than one reason.
</p>
<p id="p_9">Laying down of a subordinate legislation before  both Houses of 
the Legislature is directory in nature.  
</p>
<p id="p_10"><a href="/doc/982342/" id="a_1">In M/s Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. and Others vs. The State of 
Haryana</a> [(1979) 2 SCC 196], this court noticed that there are three 
different laying clauses which assure different forms depending on the 
degree of control which the Legislature may like to exercise, namely, -
</p>
<p id="p_11">(i)	Laying without further procedure,
</p><p id="p_12">(ii)	Laying subject to negative resolution,
</p><p id="p_13">(iii)	Laying subject to affirmative resolution.
</p>
<p id="p_14">Upon considering a large number of Indian and English decisions, 
it was held :
</p>
<p id="p_15">	"From the foregoing discussion, it 
inevitably follows that the Legislature never 
intended that non-compliance with the 
requirement of laying as envisaged  by sub-
section (6) of Section 3 of the Act should 
render the order void.  Consequently non-laying 
of the aforesaid notification fixing the maximum 
selling prices of various categories of iron and 
steel including the commodity in question before 
both Houses of Parliament cannot result in 
nullification of the notification..."
</p>
<p id="p_16">Yet again in <a href="/doc/281568/" id="a_2">Quarry Owners' Association vs. State of Bihar and 
Others</a> [(2000) 8 SCC 655], a Division Bench of this Court observed  :
</p>
<p id="p_17">"In a democratic set-up, every State Government 
is responsible to its State Legislature. When 
any statute requires mere laying of any 
notification or rule before the legislature its 
executive, viz., the State Government comes 
under the scrutiny of the legislature concerned. 
Every function and every exercise of power, by 
the State Government is under one or the other 
Ministry which in turn is accountable to the 
legislature concerned. Where any document, rule 
or notification requires placement before any 
House or when placed, the said House inherently 
gets the jurisdiction over the same, each member 
of the House, subject to its procedure gets the 
right to discuss the same, they may put 
questions to the Ministry concerned. 
</p><p id="p_18">Irrespective of the fact that such rules or 
notifications may not be under the purview of 
its modification, such Members may seek 
explanation from such Ministry of their 
inaction, arbitrariness, transgressing limits of 
their statutory orbit on any such other matter. 
Short of modification power, it has a right even 
to condemn the Ministry. No doubt in the case 
where the House is entrusted with power to 
annul, modify or approve any rule, it plays a 
positive role and has full control over it, but 
even where the matter is merely placed before 
any House, its positive control over the 
executive makes even mere laying to play a very 
vital and forceful role which keeps a check over 
the State Government concerned. Even if 
submission for the appellants is accepted that 
mere placement before a House is only for 
information, even then such information, 
inherently in it makes the legislature to play 
an important role as aforesaid for keeping a 
check on the activity of the State Government. 
Such placement cannot be construed to be non 
est. No act of Parliament should be construed to 
be of having no purpose. As we have said, mere 
discussion and questioning the Ministry 
concerned or authority in the House in respect 
of such laying would keep such authority on 
guard to act with circumspection which is a 
check on such authority, specially when such 
authority is even otherwise answerable to such 
legislature..."
</p>
<p id="p_19">It was further observed :
</p><p id="p_20">	"We also find there are few provisions in 
our Constitution which require mere laying 
before Parliament. <a href="/doc/1982492/" id="a_3">Article 151</a> requires laying 
of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor 
General of India before each House of Parliament 
and with reference to the State, to be laid 
before the legislature of the State. <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_4">Article 
338(5)</a> requires placing of the report of the 
Commission before each House of Parliament and 
with reference to the State Government, under 
sub-<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_5">article (7)</a> it is required to be laid before 
the legislature of the State. Though they are 
mere provisions for mere laying before 
Parliament, but it is always open to any Member 
of the House to discuss and comment on the said 
report." 
</p>
<p id="p_21">It was, inter alia, concluded :
</p><p id="p_22">"(d) Requirement of mere placement of the rules 
or the notifications before the State 
Legislature is also one of the forms of check on 
the State Government to exercise its powers as a 
delegatee." 
</p>
<p id="p_23">Sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act merely provides for 
laying down the rules before both the houses of the Legislature with the 
reasons for giving a retrospective effect.  The said provision does not 
speak of the necessity to obtain permission or prior approval therefor 
by the houses of the Legislature.  Only in the event the Legislature is 
not satisfied with the sufficiency or otherwise of the reasons assigned,  
it may direct that the same would operate prospectively. Sub-sections 
(3) and (4) of Section 72 must be read in such a manner that both may be 
given effect to. Sub-section (3) deals with only a special situation, 
whereas sub-section (4) is general in nature.  In the event, a negative 
resolution is adopted the Rules will cease to have the force of law.  
Difference between sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 72 lies in the 
fact that whereas in case the rule is given retrospectivity, the members 
of both the houses of the Legislature shall be apprised of the reasons 
therefor, whereas in case of the rule which is prospective in nature, 
simple laying down before both the Houses would serve the statutory 
object.    
</p>
<p id="p_24">In National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (supra), this Court 
was dealing with a different type of rule making power, viz. <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_6">Section 16</a> 
of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977 which 
reads as under :
</p><p id="p_25">"16. Power to amend Schedule I. - (1) The 
Central Government may, by notification in the 
Official Gazette, add to Schedule I any industry 
having regard to the consumption of water in the 
carrying on of such industry and the consequent 
discharge thereof resulting in pollution of any 
stream and thereupon Schedule I shall, subject 
to the provisions of sub-section (2), be deemed 
to be amended accordingly. 
</p><p id="p_26">(2) Every such notification shall be laid before 
each House of Parliament, if it is sitting, as 
soon as may be after the issue of the 
notification, and if it is not sitting, within 
seven days of its reassembly and the Central 
Government shall seek the approval of Parliament 
to the notification by a resolution moved within 
a period of fifteen days beginning with the day 
on which the notification is so laid before the 
House of the People, and if Parliament makes any 
modification in the notification or directs that 
the notification should cease to have effect, 
the notification shall thereafter have effect 
only in such modified form or be of no effect, 
as the case may be, but without prejudice to the 
validity of anything previously done 
thereunder." 
</p>
<p id="p_27">	In that case, therefore, laying of the Rules before both the 
Houses was held to be subject to affirmative resolution.  
</p>
<p id="p_28">Interpreting the said provision, it was observed :
</p>
<p id="p_29">"...Mere perusal of sub-section (2) shows that 
there has to be a positive act of approval by 
Parliament to the issuance of the notification 
before it can be held that Schedule I has been 
amended. Merely laying the notification before 
each House of Parliament is not sufficient 
compliance within the provisions of <a href="/doc/457557/" id="a_8">Section 
16(2)</a>. There is of course no time-limit within 
which the Houses of Parliament are required to 
pass a resolution once the Central Government has 
sought approval as contemplated by sub-section 
(2), but in the present case the pleadings 
disclose that no such approval was in fact sought 
for." 
</p>
<p id="p_30">						(Emphasis sought for)

The said observations, thus, must be held to be confined to the 
fact of the matter obtaining therein. In that case it was found as of 
fact that the rule had never been placed before the Legislature and, 
thus, there was even no substantial compliance of the law.  The Bench, 
however, did not consider the effect of the directory nature of such a 
provision, in the light of the decision of this Court in M/s Atlas Cycle 
Industries (supra) and Quarry Owners' Association (supra). The Court 
further did not notice the difference between the expressions 'approval' 
and 'permission'.  <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_9">Section 16</a> of the Water Act, construction whereof was 
in question did not use the expression 'prior approval'.  The word 
'approval' indicates that an Act which has already been made and is 
required to be approved whereas in the case of 'permission', the 
situation would be different.  This aspect of the matter has been 
considered by this Court in High Court of Judicature for <a href="/doc/1506702/" id="a_10">Rajasthan vs. 
P.P. Singh and Another</a> [(2003) 4 SCC 239] stating :
</p>
<p id="p_31">"When an approval is required, an action holds 
good. Only if it is disapproved it losses its 
force. Only when a permission is required, the 
decision does not become effective till 
permission is obtained. (<a href="/doc/967399/" id="a_11">See U.P. Avas Evam 
Vikas Parishad and Another v. Friends Coop. 
Housing Society Ltd and Another</a> [(1995) Supp (3) 
SCC 456].  In the instant case both the 
aforementioned requirements have been 
fulfilled."
</p>
<p id="p_32">Furthermore, in the instant case, the respondents have not been 
criminally proceeded against.  They have merely incurred a civil 
liability.  Such a liability could be fastened on them irrespective of 
Rule 24 of the A.P. Excise (Arrack and Toddy Licenses General 
Conditions) Rules, 1969  inasmuch in terms of the conditions of licence 
as also the Act and the Rules framed thereunder, the licensees are 
required to carry on their business in  liquor which would mean the 
liquor free from all types of adulteration. Such goods should be fit for 
human consumption and not hazardous to health. For the said purpose, it 
was not necessary for the State to strictly adhere to Rule 24 of the 
Rules inasmuch the right of an accused in terms of Articles 20 and 21 of 
the Constitution of India would not be attracted in such a case.  Even 
if Rule 24 as amended is held to have no retrospective effect, such a 
provision must be held to be directory and non-compliance thereof would 
not vitiate the proceedings for suspension of the licnece as even in 
such a case, it would be open to the respondents herein to get the 
sample tested by any other private laboratory of their choice for the 
purpose of showing that the allegations made against them are wrong.  
The respondents, thus, in no manner are prejudiced.  They in the 
proceedings initiated against them would be entitled to raise all other 
defences.    
</p>
<p id="p_33">By reason of such a rule no  substantive right of the appellants 
is affected inasmuch licences granted to the licensees are subject to 
the terms and conditions laid down therein whereby strict adherence to 
the provisions of the Act or the Rules framed thereunder would be 
implicit.
</p>
<p id="p_34">Furthermore, admittedly the laboratories owned by the State did 
not have the requisite facilities for testing drugs.  A Licensee having 
regard to public health cannot be permitted to escape his liabilities 
only because certain testing facilities are not available in the State 
Laboratories.  We have no doubt in our mind that considering the matter 
from that angle, Rule 24 must be held to be directory in nature.     
</p>
<p id="p_35">I may further observe that the observations made in the 
accompanying judgment of Dr. Lakshmanan, J. to the effect that it is 
also a settled law by a catena of decisions of this Court that no 
citizen has got any fundamental right for the trade in liquor and  it is 
for the Government to evolve the excise policy and implement the same in 
the interest of the public and safeguard the public may not have much 
relevance in the fact situation obtaining herein and more so when the 
said question is pending consideration before the Constitution Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_36">Subject to the aforementioned, I respectfully agree with the 
conclusion arrived at by Brother Lakshmanan, J. that the appeals be 
allowed.
