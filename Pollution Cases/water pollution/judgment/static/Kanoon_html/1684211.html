<p id="p_1">T.S.Thakur, C.J. (Oral)

             This petition has been filed in public interest for a writ of

mandamus directing respondents No.1 to 4 to initiate action against

respondents No. 5 to 8 who are disposing off/draining the chemical water

of adjoining dye units in the land owned by the Gram Panchayat, of which

the petitioner happens to be the Sarpanch.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             The petitioner's case as set out in the petition is that land

measuring 10.1/2 acres situate in village Azizulapur on the outskirts of the
 Civil Writ Petition No. 12594 of 2007                      [2]

town of Panipat is owned by the village Panchayat Azizulapur. The said

piece of land was, according to the petitioner, leased to respondents No. 5 to

8 for agricultural purposes. Instead of using the land for the purpose for

which it was leased, the said respondents appear to have permitted for

monetary consideration certain dyeing units situate in the area to drain their

chemical effluents into the land in question. As a result of this illegal

draining of water on to the land owned by the Panchayat, the fertility of the

land has been adversely affected and agriculture operations in the same

made impossible. Photographs attached with the petition have been relied

upon in order to show that the entire area is now in the form of a tank full of

weeds and effluents from the dyeing units. It is alleged that since the

Haryana State Pollution Control Board did not take any action in the matter,

the petitioner was left with no alternative except to approach this Court for

intervention and mandamus directing the State Pollution Control Board to

take action against respondents No. 5 to 8 and also the dyeing units which

were draining the effluents on to the land in question.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Mr. Walia, counsel appearing for the Haryana State Pollution

Control Board, has filed a counter affidavit, inter alia, pointing out that the

State Government have in consultation with all the limbs of the State

machinery taken a decision to shift the polluting dyeing units that have

come up in a haphazard and unsystematic manner in residential and non

conforming area of the city of Panipat to Sector 29 Part II, of that City. It is

stated that most of the dyeing units are operating in the city of Panipat

without any Effluent Treatment Plant and generate untreated trade effluent

causing water pollution in the whole of the city. The Board has also filed

Action Taken Report in compliance with order dated 07.11.2008 in which it
 Civil Writ Petition No. 12594 of 2007                     [3]

is, inter alia, pointed out that five units responsible for draining water on to

the land owned by the Panchayat were issued show cause notices dated

22.09.2008 for closure. The sixth unit M/s B.S. Dye House, near

Azizulapur, Barsat Road, Panipat, was also given a similar notice under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">section 33-A</a> of the Water Pollution Control Act, 1974. In response to the

said notices, three of such units, viz. Nitin Dye House, Virk Dye House and

B.S. Dye House, Panipat, did not appear to avail the personal hearing

offered to them. The said units were thereafter ordered to be closed down

vide order dated 15.12.2008, a copy of which is attached with the Action

Taken Report as Annexures R-1, R-2 and R-3. Three other units, viz. M/s

Malik Traders, M/s R.K. Enterprises and M/s Malik Enterprises, Panipat,

however, appeared and were asked to instal the treatment plants for

treatment of the effluents failing which the units would be closed down. The

Chairman of the Board then passed an order on 15.12.2008 directing that

the said units shall submit their scheme for installation of effluent treatment

plant within 15 days and till the time they did so, bleaching process shall be

shut down. Consequently, the six units mentioned above are lying closed

and are not discharging any untreated effluent. Counsel appearing for the

petitioner, however, contends that although according to the Action Taken

Report, the units have been shut down, the fact of the matter is that

untreated effluent continues to spread into and accumulate over the land in

question. There is according to the learned counsel no effective

implementation of the closure order by the Pollution Control Board with the

result that the nuisance continues to persist and those responsible for the

same continue to     prosper. It is submitted that this Court could issue

directions for a proper implementation of the closure order so that untreated
 Civil Writ Petition No. 12594 of 2007                   [4]

effluent discharged from the dyeing units does not play havoc with the

environment of the area nor cause any damage to the valuable property

owned by the Panchayat. It is also submitted that the damage already caused

to the land owned by the Panchayat has to be compensated by those who are

responsible for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            We have given our careful consideration to the submissions

made at the bar. According to the respondents, the polluting units have been

shut down in terms of the orders mentioned in the Action Taken Report.

Action Taken Report, however, does not go further to state that the water

accumulated on the land owned by the Panchayat was being drained only

from the six units referred to earlier. It appears that there is a certain

amount of laxity on the part of the Pollution Control Board in taking

appropriate action against all those responsible for causing the pollution in

question. The Pollution Control Board would, therefore, do well not only to

prevent draining of the effluents by the units that are already shut down but

may be operating illegally as also from other units that are situate in the

vicinity and are violating the statutory norms on the subject. The petitioner

can in this regard approach the Pollution Control Board giving specific

instances and seeking specific action against those responsible for draining

the chemical water. As and when any such representation is filed by the

petitioner, the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board shall immediately

look into the matter and take appropriate steps in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_5">            In so far as compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by

the land owned by the Panchayat is concerned, we do not think that it is

possible for us in the present proceedings to embark upon any inquiry as to

the extent of such damage and to fix the liability upon those responsible for
 Civil Writ Petition No. 12594 of 2007                      [5]

causing the same. The proper course, in our opinion, is that the petitioner

Panchayat should seek compensation in appropriate proceedings before the

appropriate forum including civil action, if so advised.

</p><p id="p_6">             The writ petition with the above directions and observations is

disposed of leaving the parties to bear their own costs.</p><pre id="pre_2">
