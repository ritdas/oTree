        Heard Mr. Mithilesh Singh, learned counsel, appearing for the
petitioners and Mr. Rakesh Kumar, learned A.P.P. for the State.
</p><p id="p_17">        Petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is
apprehending his arrest in connection with Ramgarh P.S. Case No. 121 of
2014 (G.R. Case No. 1407 of 2014), registered for the offences
punishable u/s 376,313,493 and 420 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">I.P.C</a>.
</p><p id="p_18">        It has been submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that
earlier the informant used to work in the house of the petitioner as maid-
servant and since there was some dispute with respect to sell and
purchase of land a case was instituted by the wife of the petitioner against
informant. It has also been submitted that in the complaint petition itself it
has been mentioned about the intimacy which had developed about 7-8
years ago when the informant had gone to the State Bank India, Ramgarh
Branch for agriculture loan, where the petitioner was working as Cashier,
who asked the informant to come on the next day. It has also been
submitted that thereafter the informant always used to visit the bank and
meet with the petitioner and therefore it would be improbable that the
informant would not be knowing about the marital status of the petitioner.
It has also been submitted that the petitioner is a physical disabled person
having 60% disability.
</p><p id="p_19">        Learned A.P.P. appearing for the State has opposed the prayer
for anticipatory bail of the petitioner and referring to Paragraph-4, 6 and 18
of the case diary has submitted that some of the witnesses have stated
that they were knowing that the informant is the wife of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_20">        Apart from inordinate delay in lodging the present case by the
informant, the wife of the petitioner had also instituted a case against the
informant prior to institution of the present case and therefore institution of
the subsequent case by the informant can be said to be with malicious
intent and by way of retaliation.
