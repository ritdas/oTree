</p>
<p id="p_13">2.5    The State Government vide its Circular dated 15 th March,
1999 had declared that the Development Authority while
preparing the scheme should maintain the river, pond, Talav
(Lake), Nala (Stream), large lake, canal or any other place
connected with the water body that may be a part of the
development scheme and should not include the same in the
Town Planning Scheme for any other purpose other than the

Act</a>.   So far as the water bodies were concerned, as indicated
in Clause (10) of the Circular, it was pointed-out that the lakes
and all water bodies be maintained and no development
permission be granted so as to affect its existence.            In
consonance with the provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_2">Development
Act</a>, the State Government had issued instructions and,
therefore, it became the bounden duty of the Municipal
Corporation or the Area Development Authority or the Urban
Development Authority or the District Collector, as the case
may be, to ensure that the water bodies remain as they were.

</p>
<p id="p_24">A)   On behalf of the respondent No.2 an affidavit-in-reply has

"Lakhudi Talavadi" was included in the Town Planning Scheme
No.3 (Ellisbridge), "Shekharpur-Khanpur" Section (First varied).
The State Government had sanctioned the scheme on 13 th

1988.     The land in question was allotted to the appropriate
authority for the slum up-gradation (Final Plot No.190).
</p>
<p id="p_28">E)   As the Town Planning Scheme was sanctioned under Sec.
65 of the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development Act,
1976, it became a part of the Act. The land in question was
included in the First Draft Revised Development Plan of AUDA
which was sanctioned by the Government on 8th October,
2002. The land was proposed to be notified as a residential
Zone.
</p>

<p id="p_31">4.   Stance of the Respondent no.4 Safal Construction
     Pvt.Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_32">A)   The land in question is nothing but a slum, which is in
existence past more than 4 to 5 decades. The official record of
the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and Town Planning
Department indicates that the land in question is not a water
body. The petition is not a bonafide public interest litigation as
the same has been filed for the compliance of the order dated
2nd August, 2002 passed by this Court and more particularly
when the said order culminated in a Notification issued by the
State Government in the year 2005 notifying various water
bodies situated across the State of Gujarat.

out the necessary survey of the land in question where the
slums are situated.     Thereafter in terms of the policy of the

before the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation after obtaining
the formal consent of the slum dwellers according to the
policy.

the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation considering the various
aspects of the policy and after being satisfied, the same was

Department on 3rd January,2012 for its sanction.
</p>
<p id="p_35">D)   The State of Gujarat vide its communication dated 18 th
May, 2012 approved the proposal of the respondent forwarded
by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.                      The respondent
was accordingly informed by the AMC vide communication
dated 29th May, 2012 about the grant of sanction by the State
Government and the respondent was further directed to
undertake the procedure in accordance with the terms of the
policy.

<p id="p_36">E)   Under the Slum Rehabilitation Policy, the respondent as a
Developer,      has     an    obligation     to   provide    a   free   pukka
residential unit to each of the eligible slum dweller and till such
fully habitable unit is provided to the slum dweller under the
policy, the developer would also be under an obligation to
provide them with a temporary accommodation on rent.

<p id="p_37">F)   On 16th March, 2012 the Society in the name of "Shree
Lakhudi     Talavadi         Co-op.Housing        Society"    came      to   be
registered in accordance with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_4">Cooperative
Societies Act</a>. According to the policy, the respondent is under
an obligation to provide more than 500 residential units to the
eligible slum dwellers, admeasuring 36 sq.mtrs. built-up area
of each of the units.
</p>
<p id="p_38">G)   The State Government, vide its notification dated 14 th
May, 2013 however, relaxed a few conditions considering the
fact that around more than 500 slum dwellers are to be
provided with the necessary accommodation including a
School, Anganwadi and Community Center.

<p id="p_44">6.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and having gone through the materials on record, the
only question that falls for our consideration in this public
interest litigation is whether the petitioner is entitled to any of
the reliefs prayed for in this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_45">7.    The entire petition is based on the judgment and order
delivered by this Court dated 2nd August, 2002 in Special Civil
Application No.10621/2000 and other allied matters wherein a
Division Bench of this Court issued various directions to the
State Government and other authorities for maintenance and
protection of the water bodies in the State of Gujarat. To put it
briefly, the litigation was one centering around the question of
protecting, preserving and improving the water bodies in the
State and further safeguarding them against encroachments.
Appropriate directions were prayed for on behalf of the
respondents to place the Water Policy of the Government of

to the authorities including the Municipal Commissioner for
removing encroachment from the Final Plot No.190 on the
ground that unhygienic conditions were prevailing because of
encroachments on the plot.

<p id="p_47">9.   The petitions were adjudicated and Mr.Panchal has
placed strong reliance on the observations made by the Court
in paras-14 to 18 of its order, which are quoted below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     14. The powers and functions of Urban Development
     Authorities prescribed under section 23 of the Gujarat
     Town Planning &amp; Urban Development Act, include power
     to execute works in connection with supply of water
     (clause vi). Similar power is given to the Area
     Development Authority under <a href="/doc/1512350/" id="a_5">section 7(vii)</a>. A draft
     development plan under <a href="/doc/1245728/" id="a_6">section 12</a> shall provide for

     drainage under clause (e), preservation, conservation
     and development of areas of natural scenery and
     landscape under clause (h), and for preventing or
     removing pollution of water under clause (n). These
     provisions apply to the Urban Development Authority by
     virtue of <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_8">section 25</a> of the Act. Under <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_9">section 40(3)(a)</a>, a

     or reservation of land for public purposes of all kinds as
     provided in clause (e), for water supply as provided by
     clause (h), and, drainage as provided under clause (f).

<a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_15">section 16</a> empowers it to lay down, modify or annul, in
consultation with the State Government concerned, the

nature of the use of the water in such stream or well or

the function of the State Board shall be to plan a
comprehensive programme for the prevention control
and abatement of pollution of streams and wells in the
State and secure the execution thereof. These provisions
indicate the anxiety of the legislature to maintain the
quality of water for which standards are required to be
laid down.
</p>
<p id="p_49">16. The above constitutional and statutory provisions
clearly bring to fore the paramount duty of the State
Government, Municipal and Panchayat authorities, the
Area Development Authorities and other legal authorities,
to protect and improve water bodies as a part of
environment and to ensure supply of safe water to the
public. The State as the trustee of all natural resources
meant for public use, including lakes and ponds, is under
a legal duty to protect them. This duty is of a positive
nature requiring the State including the Area
Development Authorities and the Local Bodies not only to
protect the peoples common heritage of lakes, ponds,
reservoirs and streams, but to prevent them from
becoming extinct and to rejuvenate and preserve them
quantitatively by harvesting rainwater and qualitatively
by prescribing and enforcing standards of their water.
There is ample legislation to arm these authorities with
the power to preserve these natural resources and
prevent their abuse. The duty of the State in this regard
is clearly spelt out by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_17">M.C.Mehta v.
Kamal Nath</a>, reported in (1997) 1 SCC 388, and that of
every citizen to protect the natural environment
including lakes in <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_18">M.C.Mehta v. Union of India</a>, reported in
(1997) 3 SCC 715. The necessity to limit the construction
activities in the close vicinity of the two lakes was
recognized by the Supreme Court, as noted above. It is
rather unfortunate that decades have passed with laws
already governing the field being put to disuse by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                       Page 14 of 22</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28"> C/WPPIL/72/2014                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>



apathy of the authorities to actively involve themselves
in protection and preservation of water bodies. The
interim orders made in these petitions have, however,
goaded them into some action and the final responses on
behalf of the State Government, the Urban Development
Authorities and the Municipal Corporation have raised a
distinct ray of hope that may in near future glitter on the
surface waters of the waterbodies that are promised to
be reinforced and preserved.
</p>
<p id="p_50">17. The importance of identifying the waterbodies in the
State can hardly be over emphasized. That is indeed the
starting point; and, after much exercise, the State
Government has placed on record the particulars of the
xisting lakes and ponds and acceded to the suggestion of
this Court that it will notify in the Gazette all the
waterbodies indicated in the Development Plans and the
Town Planning Schemes, as also the lakes and ponds in
other areas of the State where a Scheme or Development
Plan is not operative, so as to identify them for all time to
come. We accordingly direct that the State Government
will notify all the lakes and ponds as may have been
shown in the areas covered by the Town Planning
Schemes and Development Plans, as also those in the
areas not so covered throughout the State, in short all
the waterbodies in the territory of the State that vest in
the State and / or the Area Development Authorities or
the local bodies including Panchayats, in the official
gazette within three months from the date of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_51">18. The next important aspect is that the waterbodies
that vest in the State or local bodies should not be
alienated or transferred. It appears that, in the past, the
land covered by the waterbodies have been put to other
uses under the Town Planning Schemes and then a stand
is taken up that the Town Planning Schemes having
become part of the statute, the Court cannot do anything
about it, or, if such land is put to some other use allowed
under the scheme, that it will not be appropriate to dig
up the construction to revive a waterbody. When State is
enjoined upon a duty under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_19">Article 48A</a> read with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article
21</a> of the Constitution to endeavour to protect and
improve environment which would include the
waterbodies and every citizen is under a duty under
<a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_21">Article 51A(g)</a> to protect and improve environment
including lakes, which are specifically mentioned therein

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                       Page 15 of 22</span>

as a part of environment, and when such material
resources need to be protected to enable people to enjoy
a quality life which is the essence of the right to life
guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_22">Article 21</a> as held by the Apex Court in
Hinchlal's case (supra), there would virtually be no
constitutional option to convert the land under the lakes
and ponds to any use that may alter their character as
waterbodies in violation of the constitutional mandates to
the State and the citizens not only to protect but to
improve them. The Supreme Court has made this explicit
in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_23">M.C.Mehta v. Kamal Nath</a>, reported in (1997) 1 SCC
388 by holding that these natural resources are meant
for the public use and cannot be converted into private
ownership. Step in this direction is taken by the State
Government by declaring Draft of the State Water Policy
(2002). Announcements on Water Resources Planning,
Development and Management in paragraph 4 of the
Policy statement include the strategy of making efforts
"to protect and use all fresh water / natural resources like
lakes, tanks, ponds, talavadis, springs etc. and
preservation of existing freshwater bodies shall be
ensured. Traditional water retaining structures shall be
protected .........". The Circular dated 15-3-1999 (a copy
of which is annexed with the affidavit-in-reply dated 4-4-
2002 of the Under Secretary to the Government, Urban
Development &amp; Urban Housing Department), was issued
instructing the concerned authorities that while making
any original development plan or a revised development
plan, the waterbodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds, canals
or any other type of waterbodies should be preserved as
such waterbodies and should not be included in the
proposals for other uses and these waterbodies should
not be given any final plot number and their character
should be preserved. In order to ensure that the
waterbodies in the State which are identified as per the
development plans, town planning schemes and the
government records and which will be notified in the
official gazette, we direct that the State Government, all
Area Development Authorities and local Bodies will
protect, maintain and preserve all the waterbodies in the
State which are identified as per the development plans,
town planning schemes and the government records and
which will be notified in the official gazette, as
waterbodies and they will not be alienated or transferred
or put to any use other than as waterbodies."

<p id="p_56">11.   Thus, there is no doubt that the Division Bench of this
Court took cognizance of a very important issue in public
interest relating to preservation and protection of water bodies
situated in the entire State of Gujarat. There is also no doubt
that the first and the foremost direction which was issued was
with regard to notifying all the lakes and ponds as may have
been shown in the areas covered by the Town Planning
Schemes and the development plans as also those in the areas
not so covered through-out the State.                       Pursuant to such
direction, the State Government identified all such Water
bodies in the form of lakes and ponds and notified those by
way of a notification which was issued in the year 2005.

<p id="p_61">      4.     I submit that the State Government assures this
             Hon'ble Court that proper monitoring would be

             maintenance of the Water Bodies as such."
</p>
<p id="p_62">13.   Therefore, the first question we need to consider is
whether the land in question known as "Lakhudi Talavadi" is a
notified water body or not. From the materials on record, as
discussed above, it appears that the land in question is not a
notified water body. The land in question has been included in
the Town Planning Scheme which had already been sanctioned
under Sec. 65 of the Act, 1976 and has come into force. The
land in question has also been included in the Development
Plan and has been allotted to the appropriate authority past
many yeasrs.
</p>
<p id="p_63">14.   Therefore, the reliance placed by the petitioner on the
decision of this Court rendered in the year 2002 is of no
assistance. It appears that the land in question was included in
the T.P. Scheme No.3 (Ellisbridge) and the State Government
had sanctioned such a scheme way back on 13 th February,
1945 which came into force from 15 th March, 1945. The land in
question     was        allotted   for   the        purpose   of   garden     and
playground.       At a later stage the same was included in the
second varied Town Planning Scheme No.3. The preliminary


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                    Page 21 of 22</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">            C/WPPIL/72/2014                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>



scheme was sanctioned by the Government on 4 th November,
1988 and the same came into force w.e.f. 15th December,
1988.        Most importantly the land in question was allotted to
the appropriate authority for the up-gradation of the slum.
With the sanctioning of the Town Planning Scheme under Sec.
65 of the Act, 1976 the land has become a part of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_64">15.    In our opinion, it appears that at no point of time the land
was used as a waterbody in the form of a lake.             The name
"Lakhudi Talavadi" may give an impression that the same
might have been a small pond at some point of time. But to
say at this stage after almost 65 years that the same should be
put to use as a pond does not appear to be reasonable. It also
appears that past almost 4 to 5 decades the land is being
occupied by slum dwellers and the State Government has
