ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	present acquittal Appeal has been filed by the appellant ? 
	Assistant Environmental Engineer under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of
	Criminal Procedure, against the Judgment and Order dated 23.10.1997,
	rendered in Criminal Case No. 62 of 1991, by the learned Judicial
	Magistrate, First Class, Ankleshwar, whereby the learned Magistrate
	has acquitted all the accused from the offences charged against
	them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">It
	is the case of the appellant ?  original complainant that as an
	Assistant Environmental Engineer in Gujarat Pollution Control Board
	he was authorized to prosecute the persons who commit the breach of
	the provision of <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention of Control of
	Pollution) Act, 1974 (for short ?Sthe Water Act??). The respondent
	No.1 is a limited company and the respondents No.2 &amp; 3 are the
	Directors  of the said respondent No.1 ?  Company. The respondent
	No.1 company was producing Teak Iron Oxide and for raw-material they
	are using Sulfate, casting Soda, etc. and the respondents were
	discharging the polluted water out side without purification. The
	respondents have not obtained any permission from the Gujarat Water
	Pollution Control Board (for short ?SGPCB??). The complainant
	thereupon had visited the place of the respondents and found that
	the permission to flow the water obtained by the respondents from
	the GPCB vide letter dated 2.12.1986, the respondents are
	discharging the effluent/polluted water and thereby the respondents
	have not followed the rules and regulation of GPCB, as per consent
	given by them and thereby they have committed the offence punishable
	under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>. Thereupon the complainant filed Complaint under
	<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">25</a> read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">Sections  44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_7">47</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">The
	learned JMFC framed the charge Ex.47 against the accused. Thereafter
	the evidence was led and after hearing the parties the learned
	Magistrate came to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to
	establish its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted all the
	accused from the charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Being
	aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said Judgment and order dated
	23/10/1997 rendered by the learned Joint JMFC, Ankleshwar, in
	Criminal Case No. 62 of 1991, the appellant has preferred this
	Appeal, in the capacity of the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Heard
	learned APP Ms. Mita Panchal for the State and learned Senior
	Advocate Mr. Vikram Singh, for Singh &amp; Buch, on behalf of the
	respondents ?  original accused.
</p>
<p id="p_6">It
	is contended by learned APP that the Judgment and order of the trial
	Court is against the provision of law; the trial Court has not
	properly considered the evidence led by the prosecution and looking
	to the provisions of law itself it is established that the
	prosecution has proved the whole ingredients of the evidence against
	the present respondents. Learned APP has also read the oral as well
	as the documentary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">On
	behalf of the respondents ?  accused learned Advocate Mr. Vikram
	Singh has contended that the matter is very old. He has also
	contended that the prosecution has failed to establish its case
	beyond reasonable doubt. It is also contended that due to cause of
	doubt the respondents been wrongly involved in the commission of
	offence and there is nothing on record to show that the appellant
	has prima facie case. Lastly, he contended that the learned
	Magistrate has assigned cogent reason and after fully appreciating
	the evidence the learned Magistrate has rightly acquitted the
	accused from the offences charged against them.
</p>
<p id="p_8">I
	have gone through the Judgment and order passed by the learned
	Magistrate. I have also perused the oral as well as documentary
	evidence led before the trial Court and also considered the
	submissions made by the learned Counsel for the respective parties.
	From the evidence itself it is established that the prosecution has
	not proved its prima facie case beyond reasonable doubt. When the
	prosecution has failed to establish its case against the accused
	then the accused are entitled to get the benefit of doubt and there
	is no reason to interfere with the reasons assigned by the learned
	Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_9">It
	is settled legal position that in acquittal Appeal the appellate
	Court is not required to re-write the Judgment or to give fresh
	reasonings when the reasons assigned by the trial Court acquitting
	the accused. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
	STATE OF KARNATAKA v/s. HEMAREDDY, reported in AIR 1981 SC
	1417, has observed that when the Appellate Court agrees with the
	reasons and the opinion given by the lower Court then the
	re-discussion of evidence is not necessary. In the instant case,
	this Court is in full agreement with the reasons given and findings
	recorded by the trial Court while acquitting the respondents ? 
	accused and adopting the said reasons and for the reasons aforesaid,
	in my view, the impugned Judgment is just, legal and proper and
	requires no interference by this Court at this stage. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">In
	view of above discussion, I see no reason to interfere with the
	findings arrived at by the trial Court. Hence, this Appeal requires
	to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">In
	the result, the Appeal is hereby dismissed. The impugned Judgment
	and order dated 23.10.1997 passed by the learned Joint J.M.F.C.,
	Ankleshwar, in Criminal Case No. 62 of 1991 acquitting the
	respondents ?  accused, is hereby confirmed. Bail bonds, if any,
	shall stands cancelled.
