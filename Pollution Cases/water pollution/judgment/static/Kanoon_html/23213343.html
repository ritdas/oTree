</p><p id="p_2">1. Vide this order I shall dispose of the application filed u/s 245(2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a> read 

   with <a href="/doc/729109/" id="a_2">section 258</a> Cr.P.C filed on behalf of accused no.2 S.P. Gupta seeking his 

   discharge as well as point of framing of notice.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2. The discharge is sought on the ground that there is utter misuse of provisions 

   of   law   by   skipping   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/105867/" id="a_3">Section   33</a>­A   of   the   Water   (Prevention   &amp; 

   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and even before exhausting remedy available under 

   Clauses D (18) &amp; D(19) of the Agreement dated 20.07.05. It is further alleged 

   that  there  is false  allegation  in   the   complaint that the  accused   society  was 

   holding a permission to establish and operate till 26.01.07 and failed to obtain 

   its renewal. It is further alleged that the accused society made a representation 

   to   the   complainant   but   without   addressing   the   issues   raised   therein,   the 

   present complaint has been filed against the applicant/accused. It is further 

   alleged   that   plant   is   owned   and   constructed   by   the   Government   itself   and 

   society   is   only   running   the   treatment   plant.   The   fresh   inspection   reports 

   conducted   by   the   department   annexed   with   the   present   application   clearly 

   shows that the discharge of treated water is as per the desired EPA Standards 

   of the complainant. The accused society was never under obligation to obtain, 

   consent from the complainant department for running the plant in question.

</p><p id="p_5"> 3. It is DSIDC &amp; DJB which is operating agency and office bearer of the accused 

   society are senior citizens working on honorary basis and is not a beneficiary 

   from   this   project   in   any   manner.   Even   the   agreement   dated   20.07.05   had 

   already   expired   on   19.07.10.   and   accused   society   is   no   more   bound   to   do 

   anything   after   the   expiry   of   the   said   agreement.   The   representation   dated 

   11.03.11 was submitted with the complainant department to relieve the accused 

   society  from its  responsibility but  of no  avail.  Even  a  meeting   was  held  on 

   18.05.11 with the Commissioner of Industries for the purpose of clarification 

   that no permission is required to the society in view of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">section 25</a> of Water 

   (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a> but he refused to give a clarification in 

   writing. Even in accordance with the agreement dated 20.07.05, complainant 

   was to provide space for storage of solid waste latest by 31.12.05 as per serial 

   no.17 of the said agreement but no space was provided. This is willful non­

   performance of the authorities and for the said Act, they should be punished. 

   Instead of taking responsibility, present complaint has been filed maliciously. 

   Even, the complainant maliciously concealed that the appropriate authority had 

   all powers in the agreement dated 20.07.05 to substitute any other NGO for its 

   operation   &amp;   maintenance   if   the   working   of   the   society   was   not   found 

   satisfactory but no such step was taken. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4. It is further alleged that there is an arbitration clause clause in the agreement 

   dated 20.07.05 and before initiating any prosecution, they were duty bound to 

   invoke the arbitration clause. It was the duty of the DSIDC to take all statutory 



DPCC vs M/s GTK Road Industrial  Estate CETP Society &amp; Ors.                                        2
    permission/clearance   and   to   renew   the   permission,   if   any,   and   thus 

   applicant/accused is not responsible for any statutory lapses and is entitled for 

   discharge.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5. Reply to the application was filed denying all the material facts. It is further 

   stated that the application is pre­mature. It is further stated that event the pre­

   charge evidence is not recorded u/s 244 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. It is further stated that under 

   <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_8">section 245</a> Cr.P.C, the court is to see only prima facie case on the basis of 

   unrebutted evidence. In the present case, even no evidence was recorded at 

   the pre­summoning evidence stage, the complainant being government official. 

   Thus, it is stated that in case the application will be allowed, it would amount to 

   recalling the summoning order as nothing material has been brought on record 

   after   the   stage   of   summoning   except   appearance   of   the   accused   and 

   accepting them on bail. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6. It is further stated that the accused society is bound by the provisions under 

   'The Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plants  Rules, 2001 (DCETP Rules). It 

   is   further   stated   that   it   was   the   duty   of   the   accused   society   to   manage, 

   maintain, operate the CETP in accordance with the prescribed standard of the 

   various Act including Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act (Water Act</a>) 

   to obtain necessary clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act (E.P. 

   Act), <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Act</a> and Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act (Air Act</a>). It is 

   further stated that in view of the clear­cut statutory provisions, the agreement 

   can   not   and   does   not   override   the   provisions   of   the   <a href="/doc/1801280/" id="a_12">DCETP   Act   and   the 

DPCC vs M/s GTK Road Industrial  Estate CETP Society &amp; Ors</a>.                                           3
    DCETP  Rules.  Moreover,  the   complainant   has  never  been   the   party  to   the 

   alleged agreement and therefore, agreement has no binding effect upon the 

   complainant.   It   is   further   alleged   that   that   even   the   clause   22   of   the   said 

   agreement makes it clear that it is the responsibility of the accused society to 

   comply various laws applicable to the society and for running the Common 

   Effluent   Treatment   Plant   (CETP).   Present   complaint   was   filed   because   of 

   contravention of provisions u/s 25/26 read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_13">section 44</a>/<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_14">47</a>/<a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_15">49</a> of Water Act

   of the DECTP Act read with rule 3(4) &amp; (10) of DECTP Rules. Thus, it is prayed 

   that   application   filed   on   behalf   of   accused   no.2   is   premature   and   is   not 

   maintainable on merits as well and therefore, same is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_35">9. The   first   contention   raised   is   that   the   DCET   Rules,   2001   was   enacted   for 

   recovery   of   dues   as   arrears   of   land   revenue   in   respect   of   the   capital   and 

   recurring costs of common effluent treatment plants set up in the Industrial 

   Estates in the National Capital Territory of Delhi and thus, there can be no 

   prosecution. However, this contention has no merits. If the entire scheme of 

   the said Rule is read together, it is clear that beside the aforesaid duties, the 

   appropriate   authority   is   bound   to   check   the   appropriate   functioning   of   the 

   apparatus, their installation and to give directions time to time to furnish the 

   information for carrying on any industry, operation,  process, or treatment and 

   disposal of system including domestic sewage and such direction can be given 

   to   any   occupier/society/person,   officer   or   authority.   Further,   if   there   is   non­

   compliance or there is contraventions of provisions of the said Rules that is 

   itself an offence punishable u/s 19 of the said Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">10.The next argument is that CETP Society are not bound to apply for consent 

   under the E.P. Act, <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_44">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_45">Air Act</a> but it is for the appropriate authority 

   to obtain necessary permission. It is further contended that even in view of the 

   agreement dated 20.07.05, it was the duty of the appropriate authority to obtain 

   necessary   permission   prior   to   running   any   CETP   system.   However,   said 

   contentions are misplaced. Bare perusal of section 3 of the Delhi Common 

   Effluent Treatment Rules, 2001, clearly mandates that it would be the function

    of CETP Society to obtain the necessary clearances which are required under 

   the E.P. Act, <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_46">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_47">Air Act</a>. It would be further the duty of the CETP 

   Society to manage, operate and maintain the CETP in accordance with the 

   standards prescribed in the said Acts. 
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">11.It is settled principle of law that any agreement which is contrary to the statutes 

   is void to the extent it is not in conformity with the provisions of law. There can 

   be   no   estoppal   against   statutes.   Thus,   reliance   placed   by   the 

   applicant/accused upon the agreement dated 20.07.05 is of no help. Further, 

   from the record, it is clear that the present complainant was neither a party nor 

   in   any   way   is   connected   with   the   said   agreement   replied   upon   by   the 

   applicant/accused. Since as per the statutes, it is the duty of the society to 

   obtain necessary clearances, therefore, society can not be relieved from its 

   duties under pretext of agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">12.The next argument advanced is that CETP Society is not an industry within 

   the meaning of 2(k) of Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_48">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and therefore, 

   there is no question of discharging untreated effluent. It is further contended 

   that CETP plants run by the society is only discharging the treated effluent and 

   there are report subsequent to the inspection wherein it is clearly mentioned 

   that that there is no discharge of effluent by the accused society. In support of 

   the said contention, applicant/accused has relied upon the 33 reports annexed 

   with the application. So far as the documents annexed are concerned, these 

   documents are in respect of subsequent period. Moreover, even charge has 

DPCC vs M/s GTK Road Industrial  Estate CETP Society &amp; Ors.                                    8
    not been framed yet. Therefore, the defence of the accused can not be taken 

   into consideration at this stage. So far as the society being industry or not is 

   concerned,   it   is   clear   from   the   definitions   of   CEPT   Society   as   provided   in 

   section 6 of  Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Act, 2000. It has been provided 

   that   CEPT   Society   can   be   constituted   by   an   Industrial   Estate   or   Industrial 

   Estates   in   Delhi   for   performing   of   such   functions   including   setting   up   and 

   operating   a   CETP   for   the   units   in   such   industrial   estate   or   estates.   Thus, 

   definition of society makes itself clear that applicant/accused is duty bound to 

   get the effluent treated before its discharge. Thus, by necessary implication, 

   CETP   Society   is   bound   to   perform   the   duties   which   were   casted   upon 

   industries i.e to discharge the effluent only after its treatment.


</p><p id="p_42">13.Next   arguments   have   been   advanced   that   according   to   rule   23   of     Delhi 

   Common   Effluent   Treatment   Rules,   2001,   no   court   shall   take   cognizance 

   except on the complaint filed on behalf of the appropriate authority and since 

   the present complaint has not been filed on behalf of the appropriate authority 

   i.e Commissioner of Industry or any other officer not below the rank of Joint 

   Director,   therefore,   present   complaint   is   liable   to   be   dismissed.   The   said 

   contention is misplaced. Present complaint has been filed by DPCC through

    with rule 3(4) &amp; (10) of the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Rules, 2001 as 

   well. It is clear from the para no.16 of the complaint that the complainant is the 

   serving Environmental Engineer and thus authorized to sign and prosecute the 

   present   complaint   which   meet   out   the   requirement   as   prescribed   in   Water 

   (Prevention   &amp;   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_57">Control   of   Pollution)   Act</a>   and     Air   (Prevention   &amp;     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_58">Control   of 

   Pollution) Act</a> for filing of the complaint. Thus, complaint is competent to file the 

   present complaint.

<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">14.Next contention raised is that complaint is premature as no notice u/s 33­<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_59">A of 

   Water Act</a> was given prior to initiating prosecution nor matter was referred for 

   arbitration in view of arbitration clause. So far as arbitration is concerned, that 

   is   not   binding   upon   complainant   and   DPCC   is   not   a   party   to   the   contract. 

   Further,   by   virtue   of   the   provision   u/s   33­<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_60">A   of   Water   Act</a>,   the   appropriate 

   authority is empowered to issue show cause notice for appropriate running of 

   CETP. Lastly, it has been argued that though no pre­charge evidence is led but 

   in view of provision u/s 45(2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_61">Cr.P.C</a>., present application is maintainable. No 

   doubt,   law   is   settled   in   this   regard.   The   application   us/   245(2)   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_62">Cr.P.C</a>   is 

   maintainable even prior to pre­charge evidence. However, in the present case, 

   complaint was filed by the government officer and he was exempted from his 

   examination u/s 200 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_63">Cr.P.C</a>. being a public servant. Thus,  case is at the stage 

   where it was at the time of summoning as no pre­charge evidence has been 

   led yet. In view of same, allowing the application u/s 245(2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_64">Cr.P.C</a> will amount 

   to   recall   of   the   summoning   order   at   least   at   this   stage.   It   is   respectfully

    observed that the judgments relied upon by the accused is not applicable to 

   the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case. In the light of the 

   aforesaid discussions, the application in hand having no merit and appears to 

   have been filed with a view to delay the proceedings. Accordingly, same is 

   dismissed with cost of Rs.10,000/­ to be deposited with DLSA.
