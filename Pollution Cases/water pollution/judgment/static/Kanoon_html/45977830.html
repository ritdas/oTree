</pre><p id="p_1">                            ~~~~~~~



</p><p id="p_2">1.This application for pre-arrest bail is preferred by the 5th

  accused in Crime No. 157 of 2017 of Edavanna Police

  Station. The aforesaid Crime has been registered against

  the petitioner and others under <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_1">Sections 269</a>, <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_2">278</a> of the IPC

  read with Section 120(c) of the Kerala Police Act and under

  <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_3">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">43</a> of the Water Pollution Act.


</p><p id="p_3">2.The crux of the prosecution allegation is that on 28.8.2017

  between 4 hours and 5 hours, the accused Nos. 1 to 3

  collected chicken waste from various shops and had dumped

  the same by the side of a public road at Odangappara.

  According to      the   prosecution,      the    petitioner is the

  Contractor and it is at his instance that the other accused

  had dumped animal waste by the side of the public road.


</p><p id="p_4">3.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would

  submit that the petitioner was employed abroad and at no

  point of time was he awarded any contract for transportation

  of waste. He has been falsely implicated is the submission.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">B.A No.7427 of 2017                2</span>
</p><p id="p_5">4.I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well and have

  gone through the Case Diary.         Prima facie, it does not

  appear from the Case Diary that the prosecution has sourced

  any    material   to   connect    the   petitioner.  Custodial

  interrogation of the petitioner does not appear to be

  essential in the instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.Having regard to the nature and gravity of the allegations,

  the materials collected, the character and antecedents of

  the petitioner and other facts and circumstances, I am of the

  view custodial interrogation of the petitioner is uncalled for.

  The relief of pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner

  subject to conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.In the result, the application is allowed, but subject to the

  following conditions:
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         i). The petitioner shall appear before the
         investigating officer within ten days from today
         and shall undergo interrogation.        If he is
         proposed to be arrested, he shall be released on
         bail on executing a bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees
         fifty thousand only) with two solvent sureties
         each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the
         officer effecting the arrest.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">B.A No.7427 of 2017                3</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         ii). He shall appear before the Investigating
         Officer on all Tuesdays and Fridays for a period of
         two months or until final report is filed, whichever
         is earlier.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         iii). The petitioner shall not directly or indirectly
         make any inducement, threat or promise to any
         person acquainted with the facts of the case so as
         to dissuade him/her from disclosing such facts to
         the court or to any police officer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         iv)The petitioner shall not commit any similar
         offence while on bail.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">         v) If he surrenders before the court concerned,
         this order shall not be applicable and the
         jurisdictional court may pass appropriate orders.</blockquote><p id="p_11">



      In case of violation of any of the above conditions,

the jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider

the application for cancellation, if any, and pass

appropriate orders in accordance with the law.
