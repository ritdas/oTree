        Petitioner-complainant, by instant revision petition, has

   assailed order dated 29th January 2014, passed by Addl. District &amp;

   Sessions Judge No.3, Bikaner (for short, 'learned Court below')

   upsetting the order taking cognizance against private respondents

   for offences under <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_1">Section 39(1)</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_2">45(b)</a> of the Standards of

Weights &amp; <a href="/doc/1018628/" id="a_3">Measures (Enforcement) Act</a>, 1985 (for short, 'Act of

1985'), rendered by Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Bikaner (for

short, 'learned trial Court').
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">2.   Succinctly stated, the facts of the case are that Reliance

Marketing    Pvt.   Ltd.   (for    short,       hereinafter   referred     to   as

'Company'), in terms of its policy, retained Ex. Army Officers as

Operator for handling and up-keeping of its petrol pumps all over

India.   The Company, in all, employed around 1200 Ex. Army

Officers throughout Country with the stipulation that accounting

be done by Automatic Tank Gauge (ATG), a non-standardized,

non-registered equipment.           The petitioner being one of the

Operators,    experienced         that      measurement        of     stock      in

Underground Tanks mostly gave erratic/wrong reading.                       Taking

cognizance of discrepancies of the stock-in-hand vis-a-vis shown

by ATG, petitioner lodged complaint with the Company officials. In

response to the same, as per version of the petitioner, third

respondent acknowledged variation in the stock.                 Be that as it

may, when no encouraging steps were taken by the Company,

petitioner laid a complaint with the Meteorology Department,

Government of Rajasthan to ventilate his afflictions.                     Petition

further unfurls that Inspector of Meteorology Department carried

out inspection and unearthed that at the outlets unverified

measuring equipments, i.e. ATG, are installed.                 The concerned

Inspector then sent a communication to his superior officers on

18.03.2008 insinuating the Company for violation of <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_4">Sections 19</a> &amp;

<a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_5">22</a> of the Act of 1985.

</p><p id="p_15">3.   As per version of the petitioner, communication of Inspector,

Meteorology Department facilitated follow-up action and accused-

respondents were served show cause notice on 05.04.2008. The

notice was then replied by respondents intimating Assistant

Controller, Legal Meteorology Department for granting 15 days'

time in this regard.   Petitioner also alleged that after receiving

communication dated 07.04.2008 from the Company, Meteorology

Department did not take any further action, presumably under the

influence of Company and other respondents.            This sort of

situation   prompted    petitioner-complainant   to   lay   criminal

complaint against the respondents before learned trial Court.

Complaint of the petitioner attributing offence under <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_6">Section 39</a> of

the Act of 1985 and offence under <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_7">Sections 120</a>, <a href="/doc/570574/" id="a_8">166</a>, <a href="/doc/1815602/" id="a_9">167</a> IPC

(Annex.12) was supported by affidavit and other documents.




</p><p id="p_16">4.   The learned trial Court, on receipt of the complaint,

examined complainant on oath under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_10">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C.          Later

on, considering the statements of the complainant to be in

consonance and conformity with the documents Ex.1 to 8 named

in the complaint for offence under <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_11">Section 39(1)</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_12">45(b)</a> of the

Act of 1985, deferred proceedings qua respondents No.9 &amp; 10,

public servants, in absence of sanction for prosecution.




</p><p id="p_17">5.   Feeling aggrieved by the order of learned trial Court,

accused-respondents preferred two separate revision petitions

before learned Court below.      The learned Court below, by the
                                   (4 of 16)
                                                                [CRLR-1569/2017]

order impugned, allowed both the revision petitions and set aside

order of cognizance.      Learned trial Court recorded a definite

finding in the     impugned order             that   complainant-petitioner's

grievance is concerned with some dispute of accounts and has no

direct nexus with violation of any legal provisions.             That apart,

learned Court below also examined status of the petitioner as an

aggrieved person within the meaning of <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_13">Section 63</a> of the Act of

1985 and recorded a definite finding against him for upsetting the

impugned order. Non-impleadment of Company as an accused too

was found fetal by the learned Court below for setting aside order

of cognizance.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">6.   Mr. Gurvinder Singh, petitioner, submits that learned Court

below has seriously erred in upsetting the order of cognizance. Mr.

Singh would contend that learned Court below has misconstrued

the complaint while concluding that same is confined to dispute of

accounts   only.    Petitioner,    while       relying on    complaint,     his

statements under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_14">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C. and the documents in

support thereof, contends that prima facie offences are made out

against respondents.      Petitioner has strenuously urged that

learned Court below while reversing the order of cognizance

completely overlooked his statements under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_15">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C.

Mr. Singh, humble petitioner, while assailing the finding of learned

Court below about his locus standi to maintain complaint, has

urged that said finding is wholly perverse.             It is argued by the

petitioner that learned Court below has seriously erred in

construing <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_16">Section 63</a> of the Act of 1985 so as not to treat him an
                                  (5 of 16)
                                                         [CRLR-1569/2017]

aggrieved person. Relying on inspection report of the Inspector,

Meteorology Department (Annex.5), petitioner submits that, on

the face of it, prima facie, offences under the Act of 1985 are

made out against the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">7.   Questioning the order impugned, petitioner would contend

that his grievances were against officials of the Company, and

therefore, finding of learned Court below to non-suit him solely for

non-impleadment of Company, is not sustainable.                 Lastly,

petitioner contends that learned Court below has over-stepped its

jurisdiction in setting aside order of cognizance, against which

scope of judicial review is very limited.        In support of his

arguments, learned counsel has placed on following judgments:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           (1) Sheoratan Agarwal &amp; Anr. Vs. State of Madhya
              Pradesh (AIR 1984 SC 1824)
           (2) State of Punjab Vs. Kasturi Lal &amp; Ors. (AIR 2004
              SC 4087)

              SC 447).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">8.   Per   contra,    learned   Senior Counsel   Mr.   Mahesh    Bora,

appearing for accused-respondents, submits that bare perusal of

the complaint makes it abundantly clear that petitioner is a proxy

complainant, allegedly espousing cause pertaining to petrol pump

of village Charkhada, Tehsil Nokha, District Bikaner, with which he

has no nexus.    Elaborating his submissions in this behalf, learned

Senior Counsel has referred to Para 3 &amp; 4 of the complaint and
                                      (6 of 16)
                                                                      [CRLR-1569/2017]

communication          from    Inspector,             Meteorology     Department

(Annex.6), which according him refers to same petrol pump.

Learned Senior Counsel has further argued that expression

"aggrieved person" envisaged under <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_17">Section 63</a> of the Act of 1985

cannot be given expansive meaning so as to cover general

grievance of any individual having no substantial grievance.

Learned Senior Counsel, therefore, argued that the learned Court

below has rightly set aside the order of cognizance by not treating

the petitioner a person aggrieved within the four corners of

<a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_18">Section 63</a> of the Act of 1985.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">9.      Mr. Bora, while laying emphasis on Para 9 of the complaint,

submits that alleged afflictions of the petitioner are confined to

accounts,    which     by no       stretch       of    imagination    can   expose

respondents for penal action within the four corners of Act of 1985

and therefore there is no illegality or impropriety in the impugned

order     warranting    judicial    review        in    exercise     of   revisional

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_19">Section 401</a> Cr.P.C.                  Learned Senior Counsel

further submits that Company has closed its retail outlet at Khasra

No.515, village Charkhada, Tehsil Nokha, District Bikaner, which is

the edifice of entire complaint and order Annex.9 being anterior to

the complaint itself, even proxy complaint does not bring the

petitioner within the ambit of an aggrieved person.                         Learned

Senior Counsel has, thus, argued that the order of cognizance by

learned trial Court after eight months from the date of order

Annex.9 has been rightly upset by the learned Court below.

Learned Senior Counsel has vehemently argued that petrol pumps
                                  (7 of 16)
                                                             [CRLR-1569/2017]

are purchasing and getting supply of petrol from retail-outlets of

the Company and therefore finding of the learned Court below that

in absence of impleadment of Company as party to the complaint

same is not maintainable, cannot be faulted being in conformity

with <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_20">Section 62</a> of the Act of 1985.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">10.   Learned Senior Counsel has also urged that complaint of the

petitioner to competent authority of Meteorology Department,

Government    of   Rajasthan,    stood       rejected   before   order    of

cognizance on 27th of November, 2008, therefore, it would be

unjust to interfere with the impugned order. Romping in <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_21">Section 9</a>

&amp; <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_22">22</a> of the Act of 1985, learned Senior Counsel has contended

that equipment ATG, being installed in Underground Storage Tank,

is clearly excluded from the rigors of <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_23">Section 39</a> of the Act of

1985.   In support of his arguments, learned Senior Counsel has

placed reliance on following judgments:

</p><p id="p_29">12.   The term 'cognizance' is not defined under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_24">Cr.P.C</a>. It's literal

meaning     is    awareness,     realization     or   knowledge;     notice,

perception.      Under the criminal law, cognizance takes place at a

point when the Magistrate first takes judicial notice of an offence.

Supreme         Court   in     case    of      Ajit   Kumar    Palit     Vs.

State of West Bengal (AIR 1963 SC 765), while construing the

word 'cognizance" has observed that it has no esoteric or mystic

significance in the criminal law or procedure.           It merely means

become aware of and when used with reference to a Court or

Judge to take notice of judicially. The word "cognizance" occurring

in various sections in the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25">Cr.P.C</a>. is a word of wide import.               It

embraces within itself all powers and authority in exercise of

jurisdiction and taking of authoritative notice of the allegations

made in the complaint or a police report or any information

received that offence has been committed.               In the context of

<a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_26">sections 200</a>, <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_27">202</a> and <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_28">203</a>, the expression "taking cognizance"

has been used in the sense of taking notice of the complaint or the

first information report or the information that offence has been

committed on application of judicial mind.            In the instant case,

learned Court below, while exercising its revisional jurisdiction

under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_29">Section 397</a> Cr.P.C., has upset the order of cognizance by

citing three pivotal reasons, which are: (1) Complainant is not an

aggrieved person within the meaning of <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_30">Section 63</a> of the Act of

1985,     (2)     Essentially, grievance of the petitioner is about
                                    (9 of 16)
                                                           [CRLR-1569/2017]

accounts,   and   (3)    non-impleadment       of   Company,   which    is

responsible for supply of petrol to various petrol pumps. The

judgment in Raghubans Dubey (supra), relied upon by the

petitioner, is simply dilating on taking cognizance of offence on a

police report while making distinction that mere summoning an

individual by the Magistrate does not amount to taking cognizance

of an offence.     The Court has further clarified that it means

cognizance of offence and not offenders. Thus, this verdict in the

context of facts of the instant case renders no assistance to the

cause of the petitioner.

'person aggrieved' must be a person who has suffered a legal

grievance, a man against whom a decision has been pronounced

which has wrongfully deprived him of something, or wrongfully

refused him something, or wrongfully affected his title to

something'.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                The word "aggrieved" refers to a substantial

grievance and not merely illusory.           Therefore, for treating

someone an "aggrieved person", his grievance must be substantial

and a fanciful suggestion of the grievance is insufficient.             A

merely   sentimental   grievance      does   not   make     a    person

"aggrieved".

</p><p id="p_37">15.   Supreme Court, in case of S.A. Venkataraman Vs. The State

(AIR 1958 SC 107), while examining general power of a Court to

take cognizance of an offence vis-a-vis prohibition to the exercise

that power by any provision of law, laid emphasis on interest of

the party in the prosecution or its grievance by the commission of

offence. The Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                 "In our opinion, if a general power to take
           cognizance of an offence is vested in a Court, any
           prohibition to exercise of that power, by any
           provision of law, must be confined to the terms of
           the prohibition. In enacting a law prohibiting the
           taking of cognizance of an offence by a Court,
           unless certain conditions were complied with, the
           legislature did not purport to condone the offence.
           It was primarily concerned to see that prosecution
           for offences in cases covered by the prohibition
           shall not commence without complying with the
           conditions contained therein, such as a previous
           sanction of a competent authority in the case of a
           public servant, and in other cases with the consent
           of the authority or the party interested in the
           prosecution or aggrieved by the offence."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">16.   For testing the alleged afflictions of the petitioner to

ascertain his status as a person aggrieved, it would be just and

appropriate to examine the complaint and other allied documents.

A bare reading of the complaint (Annex.12) ex-facie transpires

nothing pertaining to petitioner's grievances vis-a-vis Act of 1985.

The averments made in paragraphs 3 to 5 of the complaint are

confined to inspection of the petrol pump at village Chakarda,

Tehsil Nokha, District Bikaner and follow-up action by Company in

this behalf besides inactions on the part of the officials of

Meteorology Department. Likewise, paragraph 9 of the complaint

simply unfurls past status of the petitioner as an Operator of the
                                   (12 of 16)
                                                                    [CRLR-1569/2017]

Company.      Therefore, in substance, there is no whisper in the

complaint showing direct or indirect nexus or proximity of the

petitioner with the petrol pump situated at village Chakarda, Tehsil

Nokha, District Bikaner. From a bare perusal of Inspection Report

(Annex.5) dated 15th of March 2008 prepared by Inspector,

Meteorology Department, it is crystal clear that petrol pump at NH

89 on Nokha-Nagaur Road, village Chakarda, Tehsil Nokha, District

Bikaner, is operated by one Col. B.L. Choudhary.                      Inspection

Report is also signed by Col. B.L. Choudhary in the capacity of

Operator of the petrol pump.         Thus, complaint (Annex.12) clearly

and unequivocally depicts petitioner a proxy complainant or rather

a pseudo complainant.            In these circumstances, even if an

expansive meaning is given to the term "person aggrieved", I am

afraid, petitioner cannot be treated as an aggrieved person within

the four corners of <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_36">Section 63</a> of the Act of 1985.




</p><p id="p_39">17.   Switching on to second reason for upsetting the order of

cognizance, suffice it to observe that recitals contained in

paragraph 9 of the complaint are clearly portraying some

accounting     dispute   of    the    petitioner     with     the     Company.

Accounting dispute between the petitioner and the Company, even

if genuine, does not furnish him substantial grievance to maintain

a complaint against respondents for alleged violation of provisions

contained in Act of 1985 as any "person aggrieved" within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_37">Section 63</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_40">             Taking   into    considerations   all    these    aspects,        the

impugned order to the extent it has zeroed status of the petitioner
                                 (13 of 16)
                                                        [CRLR-1569/2017]

as any person aggrieved on these counts cannot be faulted. The

finding of the learned Court below in this behalf is, therefore,

neither infirm, nor improper.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">18.   The third reason spelt out in the order impugned, to reverse

cognizance order of the learned trial Court, is non-impleadment of

the Company as an accused in the complaint.             In order to

examine correctness, legality or propriety of this finding, yet again

it has became imperative for the Court to scrutinize complaint

(Annex.12) and other documents annexed in support thereof.

The complaint right from its first paragraph makes a reference

about Company and alleged insinuations against it in succeeding

paragraphs to highlight violation of the provisions of the Act of

1985. Paragraph 12 of the complaint contains specific allegation

that Company has not obtained verification and stamping of STG

from the Controller but for conspicuously silent about consent or

connivance of the respondents in this behalf.




</p><p id="p_43">19.   At this juncture, it would be apposite to refer <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_38">Section 62</a> of

the Act of 1985, which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           62. Offences by companies.-1.         If the person
           committing an offence under this Act is a company,

           the company for the conduct of the business of the
           company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to

                section (1), where any offence under this Act has
                been committed by a company and it is proved
                that the offence has been committed with the

                neglect on the part of, any director, manager,

                director, manager, secretary or other officer shall
                also be deemed to be guilty of that offence and
                shall be liable to be proceeded against and
                punished accordingly.

<p id="p_44">A cumulative reading of above quoted <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_39">Section 62</a> of the Act of

1985 makes it abundantly clear that every person in-charge of

and responsible for conduct of business of the company at the

time offence was committed, as well as the company, shall be

liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.




</p><p id="p_45">20.   The judgments relied upon by the petitioner, in case of

Sheoratan Agarwal and Kasturi Lal (supra), are based on

interpretation of <a href="/doc/1943863/" id="a_40">Section 10</a> of the Essential Commodities Act,

1955, but the text of <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_41">Section 10</a> aforesaid, quoted in these

judgments, do not contain the words "as well as the company",

therefore, clearly distinguishable. Likewise, judgment of Supreme

Court in C.V. Parekh (Supra), which is relied upon in subsequent

judgment of Sheoratan Agarwal (supra), is also based on
                                 (15 of 16)
                                                         [CRLR-1569/2017]

construing <a href="/doc/1943863/" id="a_42">Section 10</a> of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955,

without finding mention of the words "as well as the company",

too, thus, cannot render any assistant to the cause of the

petitioner.      The judgment of Supreme Court in M/s.            Modi

Distillery (supra) is based on interpretation of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_43">Section 47</a> of the

Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_44">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, which is pari

materia to <a href="/doc/191927407/" id="a_45">Section 62</a> of the Act of 1985, therefore, its ratio

decidendi requires due consideration in the backdrop of facts of

the instant case. While concurring with the ratio decidendi of the

verdict of Supreme Court, in my considered view, the complaint

(Annex.2) being bereft of any specific allegation against the

respondents that alleged offences are committed by the Company

with the consent or connivance of the respondents, or are

attributable to any neglect on their part, the impugned order

cannot be categorized as infirm on this count.




</p><p id="p_46">21.   My aforesaid view is also fortified by a judgment of Supreme

Court in Brij Lal Mittal &amp; Ors. (supra), wherein, while construing

<a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_46">Section 34</a> of the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_47">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940, Court declined

to fasten vicarious liability for an offence committed under the Act

by the company on its Director in absence of prima facie

allegations against them that they were in charge of the company

and also responsible to the company for conduct of its business.

The Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                   "It is thus seen that the vicarious liability of a
              person for being prosecuted for an offence committed
              under the Act by a company arises if at the material
              time he was in-charge of and was also responsible to
              the company for the conduct of its business. Simply
                                 (16 of 16)
                                                           [CRLR-1569/2017]

           because a person is a director of the company it does
           not necessarily mean that he fulfils both the above
           requirements so as to make him liable. Conversely,
           without being a director a person can be in-charge of
           and responsible to the company for the conduct of its
           business. From the complaint in question we, however,
           find that except a bald statement that the respondents
           were directors of the manufacturers, there is no other
           allegation to indicate, even prima facie, that they were
           in-charge of the company and also responsible to the
           company for the conduct of its business."

or impropriety is forthcoming from the impugned order warranting

interference in exercise of revisional jurisdiction.
