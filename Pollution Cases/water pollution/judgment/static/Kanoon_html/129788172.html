<p id="p_1">Introduction

</p><p id="p_2">1. The Parya Varan Avam Januthan Mission, a registered Society formed

with the object of protecting and promoting the cause of pollution free

environment, and its President, are the two petitioners before this Court.

This petition concerns the Ajmal Khan Park, located in Karol Bagh in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                               Page 1 of 52</span>
 hub of West Delhi‟s thickly populated commercial and residential areas. The

park has existed since 1920 and is spread over a total area of 24.83 acres. It

is divided into four squares. The „ornamental‟ portion of the park is said to

be 18.43 acres. In the remaining area of 4.8 acres community functions are

held. This is the only major park in the area. The apprehension expressed by

the petitioners, who are residents of the area, is that over the years the park

has been used for purposes other than what is permissible in terms of the

Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) 1962, 2001 and 2021. The immediate cause for

concern is the proposed construction in the park of an indoor basket ball

stadium by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Respondent No.2

herein, in violation of the MPD norms.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2. It is stated that since 1972 an area in the north-east square of the park

measuring 2117 sq m. is being used as an open basket ball stadium. It is

named as the Master Prithvi Nath Stadium and consists of a covered

management block and an open rectangular shaped stadium having eight

rows of concrete seating stands which can seat around 1500 to 2000

spectators. It is not in dispute that the said open basket ball stadium is the

property of the MCD. It is claimed that in the past national level basket ball

championship tournaments have been organized in the stadium but it does

not meet the essential requirement for organizing international level

tournaments. It is stated that there is no other stadium in this area.




</p><p id="p_5">3. The Ajmal Khan Park has been designated as a District Park in successive

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                   Page 2 of 52</span>
 Master Plans of Delhi i.e. MPD 1962, 2001 and MPD 2021. The park is

situated in the B-2 sub-zone. It was designated as a special area under both

the MPD 2001 as well as MPD 2021. In terms of the MPD 2001, for the B-2

sub-zone, an area of 33 hectares has been designated for parks and the norm

specified is 2 hectares of park per 10000 persons. However, on account of

scarcity of open area in the zonal plan for 2001, 7.47 hectares was proposed

in the B-2 sub-zone for neighbourhood parks and playgrounds.



Previous litigation

</p><p id="p_6">4. The petition states that this court has been approached earlier for

protection of the Ajmal Khan Park. W.P. (C) No. 14261 of 2004 titled

Bharushtrachar Virodhi Sangathan v. LG &amp; Others was filed to protest

against the MCD collecting charges for the use of the parks in Delhi for

community functions like marriages. The petitioners there had sought a

direction to the respondents to stop the illegal use of farm houses, banquet

halls, vatikas, parks and other premises for commercial activities.         An

application being CM No. 10024/2004 was filed seeking a direction to seal

the farm houses, banquet halls, parks being used for commercial activities

without licence. On 6.7.2005, a Division Bench of this Court issued the

following directions in the said writ petition:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "the Corporation shall not allow anyone to use a property
              contrary to the Master Plan, on payment of charges or
              otherwise. The Commissioner is directed to appoint
              Special Officers to look into this problem and if there is
              any breach of the direction, the Officer concerned shall
              be held responsible."
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                Page 3 of 52</span>
<p id="p_7"> It appears that thereafter the focus in W.P. (C) No. 14261 of 2004 shifted to

the use of farm houses for holding marriages. On 10.10.2007 this Court was

informed that certain guidelines had been framed by the GNCTD for

regulating the use of farm houses for commercial purposes. On that basis,

the said petition was closed. It is contended that as far as the Ajmal Khan

Park is concerned, the directions issued on 6.7.2005 still hold good.




</p><p id="p_8">5. In 2005, a public interest litigation (PIL) in the form of W.P. (C) No.

12902/2005 titled Swamy Bhaskar Anand &amp; Anr v. Lt. Governor &amp; Anr.

was filed in this Court protesting against the decision of the MCD to permit

the Delhi Tourism and Transport Development Corporation (DTTDC) to use

the Ajmal Khan Park for promotion of tourism. The raising of concrete

structures in the park at the instance of and for the use of the DTTDC was

frowned upon by this Court. In response to the notice issued by this Court

an affidavit was filed by the Additional Deputy Commissioner Development

Land and Estate Department MCD stating that "MCD has decided that

Ajmal Khan Park will be used only for park purposes with an access to the

public". This Court was further informed "that the arrangement with the

DTTDC for running a snack bar in a portion of the park that has been

cancelled and the MCD has decided to return the money received from the

DTTDC and is taking steps to restore the possession of the portion which is

in their possession to the MCD".

<p id="p_9">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                Page 4 of 52</span>
</p><p id="p_10"> 6. In an order dated 8.11.2005 passed in the above writ petition, this Court

observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "Now it seems that DTTDC has also gone under the
              sway of globalisation and has contemplated to induct
              some outside agency for providing the facilities of
              banqueting under the name of International Food Plaza.
              A park which is not only of historical importance but
              situated in a densely populated area like Karol Bagh
              where there is hardly any other park of this size, should
              not be permitted to be used for putting an International
              Food Plaza. Government lands and municipal parks have
              to be saved from onslaught of commercialization, as the
              citizens of this city require green areas for their lungs.
              Food Plazas and commercial activities can be undertaken
              at other places and certainly not in a park like Ajmal
              Khan Park. Ajmal Khan Park should be used for the
              residents, for morning walkers, for the children and for
              other social activities and it is the obligation of the state
              including Municipal Corporation of Delhi to allow use of
              this park for the said purpose. The endeavour of the
              MCD ought to have been to make it a model park. We
              are putting this on record as we have been told that the
              standing committee of the MCD is seized with the matter
              and the Committee is going to meet within ten days. We
              are sure that standing Committee as the representative of
              the people of Delhi will keep all these aspect in mind."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">7. On 2.8.2006 the Court took the above statement on record and disposed of

the said petition. In the applications filed thereafter in the disposed of writ

petition concerning return of the money by the MCD to the DTTDC, orders

were passed on 23.1.2007. The Court took note of another affidavit filed by

the MCD and the statement made by the Additional Deputy Commissioner,

Land and Estate Department, MCD who was present in Court that the

demolition of the structure had already taken place and that "every effort is

being made to restore the park in its original position".   The Court then



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                   Page 5 of 52</span>
 further directed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">              "In view of the affidavit filed before us and the
              undertaking given in court which we accept, we will
              finally dispose of this writ petition with clear direction
              that within four weeks from today the park shall be
              restored to its original position without any exception.
              We make it clear that if the efforts is not made and
              direction of the court in terms of the affidavits of the
              Commissioner MCD and as well as Additional Deputy
              Commissioner Land &amp; Estate Department is not
              complied with, they shall be liable to be proceeded
              against for violating the order resulting in initiating of
              proceeding under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_1">Contempt of Court Act</a>. Liberty is

              default."

<p id="p_14">The present petition

</p><p id="p_15">8. The present petitioners state that they learnt subsequently of a decision

taken by the MCD to construct a two-storied covered air conditioned

stadium and commercial complex in the Ajmal Khan Park. A 100 tone AC

plant for the said stadium was also proposed to be constructed. Copies of the

working drawings for the said indoor stadium have been enclosed as

Annexure P-2 to the writ petition. The petitioners state that a meeting was

held with the local representatives. Two MLAs of the Delhi Legislative

Assembly met the LG (Respondent no. 1 herein) on 25th July, 2008 in the

presence of the Commissioner MCD and protested against any construction

or concretization in the Ajmal Khan Park under the pretext of extension of

Master Prithvi Nath Stadium for basket ball.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">9. Following the above discussion, on 1.9.2008 a communication was

addressed to one of the MLAs by the officer on special duty at the office of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                Page 6 of 52</span>
 the LG enclosing a copy of the record of the meeting held on 25 th July, 2008.

Para 3 of the said record of the meeting reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              "3. Subsequent to detailed discussions and explanation
              offered by the Hon‟ble MLAs, Commissioner-MCD was
              requested by the Hon‟ble Lt. Governor to examine the
              case and put up the file for further orders. In the interim,
              it was decided that no construction whatsoever would be
              undertaken in the Ajmal Khan Park in the name of
              Extension of Master Prithvi-Nath Stadium which
              otherwise is presently being used by the general public of
              the area for physical fitness, social, religious and cultural
              activities. Subsequently the E-in-C, MCD has confirmed
              this office regarding suspension of any construction
              activity in the Ajmal Khan Park."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">10. Following the aforementioned meeting, the petitioner on 12.8.2008

addressed a letter to the Secretary Environment Department, GNCTD

pointing out that the proposed move to construct the air conditioned indoor

stadium for basket ball at the Ajmal Khan Park would be detrimental to the

environment and that all cemented constructions which were going on must

be demolished. The present petition was filed on 10 th February, 2009 after it

became clear that the respondents were going ahead with the construction of

the indoor basket ball indoor stadium. The prayer in the writ petition is for a

declaration that the construction of the proposed double-storied air

conditioned indoor stadium in the pretext of extension of the Prithvi Nath

Stadium for basket ball is in contravention of the MPD 2001 and MPD 2021.

It seeks a writ of mandamus to the MCD to immediately stop the illegal

construction of the indoor stadium as being contrary to the MPD 2001 and

MPD 2021 and to remove all the unauthorized construction and

encroachment from the Ajmal Khan Park.            Photographs of the ongoing

construction activity have been placed on record. Annexed to the petition is

 also a copy of the report published by the Human Settlement Management

Institute, HUDCO House Lodhi Road which has an entire portion devoted to

the Ajmal Khan Park.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">11. On 18.2.2009 while directing notice to issue to the Respondents this

Court appointed Mr. Raj Panjwani, learned Senior Advocate as amicus

curiae to inspect the park area and to file a status report. The report of Mr.

Raj Panjwani was tendered before the Court on 24th February, 2009. The

report inter alia indicated that a north east block of the park has since 1972

been an open court basket ball stadium known as the Master Prithvi Nath

Basket Ball Stadium. At the time of the visit by Mr.Panjwani a section of

the stadium had been demolished for the purposes of constructing the indoor

stadium. As far as the new stadium was concerned, the learned amicus curiae

found that 17 columns of the proposed 23 had been constructed. The area of

the stadium was also increased as was shown in the photographs annexed

with the report. It was observed that in the entire north east block which was

barren four huge marriage pandals, which appeared to be semi-permanent,

were erected. Photographs showing the marriage pandals and the cooking

activity underway for the functions held therein have been annexed with the

report.   A tar road 600 feet in length and 100 feet in width had been

constructed within the park to be used for access to the marriage pandals and

for parking. In the proposed drawing of the stadium annexed to the report it

is indicated that the existing area of the open stadium is 2649.44 sq.m. and

the proposed area of the covered indoor stadium was 2971.73 sq.m. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                Page 8 of 52</span>
 amicus curiae was informed during the course of his inspection that the each

of the four marriage pandals were being leased out by the MCD for a meager

amount of Rs.5000 per event. Behind the marriage pandals was a small

room used as a gym, the condition of which was stated to be pitiable. There

was a musical fountain located in the North West block which was deserted.

The musical fountain was set up in 1996 and could accommodate about 700

people with an entry ticket of few a rupees each. It was not in operation for

several years and found not to be serving any social or ecological function.

The remaining two blocks namely South West and South East Blocks were

the only areas which were used by around 3000 to 5000 people for their

morning walks and other recreational activities. A large part of the South

West Block however was found to be fenced by a grill and entry to this

portion was restricted.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">12. The amicus curiae in his report pointed out that the setting up of the

pandals along with pantry/cooking facilities, installation of huge electric

generators and construction of the road in the District Park was a prima facie

violation of the MPD and the Zonal Plan.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">13. On 24.2.2009 while taking on record the report of the amicus curiae an

interim order was passed by this court directing the respondents not to carry

out any construction activity in the park. The MCD was also directed to file

the list of persons to whom the marriage pandals were let out in the last one

year as well as the amount charged from them. On 24.3.2009 while granting

 the MCD two more days to file an affidavit on the above information it was

directed that the MCD will not accept any further bookings for use of the

park for functions till further orders.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">14. An affidavit dated 16.3.2009 was filed by the MCD in which it was

stated that the four slots in the north-eastern block were let out for marriage

activities only for ten days in a month. Reliance was placed on para 9.6 of

MPD 2021 to contend that „sports activity‟ was permitted in the park. The

list of persons to whom the marriage slots had been let out during the last

one year was annexed.

</p><p id="p_28">15. On 26.3.2009 the following detailed order was passed by this Court:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              "The petitioners have filed this petition in public interest
              taking exception to the construction of a covered basket
              ball stadium in Ajmal Khan Park, which is an ornamental
              park names after a famous freedom fighter Hakeem
              Ajmal Khan and was inaugurated by a person none other
              than the Father of the nation. In the past, this Court had
              issued certain directions in respect of this park. In order
              dated 8th November, 2005 passed in W.P(C) No. 12902-
              03/2005, the Court has observed that Ajmal Khan Park is
              not only of historical importance but situated in a densely
              populated area like Karol Bagh where there is hardly any
              other park of this size, which is available for the residents
              of the area. The Court has further observed that
              "Government land and municipal parks" have to be saved
              from onslaught of commercialization, as the citizens of
              this city require green areas.          Food Plazas and

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">              2. Ajmal Khan Park admeasuring about 24 acres is
              situated in West Delhi (Karol Bagh). It was established
              in 1921. A research report recently published by the
              Human Settlement Management Institute describes the
              Ajmal Khan Park as the only potentially green space
              within a 1 to 3 kilometers radius of cheek of jowl cluster
              of residential colonies like Paharganj, Regharpura,
              Bedunpura, Devnagar, Naiwala, Sidipura among the
              many others. It is stated that such bastis and the densely
              built low-income areas occupy 50% of the area of Karol
              Bagh. The living condition of the people in these low
              income bastis prohibit the availability of open spaces
              within their residences. The narrow service lanes and the
              dense congestion precludes any scope of open space, let
              along green lands. As per the report of the learned
              Amicus Curiae Ajmal Khan Park is a rectangular shaped
              park and covers an area of 89,000 square meters or about
              24 acres. A cross shaped path divides the park in four
              almost equal sized squares. The said four squares have
              been put to different uses and are referred to as North-
              West, North-East, South-West and South-East blocks in
              the report. The maps downloaded from Google on 19th
              February, 2009 of the area and the park are also produced
              on record.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              3. Learned Amicus Curiae has reported that the North-
              East Block has an existing open court basket ball stadium
              known as the Master Prithvi Nath Basket Ball Stadium.
              It is stated that prior to 1972 an open court had been
              established and in the year 1972 an open rectangular
              shaped stadium having eight rows of concrete seating
              steps stand, which could seat about 1500 to 2000
              spectators was constructed.       The MCD has now
              undertaken the construction of a covered basket ball
              stadium by increasing the width by 9‟-3" from points „A‟
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                 Page 11 of 52</span>
               to „D‟ and „B‟ to „C‟ and by increasing the length by 34‟-
              3" from point „D‟ to „C‟ as shown in the map submitted
              by learned Amicus Curiae. As per the sanctioned plan
              the new stadium will be fully air conditioned and a
              shopping complex is also provided in the stadium. The
              North-East block has no trees or vegetation. The entire
              remaining area is barren wherein four huge marriage
              pandals, which appear to be semi-permanent have been
              constructed. A tar road admeasuring about 600 feet in
              length and 100 feet in width has been constructed within
              the park, apparently to be used for access to the marriage
              pandals and for parking. Learned Amicus Curiae has
              opined that the setting up of the pandals along with
              pantry/cooking facilities, installation of huge electric
              generators and construction of the road in the District
              park (Green Area) prima facie may be in violation of the
              Master Plan and the Zonal Plan. Learned Amicus Curiae
              has reported that each of the four marriage slots is leased
              out by the MCD for a meager amount of Rs.5000/- per
              event. It is also reported that just behind the marriage
              pandals lies a small room which is used as a gym which
              is lying in neglected condition.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">              4. Insofar as the North-West block is concerned learned
              Amicus Curiae has reported that there is a musical
              fountain located within this block, which is now deserted
              and it is not in operation for last several years. This
              entire area is lying unused and not serving any ecological
              function. It is further reported by learned Amicus Curiae
              that the remaining two blocks, viz., South-West and
              South-East are the only areas, which 3000 to 5000 people
              (approximately) are able to use for their morning walks
              by the senior citizen groups and for other recreational
              activities. However, a large part of the South-West block
              which has an exclusive well kept park, has been fenced
              by a grill and the access has thus become very restrictive.
              According to learned Amicus Curiae the condition of the
              South-West and South-East blocks needs to be improved
              upon.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">              5.    Our attention is also brought to the order passed by
              the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta versus Union of India
              &amp; Ors., I.A. Nos. 20-22, 34 &amp; 35 in Writ Petition (Civil)
              No. 4677/85. In this case, the Supreme Court expressed
              concern that large number of parks in the city are being
              used for construction of marriage pandals and for hosting
              other functions also. The Court observed that the
              permitted use of the parks being recreation under the
              Master Plan, it cannot be permitted for any other use.
              But at the same time, keeping in view the need of the

               society, it is necessary to bring the parks back to their
              normal use in a sustained manner. The Court was of the
              view that the MCD, the NDMC and the DDA should in a
              phased manner stop granting of permission for use of the
              parks for commercial/marriage purpose. Consequently,
              the Court issued the following directions:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                    "(1) The use of parks by the MCD, the NDMC

                    shall not be permitted more than 10 days in a
                    month. In other words when any of the designated
                    park is used for such purpose 10 days in a month,
                    no function thereafter shall be permitted during the
                    remaining 20/21 days.

                    the purposes of marriages etc.
                    (3) The number of parks indicated by the 3
                    authorities used for marriage etc. shall be reduced
                    by 30% by June 30, 1997. It shall be reduced by
                    further 20% by December 31, 1997. In other
                    words, by the end of December 1997, the use of
                    the parks for marriage etc. shall be reduced by
                    50%.       The authorities concerned shall file
                    affidavits standing the progress in the projects for
                    construction of community halls and also stopping
                    the use of the parks for marriages etc. by the end of
                    December 1997. This may be monitored further
                    by this Court in 1998.

                    the holding of these functions etc."

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">              6.     It appears that neither the MCD, nor the NDMC
              and DDA have taken any effective steps to reduce the use
              of the parks for commercial and marriage purposes. The
              use of substantial park of Ajmal Khan Park for marriage
              purposes has been continued with impunity without any
              regard to the well being of the residents of the area,

              Park situated in the Karol Bagh area. By order dated
              26.3.2009, this Court constituted a Committee to
              examine the ecological/environmental impact of the
              construction of the closed door basket ball stadium and
              marriage pandal in the midst of a public park and to also
              suggest measures for restoration and improvement of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">                     "The Ajmal Khan Park itself has a unique design,
                     an ornamental park, with a curious mix of Mughal
                     and European influences. The two main paths
                     cutting across divides the rectangular space into
                     four almost equal portions resembling a "char
                     bagh". The ornamental features enhance the early
                     20th century aesthetics. Parts of the park with
                     mature trees still support considerable bird life
                     and in its heyday must have been spatially and
                     environmentally comfortable shaping the ecology
                     and microclimate.

                     associational values with the freedom movement
                     and personalities make it important in the

                     Sustainability is achieved only when these values
                     are taken to the future generations. The historic

                     Park in the Master Plan. There are many kinds of
                     District parks in Delhi and some of them are
                     located in archaeological area. The Medieval
                     capitals of Delhi have been protected by this
                     designation in the First Master Plan, which is
                     considered as one of the achievements of the
                     Delhi Master Plan. However from the 1980‟s the
                     consciousness of recreation and sports resulted in
                     the development of these facilities within these
                     designated greens causing irreparable loss by
                     obliterating large extents of remains and
                     archaeological evidences of the city. For example
                     Siri, Hauz Rani etc. While recreation is allowed

                     investigation of the existing area prior to new
                     development would have saved the underground
                     and standing heritage. It can be concluded that
                     District Parks in Delhi with heritage values have
                     suffered because of an absence of a systematic
                     and methodological intervention with both "hind-

              as against 2117 Sqm. resulting in an extension of 756
              Sqm. which is 0.75% of the total park area. Master Plan
              of Delhi 2021 is silent as regards any construction of an
              closed door basketball stadium within an ornamental
              park. DDA is directed to consider this issue and make a
              report to this Court within a period of six weeks from
              today. In so far as the community functions are
              concerned, the Committee‟s observations are as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">                     "1. The Ajmal Khan Park is surrounded by densely

                     community. There is a community demand to hold
                     the function in the park as there is no other nearby
                     place/community hall is available in the vicinity.

                     construction of Community Halls. The MCD has
                     also forwarded a further list of 23 sites for its
                     approval and allotment and MCD is hopeful in
                     getting these sites as well. Accordingly, it is
                     recommended in long term MCD may identify
                     Community Hall sites near vicinity to construct
                     facilities for organizing social functions till that

constructed in the Karol Bagh zone after 1998. It is further stated that

another community hall is being constructed at Inder Puri Naraina. The

MCD had also sent to the DDA a list of sites either for allotment of

construction for community halls and the DDAs response thereto is awaited.

categorically stating that an indoor basket ball stadium is not permissible in

terms of the MPD-2021 in an ornamental park like the Ajmal Khan Park. It

was pointed out that on 8.7.2009 the Commissioner MCD had sought a

clarification in this regard from the Vice Chairman DDA and that by a letter

dated 26.8.2009 the DDA had clarified the legal position to the MCD.

According to the DDA, an indoor sports stadium and related facilities are

part of "Public-Semi Public" land use and therefore not permissible in a

District Park. The aforementioned letter dated 26.8.2009 written by DDA to

the MCD reads as follows:

copy to the Chairman of the standing Committee.             In terms of the

preliminary drawing it was proposed to increase the area of the Master

Prithvi Nath Basket Ball Stadium. It is significant the above preliminary

drawing was never got approved formally. In the records of the MCD is a

letter dated 29.12.2005 by the Community Service Department MCD

approving the work for covering of the stadium along with other allied

works.    It was mentioned that the funds for the construction had been

provided under the head of account XL-VIII M. A sum of Rs.5 lacs was to

be spent during the year 2005-06 and Rs.227.32 lacs during 2006-07. On

29.3.2006 the works committee approved the proposal vide Resolution No.

92 dated 29.3.2006.      On 30.3.2006 the MCD approved the proposal

recommended by the Works Committee. A copy of the Resolution however

shows that the approved outlay was for the year 2006-07 was increased to

326.36 lacs. It appears that on 3.6.2008 works order was awarded to M/s

<p id="p_39">22. A noting of 25.9.2008 indicates that a discussion had been held with the

Mayor, Leader of the House, Leader of Standing Committee at which the

Commissioner MCD was also present. A meeting held with the LG in which

the Commissioner MCD was also present. The LG desired "a complete

photograph of the area including all the important land marks and the area

The photographs then placed before the LG it was indicated on 8.10.2008

that the proposed extended area had no green cover and that "Hon‟ble LG

may be requested to consider extension of the basket ball stadium". The

Commissioner MCD on 2.12.2008 made a noting that the construction of the

stadium at the Ajmal Khan Park had been halted following representations

"from various quarters." He stated in the note that he had visited the site on

only". The second part of the file of the MCD shows that till 8.7.2009 no

letter was written by the MCD to the DDA to enquire whether the proposed

construction of the indoor basket ball stadium at all permissible in terms of

the Master Plan.

</p><p id="p_43">24. We must at the outset express surprise that the MCD should unilaterally

proceed with the construction of an indoor basketball stadium unmindful of

the MPD provisions that govern the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

Further, given the previous round of litigation concerning the use of the

Ajmal Khan Park for the DTTDC in which the MCD participated and filed

an affidavit assuring that the said Park would not be used for any activity

other than that permitted on law, MCD cannot be heard to say that it was

unaware of the legal position concerning the MPD. The MCD is as much

bound by the MPD as any other person wanting to raise construction

anywhere in the NCTD.

</p><p id="p_45"> 25. The committee appointed by this Court has pointed out that the Ajmal

Khan Park was designated as a District Park even in the first MPD of 1962.

The committee has pointed out that the park has a unique design. It is an

ornamental park with a curious mix of Mughal and European influences.

The two main paths cutting across divides the rectangular space into four

almost equal portions resembling a "char bagh". The ornamental features

enhance the early 20th century aesthetics. The park along with the Tibbia

College is a 20th century development. According to the committee, the park

has historical value and "associational values with the freedom movement

and personalities make it important in the National sense, for the city, and

locally". The report of the Human Development Institute focuses on the

ecological significance of the Ajmal Khan Park. It is pointed out that the

Karol Bagh division suffers from acute shortage of green areas and that of a

total 790 acres under the Karol Bagh planning division there was only one

big established park viz., the Ajmal Khan Park covering area of about 24

acres. This was mentioned in the draft zonal development plan for the Karol

Bagh area in the P-2 sub-zone. The said report points out to the manner in

which the commercial use of the Ajmal Khan Park has progressed over the

years. It notes that:

<p id="p_47">Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) Norms
</p><p id="p_48">26. We now turn to the provisions of the MPD. The first MPD was prepared

in 1962 in terms of the Delhi Development Act 1957 (DD Act). The DD Act

envisages three levels of plans - the Master Plan (under Section 7 of the DD

Act), the Zonal Development Plan (under Section 8 of the DD Act) and the

Building/Lay Out Plan in terms of Section 14 of the DD Act. Under the

MPD 2021 the entire Chapter 9 deals with environment. Clause 9.3 of the

MPD 2021 which talks of green/recreational areas reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">             "Delhi has a much larger green cover than any of the other
             metropolitan city in the country, and could well be called
             a "Green City". The green / recreational use constitutes
             8,722 ha of land as per MPD 2001, which is around 19%
             of the total urban land area of 44,777 ha. This includes
             1577 ha. Under the Northern, Central and South Central
             Ridge (the remaining area of the Ridge is in the rural
             area). The balance area under recreational / green use i.e.
             7145 ha. Is in the form of District Parks, City Parks,
             Community Parks etc. comprising around 15% of the total
             urban land area. In additional to this, a large chunk of
             green area is provided in the form of Neighborhood Parks
             / Tot lots in the gross residential use zones, plantations /
             greens in large campuses like President‟s Estate, JNU,
             IARI, Delhi University, plantations along drains and
             roadside plantations. In addition to above, two Bio-
             diversity parks are under development by the DDA.
              In the Urban Extension the green cover is to be provided
             at the rate of 15% of the total land, excluding the Ridge /
             Regional Park. Out of this, some area shall be developed
             in the form of formal parks for the community and the rest
             shall be developed as woodlands ad incidental greens for
             balancing the environment. This will be in addition to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                 Page 26 of 52</span>
              development of specialized parks like Bio-Diversity
             Parks, plantation along the roads, drains, riverbank, etc.
             Further, Sports Complexes, which were included in
             the green/recreational use category under the MPD-
             2001 will be seen under a separate category of sports.
             One of the main reasons for this modification is that,
             Delhi is emerging as an important centre for National
             and International sports events. Sports facilities are
             being developed by various agencies besides DDA in
             Delhi, mostly as a part of recreational activity /
             facility. As a result there is still a need for planned
             and structured sports infrastructure which can take
             care of training needs of sportsmen and also act as
             integrated sports complexes for national and
             international events. This will not disturb the green
             areas, which are meant for recreational purposes.</blockquote><p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">             Keeping this in mind, sports facilities have been
             included as a part of social infrastructure, which in
             turn may help to develop better sports infrastructure
             for training needs, related logistics and sports
             medicine etc.      This will also facilitate private
             participation.    Integrated sports complexes are
             envisaged under one roof to accommodate variety of
             sports and related functions, by way of facilitating
             wide-range of permissibility, ground coverage and
             FAR." (emphasis supplied)


There is a clear policy shift spelt out in the above clause. While under

MPD      2001    sports   complexes   were    included    as   part   of

green/recreational activity, under MPD 2021, they are to be a

"separate category" which "will not disturb green areas meant for

recreational purposes." Accordingly, "sports facilities" were "included

as part of social infrastructure."

100 hectares for population of 10 lacs. By this norm, Ajmal Khan Park is a

District Park. We have other kinds of parks namely the Neighbourhood Park,

MCD relies heavily on the above clause to contend that since sports activity

and recreation club are permitted in a District Park, an indoor basket ball

stadium is in line with such permissible activity. On the other hand, it is

contended by the DDA that an indoor stadium is really a public or a semi

public facility as envisaged under Clause 13.11 MPD 2021.



</p><p id="p_60">28. The learned amicus curiae has drawn our attention to certain other

clauses which indicate that the stand of the MCD is untenable. Chapter 13

pertains to social infrastructure. The opening paragraph of this Chapter

reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">              "The quality of life in any urban centre depends upon the
              availability of and accessibility to quality social

              terms of the facilities indicated in the City Level Master
              Plan, and Community Facilities, which are indicated at
              the layout plan level in various use zones. Together,

               these include social infrastructure facilities pertaining to
              health, education, sports facilities, socio-cultural
              activities, communications, security and safety, and other
              community facilities pertaining to recreation, religious
              activities, social congregations and community events,
              cremation / burial grounds etc. These are generally
              planed in terms of population norms with stipulated
              permissibility conditions and development controls."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_62">29. Sports facilities, which would obviously include an indoor stadium have

been separately specified under Clause 13.3. It will be recalled that they

have been deliberately kept out of green/recreational areas due to the shift in

the policy in the MPD 2021 when compared with MPD 2001. Under Clause

13.3 sports facilities are recognized as having to be established in

commercial premises. The said clause reads as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">              "13.3 Sports Facilities Delhi is emerging as an important
              centre for National and International Sports events.
              Sizeable sports facilities have been developed in the City
              by various agencies like the Sports Authority of India
              (SAI), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), GNCTD,
              etc. However, sports activities, so far, been dealt with as
              a part of Recreational use. It is also felt that many of the
              facilities, which have been developed, could actually be
              seen as recreation and / or club type of facilities. As a
              result, even though the DDA has developed a large
              network of excellent sports facilities, over and above the
              facilities developed by the SAI, etc. there is an evident
              need for a properly planed and structured sports
              infrastructure in the city which, inter alia, should also
              be able to take care of mega / international sporting
              events, such as the forthcoming Commonwealth
              Games in 2010.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">              Even the various facilities, which have been developed as
              pure sports facilities, suffer from lack of full and proper
              utilization, and there are issues related to maintenance
              and resources for the same. With reference to the latter,
              for example, the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium premises
              are, on the one hand, presently under use for a variety of
              non-sports related activities and on the other hand, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                  Page 30 of 52</span>
               Stadium itself cannot be used for anything but sports
              activities. The latter aspect, in turn, is characterized by
              gross under utilization. This also brings out the need
              for developing and prescribing planning and
              development control norms geared to planed,
              practical and proper development of sports facilities
              as an important component of social development and
              optimum utilization of the facilities to be developed.

<blockquote id="blockquote_74">              In addition to the above, there is a trend for
              development of gyms, spas, bowling alleys etc. at
              neighbourhood level. Since these are mostly being
              established as commercial ventures, provisions of land
              /space for these should be made in commercial
              premises." (emphasis supplied)


</blockquote><p id="p_63">30. Table 13.7 specifies the "Planning Norms and Standards for Sports

Facilities". Note (ii) thereunder states that "the existence sport infrastructure

shall be upgraded and efficiently re-planned to provide better facilities".




</p><p id="p_64">31. Socio-cultural facilities are separately indicated in Clause 13.8. It may

be mentioned here that this is under Table 13.16 sets out the planning norms

and standards for socio-cultural facilities.     Clause 2 (b) of this Table

envisages Recreational Club which can be set up in a plot area of 5000

square meters for a population of 5 lacs.         Under Table 13.27 the use

premises for recreational Club indicates the activities permitted in a

Recreation Club. This is defined a Recreational Club as "a premises having

the facility for recreation with indoor sports, swimming pool, outdoor sports,

socializing and gathering space for small functions with restaurant". The

third column of this Table specifies the activities permitted in a recreation

club.

 Analysis of MPD provisions

</p><p id="p_66">32. The above provisions when read collectively show that A conspectus of

the above provisions of the MPD 2021 indicates that a conscious distinction

has been drawn between a „sports activity‟ and a „sports facility‟. A

basketball stadium, whether an open one or an indoor one would certainly

answer the description of a sports facility and not a „sports activity‟. The

scheme of the MPD 2021 in specifying norms for parks and sports facilities

in two separate clauses viz., 9.3 and 13.3 respectively is consistent with the

changed policy of separately dealing with sports facilities and not bring them

within the ambit of green/recreational areas. Sports facilities and recreation

clubs are in a separate chapter relating to social infrastructure and are

specifically kept outside the chapter concerning the environment i.e. Chapter

</p><p id="p_67">9. This is clear from para 9.3 which states that "sports complexes which

were included in the green/recreational use category under the MPD-2021

will be seen under a separate category of sports". Further, while "green

areas....are meant for recreational purposes", "sports facilities have been

included as a part of social infrastructure, which in turn may help to develop

better sports infrastructure for training needs, related logistics and sports

medicine etc." An outdoor or indoor stadium is certainly not a „recreational

club‟ of the kind envisaged in Clause 4 of Table 9.4 or Table 13.16 or Table

13.27 referred to hereinbefore. Also, in terms of Clause 13.3. even for

"gyms, spas, bowling alleys etc." space is expected to be provided "in

commercial premises" since they are "mostly being established as

commercial ventures." The only type of construction permitted in a District

Park is for a restaurant the dimensions of which are specified in Table 9.4.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                Page 32 of 52</span>
 There can be therefore no manner of doubt that a sports facility like a

basketball stadium whether outdoor or indoor cannot form part of a green

area including a District Park.

<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">33. Significantly the use of parks for setting up marriage pandals is not also

an activity which is permissible in terms of MPD 2021. In this context, the

reference is also been made the orders of the Supreme Court in the PIL in

that court requiring the agencies to phase out the use of parks for marriage

purposes way back in 1996 itself.
</p>
<p id="p_70">
</p><p id="p_71">34. The MPD provisions have also to be viewed in the background of two

provisions of the Constitution of India: <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_5">Article 48</a> A which states that "The

mandates that "It shall be the duty of every citizen of India- to protect and

improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife,

and to have compassion for living creatures". The judgments of our Supreme

Court, in their expostulation of environmental jurisprudence foreground the

constitutional scheme in which the right to health and in turn the right to a

clean environment is seen as an inalienable part of the right to life under

consultation process involving experts drawn from different disciplines. The

provisions of the MPD reflect the key concerns of environmental law

resources for ourselves, but for the future generations as well. Our short-term

„developmental‟ needs should not dictate our present decisions that might

make these very resources extinct for our future generations. The MPD

Case Law

in several decisions of the Supreme Court and the High Courts may be

noticed. <a href="/doc/847706/" id="a_11">In Dr. G.N. Khajuria v. Delhi Development Authority</a>, AIR 1996

SC 253 the Supreme Court disapproved of the conversion of an area meant

for a park for the use of a school. The Court on that occasion observed as

under:

<p id="p_77">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_76">         "the land which was allotted to respondent No. 2 was part of a Park.
         We further hold that it was not open to the DDA to carve out any
         space meant for park of a nursery school. We are of the considered
         view that the allotment in favour of respondent No. 2 was misuse of
         power, for reasons which need not be adverted. It is, therefore, a fit
         case, according to us, where the allotment in favour of respondent No.
         2 should be cancelled and we order accordingly. The fact that
         respondent No. 2 has put up some structure stated to be permanent by
         his counsel is not relevant, as the same has been done of a plot of land
         allotted to it in contravention of law. As to the submission that
         dislocation from the present site would cause difficulty to the tiny tots,
         we would observe that the same has been advanced only to get
         sympathy from the Court inasmuch as children, for whom the nursery
         school is meant, would travel to any other nearby place where such a

plant in a park, reference may be made to the decision of the Court of

York 95 N.Y.2D 623, 630. The court was informed that the public would be

deprived of the use of the park for five years during which the water

treatment plant would be constructed and thereafter the park would be

restored. That court held that prior legislative approval of the change in user

was mandatory even if the proposal was that the park would ultimately be

restored. Referring to the decision in Williams v. Gallatin 229 NY 248 the

Court of appeals invoked the "public trust" and said: "Though the water

treatment plant plainly serves an important public purpose - indeed eve the

State Attorney General believes it should be built at the site selected - our

law is well settled: dedicated parks in New York are impressed with a public

trust for the benefit of the people of the State. Their „use for other than park

purposes, either for a period of years or permanently, requires the direct and

specific approval of the State legislature, plainly conferred‟." Our Supreme

Court too has reiterated the public trust doctrine as forming part of the

environmental jurisprudence in this country (See generally <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_26">M.C.Mehta v.

 Position as regards the present case

</p><p id="p_97">47. In the background of the law as explained in the above decisions, we

may now examine the position in the present case. The manner in which the

MCD has gone about initiating and then executing the construction of an

indoor basketball stadium in Ajmal Khan Park, without at any time making

any reference whatsoever to the provisions of the MPD 2021 is, to say the

least, wholly impermissible. The MCD has a statutory duty of ensuring that

buildings or constructions in the areas in its control strictly conform to the

planning norms. MCD is bound by the MPD 2021 and its predecessor the

MPD 2001. The MCD could not have possibly been ignorant of the fact that

construction of any sports stadium in a District Park was clearly

impermissible in law either in terms of the MPD 2001 or the MPD 2021.

The stand now taken on affidavit by the MCD that the Table 9.4 of the MPD

2021 which talks of a sports activity in a District Park in turn permits the

construction of a stadium is really an argument of desperation. No such

stand appears to have been taken at any time when the proposal of the MCD

for construction of the stadium was being considered up to the level of the

LG. The MCD is not above the law. It is bound by the MPD norms as much

as any other entity or person desirous of raising any construction.




</p><p id="p_98">48. At this juncture a reference may be made to the decision of the Division

Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/280260/" id="a_27">Delhi Science Forum v. Delhi Development

Authority</a> 112 (2004) DLT 944where this Court prevented the DDA from

going on with the construction of a mass housing project on a land in respect

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                    Page 44 of 52</span>
 of which the change in the land use from rural to urban in accordance with

the procedure outlined under the DD Act had not taken place. Reminding the

DDA that "however high you may be, the law is higher than you", this Court

disapproved of the DDA going ahead with the construction of the housing

project without first getting the change of land use effected. The said

decision would apply in the instant case to prevent the MCD from going

ahead with the construction of the indoor stadium which is impermissible

under the provisions of the MPD 2021 as they presently stand.




</p><p id="p_99">49. There is another aspect of the matter. The MCD does not appear to have

at any point of time got the plan for the construction of the indoor stadium

formally approved.     There is no such endorsement on any sanctioned

building plan concerning the stadium. The notes on file only talk of the

approval of the LG for extending the area of construction. The manner of

preparing a plan and getting it approved is not unknown to the MCD.

Unless there is a properly prepared plan bearing the endorsement of a

competent architect who has examined it and affixed an approval, it cannot

be said to be a duly sanctioned/approved building plan. In the file of the

MCD there is no such document concerning the indoor basket ball stadium.

This is a matter for concern. The MCD itself is an authority which sanctions

building plans of private individuals and a rigorous process is followed

before such approval is accorded. The MCD hardly needed be reminded of

its statutory obligations under the MPD 2021. While the DDA is entrusted

with the overall responsibility of ensuring the plan development of Delhi, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                Page 45 of 52</span>
 provisions to DD Act and the binding nature of the Master Plan can be no

different for the MCD. In fact this Court would hold the MCD, which is an

authority of the State, to the strictest standard when it comes to building

norms. The MCD simply cannot itself be seen to be violating either the

planning norms or the building norms. The MCD would have to lead by

example.
</p>
<p id="p_100">
</p><p id="p_101">50. The other peculiar feature of the case is that the LG, who approved the

decision of the MCD to extend the area of the existing open basketball

stadium is also the Chairman of the DDA. The LG wears two hats. One is

that of the ultimate executive authority representing the GNCTD whose

approval for such proposal is sought by the MCD. The other is as the head of

the premier planning organization, the DDA, a statutory body entrusted with

the statutory responsibility of ensuring the planned development of Delhi in

accordance with the MPD. It is apparent that when his approval was sought

by the MCD for the extension of the indoor basketball stadium at the Ajmal

Khan Park, the LG‟s attention was not drawn to the MPD 2021 norms.



</p><p id="p_102">51. If the MCD was in any doubt as to what was permissible in the Ajmal

Khan Park then the previous litigation concerning its permission to the

DTTDC to have a facility inside the park should have served as a reminder.

The orders passed by the Court in Swamy Bhaskar Anand were a clear

warning that the MCD could ill afford to breach statutory norms. It appears

now that those orders were not a sufficient deterrent.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                              Page 46 of 52</span>
 Conclusions and Directions

</p><p id="p_103">52. In light of the law, as consistently explained by the Supreme Court and

several High Courts including this court, we hold that the construction of an

indoor basketball stadium in the Ajmal Khan Park is impermissible in law.

The decision of the MCD in this regard is hereby declared to be illegal and

quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_104">
</p><p id="p_105">53. The consequential order as a result of the above declaration is that the

entire construction activity in connection with the indoor basketball stadium,

which has already been stopped, should be reversed and the park restored to

its original position within the time frame indicated hereafter. The MCD

will forthwith ensure the removal of all structures and any concretization of

the north eastern block for the purposes of the indoor basket ball stadium.

This area will be restored as a park for use by the public.




</p><p id="p_106">54. It was strenuously pleaded by the learned counsel for the MCD that

since an open basket ball stadium was operational since 1972 inside the park

that should be permitted to continue. It is also pointed out that there is no

other sports facility in the Karol Bagh area and the young population who

would otherwise have to travel long distances for availing all similar

facilities would be benefited by such a facility. We are not persuaded to

accept the plea for more than one reason. In the first place, the mere fact

that an activity not permissible inside a district park has been carried on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                Page 47 of 52</span>
 since 1972 will not lend it legality. Secondly, with the commencement of

the illegal construction of the indoor stadium, the open stadium has already

been demolished. The photographs in fact show that right now the open

stadium does not exist. This Court is not inclined to direct restoration of a

structure which to begin was not permissible to be erected in a district park.

Finally, we find that for the Commonwealth Games 2010 there are sports

facilities coming up in Delhi. It is likely that after the event many of these

facilities will be made available for use by the public. The transportation

facilities are also likely to improve making some of these facilities accessible

to the youth of Karol Bagh.
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><p id="p_108">55. We wish to clarify that as long as sports activities are permitted in the

district park, the local population can continue to use the Ajmal Khan Park

for that purpose without in any manner impairing the essential features and

character of the park. This does not mean that a sports facility like a stadium

can be erected in the park. Norms will have to be laid down for the use of

the park for sports activities including regulating the hours and the area

within the park where such activity can be permitted.




</p><p id="p_109">56. As regards use of the park for marriages and other community functions,

this Court has by the order dated 26th August, 2009 reduced the number of

places for use of such functions to three. This however is not meant to

continue definitely. The affidavit filed by the MCD indicates that three

community halls have been constructed in 1998 in the Karol Bagh zone. One
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                 Page 48 of 52</span>
 more hall in the zone is under construction. We are, therefore, inclined to

continue the order permitting the holding of community activities in three

places in one corner of the park for a further period of one year, subject to

certain conditions which we direct must be scrupulously enforced. Such

activity in those three areas in the north-eastern block of the park will be

completely stopped after one year. The conditions are that such functions

can be held only during the day time and that too without any cooking

activity being carried on. Precooked and pre-packed eatables can be served

but every effort will be made to ensure that the place is not littered. The

littering of the park as a result of such functions must be penalized with very

heavy fines being levied on those booking the park for such functions. The

use of mikes and loudspeakers will be strictly monitored to ensure that the

norms under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_28">Environment (Protection) Act</a> 1986 (as further laid down in

the judgments of the Supreme Court in tis context) are strictly followed. No

generators will also be permitted. There cannot be any road/tar road laid for

the purpose of facilitating transportation into the park of pandals and other

tent material. In other words, the holding of such functions will not be

allowed to cause any destruction whatsoever of the environment. The idea is

to discourage the use of the three spaces in the park for functions marriages

as far as possible. If not already done, the tar road in the park has to be

immediately removed. The charges presently being collected for the use of

the park in these functions is too meager.

<p id="p_110">
</p><p id="p_111">57. This Court directs that the LG will immediately set up a High Level

Committee comprising senior level officials of the MCD, the DDA and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                                 Page 49 of 52</span>
 GNCTD as well as experts in the areas of urban planning and horticulture to

reexamine the letting out of parks generally (and the Ajmal Khan Park in

particular) for community functions and ensure that there is no

environmental damage in any manner caused by the letting out of such parks

for community functions. The High Level Committee will also formulate

the norms and guidelines for permitting the parks to be used for sports

activities and any other activity as permissible under the MPD 2021. The

High Level Committee will evolve norms on the lines suggested by this

Court and incorporate further norms as considered appropriate to preserve

the area as a park, in consultation with the DDA. The High Level Committee

will keep in view the law as explained in several of the above decisions as

well as the report of the committee appointed by this court and the report of

the Housing Development Institute of HUDCO referred to earlier in this

judgment, which forms part of the record of this case.




</p><p id="p_112">58. The norms that will be evolved by the High Level Committee will be

given wide publicity in the print and electronic media and in each of the

parks and shall be strictly adhered to. We direct that the High Level

Committee be set up within a period of three weeks and the new norms be

evolved by the said Committee within a further period of eight weeks. Till

such time the present norms may be followed. Thereafter as recommended

by the committee set up by this Court, the Ajmal Khan Park has to be

restored completely by having a comprehensive landscape plan by removing

the boundary wall within the park and replanting a large number of trees.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">WP(C) 6950 of 2009                                               Page 50 of 52</span>
 The MCD‟s proposed plan is not strictly in accordance with the proposal of

the Committee.       It still shows a basket ball ground and a gym. These

structures cannot be permitted in a district park. They have to be removed

forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_113">
</p><p id="p_114">59. As regards the north-west block of the Ajmal Khan Park, it has already

been pointed out that the fountain is not serving any purpose as it is

dysfunctional. The HUDCO report indicates that how the fountain did not

serve any purpose even while it was functional. The photographs of the said

musical fountain show that it has entailed concretization of the north-west

block. We direct the MCD and the DDA to jointly take a decision within a

period of four weeks from today on whether the fountain should be

continued and is permissible in terms of the MPD 2021. If not, steps should

be taken immediately thereafter to remove the fountain. If it is permissible

within the ambit of the MPD 2021 then it should be ensured that the fountain

when made functional does not pose a threat to the environment and result in

the littering of the park.

efforts of the learned amicus curiae in preparing a comprehensive report and

in assisting the court about the legal position resulting from the MPD 2021.

The court also appreciates the efforts made by the members of the committee

in submitting the report which has facilitated the court in rendering this

decision.

in paras 53 to 59 will be filed in this Court jointly by the Commissioner

MCD and Vice-Chairman DDA within a period of eight weeks from today.

It will be open to the petitioner or the amicus curiae to apply to this court in

the event of non-implementation of the said directions within the stipulated

time frame. With these directions the writ petition and all pending

applications are disposed of. Certified copies of this judgment be delivered

to the Lieutenant Governor GNCTD, the Vice-Chairman DDA and the

Commissioner MCD by a special messenger within four days.
