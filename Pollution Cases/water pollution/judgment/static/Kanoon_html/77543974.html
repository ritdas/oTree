<p id="p_2">2.     L.W.1 (Mahawat Jawahar) is the de facto complainant in this

case. This is a case of cheating and violating the provisions of the

Act that occurred on 04.05.2016 at Food Fats &amp; Fertilizers Limited,

Prathipadu.    The complainant reported that M/s. 3F Industries

Limited, Prathipadu, Pentapadu Mandal, Guntur District, is

unauthorizedly packing vegetable fat spread under the Ag-Mark

insignia without having valid Certificate of Authorization (i.e., Ag-

Mark). During inspection by the Authorized Officer of Director of

Director and Unit Head In-charge and A.2, being the Civil

Engineer, General Manager, Production and Marketing of the said

Company, are unauthorizedly packing, grading and marketing

vegetable fat by using Ag-Mark insignia (symbol) on the packed

products and thus cheating the Government and the public

intentionally in a fraudulent manner and caused loss to the

Government to a tune of Rs.56.00 lakhs. Basing on the report of

the de facto complainant, the police registered the aforesaid crime

<p id="p_3">      As per the instructions vide Memorandum C.No.54/Cr/SDO

K/2016, dated 04.05.2016, issued by the Sub-Divisional Police

Officer, Kovvur, the concerned police officer visited Pentapadu

Police Station and handed over the CD file in the aforesaid Crime,

wherein it is stated that while L.W.9 (<a href="/doc/141940/" id="a_6">Ch.V.Nagendra</a>) was in the

police station, the de facto complainant came to the police station

and presented a report about the occurrence of the offence.

During the course of investigation, L.W.10 (G.Madhu Babu),

Inspector of Police, Tadepalligudem Rural, secured L.Ws.1 and 2,

recorded their statements under <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_7">Section 161</a> (3) <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a>. He visited

Industries Limited, Prathipadu Village, examined them and

recorded their detailed statements under Section 161 (3) Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_4">      On 03.05.2016 L.Ws.1 and 2 visited M/s.3F Industries

Limited and verified the accurate position and asked the factory

authorities to show the processing and packing unit, where the

vegetable fats spread has completed. At the time of inspection of

factory, the processing unit has not been working, but they saw

cold storage and found that the packed vegetable fat spread

any Ag-mark or any licence from the competent authority. L.W.10

collected previous Agmark licence from the Administrative Block of

the Company and on perusal of the same, found that the certificate

of Authorization remain valid upto 31.03.2014. The specimen of

the Trade Brand label 'MELLO' used only for production of

products graded under Agmark. The said company has to renew

the licence before the validity period i.e., on 31.03.2014.         But,

without renewing the licence, the accused are selling the products

and thus committed the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_9">Section 420</a> IPC

and <a href="/doc/1972819/" id="a_10">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/635751/" id="a_11">4</a> of the Act.

representing         Dr.J.V.S.H.Sastry,          learned   counsel       for     the

petitioner/A.2, reiterated the contentions and placed reliance on

three judgments reported in N.Harithara Krishnan v J.Thomas1,

N.Srinivasan v State of Telangana and another2 and Sunil

Bharti Mittal v Central Bureau of Investigation3. In all these

three judgments, the Apex Court and this Court had an occasion

to decide about the criminal liability of the Director of the company

based on the principle of "alter-ego".               Taking advantage of the

principle laid down in the above judgments, the learned counsel for

the petitioner requested the Court to quash the proceedings

against the petitioner.

<p id="p_8">5.      On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor for the State of

Andhra Pradesh, while supporting the contents in the charge

return of property.             The learned Magistrate, after perusing the

record, dismissed the petition.                     Aggrieved by the same, the

petitioner filed Crl.R.P.No.97 of 2016 on the file of II Additional

Sessions Judge, West Godavari District, and the same was allowed

and the concerned police are directed to release the seized goods to

the petitioner for interim custody.                 He further stated that in the

first instance when the petitioner himself filed a petition before

I Additional Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Tadepalligudem, for

interim custody of the seized property, the same was dismissed

and in revision before II Additional Sessions Judge, West Godavari

District, the learned Sessions Judge, while allowing the petition

observed that the petitioner, being General Manager of the

Company is not responsible for the offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_16">Sections 420</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1972819/" id="a_17">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/635751/" id="a_18">4</a> of the Act. He has also

drawn the attention of this Court to paras 42 to 44 of the Sunil

Bharti Mittal's case (supra) while placing reliance on the

judgment          reported       in    U.P.       Pollution   Control   Board       v

Dr.Bhupendra Kumar Modi and Another4, and contended that it

is a curable defect and such defect can be cured by impleading the

Company at appropriate stage and hence, on the ground that the

Company was not impleaded as a party, the proceedings against

the petitioner cannot be quashed and requested the Court to

dismiss the petition.

finding of such food products with Ag-mark is not seriously

disputed before this Court. But, the main contention of the

petitioner before this Court is that in the absence of impleading the

Company as an accused, the petitioner, who is a General Manager

of the said Company, cannot be prosecuted for the offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_19">Section 420</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1972819/" id="a_20">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/635751/" id="a_21">4</a> of the Act.

In the charge sheet, the petitioner is arraigned as accused No.2,

being the General Manager, Production and Marketing, of M/s. 3F

Industries Limited. The petitioner, being Civil Engineer, General

Manager, Production and Marketing of the company, is having

control over the production and packing. The specific allegation in

the charge sheet is that A.1, being Director, Unit Head In-charge,

and the petitioner (A.2), being General Manager, Production and

Marketing, of the said company are authorized for production,

packing, Grading &amp; Marking under the Ag-mark, as per the

licence, which was expired on 31.03.2014 and the petitioner was

authorized to produce Agricultural food products and in-charge of

business of the Company i.e., M/s.3F Industries Limited, which is

an artificial person.            The contention of learned counsel for the

petitioner is that in the absence of impleading the company, the

Director of the said Company cannot be prosecuted and he placed

reliance on a Judgment reported in <a href="/doc/1322448/" id="a_22">Aneeta Hada v. Godfather

Travels and Tours5</a>, wherein at paras 58 and 59, while deciding

the liability of the Directors or its employees without impleading

the Company, the Honourable Supreme Court had an occasion to

decide the criminal liability of the Directors for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_23">Section 138</a> with reference to <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_24">Section 141</a> of the

<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_26">Section 141</a> of NI Act, arraigning of a company as an accused is

imperative. The other categories of offenders can only be brought

in the drag-net on the touchstone of vicarious liability as the same

has been stipulated in the provision itself on the basis of ratio laid

down in <a href="/doc/1409304/" id="a_27">State of Madras v. C.V.Parekh6</a>, which is a three-Judge

Bench decision. Thus, the view expressed in <a href="/doc/741325/" id="a_28">Sheoratan Agarwal

v. State of M.P</a>.7 does not correctly lay down the law and,

accordingly, is hereby overruled. Similar decision in Aneeta

Hada's case (supra) is overruled with the qualifier as stated in the

Judgment.          The decision in U.P.Pollution Control Board's case

(supra) has treated to be restricted to its own facts as has been

explained by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.        The principle laid down in the above judgments is applicable

to the present facts of the case. M/s. 3F Industries Limited

obtained licence from the concerned authorities under the Act, but

though the licence was expired on 31.03.2014, still used the Ag-

mark insignia (symbol) on packed product and thereby cheated the

Government and public intentionally in fraudulent manner and

caused loss to the Government to a tune of Rs.56.00 lakhs. Thus,

the offence is only by the company, but not by its Managing

Director. But, the company is not arraigned as an accused.               In

such case, the prosecution cannot be maintained against the

petitioner.       But, learned Public Prosecutor for the State of Andhra

Pradesh contended that the defect is only a curable defect and that

can be cured at any stage basing on the principle laid down in

Aneeta Hada's case (supra) and hence, proceedings cannot be

quashed. He also placed reliance on the decision in U.P.Pollution

Control Board's case (supra). The Apex Court referring the

judgment in U.P.Pollution Control Board's case (supra), which

was filed by Special Leave and was directed against the judgment

of the High Court of Allahabad, dated 16.05.1984, while setting

aside, in its revisional jurisdiction, Order of the CJM, Ghaziabad,

dated     03.11.1983,   directed   issue     of   process    against       the

respondents therein on a complaint filed by the appellant therein -

Pollution Control Board under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_29">Section 44</a> of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The issue involved therein was

whether the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Managing Director and

Members of the Board of Directors of M/s. Modi Industries Ltd.,

the Company owning the industrial unit called M/s. Modi Distillery

could be proceeded against, on a complaint against the said

industrial unit.   The Single Judge of the High Court found that

there was no sufficient ground against the respondents inasmuch

as the allegations made in the complaint did not constitute an

offence    punishable    under     <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_31">Section    44</a>    for     the    admitted

contravention of <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_32">Sections 25</a> (1) and 26 read with <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_33">Section 47</a> of the

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.      The facts narrated in M/s. Modi Distillery's case clearly show

that the same is identical to the case in U.P.Pollution Control

Board's case and the Apex Court taking note of the provisions

particularly, <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_34">Sections 25</a> (1), (2) and 26 as well as <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_35">Sections 44</a> and

<a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_36">47</a> and the averments in the complaint after finding that prima

facie materials are available and all the issues to be dealt with by

the Judicial Magistrate at the time of trial, set aside the order

passed by the learned Magistrate. The Court also of the view that,
                                                                    MSM,J
                                                           crlp_8721_2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    9</span>


no-doubt, it is true that the learned Single Judge of the High Court

quashed the proceedings on the ground that there could be no

vicarious liability saddled on the Chairman, Vice-Chairman,

Managing Director and other members of the Board of Directors of

the Company under <a href="/doc/26027/" id="a_37">Section 47</a> of the Act unless there was a

prosecution of the Company i.e., M/s. Modi Industries Ltd. But, in

the facts of U.P.Pollution Control Board (supra), it is not in

dispute that the Company has been shown as the first accused in

the complaint apart from Chairman, Managing Director, Joint

Manager Director, General Manager, Directors, General Manager,

Commercial Manager and Company Secretary as well as their

specific role in the day-to-day affairs and decision making process.

The Court also relied on another judgment in <a href="/doc/1814230/" id="a_38">U.P.Pollution

Control Board v. Mohan Meakins Ltd8</a> and finally concluded that

it is only a curable defect and merely because the company is not

impleaded as an accused, the proceedings against the petitioner

cannot be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.        Undisputedly, in the present case, the Company i.e., M/s.3F

Industries Limited was not arraigned as an accused, but its

Director and General Manager were arrayed as A.1 and A.2. The

Full Bench of the Apex Court in Aneeta Hada's case took a

different view while referring to M/s. Modi Distillery's case, which

is in Mohan Meakins Ltd case (supra).         The Division Bench in

Dr.Bhupendra Kumar Modi's case, placing reliance on the

judgment of the M/s. Modi Distillery's case referred supra, held

that it is limited purpose of principle laid down therein has

rejected.         Therefore, on the basis of principle laid down in

Dr.Bhupendra Kumar Modi's case, this Court cannot take a

contrary view than the view taken by the Full Bench in Aneeta

Hada's case.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10.       Even in the Agriculture Produce (Grading &amp; Marking) Act,

1937, there was no provision to fasten vicarious liability on the

Director, Managing Director or its employees. But, <a href="/doc/635751/" id="a_39">Section 4</a> deals

with penalty for un-authorized marking with grade designation

mark.        According to this section, whoever marks any scheduled

article with a grade designation mark, not being authorized to do

so by rule made under <a href="/doc/1972819/" id="a_40">Section 3</a>, shall be punishable with

imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months and fine not

exceeding five thousand rupees.            But, there is no identical

provision to <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_41">Section 141</a> of the NI Act in the Ag mark Act. In such

case, the Company alone shall be made liable for prosecution along

with its officials, who are dealing with day-to-day affairs and

decision making in the position of the Company. The Apex Court

<p id="p_14">11.   In view of above principle, the acts or omissions of the

accused are directly attributable to the company since the

petitioner is not having control over the affairs of the company and

he is acting on behalf of the company.    Whether he had the mens

rea or not is a question to be decided only during trial, but not at

the stage of petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_43">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. Even the principle

is applied to the present facts of the case, the petitioner cannot be

made liable in his individual capacity though the acts done by him

are attributable to the company, in the absence of impleading the

company as an accused in the main charge.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.   The contention of learned Public Prosecutor for the State of

Andhra Pradesh is that it is a curable defect and such defect can

be cured at any stage by placing reliance on a judgment reported

in U.P.Pollution Control Board's case (supra). But, till date no

steps have been taken to cure the defect, though it is curable.

The Court cannot simply allow the prosecution to be continued

though there are latches since it would cause an irreparable injury

to the person, who is prosecuting for the offence on account of the

proceedings.   The Public Prosecutor also contended that when the

petitioner himself claimed interim custody of the property as owner

of the goods by filing Crl.M.P.No.2912 of 2016 before I Additional

Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Tadepalligudem, under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_44">Section

251</a> Cr.P.C., the Court below dismissed the petition holding that

petitioner is not entitled for the relief as prayed for, as the

company is owner of the goods. Aggrieved by the said order, the
                                                                                MSM,J

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                       12</span>


petitioner filed Crl.R.P.No.97 of 2016 before II Additional Sessions

Judge, West Godavari, Eluru, under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_45">Section 397</a> Cr.P.C., and the

learned Sessions Judge after considering the material on record,

held that the revision petitioner is entitled for interim custody of

the seized goods and directed the concerned police to release the

seized goods subject to compliance of conditions. Thus, there is no

justification    in    the   argument       advanced      by   learned      Public

Prosecutor,      since    opposed     the    said     contention     before     the

Magistrate and revisional Court by the prosecution.                     Now, the

learned Public Prosecutor cannot take advantage of the situation.

Therefore, at this stage, the order passed in revision petition and

the contention of the public prosecutor cannot be accepted.

</p><p id="p_16">13.   In view of my foregoing discussion, unless the company i.e.

M/s. 3F Industrial Limited, though an artificial person, is

arraigned as an accused, its Managing Director cannot be

prosecuted for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_46">Section 420</a> IPC and

<a href="/doc/1485731/" id="a_47">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/148539/" id="a_48">4</a> of the Act. Accordingly, it is answered in favour of

the petitioner and against the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_17">14.   The other contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is

that vicarious liability cannot be fastened to the petitioner, being

General Manager of the Company, in the absence of any allegation

that he is the person in-charge of the company is doing business.

But, in the charge sheet, the specific allegation against the

petitioner is as to how he is participating in day-to-day affairs of

the business. The specific allegation is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                "Sri Pantham Venkata Rama Rao, General Manager of
      Production      Marketing-Vanaspati   of   3F    Industries   Limited,

      packing and Grading &amp; Making under the Ag-mark. They have

          of Vegetable Fat spread) and they intentionally cheated the
          Government authority &amp; Public and violated            the Rules of
          Agriculture Produce (Grading &amp; Marking) Act, 1937."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">15.       The role attributed to the petitioner is with regard to the day-

to-day affairs of the company and he is the person, who is

authorized to conduct the business including the production

(Grading &amp; Marking) and packing. In such a case, the petitioner

being the person responsible for day-to-day affairs of the company

i.e., packing, marking etc, is liable for the acts of the company.

</p><p id="p_19">16.       The law is well settled on this aspect in catena of decisions.

The Apex Court in Iridium India Telecome Ltd. v Motorola Inc10

held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   "A body corporate is a `person' to whom,
          amongst the various attributes it may have, there
          should be imputed the attribute of a mind capable of
          knowing and forming an intention -- indeed it is much
          too late in the day to suggest the contrary. It can only
          know or form an intention through its human agents,
          but circumstances may be such that the knowledge of
          the agent must be imputed to the body corporate.
          Counsel for the respondents says that, although a
          body corporate may be capable of having an intention,
          it is not capable of having a criminal intention. In this
          particular case the intention was the intention to
          deceive. If, as in this case, the responsible agent of a
          body corporate puts forward a document knowing it to
          be false and intending that it should deceive, I
          apprehend, according to the authorities that Viscount
          Caldecote, L.C.J., has cited, his knowledge and
          intention must be imputed to the body corporate."

</blockquote><p id="p_20">17.   In "Motorola Inc' case (referred supra), the Apex Court

further held that "the criminal liability of a corporation would arise

when an offence is committed in relation to the business of the

corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its affairs.

In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain that the

degree and control of the person or body of persons is so intense

that a corporation may be said to think and act through the person

or the body of persons. Mens rea is attributed to corporations on

the principle of `alter ego' of the company."     If this principle is

applied to the present case, the petitioner is acting on behalf of the

company and having control over the business, mens rea is

attributed to the petitioner on the principle of "alter ego" of the

company.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">18.   There is no dispute that the company is liable to be

prosecuted and punished for criminal offences. Although there are

earlier authorities to the effect that corporations cannot commit a

crime, the generally accepted modern rule is that except for such

crimes as a corporation is held incapable of committing by reason

of the fact that they involve personal malicious intent, a

corporation may be subject to indictment or other criminal

process, although the criminal act is committed through its agents

as held in "<a href="/doc/1915525/" id="a_49">Standard Chartered Bank v. Directorate of

Enforcement</a>.7" At the same time, Public Prosecutor for State also

placed reliance on the same judgment of Apex Court rendered in

"<a href="/doc/1570831/" id="a_50">Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola Inc</a>." (referred supra),

to the effect that "the companies and corporate houses can no

longer claim immunity from criminal prosecution on the ground
                                                                   MSM,J

that they are incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for

the commission of criminal offences."
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">19.   In view of the law declared by the Apex Court in Motorol's

case (referred supra) it is clear that for the acts or omissions of

staff of the petitioner company, by applying the principle of "alter

ego" the company is liable for criminal acts.

      contain any provision for attaching vicarious liability
      on the part of the Managing Director or the Directors

      The learned Magistrate failed to pose unto himself the
      correct question viz. as to whether the complaint
      petition, even if given face value and taken to be
      correct in its entirety, would lead to the conclusion
      that the respondents herein were personally liable for
      any offence. The Bank is a body corporate. Vicarious
      liability of the Managing Director and Director would
      arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the
      statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision
      fixing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said
      purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant

      terms of the settlement and whether they were duly
      incorporated In the printed agreement or not were all
      questions which could be properly and adequately
      decided in a civil court. Obtaining signature of a
      person on blank sheet of paper by itself is not an
      offence of forgery or the like. It becomes an offence
      when the paper is fabricated into a document of the

      their bonafide right of seizing the truck on the
      respondent's       failure   to    pay    the    third    monthly

at    the   same   time,   it   is   a    cardinal   principle   of     criminal

jurisprudence that there is no vicarious liability unless the statute

specifically provides so."
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">23.    Based on the principles laid down in the above judgments,

the Apex Court in a recent judgment rendered in "<a href="/doc/48599021/" id="a_57">K.Sitaram and

observed that "no doubt, a corporate entity is an artificial person

individual who would act on behalf of the company that too when

the Division Bench of this Court discussed about the liability of the

principle laid down in the above judgment "any legal proceedings

by or against a body corporate is required to be brought in the

name of some person authorized for that purpose by the

appropriate law. Normally, the legislative practice has been that

whenever a Corporation is brought into existence, a statute, which

brings that Corporation into existence, makes a specific provision

in that regard, indicating the person authorized to represent the

body corporate in legal proceedings. The complaint does not

disclose whether the Branch Manager of Gunfoundry Branch of

State Bank of Hyderabad is the appropriate person authorised by

the law in whose name the proceedings could be initiated."



</p><p id="p_34">25.   If this principle is applied to the present facts of the case,

though this petitioner being in-charge of the production, packing,

trading etc., using Ag-Mark signia (symbol) after expiry of licence

period, such act is attributable to the company i.e., M/s.3F

Industries Limited, which is not a party in the petition. The

petitioner is claiming exemption on the ground of absence of mens

rea. Therefore based on the allegations made in the charge sheet

against the petitioner coupled with the law declared by the Apex

Court in all the judgments, the petitioner being the Civil Engineer,

General Manager of the company cannot come to know about

Grading, Trading, Marking, packing, he is not responsible for day-

prosecuted for the offences. Though it is a curable defect since no

steps have been taken till date by the respondent-State, this Court
