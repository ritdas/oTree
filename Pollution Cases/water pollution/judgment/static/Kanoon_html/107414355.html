                              ORAL JUDGMENT

                                                             P.B:
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">1.         This Appeal is filed on 13th February, 2014. The

Appellant has preferred the present Appeal against order

dated October 25th, 2013, passed by Respondent No.1,

under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_3">Section 28</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>,            1974 and Air Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, The impugned order was forwarded

to the Appellant along with forwarding letter dated October

25th, 2013. The Appellant has come out with a case that

the impugned order was received by him by post on

October 30th ,2013.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">2.       According to the Appellant, the Appeal had to be filed

up till November 30th, 2013, but there is delay in filing of

the Appeal due to his medical problem. He was suffering

from mental depression between November 25th , 2013 till

January 30th, 2014 and as such, was directed by medical

practitioner to undergo rest. He could not, therefore,

approach the Advocate and prepare Appeal Memo.

Consequently, filing of Appeal is delayed by twelve (12)

days. It is stated in the Application for delay condonation

that delay is caused on account of 'sufficient cause' shown

by the Applicant and as such, same should be condoned.

(J) Appln. No. 5 of 2014
</p><p id="p_7"> 3.         By order dated March 3rd, 2014, we directed the

Appellant/Applicant to place on record postal envelope

which he was then ready to produce for perusal of this

Tribunal, in order to show the postal stamp regarding

receipt of envelope by him. However, he has not produced

the postal envelope for perusal of the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_8">4.       We have heard learned Advocate Shah for the

Appellant/Applicant. He argued that delay is unintentional

and can be condoned when sufficient cause is shown. He

invited our attention to the provision of Order 8, Rule 1 of

the C.P.Code. He further invited our attention to the

Judgments of learned Single Judges of the Hon'ble High

Court of Bombay, in :

(J) Appln. No. 5 of 2014
        Judgments cited by the learned Advocate for the

       Appellant, is that these three (3) citations are based

       on observations in the case of "<a href="/doc/1338327/" id="a_7">Shaikh Salim Haji

       Abdul Khayumsab vs. Kumar and others</a>," reported in

       2006(1) Mh.L.J.(S.C.) 178=2006(1) Bom.C.R.57."


 It is observed by the Apex Court in paras 10 and 14 as

below:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 10. All the rules of procedure are the
              handmaid of justice. The language employed by
              the draftsman of procedural law may be liberal or
              stringent, but the fact remains that the object of
              prescribing procedural is to advance the cause of
              justice. In an adversarial system, no party should
              ordinarily be denied the opportunity of
              participating in      the process of        justice
              dispensation. Unless compelled by express and
              specific language of the Statute, the provisions of
              the Civil Procedure Code or any other procedural
              enactment ought not to be construed in a manner
              which would leave the Court helpless to meet
              extraordinary situations in the ends of justice.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              14. Procedural law is not to be a tyrant but a
              servant, not an obstruction but an aid to justice.
              Procedural prescriptions are the handmaid and
              not the mistress, a lubricant, not a resistant in
              the administrative of justice"

<p id="p_15">6.       We may mention here that limitation for filing of an

Appeal under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_8">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010, is

specifically circumscribed by <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_9">Section 16</a> of the enactment.

<a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_10">Section 16</a> reads as follows:

        Provided that the Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that the
     appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal
     within the said period, allow it to be tiled under this section

</p><p id="p_19">7.       The above provision is not rule of procedure akin to

those under the C.P.Code. There is basic difference

between substantive provision in the section of the Act,

which          specifies         particular   limitation   and   excludes

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_13">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 and directory Rules

under the Code of Civil Procedure. In "Seva Mon Region

Federation &amp; Anr vs Union of India and Ors" (MA No.104/2012,

arising out of Appeal No.13/2012) the Hon'ble Principal

Bench of NGT, New Delhi, by order dated March 14, 2013,

elaborately discussed the scope of <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_14">Section 16</a>. The Hon'ble

Principal Bench, held that "such period cannot be

extended by the Tribunal." Similar view is expressed by

this Bench in the Order passed in Appeal No.2/2013.

"Gram panchayat <a href="/doc/167087773/" id="a_15">Tiroda &amp; Anr vs MoEF &amp; ors</a>". This Bench

(J) Appln. No. 5 of 2014
 held that the Tribunal has no power to extend limitation

period beyond the period prescribed under the specific

provision enumerated in the enactment. We may refer to

observations of this Tribunal as enumerated in paragraph

25 of the said order. The same may be re-produced as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           25              At this juncture, we may refer to case of

           "Chhatisgarh State Electricity Board Vrs. Central

           Electricity Regulatory Authority and Ors (2010)5,

           S.C.C. 23".          In the said case the Apex Court

           considered <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_16">Section 125</a> of the Electricity Act 2003

           along with Proviso appended thereto.           The Apex

           Court held that the limitation period provided under

           <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">section 125</a> is of 60 days and could be extended

           upto 60 days under Proviso to <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Section 125</a> but there

           is no provision in the said Act for extension beyond

           this period. It is held that the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_19">Electricity Act</a> is a

           special legislation which is excluded from purview

           of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_20">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 by virtue of <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_21">Section 29(2)</a>

           of the Limitation Act and therefore, <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_22">Section 5</a> of the

           Limitation Act, cannot be invoked. It is quite clear,

           therefore, that <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_23">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act is not

           applicable to the Appeal which comes within ambit

           of Section 16 of the NGT Act, 2010.

<p id="p_21">(J) Appln. No. 5 of 2014
</p><p id="p_22"> 8.       Considering the view taken consistently by the

Hon'ble Principal Bench and this Bench, we have no

hesitation to hold that the present Appeal is barred by

limitation and delay cannot be condoned. The case law

relied upon by the learned Advocate for the Appellant, is

not applicable to the facts of the present case and in view

of the legal position enumerated above.


</p><p id="p_23">9.       In view of foregoing discussion, the Application will

have to be dismissed, so also, the Appeal will have to be

dismissed. Hence, we have no option but to dismiss the

Miscellaneous Application and the Appeal. Both are

accordingly dismissed. No costs.
