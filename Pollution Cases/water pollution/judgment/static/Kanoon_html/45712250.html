</p><p id="p_32">08.                   In terms of that order, the PCB issued further notice on

the petitioners including the other brick kilns which are operating

in violation of the law. The respondents had published a public

notice on 06.09.2016 in the newspaper. From their communication

dated 05.09.2016 (Annexure-R/8 to the reply filed by the Tripura

State Pollution Control Board in W.P.(C) No.1155/2016) the said

fact can be gathered. It appears that such notice was published in

the newspaper for affording further opportunity to the petitioners

to deposit the environmental compensation as determined and

communicated by the Tripura State Pollution Control Board. But

the petitioners did not comply in terms of that notice also. Finally,

the order dated 28.10.2016 [Annexure-R/19 to the reply filed by

the        Tripura            State          Pollution            Control            Board              in   W.P.(C)

issued by the Tripura State Pollution Control Board. As such, there

was no delay. The impugned orders were passed in the pendency

          petitioners, this court is of the view that in the circumstances of
