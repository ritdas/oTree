         [2]              By means of this writ petition, the petitioners have

         challenged the order dated 28.05.2013, Annexure-8 to the writ

         petition, which has been passed by the appellate authority in

         exercise of its jurisdiction as provided under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> of the Air

         the writ petition, the rice mill of the petitioners, under name and

         style of 'Joyram Rice Mill' situated at Ranirbazar was directed to

                          Being aggrieved by that order dated 14.02.2012, the

         petitioners had filed an appeal under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_9">Section 31</a> of the Air

         (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_11">Section

         raising the ground that the said rice mill was all the times

         observing the standard so far the noise level and water standard

         are concerned. The petitioners have further contended that there

         was no scientific inquiry into the allegations and without resorting

         any inquiry, the said closure order dated 14.02.2012 was issued

         by the Member Secretary, Tripura State Pollution Control Board

         illegally       and   arbitrarily.   Despite    that,    the   petitioners    have

         complied the said order dated 14.02.2012 by suspending the

         operation of the said rice mill. By the said appeal, legality of the

         order dated 14.02.2012 was questioned. It would be apparent

         from the memorandum dated 02.06.2012, Annexure-7 to the writ

         petition, that even during the appellate proceeding inspection in

         the mill was carried out for purpose of submitting the report to

         the    appellate       authority.    The    appellate     authority    made    the

         following observations on perusal of the inspection report:

                              55 dB for residential area. Therefore, though, the
                              readings are technically lower than 55 dB, yet, as
                              per the ground condition, this marginal lower limit
                              is not sufficient to provide the local residents a

                              Mill are not at all useful in arresting the noise level,

         appeal under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_28">Section 16</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, this

         Court cannot waive the substantive jurisdiction to allow the
