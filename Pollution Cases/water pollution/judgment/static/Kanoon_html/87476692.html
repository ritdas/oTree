<p id="p_4">         2.   The dispute pertains to allotment of 100 acres of the land
         in favour of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation for the purpose of
         developing a landfill site. It is the case of the Rajkot Municipal
         Corporation     that   it   has     manifold          problems           as      regards
         managing the solid waste. The Corporation took up the issue
         with the State Government for the purpose of allotting 100
         acres of part of the Government Kharaba land bearing the
         Revenue Survey No.222 Paiki of the village Nakrawadi. The
         village Nakrawadi is situated in the outskirts of the city of
         Rajkot. After examining the proposal in detail, the State
         Government thought fit to pass an order dated 18th May, 2002
         allotting 4,04,680 square meters (100 acres) of the land to the
         Rajkot Municipal Corporation for its compost manure plant at
         the rate of Rs.15/- per square meter. The Corporation is in
         need of additional 100 acres of land for the purpose of the
         landfill site. It appears that on 21st December, 2004, an order
         relating to allotment of the additional land admeasuring 100
         acres was passed. However, the Corporation was not handed
         over the possession of the additional 100 acres of the land. Out
         of 100 acres of the land allotted in the first phase, in all, 40
         acres of the land has been developed by putting up a waste
         process plant. A compound wall has been constructed to cover
         up the entire 100 acres of the land and even a Green Belt has
         been developed in accordance with the order passed by the

         National Green Tribunal, Western Zone, Pune dated 20th
         December, 2013. The case of the Corporation is that it is in
         need of additional 100 acres of the land of the same revenue
         survey number for the future planning of the Solid Waste
         Management.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         3.     The State Government seems to be reluctant for some
         reason for the allotment of additional 100 acres of the land. It
         appears that the State wants the Corporation to, first, utilize
         the 100 acres of the land already allotted and then, in future, if
         need     arises,     the   Government          would        consider          allotting
         additional 100 acres of the land.

         of land is concerned, the same was vested under the
         State Government and even said order of allotment dt.
         21.12.2004 stood cancelled. That being aggrieved by the
         said order, the petitioner had approached the respondent
         no.2 herein, wherein after perusal of the record as well as
         after hearing the respective parties, the respondent no.2
         was pleased to confirm the order of the respondent no.1.
</p><p id="p_22">         8.     Now so far as legal position as regards distribution
         of State largesse is concerned, it is well settled position
         of law as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
         India, it is held that the Government should not act in a
         manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of
         the State. Such an action would be both unreasonable
         and contrary to public interest. The Supreme Court in the
         case of <a href="/doc/497388/" id="a_4">Shri Sachidanand Pandey and another v. State of
         West Bengal and others</a>, reported in (1987) 2 SCC 295,
         has observed that the State-owned or public-owned
         property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion
         of the executive. Certain precepts and principles will
         have to be observed. Public interest is the paramount
         consideration. One of the methods of securing the public
         interest, when it is considered necessary to dispose of
         the property, is to sell the property by public auction or
         by inviting tenders. In the words of the Supreme Court,
         nothing should be done which gives an appearance of
         bias, jobbery or nepotism. Also in the case of <a href="/doc/183512138/" id="a_5">Public
         Interest Litigation and Others v. Union of India and
         Others</a> reported in (2012) 3 SCC 1, the issue before the
         Supreme Court was whether the Government had the
         right to alienate, transfer or distribute natural
         resources/national assets otherwise than by following a
         fair and transparent method consistent with the
         fundamentals of the equity clause enshrined in the
         Constitution. The Supreme Court observed that the
         natural resources belong to the people but the State
         legally owns them on behalf of its people and from that
         point of view natural resources are considered as
         national assets, more so because the State benefits
         immensely from their value. The State is empowered to
         distribute natural resources. However, as they constitute
         public property/national asset, while distributing natural
         resources, the State is bound to act in consonance with
         the principles of equality and public trust and ensure that
         no action is taken which may be detrimental to the public
         interest. The Court also observed that like any other

         State action, constitutionalism must be reflected at every
         stage of distribution of the natural resources. In the facts
         of that case, the Court also observed that a duly
         publicized auction conducted fairly and impartially was
         perhaps the best method for discharging such burden
         and the methods like first come first serve when used for
         alienation of natural resources/public property were likely
         to be misused by unscrupulous people who may only be
         interested in garnering maximum financial benefits and
         may have no respect for constitutional ethos and values.
         That in light of the said legal position, I humbly say and
         submit that Collector is consider to be custodian legis of
         the State property and is shoulder with statutory as well
         as constitutional duty to distribute the State largesse in
         the manner not detrimental to Public interest. That so far
         as additional 100 acres of land is concerned, the
         possession of said land has never been taken for such
         long period of 10 years. In fact, it is only when show
         cause notice was issued and impugned order came to be
         passed by the Collector extending the time for further 3
         months for deposit of amount, it is at that stage, the
         Corporation became serious about the affairs and finally
         deposited the amount . Hence, respondent no.1 herein
         being conscious of the fact about requirement of 100
         acres of land for public purpose has not revoked the said
         first order of allotment since some efforts were made in
         utilization of 50 acres of land, however, so far as
         additional 100 acres of land is concerned, no such
         development was seen during lapse of 10 years. In fact,
         the said land could have been utilized for some other
         public purpose. However, irrespective of the said fact,
         recently on 01.09.2016, the office of Collector has
         received a darkhast from the GlDC, seeking allotment of
         land of 70 hectares from the said Revenue Survey no.
         222 paiki. Here with annexed and marked as Annexure R-
         IV is the copy of the said letter dt. 01.09.2016 submitted
         by the GIDC. That the Collector office of Rajkot is still
         considering the proposal and has not taken any final
         decision, however, it is worth to note that petitioner
         Corporation has not been able to utilized the land allotted
         under first order and in this peculiar facts, the
         respondent no.1 herein has to act taking into
         consideration      the   larger    Public    Interest   and
         simultaneously to also see that the action of the parties
         may not be detrimental to the interest of Public at large.
         At present, the respondent no.1 herein is mindful of the

         purpose, more particularly, having regard to the directions
         issued by the National Green Tribunal and the proceedings
         pending before the Supreme Court. The need of the hour is to
         take care of the Solid Waste generated at the end of the day in
         a vast city like Rajkot and the surrounding areas. Without an
         adequate landfill site and a management plan, it is going to be
         very difficult to take care of the problem. If there is no proper
         landfill site with a disposal plan, then it might lead to a
         potential health hazard. In such circumstances, I direct the
         Chief Secretary, State of Gujarat to take up this issue very
         seriously and see to it that the dispute is resolved at the
