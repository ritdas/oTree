</p>
<p id="p_2">Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3"> 	In these appeals challenge is to the order passed by a 
Division Bench of the Madras High Court dismissing the writ 
petitions filed by the appellants.  
	Background facts as projected by the appellants are as 
follows:
</p><p id="p_4">	Various stone crushing units were being operated by the 
appellants in Trisoolam Village, Kanjipuram District, Tamil 
Nadu. According to the appellants they had obtained "no 
objection certificate" from the Tehsildar, Divisional Fire Officer 
and the Panchayat Union for the purpose of running the units.  
After Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (in 
short the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>')] and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of 
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (in short the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>') came into force 
appellants applied for consent from the concerned authorities 
under these Acts.  Considering the applications the District 
Environmental Engineer called for some particulars and 
appellants were required to remit a sum of Rs.1750/- each 
towards consent fee under the Acts, which was also paid.  
Appellants were granted permission by the Commissioner, 
Panchayat Union for construction of a shed and installation of 
25 HP Electric Motor to run the units and as per the approved 
plan the shed was constructed and business was being carried 
out. The Principal Secretary, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control 
Board  (in short the 'Board') issued notice to each of the 
appellants requiring shifting to alternative sites since the units 
were located at about 325 meters from the residential colony.
  Appellants gave their reply stating that the units were 
operating since 1972 and in fact they were located in the non-
urban zone.  Some writ petitions were filed by the Krishna 
Nagar Welfare Association and Kennedy Valley Welfare 
Association. Since there were various reports, which were 
somewhat contradictory to each other, Civil Appeal No. 6742 
of 2001 and W.P. (C) 2594 of 1999 were disposed of by this 
Court with certain directions. The Industries Department of 
the State Government issued G.O.Ms.  No. 13 dated 22.1.2002 
wherein it was declared as follows:
	"In the order first read above, in adherence to 
the Supreme Court Order in C.A. No. 10732/95, 
the Government issued amendment to Rule 
36(1) of Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession 
Rules, 1959 to the effect that no quarrying shall 
be done within a radial distance of 500 metres 
from inhabited site.  The position was also 
informed to Supreme Court of India in 
connection with S.L.P.(C) No. 13564/98."
</p>
<p id="p_5">The District Environmental Officer issued a notice to 
each of the appellant observing that their units were located 
within 500 meters from the residential area and therefore, 
penal action was called for.  A Writ Petition (Writ Petition No. 
35855 of 2003) was filed before the High Court alleging 
pollution because of the activities of the stone crushing units.  
The appellants challenged the notices/orders issued by the 
Board.  The High Court dismissed the same holding that the 
action initiated by the Board was justified.
  During the hearing of the cases on 13.11.2006, the 
following order was passed:
</p><p id="p_6">	"Our attention has been drawn to the notice 
dated 11 March, 1994 issued to one of the 
petitioners, M/s. Rathnam Blue Metals, which 
states that the units is located at about 325 
meters from Krishna Nagar against  the limit of 
500 meters from residential area. The contention  
of the petitioners is that now the limit has been 
reduced to 300 meters and, therefore,  their  unit 
is located within the permissible distance.  It is 
further submitted that all the units are  in 
adjoining  sites and are beyond the distance of 
300 meters from residential area.  The 
respondent-Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board 
is directed to verify the factual scenario and file 
an affidavit within four weeks."
</p>
<p id="p_7">An affidavit had been filed on behalf of the respondent 
Nos.1 &amp; 2 Board annexing a map and giving the following 
details.
</p><p id="p_8">Name of the Nine Stone Crushing Units and its Distance

We have heard learned counsel for the parties. It appears 
that the factual position was not examined in detail by the 
High Court.  The affidavit filed by respondent Nos.1 &amp; 2 
alongwith the map before this Court throw some light on the 
controversy.  In the circumstances, we think it appropriate to 
remit the matter to the High Court to consider the effect of the 
affidavit and the map.  It goes without saying that the parties 
shall be permitted to place materials in support of their  
irrespective stand so that the High Court can consider the 
issues involved.  We make it clear that we have not expressed 
any opinion on the merit.  The appeals are accordingly 
disposed of without any orders as to costs.
