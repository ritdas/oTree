</p>
<p id="p_2">     The petitioners in W.P(C) No. 9136/2014 are the

appellants W.A. No. 1715 of 2014.       They challenge the

judgment dated 7.11.2014 of the learned Single Judge.

</p><p id="p_3">     2.   W.P(C) No. 9136/2014 was filed seeking to quash

Ext. P5, a common order passed by the Tribunal for Local

Self Government Institutions (hereinafter referred as the

'Tribunal') in Appeal No. 274/2013 and Revision Petition

No. 157/2013. Appeal No. 274/2013 was filed by the 1st

respondent herein challenging the decision dated 8.3.2013

of the Municipal Council, whereby the 1st respondent was

denied renewal of his licence for functioning an industrial

unit. Revision Petition No. 157/2013 was filed by the 1st

respondent, challenging the decision dated 8.10.2013 in an

appeal filed by the 1st respondent before the Municipal

Council. The appeal and the revision were heard together

and allowed. The decision of the Municipal Council dated

8.3.2013 was set aside and a direction was issued to the

Municipality to issue licence to the 1st respondent.   The

revision petition was also allowed, setting aside the order

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013            -: 2 :-</span>

dated 8.10.2013, rejecting the appeal filed by the 1st

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         3.       The facts involved in the writ petition would

disclose that the petitioners are certain persons in the

Municipal area where the 1st respondent has started

functioning a unit            under the name and style      M/s.

Palappilin Specified Block Rubbers Pvt. Ltd. According

to the 1st respondent he is the Managing Director of a

Company M/s. Palappilin Specified Block Rubbers Pvt.

Ltd. , which started functioning since 1983. In the year

1996, it started to operate as a small crumb rubber

factory with all licences/permission from statutory

authorities.            Certain objections were    raised by the

Pollution Control Board regarding               treatment of the

effluent during 2011, on the basis of which the

Municipality suspended the licence.              The contention

urged by the 1st respondent before the Tribunal was

that despite rectifying of defects pointed out by the

Pollution Control Board, the licence was not renewed.

Several litigations followed and                 finally, as per

judgment dated 10.12.2012 in W.P(C) No. 1253/2012,

this Court directed             the Council to dispose of the

Appeal pending before it.               It is stated that a sub

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013            -: 3 :-</span>

committee was constituted by the Council who

inspected the factory and prepared a report. Based on

the said report, the Council, in its meeting held on

8.3.2013, decided to refuse the licence to the 1st

respondent. There was a request to renew the licence

and by virtue of a direction issued by this Court in its

judgment dated 20.6.2013 in W.P(C) No. 15653/2013, a

decision was taken by the Council in the meeting held

on 31.8.2013 deciding not to renew the licence, which

was the subject matter in the revision petition before

the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         4.       It was inter alia contended by the appellants

before the learned Single Judge that even from the

documents produced before the Tribunal, it was clear

that the unit was not fit to be granted a licence.

Therefore, the Tribunal was not justified in directing

grant of licence or renewal thereof.            It was further

contended that the consent given by the               Pollution

Control Board did not have any sanctity, as,

subsequently, the              Pollution Control Board had

indicated that the 1st respondent did not comply with

the conditions imposed as per the consent issued and

therefore when a sub committee, after site inspection,

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013           -: 4 :-</span>

had come to the clear finding that the unit cannot be

permitted to function on account of severe pollution,

the Tribunal was not justified in taking a contrary view.

The materials produced before the Tribunal have not

been considered and the decision taken as per Ext. P5

is arbitrary and not based on the materials available on

record.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         5.       The learned Single Judge, after elaborately

considering the facts and circumstances involved in the

matter, dismissed the writ petition. While impugning

the aforesaid judgment, it is argued by the learned

counsel for the appellants that none of the grounds

raised by the appellants has been considered by the

learned Single Judge. That apart, when the sub

committee report was available on record, reliance

should have been placed on the said document rather

than discarding the said document without any basis.

Specific reference is also made to the judgment of this

Court in Manjapra Grama Panchayat v. State of

Kerala, 1996(2) KLT 719, wherein this Court found

that even though the licences/permission had been

obtained from             Pollution Control Board as well as

District Medical Officer, the Panchayath has to

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013          -: 5 :-</span>

independently consider whether setting up of the unit

within its area would affect the people of the locality.

The         Panchayath      being   an   institution  of   self

Government, has powers and duties which enable them

to reject a licence, if it is found that the functioning of

the unit affects          the public at large.   Further, it is

argued that even as per the materials available on

record, especially the report submitted by the Pollution

Control Board as instructed by this Court, would show

that the effluent is not up to the standards and the

sound emanated is exceeding the limits.

</p><p id="p_7">         6.       On the other hand, the learned counsel for

the 1st respondent supported the stand taken by the

Tribunal and pointed out that there is no basis for the

contentions urged on behalf of the appellants as the

defects pointed out have been completely rectified.

There is no effluent which is being discharged as the

same            is recycled and sound level is within the

parameters specified for industrial units in the locality.

It is further pointed out that the unit had been set up

in 1983 and it is thereafter that several residents have

started residing in the locality. It is unfair to reject

renewal of licence when this unit had been functioning

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013          -: 6 :-</span>

for the last several years without causing any nuisance

or pollution as contended by the Municipality.

</p><p id="p_8">         7.       W.P(C) No. 26922/2013 is filed by the

Company which runs the unit, seeking for police

protection. They allege obstruction in the functioning of

the unit by the party respondents. They have submitted

a complaint to the police seeking for police protection

and since no action had been taken in the matter, the

writ petition is filed seeking appropriate orders for

police protection to function the factory. According to

them, on the basis of the directions issued by the

Tribunal, the Municipality is bound to renew the licence

and therefore their right to operate the unit cannot be

obstructed by any person.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         8.       Heard the learned counsel for the appellants,

respondents in the appeal and the respective counsel

appearing in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">         9.       The appellants mainly rely upon the report of

the sub committee appointed by the Municipality. The

minutes of the meeting which considered the sub

committee report is produced as Ext. R1(t).               The

</p>
<p id="p_16">         Based on the report of the sub-committee, the High
         Court has directed the Municipality to take a
         decision regarding the function of the Palapillil
         Specified Block Rubbers.       The said   factory was
         operating in ward 26. It was closed down for the

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

         past sixteen months as per the recommendations of
         PCB and Municipality.       The sub committee was
         appointed by the council in the meeting held on
         25.01.2013 to study and file a report regarding
         Palapillil factory.  Palapillil factory is situated in
         ward No. 26 of the kothamangalam Municipality,
         200 meters away from NH-49 and at a distance of 3
         km. from town. The Mathirapilly School where more
         than 1000 children are studying is situated only at a
         distance of 200m from the factory.       Students are
         acing difficulty in studying due to the smell and
         sound from the factory. This was reported earlier.
         There is a PWD Road in front of the company which
         is used by the public at large daily. There is a colony
         only just 5 km away.         It was noticed by the
         committee that the nearby well was polluted since
         the factory has not installed any mechanism for
         treating the effluent (around lakhs of litres of
         effluent per day) or to use it without causing trouble
         to the residents of the locality.      The factory is
         situated in relatively higher area where sound and
         smell are very high.
</p>
<p id="p_17">         The company started functioning as a creep mill
         when the population was very less. With passage of
         time, it was developed into a Block Rubber factory
         without the consent of the residents. A canal known
         as 'Erappinkal Thodu' is running through the back
         area of the factory.      It is a canal used by the
         residents It is a source of drinking water. This has
         come to the notice of the committee. The localities
         complained that when the company was functioning
         the water in the canal used to cause health problems
         like itching. This was brought to the notice of the
         Municipality by filing a mass petition. It is pertinent
         to note that the Health Department of Municipality
         and PCB rejected the permission to function taking
         note of the fact that the factory was discharging the
         effluent to the canal.

         The burning of cashew nut shell for heating the
         burner creates a lot of smoke and causes air
         pollution. Since it functions 24 hours or 3 shifts
         children are unable to study or sleep. Women and
         children have complained that they are facing many
         problems.       Since the machinery is very old it is
         creating noise higher than the permissible limits. It
         is also a fact that if the factory is allowed to function,
         even if any kind of devices are installed it won't be a
         permanent solution for the stinking smell or the
         worms in the rainy seasons. Localities complained
         that the factory is responsible for some deaths
         happened in the near by areas.
</p>
<p id="p_19">         There are many poor people living within a radius of
         200 meters. The committee has been to around 30
         houses        and  interacted    with    them    directly.
         Committee is convinced of the seriousness of the
         matter. The only pathway available to the persons
         living in the colony has become unfit for use because
         of the malicious acts of the company.          When the
         current density of the area is considered it is evident
         that the situation is not suitable for functioning of
         such a company.
</p>
<p id="p_20">         The Health Department of Municipality was totally
         careless with respect to this matter.              Health
         department has taken a stand opposite to the earlier
         stand of Municipality without considering the
         hardship faced by the people and without seeking
         scientific     and  expert   opinions.    Therefore   the
         committee is hereby recommended not to give
         license to the factory when the people are agitating
         for unpolluted water and air.

        officials      conducted day   to    day analysis from
        10.08.2012 to 01.09.2012. The unit was inspected on
        all the days on which they are operational. Effluent
        samples were collected from raw effluent collection
        tank and from treated effluent portion.          During
        inspection sound level were also measured outside the
        unit. Regarding air pollution, no foul smell except the
        normal smell from a crumb rubber industry was
        experienced during monitoring. It was also seen that
        they have provided alkaline scrubber to reduce smell
        from the drying section. Tabulated data of analysis

</p><p id="p_34">         11. Before proceeding to consider the contention

regarding the alleged pollution on account of the

functioning of the unit, it will be worthwhile to consider

the first argument of the                learned counsel for the

appellants based on the judgment in                      Manjapra

Grama Panchayat's case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_35">         12. In the said judgment, a learned Single Judge

of this Court was considering the question relating to

grant of licence for putting up a metal crusher and

hollow bricks manufacturing unit. This Court held that

the Panchayath being a Local                    Self Government

Institution, is entitled to consider whether a licence

can be granted even if the applicant has obtained all

other statutory permissions.                 There is substantial

difference between consideration of an application for

issuance of a fresh licence and that of an application for

renewal of licence. No doubt, when a fresh application

is submitted, it has necessarily to be considered

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013       -: 13 :-</span>

whether the Panchayat should actually permit such an

industrial unit in the locality.        That was a case in

which an attempt was made to instal a metal crusher

unit along with hollow brick unit in an agricultural

area.          A consideration of the relevant parameters

required for starting a unit including the fact that

whether it should be permitted to be put up in an

agricultural area is a matter definitely to be considered

by a Panchayath. It was in the said circumstances that

the learned Single Judge has decided the Manjapra

Grama Panchayat's case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_36">         13. But that is not the situation in the case on

hand. In the present case, the petitioner was running a

unit in crumb rubber. The unit was in existence since

1983 and all along, it was functioning with the licence

from the Municipality. Only at a later stage, when the

question of renewal of licence came, there were

allegations about pollution by the local people. It is at

that stage several action had been taken by the

Municipality on the basis of various orders issued by

this Court and other statutory authorities.        The 1st

respondent had taken all necessary steps for ensuring

compliance of all the statutory requirements.           A

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013          -: 14 :-</span>

reference to the counter affidavit filed in W.P(C) No.

9136/2014 would clarify the nature of proceedings that

ensued in respect of the above unit. The following facts

will be relevant.
</p>
<p id="p_37">         (i) The crumb rubber unit was established in the

year 1983 in an extent of 6 acres of land in Sy. No.

1369/1/4/A             of   Kothamangalam    Village.   The

Environmental Engineer, by a communication dated

11.11.2011, called upon the respondent to modify the

effluent             treatment plant.     The 1st respondent

submitted a proposal before the Pollution Control

Board for constructing effluent treatment plant.

</p><p id="p_38">         (ii) Alleging that there was obstruction from

some persons in the locality in the construction of the

treatment plant, the respondent filed W.P(C) No.

1253/2012, in which this Court passed an interim order

granting police protection.
</p>
<p id="p_39">         (iii) The Municipal Council issued an order of stay

against the construction on 24.3.2012.

</p><p id="p_40">         (iv) W.P(C) No. 7876/2012 was filed and the order

of the Secretary dated 24.3.2012 was stayed and the

construction of the treatment plant was completed. The

treatment plant was            installed and the permission

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013         -: 15 :-</span>

granted by the Pollution Control Board is produced as

Ext. R1(h) dated 2.4.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_41">         (v) W.P(C) No. 7876/2012 was finally disposed of

on 13.4.2012 directing the Municipality to consider the

application of the 1st respondent for renewal of the

licence           for the year 2012-2013, pursuant to which

licence was granted.
</p>
<p id="p_42">         (vi) An extra-ordinary general meeting was held

by the Municipal Council on 16.6.2012 and they have

passed an order restraining the respondent from

proceeding with the functioning of the unit.

</p><p id="p_43">         (vii) The respondent filed W.P(C) No. 14490/2012

and the order passed by the Municipal Council was

stayed.
</p>
<p id="p_44">         (viii) The Division Bench passed an interim order

in I.A. No. 8673/2012 in W.P(C) No. 1253/2012

permitting the unit to be operated for 15 days in order

to ensure that the effluent treatment plant was working

properly and the Pollution Control Board was directed

to analyze the situation and file a report. Ext. R1(n) is

the report. The Division Bench disposed of W.P(C) No.

1253/2012, directing the Municipal Council to consider

the case of the unit for granting licence. The Pollution

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013     -: 16 :-</span>

Control Board issued consent to operate, which is valid

till 30.6.2015 (Ext. R1(p)).
</p>
<p id="p_45">         (ix) The Municipal Council again held a meeting

on 8.8.2012 and decided to reject the licence. On the

basis of the judgment of the High Court in W.P(C) No.

1253/2012, again, a representation was given.        The

Municipal Council selected a sub committee under the

leadership of one Sri. A.G. George. The sub committee

submitted a report on 6.3.2013 pointing out the health

hazards in the locality.
</p>
<p id="p_46">         (x) Pursuant to the committee's report, the

Municipal Council again took a decision on 8.3.2013,

deciding not to renew the licence. This was followed by

another order of the Secretary issued on 13.3.2013.

</p><p id="p_47">         (xi) Consequent to the direction issued by the

Tribunal, which is under challenge, the Secretary had

issued the licence on 23.3.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_48">         14. The learned counsel for the appellants' main

argument is based on the fact that the Tribunal, while

considering the appeal and revision, did not advert to

the material evidence available in the case and has

erroneously directed the licence to be issued. Perusal

of Ex. P5 order dated 1.3.2014 of the Tribunal would

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013     -: 17 :-</span>

indicate that the Tribunal has come to the aforesaid

conclusion after considering the report submitted by

the Environmental Engineer before this Court (Ext. R1

</p><p id="p_49">(n)) and also the report of the committee constituted by

the Municipality. As far as the report filed before this

Court as Ext. R1(n) is concerned, the Tribunal had

specifically mentioned that the officials of the Pollution

Control Board had conducted day to day analysis of the

unit from 10.8.2012 to 1.9.2012.      In respect of the

report of the sub committee as well, it is found that one

of the Municipal Councilor A.G. George, who has

objected to the unit functioning in the locality, was also

a member of the sub committee.        Further, it is held

that such a report cannot be the basis for denying the

licence. It is also found that the finding of the sub

committee is against the consent issued by the

Pollution Control Board and without any scientific basis

and cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_50">         15. Further, the learned Single Judge, while

considering the respective contentions of the parties,

has taken note of the fact that the consent to operate

issued by the Pollution Control Board has not been

challenged by the appellants and that the respondent is

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013    -: 18 :-</span>

having a deemed licence as per Section 447(6) of the

Municipality Act, 1994 in respect of the current

financial year and fee for renewal had been submitted

as per Ext. R1(x). Further, the learned Single Judge

held that the findings of fact by the Tribunal cannot be

interfered in writ proceedings.      The learned Single

Judge also held that while taking a decision, the local

authority has to be guided by expert opinion and

though public interest is also a relevant factor, there

has to be some basis for denying the licence. On that

basis the learned Single Judge did not interfere with

the order passed by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_51">         16. It is argued by he learned counsel for he

appellants that the Tribunal should not have directed

grant of licence and no such power is available to the

said authority. Section 509 of the Kerala Municipality

Act, 1994 deals with appeals and revision,          the

procedure and the manner in which appeal has to be

filed and considered by the Tribunal. Sub-section (9) of

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Section 509</a> indicates that the Tribunal shall pass

appropriate orders on an appeal or revision petition

filed before it and the order so passed shall be final.

Appropriate order apparently includes any order that

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013              -: 19 :-</span>

the Tribunal may deem it necessary in order to give

effect to the orders passed. Rules have been framed by

the Government in exercise of powers conferred under

Section 509 of the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994 as the

Tribunal for Local Self Government Institutions Rules,

1949 (hereinafter referred to as 1949 Rules) Rule 21

reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  "21. Consequence of the order of the
        tribunal:- The notice or order issued or action taken
        by the Local Self Government Institution or its
        Secretary, as the case may be, shall stand as such or
        be modified or annulled in accordance with the final
        order of the Tribunal on the petition from the date of
        issue of such final order.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  (2)   Copy of the order of the Tribunal shall be
        issued to each party to the petition within one week
        from the date of the order."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">Reference to the aforesaid Rule clearly indicates that it

is open for the Tribunal to modify or annul any decision

of the Local Self Government Institutions or its

Secretary. When authority is given to the Tribunal to

annul any order, it can also direct issuance of the

permit/licence, if it is found that the impugned order is

patently illegal.             This is a case in which the 1st

respondent was unable to function the unit over a

period of time. Since there were objections from the

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013            -: 20 :-</span>

people in the locality, he had to approach the writ court

on several occasions seeking appropriate directions and

therefore when it was felt that licence has not been

issued by the              Municipality without any justifiable

reason, it is well within the power of the Tribunal to

direct grant of licence.
</p>
<p id="p_53">         17. This is a case in which the unit has started

operation in 1983 and was a functioning unit. There

was no complaint from any quarters over a period of

time. Only during 2011 certain complaints had arisen.

It is not possible for a Municipality who had permitted

grant of licence, to refuse to renew the licence merely

on the ground of public protest. Public protest can be

considered if a new unit affects the public in any

manner.              In fact, the Municipality Act itself makes

specific provisions to enable the Secretary to ensure

that nuisance, if any, is abated. Chapter XIX of the

Municipality Act gives appropriate powers                to the

Secretary to ensure that no nuisance is being caused

and the measures to be taken to abate such nuisance.

</p><p id="p_54">         18. In the case on hand, the alleged nuisance was

regarding the effluent discharged from the factory.

The material available on record clearly indicates that

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013      -: 21 :-</span>

the 1st respondent has put up an effluent treatment

plant and Pollution Control Board had certified that it is

a zero discharge plant. Therefore, such an issue has

become irrelevant. Regarding the sound pollution also,

being an industry, during day time, the permissible

limit of standard of noise is 75 decibels and during

night it is 70. In a commercial area, it is 65 during day

time and 55 during night hours. Only in residential

area, it is 55 during day time and 45 during night.

Apparently, the property in question is an area where

an industry has been put up for the last several years

and it can afford to have noise ambiance level of 75

decibels during day time. The report of the Pollution

Control Board at Ext. R1(n), clearly indicates that it is

much below the standards prescribed for industrial

area. Even assuming that it is a residential area, the

sound emanated exceeds very minimal and therefore it

is not possible for the appellants to contend that there

is any form of pollution as matters stand now.

</p><p id="p_55">         19. With reference to the report at Ext.R1(n), the

learned counsel for the appellants argued that during

certain days, the Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)

exceeds the limit and therefore the functioning of the

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013           -: 22 :-</span>

unit is not satisfactory. We have already extracted the

report itself. The Environmental Engineer has further

stated that after stabilisation, considerable reduction is

expected in the concentration of BOD and other

parameters. The report came to be prepared during a

trial verification as directed by this Court for a limited

period.           As far as sound level is concerned, the report

indicates that "much exceeding sound levels" were not

noticed. They have further mentioned about certain

operative measures to be taken, which, according to

the petitioner, they have complied.             Therefore, it is

evident from the materials on record which have been

rightly adjudicated by the Tribunal that the alleged

cause of pollution is absolutely baseless.

</p><p id="p_56">         20. Yet another contention urged is based on the

sub committee report. The said report, as rightly held

by the Tribunal, cannot be the basis for rejection of the

licence. One of the Councilors, who was totally against

the continuance of the industry in the locality, was a

member of the said committee.                  That apart, the

committee members have no technical expertise. It is

the contention of the learned counsel for the 1st

respondent that they visited the premises when the unit

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013     -: 23 :-</span>

was not functioning. Even if the Municipality can

delegate verification of a unit to a sub committee, they

can only verify the visible features in the locality. As

far as the technical aspects are concerned, they have

to get the assistance of experts. In the present case, the

question is that of pollution, which apparently had to be

considered by an expert body. It is for that purpose

that the statute itself had made specific provisions to

enable the Municipality to get the assistance of the

Pollution Control Board. When an opinion has been

expressed by the Pollution Control Board in regard to a

particular industry with reference to air, water and

noise pollution, it has to be treated as an expert opinion

in the matter and the Councilors or a sub committee

consisting of members of Council cannot override such

expert opinion based on their site inspection.

</p><p id="p_57">         21. Learned counsel for the appellants contended

that there is public protest in the locality. This again is

based on an apprehension of pollution. This is not an

industry which has just started functioning. Of course,

the Municipality can seek opinion from the members of

public. An existing industry can be refused renewal of

licence only if they do not comply with the statutory

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013           -: 24 :-</span>

provisions and if they fail to comply with the standards

prescribed by the competent authorities. Public protest

cannot override the right of the owner of the industry

to carry on lawful business.
</p>
<p id="p_58">         22. Under such circumstances, we are of the view

that the grounds urged by the learned counsel for the

appellants challenging the judgment of the learned

Single Judge fails and accordingly the writ appeal is

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_59">         23. In regard to W.P(C) No. 26922/2014, this

being an application seeking police protection, once the

petitioner functions a unit with a valid licence or

permission from the competent authorities, the party

respondents cannot obstruct the said activities and if

any such obstruction is created, it amounts to law and

order situation or prevention in carrying on the

business activities, and police is bound to interfere and

ensure that no obstruction is caused in the functioning

of the unit and that law and order situation is

maintained.              Counter affidavit is filed by the 2nd

respondent raising grounds similar to that raised in the

appeal.            Having regard to the fact that there is stiff

opposition             from  some     quarters   among   party

W.A. No. 1715 of 2014
       and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">W.P(C) No. 26922 of 2013          -: 25 :-</span>

respondents, we are of the view that this writ petition

requires to be allowed and appropriate directions are

to be issued to respondents 7 and 8 to maintain law

and order situation in the area.
</p>
<p id="p_60">         In the result,

</p><p id="p_61">         (i)      Writ Appeal No. 1715/2014 is dismissed.

</p><p id="p_62">         (ii)       W.P.(C) No.    26922/2013     is   allowed.

Respondents 7 and 8 are directed to ensure that no

obstruction or law and order is created by respondents

1, 2, 4, 5 and their men in the matter relating to the

functioning of the factory of the petitioner.
