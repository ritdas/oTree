     particular, respondent No.2 to supply potable water to

     the citizens of Aurangabad city.

<p id="p_5">          There are two essential requirements of the
   



     human life - firstly, fresh air and secondly, potable

     water. Without these two things, human being cannot





     survive.   The Supreme Court in various expositions,

     has interpreted <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India





     and has taken a view that right of           access to clean

     drinking water is fundamental to life.            Duty lies on

     State to provide clean drinking water to its citizens.

     Division Bench of this Court, has taken a view that the

     State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_3">Article 12</a> of the
      


     Constitution of India.        The parliamentarians were
   



     cautious about the social rights of the citizens of the

     country and parliament in its wisdom thought it fit to





     add the word 'Socialist' in the preamble of the

     Constitution     way   back    in   1976.       The       directive





     principles of State Policy are given in Part IV and in

     the State to take care of the health of the citizens and
