     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE APARESH KUMAR SINGH
                                ...

            The grievance of the petitioner in the present writ

     petition is that it was not required to obtain renewal of

     consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of

     Pollution) Rules, 1976.

            The reasons for coming before this Court of the

     petitioner is that he was aggrieved vide letter dated

     17.09.1996</pre><p id="p_1"> issued by the Member Secretary of the Bihar

     State Pollution Control Board under <a href="/doc/68540/" id="a_2">Section 5(2)</a> of the

     Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Cess Act</a>,

     1977.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            According to the petitioner, it is a small scale

     industry, which is exempted from the requirement of

     obtaining annual renewals on the basis of letter dated

     21.10.1992 issued by the Central Pollution Control

     Board, Annexure-3, which is said to have been issued in

     statutory exercise of power. The petitioner submits that it

     is not carrying on any activities of discharge of water or

     discharge of any sewage or trade effluent creating                       a

     nuisance or injurious to public health etc.

            However, the petitioner had obtained such consent

     by making an application in Form VIA to the Bihar State
 Pollution Control Board, which was granted vide letter

dated 28.02.1994. According to the petitioner, in the

category of small scale industry, one time consent would

serve the purpose of consent and there is no requirement

for the industry to obtain       periodic renewal of consent

unless the unit modifies or changes its processes. The

petitioner is, therefore, aggrieved by the issuance of the

said notice by which it has been asked to seek renewal of

consent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     The respondent- Jharkhand State Pollution Control

Board, which has been created after bifurcation of the

State and has stepped into the shoes of the Bihar State

Pollution Control Board,         has filed its     counter after

coming into existence.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     Learned counsel for the respondents submits that

there is requirement under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the Water

(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1978

that every assessee shall submit returns before the

Member Secretary of the State Pollution Control Board in

Form-I. Accordingly, the Unit was asked to submit water

cess returns. The Unit was informed by the then Bihar

Board that this unit is covered under Engineering

industry in sl. no. 15 of the specified industry in cess

water Act, 1977 and          it is not exempted from the

provisions    of    the   Acts   and   Rules.     However,      the

respondents        submit   that    earlier      notification    of

21.10.1992 was in the conflict of the Provisions of the

Water Act, 1974 and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>, 1981 and cannot prevail.
 Therefore, the aforesaid Rules of Pollution Control Board

is bad in law and is not acceptable. The stand taken by

the respondent-Board, however,        apparently appears to

be   contrary to the guideline issued by the Central

Pollution   Control   Board.    Learned     counsel    for    the

respondents    submits   that     thereafter   again    several

amendments have taken place and the petitioner would

be liable for submission of returns as well as renewal of

such consent upon payment of renewal fee.

</p><p id="p_5">     The matter is pending since 1998 and the Bihar

Pollution Control Board        is substituted by the newly

created Jharkhand Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_6">     In that view of the matter, without entering into the

merit of the controversies, the petitioner is directed to

approach    the   Member       Secretary,   Jharkhand        State

Pollution Control Board on the question relating to

renewal of consent as was directed by earlier notice

issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The

petitioner shall approach the Member Secretary with his

representation    containing    all   supporting   facts      and

documents within a period of 15 days.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     Learned counsel for the respondent no. 4 submits

that final decision, in this regard, has to be taken by

Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board itself, which has

delegated its power to the Chairman of the Jharkhand

State Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     In that view of the matter, the matter would be

placed before the Chairman by the Member Secretary for
                taking appropriate decision in the matter, which shall be

               taken within a period of 12 weeks thereafter from the

               receipt of such representation of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_9">                       Any consequential action shall be taken pursuant to

               the order passed by the Chairman, Jharkhand State

               Pollution Control Board. The petitioner, if so required,

               will be liable to comply with any condition as may be

               imposed upon it in terms of the relevant Acts and the

               Rules and Circulars in that regard. Accordingly, this writ

               petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
