ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">(PER
: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. BHASKAR BHATTACHARYA)
 


 


 


	By
this application under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the
petitioner has prayed for issue of a writ of mandamus or a writ in
the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate writ or order
quashing and setting aside the notice dated 13th March, 2012, being
Annexure "A" to this application, with further direction
upon the respondent No.1 to process the application of the petitioner
for carrying on some other business in the premises.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	It
appears that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, by the impugned
notice dated 13th March, 2012, issued under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33A</a> of the Water
(Prevention of Control of  Pollution) Act, 1974, directed closure of
the unit of the petitioner, which was carrying on an industry of
galvanization.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	The
grievance of the writ-petitioner in this application is that he has
intended to close the aforesaid business, as he intends to start a
new unit for engineering or godown purpose with the assurance that
there would be no generation of hazardous waste and emission of any
gas.  The petitioner complaints that in spite of the filing of such
an application and undertaking, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board
is not processing the same.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	Mr.
</p><p id="p_5">Vyas, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Gujarat
Pollution Control Board submits that if the petitioner wants to start
a new business after complying with all the formalities required
under the law, his client has no objection in granting permission,
provided the previous activities  done by the petitioner is not
continued.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">	Such
being the position, we direct the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to
process the application filed by the petitioner for starting new
business as indicated in the undertaking, and to pass necessary order
of revocation of the closure notice, if it is satisfied that the
petitioner would not carry on his previous business for which closure
notice was issued, and the business intended to be done would be
started after compliance of the formalities required under the law. 
Such decision be taken within one month from today.  The application
is thus, disposed of.
</p>
