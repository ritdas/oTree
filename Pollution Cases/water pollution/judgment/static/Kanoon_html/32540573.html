impugned order dated 08.06.2015, Annexure P.10 during the pendency of the

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.            A few facts relevant for the decision of the controversy involved

as narrated in the petition may be noticed. The petitioner is a small scale

industry installed in the year 1994. It is being run through its proprietor Manak

Ali. It is dealing in manufacturing of plastic Gitta. The petitioner started its

unit after proper verification and fulfilled required conditions under the law. It

got No Objection Certificate dated 01.09.1994 from Municipal Committee,

Sirhind, Fatehgarh Sahib before installing industrial unit and for getting

electric connection. The petitioner also got installed Air and Water Pollution

Control Equipment in its premises. According to the petitioner, it is not

causing air or water pollution of any kind in the area. The premises of the

petitioner were inspected and checked by respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and

thereafter report "A feasibility report" was issued. The petitioner was required

to obtain consent of respondent Nos. 2 and 3 for running the industry. The

petitioner applied for the same which was granted till 30.11.2012 which was

renewed till 30.06.2014. Respondent No.7, who is a resident of the same

Mohalla started filing false applications against the respondent before

respondent Nos. 2 and 3 by using his influence. He even alleged that the

petitioner was causing pollution at the spot. The petitioner raised its plea

before respondent Nos. 2 and 3 to the effect that the industry was installed in

the month of July, 1994 after obtaining NOC. There were lots of industries

near the industry of the petitioner. The house of respondent No.7 was at a

distance of about 700 feet from the petitioner industry. The nearby inhabitants

had no objection qua the industry of the petitioner. To the utter surprise of the

petitioner, respondent Nos. 2 and 3 under the influence of respondent No.7

issued a letter dated 12.11.2014, Annexure P.7, to the petitioner and had given

the decision for shifting of the petitioner-industry on the ground that it had

failed to submit permission from the competent authority regarding

continuance at the existing site for further period. Thereafter, the petitioner

visited respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and disclosed to them that it had earlier applied

for necessary permission to be given by District Town Planner, District

Management Complex, Fatehgarh Sahib, who further directed the petitioner to

seek permission from the competent authority-GMADA. Accordingly, the

petitioner applied for the said permission which is pending in the office of CA-

GMADA, PUDA Bhawan, Mohali. Instead of considering the above facts,

respondent Nos. 2 and 3 issued the impugned direction vide letter dated

08.06.2015, Annexure P.10 to the petitioner directing it to dismantle and

remove all outlets of industry. Further, direction has been issued to respondent

Nos. 5 &amp; 6 to disconnect the supply of electricity available to the petitioner.

According to the petitioner, respondent No.8 is also running industry at the

similar position and respondent No.2 has granted the permission to respondent

No.8 till 30.09.2018 to run the industry. The petitioner asserts that there are

about 15 to 20 industries of similar nature in the area but the petitioner has

been made scapegoat, though it had applied for permission way back on

04.08.2014. According to the petitioner, the plastic factory is a source of its

income. The petitioner is continuously representating to respondent No.4 to

grant the required permission to run industry but no action has been taken so

far. Hence the instant petition by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.            In the short reply filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 to 3, it has

been inter alia stated that the petitioner industry was located in residential area

and since, a number of complaints were being filed by the residents of the

locality the officials of the respondent authorities visited the industry on

30.09.2014. It was found that the industry had not provided adequate water

pollution control measures and the air pollution control devices were not being

operated. During a personal hearing on 10.11.2014, the proprietor of the

industry assured that the industry would dismantle the soakage pit and would

apply for renewal for consent under the relevant Act. During inspection on

13.05.2015, again it was found that even though the industry was not in

operation, no steps had been taken for shifting it from the existing premises to

some other place. It was further noticed that the industry had been shut down

temporarily and it failed to obtain the necessary consent and permissions to

continue its operation. In view of the above, vide order dated 08.06.2015,

Annexure P.10, the respondents directed the industry to close down

immediately. It was further directed that no process shall be re-started without

obtaining the necessary consent.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.            In the short reply filed on behalf of respondent No.4, it has been

inter alia stated that permission to shift its industrial unit by the petitioner

cannot be granted as the unit has already been sealed by respondent No.3 i.e.

Punjab Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had permission to run its

industry unit only till 30.06.2014 which period has already expired. As per

report dated 09.07.2015 (Annexure R-4/1), respondent No.3 has sealed this

industrial unit and disconnected its electricity connection.

</p><p id="p_5">5.            A written statement has also been filed by respondent No.7-

Jasmer Singh wherein it has been inter alia stated that sufficient time was given

to the petitioner to make the necessary arrangement but it failed to follow even

a single norm and continued to run the factory on the same conditions and

resultantly the industry was directed to close its operation. It was running in

residential area without any clearance from any authority. Various complaints

had been received that the industry had been causing harm and damage to the

health of the nearby residents.

<p id="p_9">7.            A perusal of the impugned order dated 08.06.2015, Annexure

P.10 shows that it was mandatory on the part of the petitioner-industry to

obtain consent of the Punjab Pollution Control Board to establish/operate

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Sections 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (in short, "the 1974 Act") as the unit was discharging effluents from its

premises. It was also mandatory to provide adequate and appropriate waste

water treatment facilities to ensure that concentration of various pollutants in

the waste water discharged by the industry conforms to the permissible limits

prescribed by the Board. The petitioner industry was granted consent to

operate upto 30.11.2012 subject to certain conditions. A complaint against the

pollution caused by the petitioner-industry was received from Jasmer Singh on

18.09.2012. The petitioner was called for personal hearing before the Board.

The industry was granted consent to operate upto 30.06.2014 with the

condition that it shall submit permission from the competent authority

regarding continuance at the existing site for further period under Section 79 of

the Punjab Regional and Town Planning Development Act, 1995 (in short, "the

1995 Act"). After hearing the officers of the Board and representative of the

petitioner-industry, it was found that the industy had failed to submit

permission under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Section 79</a> of the 1995 Act from the competent authority

regarding continuance at the existing site of the unit. The Member Secretary of

the Board decided that the petitioner industry shall take necessary steps to shift

its unit from its existing premises to some other suitable site conforming to the

set guidelines of the Board, within a period of six months. When the petitioner

industry failed to comply with the relevant statutory provisions, the Member

Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board, in exercise of powers conferred

upon him under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33-A</a> of the 1974 Act, ordered that it was a fit case to

order closure of the industry. It was further directed that the industry shall

into sewer or through any other mode. The Punjab State Power Corporation

Limited was also directed to disconnect the supply of electricity available to

the hot mix plant. After considering the overall facts and circumstances of the

case, the respondent authorities decided to pass the impugned order dated

08.06.2015, Annexure P.10 directing to close the petitioner-industry. Learned

counsel for the petitioner has not been able to produce any material on record

or even before this Court to substantiate his claim or to controvert the findings

recorded by the authorities below. Consequently finding no merit in the
