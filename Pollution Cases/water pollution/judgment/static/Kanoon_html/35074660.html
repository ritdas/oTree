This application has been filed by Mr. Z. A. Shah, learned Amicus curie who

<p id="p_8">PIL No. 159/2002
</p><p id="p_9">1.       This Public Interest Litigation was filed in the year 2002. An undated letter
was sent by Syed Tahir Iqbal Jeelani, then a class representative of the 6 th
Semester LLB Course which he appears to have been pursuing with the
University of Kashmir, Srinagar drawing the attention of the then Chief Justice
of this Court to the lack of attention being bestowed on the Dal Lake, pointing
out that environment pollution has resulted in public nuisance threatening the life
of the inhabitants of the area as well as the failure of the State to discharge their
statutory duty and public obligations to protect and preserve the lake especially
keeping in view the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment Protection Act</a> and Prevention and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Control of
Water Pollution Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_10">               Syed Tahir Iqbal Jeelani also throw the attention of the then Chief
Justice to the constitutional provision and directive principles of State pollution
in addition to international instruments laying down the responsibility of the
State.
</p><p id="p_11">2.       This PIL has engaged the attention of this Court for a period of almost 16
years. The order sheet in the case runs into 13 volumes. A cursory examination
thereof would show that the repeated agony has been expressed by the Division
Benches with regard to the failure as well as inability of the respondents to take
effective steps for discharging their constitutional statutory as well as public law
responsibilities.
</p><p id="p_12">3.       Amongst others, we find that the following issues concerning the health of
the lake have been noted in the course of proceedings: -

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               i.      Uncontrolled development of weeds in the lake suffocating
                      the same.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              ii.     Untreated sewage flowing into the lake from the
                      surrounding areas.

                      houseboats which are anchored in the lake.
              iv.     Lack of sufficient oxygen in the lake which discourages fish
                      and other organisms to survive therein.
              v.      Negative impact on account of dwellers on the lake which
                      can be addressed only by their re-settlement and
                      rehabilitation.

                      measures by the State are to be found.
              vii.    Catchment area of the Lake getting show on account of inter
                      alia,   growth    of   encroachments      and   unwarranted
                      constructions.

                      waters of the Dal Lake.

                      dredging/restoration of the depth &amp; its maintenance

</blockquote><p id="p_13">4.     Inasmuch as Mr. Z. A. Shah, learned Amicus Curiae and other learned
counsels are not available, we will consider the steps taken by the respondents on
these aspects on the next date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_14">5.     On the next date of hearing, we shall be informed as to what has been the
fate of the relocation and the rehabilitation by the State, whether persons who
have been given resettlement allotments have moved to the resettlement sites and
the State has been able to retrieve the land where from they were resettled.

<p id="p_15"> 6.      We shall be informed by the Director Fisheries and the Wildlife
Department about the fish population and other lake organisms which used to be
found in the Dal Lake when it was still healthy and as are to be found today.

which has been spent by the Central Government and the State Government on
projects relating to the Dal Lake since when the first order was passed in PIL No.
159/2002. Mr. Dar, learned Sr. AAG shall list out the projects for which the
disbursement was made; the date thereof and the amount thereof; the date of
completion of the work as per its award to an agency and the present status by the
next date of hearing.
</p><p id="p_18">9.      Court orders for the last sixteen years have been of no avail as the
respondents do not appear to have addressed any issue sufficiently to have made
any significant impact. This is despite appointment of an Expert Committee and
its recommendations. It would appear that a High Level Expert Committee is
required to monitor the steps relating to the restoration and preservation of the
Dal Lake and their completion
</p><p id="p_19">10.     The Registry shall ensure that the proper steps for maintenance of the
orders sheets are taken and they are preserved in spiral bindings.
