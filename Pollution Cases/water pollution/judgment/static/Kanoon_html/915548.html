<p id="p_1">          This petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of

Code of Criminal Procedure to quash                 Annexure-II order

and to release vehicle KL-8-AF-367 to the petitioner

on furnishing sufficient guarantee. As per Annexure-II

order  Judicial   First       Class       Magistrate,       Chalakkudy

dismissed the application for interim custody                   of the

vehicle  for the reason that vehicle can be released

only after inspection of the waste                       kept in the

vehicle by the        Pollution Control Board.                 Learned

counsel appearing for the            petitioner submitted that

in spite of the order       Pollution Control Board has not

examined   the vehicle and if the vehicle is to be

retained  as  it    now      stands,        its      value   would  be

deteriorated and      petitioner is prepared to furnish

security and   sufficient undertaking                   and therefore

vehicle may be released.

<p id="p_2">    2.     Learned Public Prosecutor                    submitted that

direction could be issued to the Pollution Control

Board to inspect the vehicle      within a period and

before the inspection vehicle may not be released.

</p><p id="p_3">          3.   On hearing the learned counsel I do not

find it proper to release the vehicle to the petitioner

as  sought  for  before  the  inspection  by  Pollution

Control Board,  as the  allegation is that he committed

offences under <a href="/doc/726894/" id="a_2">Section   24(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_3">Section 43</a> of

Water    Prevention Control of Pollution Control of

Pollution   Act.  Magistrate  has   only  stated   that

petitioner is not entitled   to get the custody before

such inspection.
</p>
<p id="p_4">          In such circumstances, petition is dismissed.

But Pollution Control Board is directed to examine the

vehicle within three weeks from today.   Petitioner is

at liberty to move the Magistrate thereafter        for

release of the vehicle.
