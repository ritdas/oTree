</pre><p id="p_1">1.           This petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

seeks a direction to the official respondents for taking effective

steps with regard to expansion of Stelco Industries Limited-

respondent No. 4 and for its re-allocation to some other alternative

site.    The primary grievance of the petitioner is that the said

industrial unit has come within the residential area, is a source of

noise and air pollution and also creating hurdle for the residents of

the area.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No. 19773 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                          2</span><p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.          Brief facts of the case are that Stelco Industries Limited-

respondent No. 4 was set up in the year 1977. At that point of time

it was located far away from the township of Rampura Phul, District

Bathinda.      However, with the growth of population several

residential colonies like Jawahar Nagar have developed in an

around the area where the respondent No. 4 industry is located. It

is pertinent to mention that the said industry manufactures 'Cold

Rolled Steel Strips'. According to the petitioner, when the industry

was set up the area was not inhabited and there was no danger to

the human beings.      But now the position has changed.       Several

residential houses have come up in the vicinity of the industrial

unit. The industry is also expanding. The petitioner has placed on

record a representation made by the Gram Panchayat of Jawahar

Nagar, dated 10.10.2008, requesting the Deputy Commissioner,

Bathinda, to interfere in the matter of expansion of Stelco

Industries-respondent No. 4 (P-1).      It has been stated that the

industry is a source of noise pollution day and night and the

persons living in the residential area are facing several problems.

The petitioner also served a legal notice dated 23.10.2008 (P-2) in

this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.          Even the Gram Panchayat and the residents of Jawahar

Nagar instituted proceedings under <a href="/doc/356470/" id="a_3">Section 133</a> IPC in the Court of

Sub Divisional Magistrate, Rampura Phul, against M/s Stelco

Industries-respondent    No.   4.    However,    the   Sub   Divisional

Magistrate, Rampura Phul, found no truth in the complaint and

dismissed the same, vide order dated 23.10.2009 (P-3). It has been

specifically observed by the SDM that other factories are also

located near Stelco Industries and, in fact, it is a private dispute.

The factory has got the pollution certificate from the Pollution

Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.            The petitioner has also alleged that the Pollution Control

Board has granted No Objection Certificate to the respondent No. 4

industry without ascertaining the true facts.         Even it has not

obtained the requisite permission for Change of Land Use (CLU)

from the Department of Town and Country Planning before applying

the clearance certificate and various consents under the statutes

dealing with Air and Water pollution.      It does not conform to the

terms and conditions imposed for establishment of new industries

and enlargement of old industries, which have been placed on

record (P-4).       According to the petitioner, Stelco Industries-

respondent No. 4 is undergoing expansion by forcibly taking the

lands of small farmers or whose land adjoins the existing factory,

therefore, effective steps are required to be initiated for its re-

allocation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.            On 25.3.2011, a detailed written statement was filed on

behalf of the Punjab Pollution Control Board-respondent No. 5 (for

brevity, 'the Board'). In the preliminary submissions it has been

asserted that on 6.10.1995, Stelco Industries Limited-respondent

No. 4 was granted No Objection Certificate for the establishment of

an industrial plan for production of 10 TPD of Cold Rolled Steel Trips

(R-5/A).      It was also granted consents to operate under the

provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for

brevity, '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a>' and '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>' respectively), which were valid up

to 31.5.2011. Various documents have also been placed on record

showing that the Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4

conforms to the standards laid down by the Board. It has further

been pointed out that on receipt of a complaint from the residents

of the area, a show cause notice dated 15.9.2009 was issued to

Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4.          On 30.9.2009, after

granting personal hearing to the Director of respondent No. 4, the

Board took the following decisions:
</p>

                 Ministry of Environment and Forests."

</blockquote><p id="p_7">6.         In compliance to the above decisions, an affidavit was

filed by Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 that no industrial

activity would be carried out in the newly constructed shed without

the prior written permission of the Board.          On 4.11.2009, the

Environmental Engineer also reported that the said industry has

completely dismantled its cage type acid pickling section.         The

District Town Planner, Bathinda, was also requested to intimate the

land use of the area in which the industry is located. On 10.2.2010,

the District Town Planner, Bathinda, informed that Stelco Industries

Limited-respondent No. 4 is comprised in 45 Kanals and 9 Marlas of

land.   Some part of it, as per the proposed non-statutory master

plan of Rampura Phul, falls under industrial spot zone and some

part under residential zone and the remaining falls under proposed

road sector.

<p id="p_8">7.         The Board in its written statement further disclosed that

on 1.11.2010, Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CWP No. 19773 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                        6</span>



applied for obtaining varied consents under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air

Act</a> for the production of cold rolled and hard tempered steel strips

@ 24,000 MTA (66 TPD). After examining the matter it was felt that

the said industry needs 'NOC' from the Board for regularisation of

its installed/actual production capacity along with varied consents

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>. For this purpose 15 days time was

granted to it to proceed further in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.         On 25.1.2011, the Environmental Engineer of the Board

submitted his report to the effect that Stelco Industries Limited-

respondent No. 4 has not applied for obtaining 'NOC' from the

Board for regularisation of its installed/actual production capacity

along with certificate from competent authority regarding the

suitability of site and proposal to install proper effluent treatment

plant to treat the effluent generated from floor washing and spent

cutting oil as well as development of land with plantation for

disposal of its trade and domestic effluent in proper manner.

Accordingly, the applications of the industry for varied consents

under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a> were returned in

original vide letter dated 21.12.2010 with the remarks to re-submit

the same after attending to the said observations. It has also been

found that the industry has increased its power load as well as

production capacity without obtaining the prior sanction from the

Board. Other than this, on 22.1.2011, the premises of the Stelco

Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 was again inspected by the

officers of the Board and following shortcomings were noticed:

                the approval of the Board).

                manufacture cold rolled and hard tempered steel

                strips. Later on, the industry applied for varied

                consents for installed capacity of 66 TPD (24,000

                TPA) and as such the applications were returned to

                the industry vide letter No. 4048 dated 21.12.2010.

                and have been replaced with 5 no. oil fired

                annealing furnaces of capacity 40 ton each.     One

                DG set of 800 KVA capacity has been added. The

                entire expansion in the premises of the industrial

<p id="p_10">9.         In view of the above violations of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air

Act</a>, a show cause notice was issued to Stelco Industries Limited-

respondent No. 4. On 25.2.2011, the Director of the said industry

appeared before the Member Secretary of the Board and submitted

that they would install adequate pollution control devices and also

took effective steps for proper disposal of treated effluent on to the

land for plantation, within three weeks. He further assured that the

industry would also obtain CLU from the Department of Town and

Country Planning within three weeks. Keeping in view the above

assurances, the Member Secretary of the Board took the following

conscious decisions:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">10.        Despite noticing the above shortcomings and lapses on

the part of Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4, still an

objection has been raised with regard to the maintainability of the

writ petition by the petitioner. Dismissal of the petition has been

sought by averring that adequate steps have already been taken by

the Board against Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 and in

case it fails to comply with the decisions already taken, appropriate

further action would be taken against it.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.        A reply by way of affidavit of Additional Secretary to the

Government of Punjab, Department of Industries and Commerce,

dated 8.7.2011, has also been filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1

and 2, wherein it has been submitted that at the time when the

Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 and other factories were

established there was no residential area in existence. It has been

asserted that though there are several factories located in the area

but the petitioner has targeted only Stelco Industries Limited-

respondent No. 4.     Therefore, it seems that there is a private

dispute between the petitioner and Stelco Industries Limited-

respondent No. 4. The said industry has already got the NOC from

the Board. No cause of action to file the instant petition has arisen
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> CWP No. 19773 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                        10</span>



and the same deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.        In the reply filed by Stelco Industries Limited-respondent

No. 4 at the outset it has been urged that the instant petition has

been filed by the petitioner to settle his personal scores.    It has

been pointed out that the brothers of the petitioner had sold their

land to Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 and the

petitioner is attempting to extort and compel the company to pay

an exorbitant price for sale of the land owned by him. However, it

is not interested in the purchase of petitioner's land.    Thus, the

present petition is a subtle devise and has been filed with a view to

settle personal vendetta. It has been disclosed that the industry is

being run after obtaining the requisite permissions from the Board

and it is not causing any pollution as alleged.    Various sanctions

from the appropriate authorities have already been obtained.        In

that regard various varied consents granted by the Board have

been placed on record (R-4/1).
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.        The Board has also filed a status report by way of

affidavit dated 13.7.2011, bringing on record the events which have

taken place after filing of its written statement. It has been pointed

out that Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 applied for

varied consents to operate under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Act</a>

and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Air Act</a> and for increased capacity to manufacture cold

rolled/hardened tempered steel strips @ 60 TPD along with the

requisite documents and CLU for additional land of 24 Kanals 0

Marlas, issued by the Chief Town Planner, Chandigarh, vide Memo.

No. 2559, dated 5.4.2011 (R-5/F). On 11.4.2011, the District Town

Planner, Bathinda, also informed the Board that as per the site plan

of Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4, total land area of the

industry is 45 Kanals 19 Marlas out of which the CLU for 24 Kanals

has already been granted and the remaining 21 Kanals 19 Marlas

falls in the industrial spot zone as per the non-statutory master plan

of Rampura Phul Town (R-5/G).      On 16.4.2011, the industry was

again inspected and it was found that it was complying with the

provisions of Pollution Control Laws.      Accordingly, consents to

operate under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a> have been granted to it

uptil 9.11.2011, subject to the terms and conditions mentioned in

the sanction (R-5/I).   Thereafter, on 22.6.2011 the officers of the

Board went to the premises of the industry to collected samples of

air emissions and waste water. However, samples of waste water

could not be collected because the industry has not generated any

effluent from the washing and spent cutting oil processes.        The

Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) installed by the industry has been

found to be in proper condition.     The analysis report of the air

emission sample collected from the stack of annealing furnace

revealed that the pollutants were within the prescribed limits

(R-5/J).

<p id="p_15">14.        We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length

and perused the paper book with their able assistance.        From a

threadbare scrutiny of various documents and factual position

placed on record it is evident that a number of shortcomings were

noticed by the Board in the functioning of the Stelco Industries

Limited-respondent No. 4 after receipt of complaint from the

residents of the area.    Acting promptly on the complaint, show

cause notices were issued to it and after compliance with the

principles of natural justice several restrictions were imposed by

the Board, which have already been noticed in the preceding paras.

The industry was also inspected by the officers of the Board time

and again and directions were issued to comply with the norms

prescribed by the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_22">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_23">Air Act</a> and other Pollution Control

Board, have already obtained varied consent under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">Water Act</a>

and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_25">Air Act</a> and also obtained CLU from the District Town Planner.

As per the status report dated 13.7.2011, the said industry is found

to have completed all the formalities.           It has been specifically

stated that the air emission are within the prescribed limits. The

industry has also installed Effluent Treatment Plant. In nut shell, all

the prescribed norms are being complied with by the Stelco

Industries Limited-respondent No. 4.

<p id="p_16">15.        It needs to be highlighted here that in the recent past,

there is a flood of petitions filed in this Court, which are styled as

Public Interest Litigation where the petitioner(s) do not disclose

their credentials.   In such cases it has been found that there is

direct or indirect personal motive or interest of the petitioner is

always involved. However, when this Court took cognisance of the

matter, nothing concrete comes to the surface in most of the cases.

It is well settled that under the garb of filing a petition in larger

public   interest,   an   individual    cannot   ventilate   his   personal

grievances, especially without disclosing the same.            It is sheer

misuse of the process of law.          If anyone is affected adversely or

individually then the course is open to file a petition without

invoking the support of Public Interest Litigation.       This tendency,

thus, needs to be discouraged for launching a litigation which

involves private interest. In the present case, the Stelco Industries

Limited-respondent No. 4 has raised a specific objection that the

petitioner wants to settle his personal interest by filing the instant

petition. The same has not been controverted by the petitioner by

filing any additional affidavit or replication. We are of the view that

there is substance in the above objection because it has also come

on record that there are several other industries also located in the

area but the petitioner has chosen to target only the Stelco

Industries Limited-respondent No. 4. The motive is obvious.            As

already noticed above, his brothers have already sold their land to

Stelco Industries Limited-respondent No. 4 and he is attempting to

compel the said company to pay an exorbitant price for sale of his

land. On the other hand, the Stelco Industries Limited-respondent

No. 4 is not interested in purchasing his land.

<p id="p_17">16.        This Court has already framed the Rules, namely,

'Maintainability of Public Interest Litigation Rules, 2010' (for brevity,

'the 2010 Rules').    Rule 6 of the 2010 Rules defines the main

categories under which a Public Interest Litigation ('PIL') could be

entertained.     It   also   includes   the   petitions   pertaining   to

environmental pollution, disturbance of ecological balance, forest

and wild life. Maintainability of a 'PIL' is governed by Rule 2, which

reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">           "2.   No Public Interest Litigation shall be entertained by

           the Registry unless the petitioner(s) has specifically

           disclosed his credentials and his direct or indirect
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> CWP No. 19773 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                         14</span>



           personal motive or interest involved in the case, if any,

           by way of an affidavit."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">17.        From a bare perusal of Rule 2 of the 2010 Rules it is

evident that an affidavit is required to be filed by the petitioner

filing a writ petition as 'PIL' specifically disclosing his credentials

and direct or indirect personal motive or interest involved in the

case. However, no such affidavit has been filed by the petitioner in

the present case.    Accordingly, we find no merit in the instant

petition and the same deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">18.        For the reasons stated above, this petition fails and the

same is accordingly dismissed. However, the Registry is directed to

insist compliance of Rule 2 of the 2010 Rules whenever any petition

falling under any of the categories prescribed by Rule 6 of the 2010

Rules is filed in this Court. Necessary steps in that regard be taken

by the Registrar Judicial by issuing a circular/notice in the daily

cause list for the information of the Members of the Bar and also

putting the same on the High Court website.
