</pre><p id="p_1">(Judgment delivered by the bench)

PRELUDE

      Initially, an appeal was filed under Section 11 of the NEAA Act before the
      National Environment Appellate Authority, New Delhi, aggrieved by the grant
      of Environment Clearance for the installation of Steel Melting Shop with a
      capacity of 97,000 TPA and CFBC-based 65 MW Power Plant at village
      Gerwani, District Raigarh by M/s Salasar Steel &amp; Power Ltd (SSPL) through
      letter No. SEIAA-CG/EC/BPP/RGH/15 dated 21.07.2010 by State Level
      Environment Impact Assessment Authority (for short SEIAA) of the State of
      Chhattisgarh, and the same was numbered as Appeal No. 24/2010. On repeal
      of the NEAA Act and disbanding the National Environment Appellate Authority
      with effect from 18.10.2010, the appeal stood transferred to this Tribunal
      under Section 38 (5) of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 and the same is
      numbered as Appeal No. 20/2011 (NGT).
</p>
<p id="p_2">PRIMARY OBJECTIONS

</p><p id="p_3">   2. The learned counsel for the respondent project proponent, at the outset,
      strenuously contended that the very appeal filed before the NEAA under
      Section 11 of NEAA Act itself was not proper and maintainable in law. The
      said appeal was filed without filing the impugned order dated 21.07.2010.
      According to him, no appeal could have been filed without there being an
      order which is supposed to be under challenge. How the grounds were
      raised in the appeal without looking into the impugned order is not known.
      This practice is unknown to law and liable to be deprecated. Even after
      transfer of the appeal to this Tribunal it was not made in proper format. The
      grounds which were not raised in that appeal have been raised in the present
      additional affidavit, which is not permissible as per the procedure established
      under law. It is strange that some of the papers / documents are placed
      before the Tribunal off-hand which are not certified and/or not authenticated.
      Such documents should never be received and relied upon. Such a practice
      causes hardship to the other side and becomes difficult to be answered
      properly. Merely because the appellant has come up with an environmental
      issue, the fundamental jurisprudential principles of civil law cannot be ignored.
      Though Civil Procedure Code is not strictly applicable under the NGT Act the
      fundamental principles cannot be avoided to be applied for the detriment of
      fair submission of pleadings and evidence. There appears to be some truth in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                            Page 2 of 13</span>
      the submission made by the learned counsel for the respondent-but no
     substantial irregularity has been brought to our notice requiring rejection of
     the appeal on the ground of maintainability since procedure was not followed.
     No documentary evidence which is not authenticated or which is disputed and
     proved to be fake can be relied upon by this Tribunal. The fundamental
     jurisprudential aspects such as pleadings and evidence are always taken care
     of by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">FACTS

</p><p id="p_5">  3. According to the appellant, he is working in the field of environment and has
     been involved in raising issues relating to environment. He also asserted that
     he lives near the project area and his residence is within 10 km of the project
     area. He had participated in the public hearing (for short PH) conducted on
     29.11.2009 and raised issues concerning environment and they were not
     considered by the SEIAA. Initially, when the appeal was filed before the
     NEAA, the copy of the EC dated 21.07.2010 was not available; therefore,
     detailed grounds could not be raised. However, now in the additional affidavit
     filed, the proper grounds could be raised. According to the appellant the
     Environment Impact Assessment (for short EIA) report was not in accordance
     with the Terms of Reference (for short ToR) prescribed by SEIAA. The PH
     was not properly published and the same was not conducted in a transparent
     manner. The Member Secretary of SPCB delegated the responsibility to
     conduct the PH to his subordinate which is not in accordance with law.
     Measures were not taken to disseminate information about the project before
     the PH by the SEIAA and local authorities. The Chhattisgarh Environmental
     Conservation Board (CECB) failed to ensure that adequate information was
     provided about the project before the PH. The CECB does not have
     jurisdiction to conduct PH. The draft EIA Report prepared by the consultant of
     the project proponent was not in tune with the ToR. A lot of information was
     concealed by the respondent No. 2. The Cumulative Impact of several Steel
     and Power Plants on ground water has not been considered. Apart from that,
     the project proponent is operating its existing unit in complete disregard to
     laws since 2001. Thus, the EC granted in favour of respondent No. 2 is in
     utter violation of the law and the environment in particular. Therefore, the EC
     under challenge is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_6">  4. Whereas, the respondent No. 2 filed a detailed reply denying the allegations
     made by the appellant as baseless and without any substance. It is stated
     that the project under challenge is only proposed expansion of the existing
     unit within the existing plant and premises. No additional land would be
     acquired for the proposed expansion project. The existing green belt would
     not be disturbed for expansion of the project. The total land for existing and
     the proposed expansion would be 68 acres. Nearest habitation is at a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                         Page 3 of 13</span>
    distance of 1.0 km from the plant. There are no National Parks, Wild Life
   Sanctuaries, Eco-sensitive Zones, Elephant/Tiger reserves, migratory routes
   and Bird Sanctuaries within a 10 km radius. No rehabilitation and resettlement
   is involved. Nearest river is Kelo river flowing at a distance of 3.0 km from the
   plant. No forest land is involved. The Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion
   (CFBC) technology would be used for power generation. EC granting
   authority also had added several precautionary measures to be adopted by
   the project proponent under the direct supervision of the implementing
   authorities. The PH was conducted after taking all the steps as required by
   the EIA Notification, 2006. Absolutely there is no illegality or irregularity in
   granting the EC nor there any environmental and ecological threat in view of
   establishing the expansion project. The entire allegations made are based on
   mere conjectures and imagination. Not having a good case on merits, the
   appellant is trying to raise false and frivolous issues which are beyond the
   scope of these proceedings and trying to mislead this Hon'ble Tribunal.
   Absolutely no grounds are made out calling for interference of this Tribunal
   and the appeal is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 adopted the
   arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 and the
   learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 stated that the PH was conducted
   strictly in accordance with the prescribed procedure under the EIA
   Notification, 2006. It is their case that all the allegations made by the
   appellant are imaginary and blown out of proportion.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6. The learned counsel on either side advanced arguments and furnished
   written submissions. We have given our earnest consideration to the
   respective submissions made by the learned counsel on either side and
   perused the material made available on record. The following points arise for
   consideration in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">   1. Whether the PH was properly conducted following the procedure as
      prescribed by EIA Notification, 2006

</p><p id="p_10">   2. Whether EIA report was in accordance with the ToR prescribed

</p><p id="p_11">   3. Whether the authority granting EC ought to have called for a
      Cumulative Impact Study of the several Steel &amp; Power plants on the
      ground water

</p><p id="p_12">   4. Whether there is any serious environmental lapses committed by the
      project proponent in relation to the existing unit which would result
      in environmental threat.
</p>

<p id="p_13">    7. Point No. 1:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          Whether the PH was properly conducted by following the procedure
          as prescribed by EIA Notification, 2006

        The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the PH held on
29.11.2009 was not systematic, time bound, transparent and there was no widest
public participation, as required by law. Except publishing the fact as to conducting of
PH no further steps were taken as required under EIA Notification of 2006. It was the
responsibility of the Member Secretary of the concerned SPCB to finalize the date,
time and exact venue for conducting PH, within seven days from the date of receipt
of draft EIA report from the project proponent and to advertise the same in the daily
newspapers. A minimum notice of 30 days shall be provided for the public to furnish
their responses. Instead of conducting the PH all by himself, the Member Secretary,
CECB delegated the power to conduct PH to the Regional Officer at Raigarh and
further the Regional Officer involved the District Collector in the process which is
illegal and contrary to EIA Notification, 2006. No measures were taken to
disseminate information about the project before the PH was conducted. Neither the
EIA report nor the summary thereof with regard to the proposed project was
available on website of Chhattisgarh SEIAA. No adequate information was provided
about the project before the public consultation was conducted. The summary of EIA
report which was available on the website did not comply with the requirement of EIA
Notification, 2006. The CECB does not have jurisdiction to conduct the PH.
</blockquote><p id="p_14">Nonetheless, the CECB failed to hold PH within the stipulated time of 45 days and if
no PH is conducted within 45 days it is for the State Government to engage any
other authority for conducting PH. The summary of the PH was not provided at the
end of the PH in the vernacular language.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        Whereas, according to the learned counsel for the respondent No. 2, the
project proponent, the appellant does not reside near the project site or within 10 km
radius thereof. He resides at a distance of more than 17 km from the proposed
project site and participated in the PH and raised objections. In the PH conducted on
29.11.2009 around 1,200 people participated out of which about 846 voiced their
opinion on the project. The opinion of all the people were duly recorded by the
competent authority. The representatives of the respondent No. 2 duly explained and
clarified their position on all the relevant aspects to the satisfaction of all concerned.
Wherever it was felt necessary remedial measures were taken. All relevant and
material opinions of all the participants including that of appellant were duly
considered and addressed by the respondent No. 2, as well as by the SEIAA and
SEAC. All documents which are required to be made available for the public at large,
at different stages, were also made available. The appellant had access to all the
relevant documents at all times.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                              Page 5 of 13</span>
<p id="p_16">      On perusal of the material it came to light that the PH was conducted in a fair
and transparent manner. The CECB is the appropriate authority to conduct PH and
the general rules speak of conducting of the PH in the presence of the District
Collector or his nominee. Therefore, it cannot be said that the entrustment of the PH
to the District Collector is either illegal or without jurisdiction. The Draft EIA Report
was very much available on the website of CECB of Chhattisgarh even before the
PH was taken up on 29.11.2009. It is an admitted fact that wide publicity was given
in the local newspapers. As many as 1200 people participated and about 840 people
raised their objections etc., and the same has been recorded and at the end of the
PH the project proponent gave reply considering the objections raised by the people.
Finally, the summary of the proceedings was read over in the local language. Simply
because the PH was not conducted within 45 days from the date of receipt of the
draft EIA, the PH cannot be said to be vitiated. If for any reason the CECB was not
able to conduct the PH, probably it was for the government to entrust conducting of
PH to a different agency.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      Under these circumstances we are of the opinion that there is no irregularity or
illegality in conducting the PH. In fact, while considering the legality or otherwise of
the conduct of Public Hearing the material which was placed on the website as a
draft EIA alone can be looked into. May be the project proponent is supposed to
prepare the draft EIA in consonance with the ToR awarded. If there is any deviation
in the preparation of draft EIA and concealment of some information which might
result in the environmental and ecological threat the matter must be viewed seriously
by the MoEF and the project proponent as well as the consultant shall be punished
suitably. Unfortunately there is no mechanism evolved to check as to whether the
draft EIA is strictly in consonance with the ToR awarded which gives scope to the
project proponent/ his EIA consultant to conceal certain information or furnishing
incomplete information which fact was not within the reach of public before the Public
Hearing could be conducted. Therefore, merely because the draft EIA was not in
consonance with the ToR, the Public Hearing conducted cannot be faulted with.

<p id="p_18">   8. Point No. 2:
</p>
<p id="p_19">          Whether EIA report was in accordance with the ToR prescribed

       According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the EIA report of the
project is not as per the ToR issued vide its letter dated 29.08.2008, by the
respondent No. 1. The final rapid EIA report submitted by the respondent No. 2 does
not meet the requirements set forth in the ToR in several respects. The following are
some of the discrepancies observed in the REIA.

<p id="p_31">        The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that when such important
information was not available to the public, it was difficult for the people to participate
effectively in the PH process. Further, there is no provision under the EIA Notification
2006 as to publication of the final EIA report, which is causing difficulty in knowing
the changes that are made in the final EIA. There shall not be much difference
between a draft EIA and final EIA report, except adding something which is
necessary for furthering the environmental and ecological interest. Therefore, the
very study conducted is contrary to the EIA Notification, 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_32">        Whereas, the learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 submitted that the
appellant either in the original appeal filed before NEAA or in the additional affidavit
or rejoinder raised any plea that there is discrepancy in the final EIA report and ToR.
In fact, the entire ToR were addressed and adhered to in the final EIA report. In fact,
there is no law which says that the final EIA shall be published and made known to
the public. However, there is no discrepancy in the ToR and final EIA report. The
allegation of discrepancy is totally false and misplaced. The appellant is deliberately
misleading this Tribunal by providing incomplete and factually incorrect data. The
required contour map and plant layout form part of the Final EIA report and the same
was filed as Annexure VI.
</p>
<p id="p_33">        The Final EIA report provides the representative chemical analysis of SMS
Slag which clearly shows that the same is not Hazardous or Toxic. The SEIAA after
carrying out due diligence, has noted that this is true for the numerous SMS projects
installed in the region and accorded sanction correctly in the matter. In fact, the
respondent, as a precaution has itself mentioned in the Final EIA that the TCLP test
would still be done once the SMS is operational to re-confirm the fact that the slag so
generated is Non-toxic in nature. This can be seen at page 461 of the document filed
by the respondent.

<p id="p_34">       The fugitive emissions have been recognized as an important aspect in the
EIA study. All the proposed measures for control of fugitive emissions such as dust
extraction system with bag filters, covering of conveyers, etc., have also therefore
been detailed in the Final EIA report. The Industrial Source Compex Short Term
1993 (ISCST-3). Dispersion Model developed by the USEPA measures dispersion of

 incremental Ground Level Concentrations due to both point sources of emissions
and for non-point sources of emissions such as area sources (fugitive emissions
from sources such as storage piles and slag dumps). It is normal practice to assume
the impacts of fugitive emissions at a particular level along with expected impacts
from other upcoming plants and their expansion.
</p>
<p id="p_35">        In the EIA report also the point and area sources (fugitive emissions) have
been indicated for prediction of incremental Ground Level Concentrations (GLC) due
to the proposed expansion. The incremental GLC of particulate matter without area
source would have been only 0.2 µg/m3 , whereas because of the consideration of
fugitive emissions, the incremental increase is coming up to 0.5 µg/m 3 as depicted in
the report. It is thus totally baseless and factually incorrect to suggest that fugitive
emissions have not been considered in the study. Various fugitive emission control
measures such as dust suppression system, dust extraction system with bag filters
etc., have been proposed and the details have been furnished in the Final EIA
Report. For storage, it is detailed that a pucca platform above ground level will be
provided.
</p>
<p id="p_36">       In the so called google imagery which brings out the two areas of the location
is actually areas which have been filled with AFBC Bed Material. AFBC Bed material
is a heavy material which is preferred for filling in top layers as it arrests fugitive dust
emission and provides stable and firm strata. It is white in colour and this is being
incorrectly pointed out as "waste material such as Fly Ash or Slag".
</p>
<p id="p_37">       After perusal of the above submissions and on verification of the original
records placed before us, we are satisfied that though there are some discrepancies
in the draft EIA report when compared to ToR, all the deficiencies pointed out have
been adequately addressed and included with data support in the final EIA report.
Thus, the allegation that contour map with the plant site is not shown, plant
coordinates not properly marked, TCLP test results are lacking in the EIA report,
impact of raw materials, fuel, solid wastes are not given, generation of fugitive
emission is not properly projected, storage yards are not delineated properly etc., are
baseless and deserves to be rejected. No substantial irregularities were brought to
our notice to hold that the EIA report was not in accordance with law or the same
conceals any potential environmental threat, due to the implementation of the
project.

        Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that as many as 23 Sponge Iron,
Integrated Steel and Power Plants are engaged in exploiting ground water to meet
their water requirement for industrial purpose without valid consent/permission from
the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) or Chhattisgarh Water Resources
Department (CGWRD) which has led to severe depletion of ground water and
Raigarh District is facing severe water crisis. The report prepared and submitted by a
five member committee to the District Collector also speaks to this effect. Raigarh is
the second largest centre of Sponge Iron production having 23 units with a daily
production of 10,050 MT and most of the units are located in the Taraimal Industrial
Area. In a survey carried out by the Central Pollution Control Board, Zonal office
Bhopal it has been observed that the ambient air quality values and fugitive
emissions in the area are higher than the standards in the industrial areas which is
causing severe air pollution in Raigarh District.</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">       Whereas, it is the contention of the learned counsel for respondent No. 2 that
this question is out of context and misconceived as only surface water is proposed to
be used for the expansion. Accordingly, the respondent No. 2 proposed to meet its
water requirement of the project from the Gerwani Nala by constructing an anicut at
a distance of 7 km from the project site. As such there is no ground water extraction
proposed and thus conducting a Cumulative Study in this regard does not arise. The
ambient air quality values and fugitive emission have no relevance for the purpose of
resolving the present issue. The learned counsel further indicated that the 3.8 km
distance maintained for establishing monitoring station is only as
precautionary/conservative measure.
</p>
<p id="p_40">       At the outset, we may notice that there is no plea for conducting cumulative
impact study on air pollution and other environmental parameters. The only
cumulative study sought for is the exploitation of ground water by the cluster of
industries located in and around the proposed project. It is unfortunate that such an
issue without any basis has been raised. Firstly, there is no proposal for drawl of
ground water. The proponent categorically stated that the surface water alone will be
used drawing from the Gerwani Nala by constructing an anicut, that too at a distance
of 7 km from the project site. Practically there was no reply to this by the appellant.
Therefore, we are of the opinion that there was no necessity for conducting a
cumulative study with regard to the usage of ground water. We are in full agreement
with the submission made by respondent that this issue is irrelevant and
misconceived.

         According to the learned counsel for the appellant M/s SSPL is operating its
existing sponge iron plant in complete disregard of laws since year 2001. The CECB
had issued warning many times for not installing and/or not ensuring proper
functioning of pollution control equipment which is causing severe irrecoverable loss
to environment and has become a major threat to health and livelihood of people.
</blockquote><p id="p_42">CECB has filed cases in the court of CJM Raigarh, against the company and other
industries in close vicinity against violations of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Sections 44-47</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Section 37-40</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981. Given the number of plants in close
vicinity of the Project which are not complying with various environmental legal
provisions, the environmental impact of these plants is very high. Furthermore, this is
a reflection of the inability of CECB to actually control pollution from these plants.
Permitting yet another plant in the same area would drastically worsen the situation.
The CECB had issued warning letters to the project proponent herein, showing
violation of environmental laws by the company.
</p>
<p id="p_43">       Whereas, learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 submitted that there is
neither violation of any environmental laws nor any warning under the environmental
law has been issued in relation to the proposed project or for that matter any case is
pending in relation to the proposed project in question. The purported violations
mentioned do not have any bearing on the present proposed project. Even according
to the appellant they are violations attributable to the existing unit. In fact, against the
existing unit also there are no allegations of substantial nature requiring
consideration by this Tribunal. The whole issue is baseless and misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_44">        So far as this issue is concerned it is in a way irrelevant for the purpose of this
appeal. However, the reply filed by the CECB reveals that a case was registered
against the project proponent along with others in relation to the existing unit in the
year 2005 and the same is pending. It appears the said case was booked for
operating the unit, without the consent to operate and not putting up adequate air
pollution control equipment. However, it is admitted in the reply filed by the CECB
that all the Sponge Iron Plants located in the area including the project proponent
herein have installed adequate air pollution control equipment and bad filters for
control of air pollution in the existing unit. Therefore, firstly the allegation has no
relevance and secondly it does not relate to the proposed expansion. Even
according to the CECB there is no pollution caused by the existing unit, beyond the
norms fixed. It appears the appellant is trying to blow the issue out of proportion.

and the project proponent in the preparation of the draft EIA and final EIA reports.
Therefore we are of the considered opinion that unless and until the MoEF (the rule

may not improve

         again evaluate the same as to whether the same is in tune with the ToR
         and the proceedings of the PH. The MoEF may also take care that there
         may not be drastic variation between the draft and the final EIA except for
         certain intrinsic technical and/or scientific information relatable to the
         project.

<p id="p_51">      5. The MoEF may consider displaying the final EIA in public domain before
         the grant of EC - this may enable in making representations before the
         EAC in a given case.
</p>
<p id="p_52">Since, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, is not a party
