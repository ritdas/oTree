PER PAWAN SINGH, JUDICIAL MEMBER;

</pre><p id="p_4">1. This group of six appeals by assessee under <a href="/doc/1115780/" id="a_1">Section 253</a> of Income-tax Act

   are directed against the order of ld. CIT(A)-1, Thane dated 23.11.2016 for

   Assessment Years 2005-06 to 2010-11. In all appeal, the assessee has raised

   some common grounds of appeal, the ld. CIT(A) passed the consolidated

   order for all years, therefore, all appeals were clubbed, heard together and

   are decided by a consolidated order. In appeal for Assessment Year 2005-

   06, the assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       1) The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-l Thane (CIT(A)) has erred in
       law and on facts by holding that the assessment for A.Y.2005-06 has been
       validly reopened in accordance with law.

       r.w.s. 147 of the Act dated 28th January, 2013 is bad in law and void ab-initio
       on the following amongst other grounds which are without prejudice to one
       another:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          a) the assessment proceedings are bad in law as no Income chargeable to tax
          has escaped assessment.

          assessee has disclosed fully and truly all material facts necessary for
          assessment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">          c) the impugned Order has been passed on the basis of change of opinion.

          reasons for reopening assessment has not been passed.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       3) The CIT(A) has grossly erred in law and on facts by confirming the
       disallowance of deduction of Rs.9,65,613/- u/s.80IB(4) of the Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       The CIT(A) ought to have held that the assessee is entitled to deduction of Rs.
       9,65,613/- u/s. 80IB(4) of the Act.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">2. Brief facts of the case are that the assessing officer, while completing the

   assessment for Assessment Year 2009-10 under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">section 143(3)</a> on

   29.12.2011, disallowed deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">section 80IB(4)</a>. The assessing

   officer while disallowing deduction of 80 IB(10) hold that the assessee

   have shown the purchases of machinery on 28.03.2004 from Jhajjar

   Haryana and it was and that the assessee shown its production before

   31.03.2004 and that it was not humanly probable to start production within

   three days.    Therefore, the assessee failed to complete the conditions

   prescribed in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_4">section 80IB(4)</a> i.e. undertaking should be manufacturing

   undertaking and it should have started its manufacturing activities on or

   before 31.03.2004. The Assessing Officer in this backdrop took the view

   that there was escapement of income for the year under consideration (for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>
                              ITA No. 1489 to 1494 Mum 2017-Shri Krishnakumar Vijayashankar Dubey




AY 2005-06) within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1837761/" id="a_5">section 147</a> of the Act. Accordingly,

notice under <a href="/doc/1888237/" id="a_6">section 148</a> dated 30.03.2012 was issued to the assessee. The

assessee vide reply dated 25.04.2012 dated 29.12.2010 challenged the

validity of re-opening. In the reply, the assessee contended that the

assessment was re-opened after four year from the end of Assessment Year.

The assessment cannot be re-opened unless the assessee has failed to

disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment. It was

contended that assessee disclosed all the material facts fully and truly while

filing return of income. The assessee also mentioned that the reasons

recorded for re-opening does not mention anything about such failure on the

part of assessee. Thus, the assessee claimed that notice under <a href="/doc/1888237/" id="a_7">section 148</a> is

bad-in-law and void ab-initio. The contention of assessee was not accepted

by Assessing Officer. The Assessing Officer concluded that the claim of

deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">section 80IB(4)</a> by assessee is not allowable. The assessee

failed to start the business activities before March 2004. Therefore, the

assessee violated the condition laid down in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">section 80IB(4)</a>. The

manufacturing before March 2004 is the basic condition for claiming

deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">section 80IB(4)</a> and failure to fulfil the basic condition for

deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_11">section 80IB(4)</a> is clearly mentioned in the reasons

recorded. The satisfaction of Assessing Officer is based on the finding in the

assessment proceeding for Assessment Year 2009-10. Therefore, it is not a

case of change of opinion.

</p><p id="p_8">3. The Assessing Officer proceeded to make the re-assessment and disallowed

   deduction under section 80IB(4) of Rs. 9,65,613/- vide assessment order

   dated 28.01.2013 passed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">section 143(3)</a> r.w.s 147 of the Act. On

   appeal before the ld. CIT(A), the action of Assessing Officer for re-opening

   and making disallowance under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">section 80IB(4)</a> was confirmed. Thus,

   further aggrieved by the order of ld. CIT(A), the assessee has filed the

   present appeal before us.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4. We have heard the submission of ld. Authorized Representative (AR) of the

   assessee and ld. Departmental Representative (DR) for the Revenue and

   perused the material available on record. Ground No.1 &amp; 2 relates to the

   validly of re-opening not in accordance with law. The ld. AR of the assessee

   submits that the assessment was re-opened after four years from the end of

   relevant Assessment Year. No new material found for re-opening the

   completed assessment. The assessee made full disclosure at the time of

   original assessment. The notice under <a href="/doc/1888237/" id="a_14">section 148</a> dated 30.03.2012 was

   served after four years from the end of assessment year. No fresh material

   was alleged by the Assessing Officer nor allegation that assessee filed false

   statement during the original assessment. At the time of passing the

   assessment order for Assessment Year 2009-10 under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_15">section 143(3)</a> on

   29.12.2011, the Assessing Officer noted "as a common sense it is humanly

   improbable to establish a manufacturing unit and sale the finished goods

   within span of three days". Thus, no valid reasons were recorded before

   making re-opening.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5. The ld. AR of the assessee further submits that Assessing Officer has not

   disposed off of the assessee's objection. The objection were disposed off

   only at the time of passing the assessment order under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_16">section 143(3)</a> r.w.s

   147 on 28.01.2013, which is against the law settled by Hon'ble Apex Court

   in GKN Driveshafts (259 ITR 19), in decision by jurisdictional High Court

   in Asian Paints (296 ITR 90) and KSS Petron Pvt. Ld. (ITA No. 224/2014),

   Kelvinator India (320 ITR 561(<a href="/doc/1010315/" id="a_17">SC) and Hindustan Lever vs. R. B. Wadkar</a>

   (268 ITR 332 (Bom. HC), Karnataka High Court in Dulraj U Jain Vs ACIT

   (ITA No. 1641of 2018).
</p>
<p id="p_11">6. On the other hand, the ld. DR for the Revenue supported the order of

   authorities below. The ld. DR for the Revenue further submits that objection

   of the assessee was disposed of as per the order of assessment and the

   assessee was aware about the disposal of objection.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7. In the rejoinder submission, the ld. AR of the assessee insisted that the

   Assessing Officer never communicated the assessee about the disposal of

   objection which is mandatory on the part of Assessing Officer as per the

   decision of jurisdictional High Court in Asian Paints (supra) since in

   separate order was passed in disposing of objection. Therefore, the

   subsequent action of Assessing Officer is void ab-initio. The ld AR further

   submits that even during the first appellate stage the assessee demanded the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                        6</span>

   copy of the order disposing of the objection, which was not made available

   to the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8. On the considering the contention of both the parties, we directed the ld. DR

   to call the assessment record. On our direction assessment record for

   Assessment Year 2005-06 to 2008-09 was brought . The record was perused

   in the presence of ld. DR for the Revenue and ld. AR of the assessee. On

   perusal of original record, the ld. DR for the Revenue submits that there is

   no separate order available on record disposing the objection nor there is

   any reference in the order sheet that the objections raised by the assessee

   was disposed off by assessing officer. The ld. DR was directed to place on

   record the copy of order-sheet of assessment record, the ld. DR placed on

   record the copy of order-sheet. The perusal of order-sheet reveals that there

   is no reference about the disposal of objection. The assessee was also

   directed to furnish the return of income for Assessment Year 2004-05

   together with the copy of statement of income to ascertain, if the assessee

   has shown in its statement of income about the starting of manufacturing

   activities. The ld. AR of the assessee furnished the copy of return of income

   along with the computation of income and other evidences.

</p><p id="p_14">9. The facts for A.Y. 2006-07 to 2008-09 are almost similar except variation of

   figures of disallowance under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_18">section 80IB(4)</a> and various dates.

</p><p id="p_15">   (a) For AY 2006-07, the ld AR submits that no reasons recorded were

      supplied to the assessee despite repeated request, this fact was admitted

     by assessing officer in his remand report furnished during first appellate

     stage, which is discernable at page 25 of the order of ld CIT(A).

</p><p id="p_16">  (b) For AY 2007-08, the ld AR submits that no reasons recorded were

     supplied to the assessee despite repeated request, this fact was admitted

     by assessing officer in his remand report furnished during first appellate

     stage, which is discernable at page 24 of the order of ld CIT(A).

</p><p id="p_17">  (c) For AY 2008-09, the ld. AR submits that notice under <a href="/doc/1888237/" id="a_19">section 148</a> was

     served on 26.02.2014. The assessee filed return of income in response to

     the said notice on 16.04.2014 and demanded reasons of re-opening. The

     reasons were supplied after 7 months vide letter dated 28.11.2014.

     Notice under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_20">section 143(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/511102/" id="a_21">142</a> was served on 28.11.2014, without

     disposal of objections. The assessee again filed objection on 15.01.2015

     (per page 28 to 39 of PB) to decide the objection. The objections were

     disposed of as per assessing officer letter dated 28.11.2014 on

     10.03.2014. The assessment order was passed on 23.03.2015.

</p><p id="p_18">10. We have considered the rival submission of the parties and have gone

  through the orders of authorities below. It is not in dispute that assessment

  for the Assessment Year 2005-06 was completed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_22">section 143(3)</a> on

  23.01.2007. Notice under <a href="/doc/1888237/" id="a_23">section 148</a> dated 30.03.2012 was issued to the

  assessee. The assessee vide its application dated 25.04.2012 demanded the

  reasons recorded. The assessee was furnished following reasons of re-

  opening:

       In this case, assessee claimed deduction u/s 80IB (4). Whereas during the course
       of assessment proceedings for A. Y. 2009-10 it was seen that assessee failed to
       start business activities before March, 2004. Starting manufacturing before
       March 2004 is basic condition for claiming deduction u/s 80IB(4). As assessee
       violated the conditions laid down in section 80IB (4) deduction, so claim of
       deduction is to be rejected.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       In view of the above, I have reason to believe that income has escaped
       assessment within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1837761/" id="a_24">section 147</a> of the I.T. Act for the A.Y. 2005-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       06.

</blockquote><p id="p_20">11. The assessee vide its application dated 29.010.2012 furnished the detailed

   reply contending therein that the allegation that assessee has not started

   manufacturing activities before March 2004 and that assessee not complied

   the provisions as contained in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_25">section 80IB(4)</a> are incorrect, the assessee

   started manufacturing before 31.03.2004. The assessee further contended

   that he has furnished all documentary evidence which proved that assessee

   started manufacturing activities before 31.03.2004. The assessee claimed

   deduction from Assessment Year 2005-06 as in the Assessment Year 2004-

   05, the assessee incurred losses. The Assessing Officer after application of

   mind allowed the deduction. Therefore, the re-opening is clear change of

   opinion and is not allowable as per the provision of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_26">Income-tax Act</a>. The

   assessee further objected that assessment cannot be re-opened after four

   years from the end of relevant Assessment Year unless any income

   chargeable to tax escaped assessment by reasons of the failures on the part

   of assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for

   assessment for that Assessment Year. Therefore, the assessment cannot be

   re-opened unless assessee has failed to disclose fully and truly all material

   fact. The assessee has filed Form 10CCB duly certified on Chartered

   Accountant giving all necessary particulars for claim under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_27">section 80IB(4)</a>

   for Assessment Year under consideration. The assessee prayed that the

   notice under <a href="/doc/1888237/" id="a_28">section 148</a> is bad-in-law and void ab-initio as the Assessing

   Officer has nowhere mentioned that assessee failed to disclose fully and

   truly all material fact necessary for assessment as there is no such allegation

   in the reasons furnished to the assessee and that the reasons have no

   validity.
</p>
<p id="p_21">12. We have noted that the Assessing Officer has not disposed of the objection

   raised by assessee before passing the assessment order.

</p><p id="p_22">13. The Hon'ble Apex Court in GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. (supra) made it

   clear that on receipt of reasons, the assessee is entitled to file objections to

   issuance of notice and the Assessing Officer is bound to dispose of the same

   by a speaking order. The judgment is very clear that before proceeding with

   the assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer has to pass a speaking

   order. Therefore, the Assessing Officer is bound to pass an order and

   thereafter only further proceedings could be taken for passing the

   assessment order.
</p>
<p id="p_23">14. The Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in Asian Paints (supra) held that if

   the Assessing Officer does not accept the objections filed to notice under

<p id="p_24">15. The Hon'ble Apex Court in Kelvinator India (supra) held that after 1.4.1989

   the Assessing Officer has power to reopen provided there is "tangible

   material" to come to the conclusion that there is escapement of income. This

   judgment has laid emphasis on two more aspects: that there can be no

   review of an assessment in the guise of reopening and that a bare review

   without any tangible material would amount to abuse of the power.

   Wadkar (Supra</a>) has held that the reasons recorded by the Assessing Officer

   nowhere state that there was failure on the part of the assessee to disclose

   fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment of that

   assessment year. It is needless to mention that the reasons are required to be

   read as they were recorded by the Assessing Officer. No substitution or

   deletion is permissible. No additions can be made to those reasons. No

   inference can be allowed to be drawn based on reasons not recorded. It is for

   the Assessing Officer to disclose and open his mind through reasons

   recorded by him. He has to speak through his reasons. It is for the Assessing

   Officer to reach to the conclusion as to whether there was failure on the part

   of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his

  to form his opinion. It is for him to put his opinion on record in black and

  white. The reasons recorded should be clear and unambiguous and should

  not suffer from any vagueness. The reasons recorded must disclose his mind.

  Reasons are the manifestation of mind of the Assessing Officer. The reasons

  recorded should be self-explanatory and should not keep the assessee

  guessing for the reasons. Reasons provide link between conclusion and

  evidence. The reasons recorded must be based on evidence. The Assessing

  Officer, in the event of challenge to the reasons, must be able to justify the

  same based on material available on record. He must disclose in the reasons

  as to which fact or material was not disclosed by the assessee fully and truly

  necessary for assessment of that assessment year, so as to establish vital link

  between the reasons and evidence. That vital link is the safeguard against

  arbitrary reopening of the concluded assessment. The reasons recorded by

  the Assessing Officer cannot be supplemented by filing an affidavit or

  making oral submission, otherwise, the reasons which were lacking in the

  material particulars would get supplemented, by the time the matter reaches

  to the court, on the strength of affidavit or oral submissions advanced.

  jurisdiction (without compliance of the law in accordance with procedure) ,

  yet the only consequences would be that of appeal, it would be restored to

  the assessing officer for fresh adjudication after following the due

  procedure. This would lead to unnecessary harassment to the assessee by

  reviving stale/old matters.

<p id="p_27">18. Further, Hon'ble Bombay High Court in Dulraj U Jain Vs ACIT (WP No.

  1641 of 2018) held if the reasons do not specify, prima facie, the quantum of

  tax which has escape assessment but merely states that it would be at least of

  Rs. 1 lakh. Prime facie, we are of the view that reasons recorded do not

  indicate reasonable belief of the assessing officer himself to show the

  impugned notice. Thus prime FSI the impugned notice is without

  jurisdiction.

<p id="p_28">19. The Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in CIT versus Chaitanya Properties

<p id="p_29">20. Considering the above legal factual discussion and important fact that on

   perusal of assessment record, which was brought before us, we do not find

   that the Assessing Officer disposed of the objection raised by assessee

   against the validity of re-opening in accordance with the law laid down by

   Hon'ble Apex Court in GKN Driveshafts (supra) Asian Paints (supra), the

   non-disposal of objection raised by assessee renders the re-assessment as

   invalid.

<p id="p_30">21. Even otherwise the reasons recorded by the Assessing Officer nowhere state

   that there was failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly

      Assessment Order passed u/s.143(3) of the Act dated 29th December, 2011
      (the said Assessment Order) is not time barred. The CIT(A) ought to have
      held that the said Assessment Order is bad in law and void ab initio as the
      said Assessment Order is time barred.

      law and void ab initio also on the ground that no notice u/s.143(2) has been
      served on the assessee by the Assessing Officer and that the said notice has
      been served only by the predecessor i.e. by the ITO Ward 3(2) Kalyan.

   scrutiny. The assessment was completed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_35">section 143(3)</a> on

   29.12.2011. During the assessment, the Assessing Officer noted that

   assessee purchased machinery of Rs. 2,00,000/- on 28.03.2004 and claimed

   that machine were used for manufacturing of Wire Mesh. The assessee

   purchased the material on 27.03.2004 from Garg Sales Co. Pvt. Ltd., Jhajjar

   (Haryana) and was delivered to assessee on 30.03.2004. The assessee has

   not submitted octroi challan or toll challan which may prove that material

   was actually came from Jhajjar (Haryana) to Daman within a span of three

   days. The Assessing Officer in order to verify the claim of the assessee

   recorded the statement of proprietor of the assessee. In the statement, the

   proprietor of assessee admitted that production was started in Financial Year

   2004-05 and material was purchased on 28.03.2004. On the basis of

   statement, the Assessing Officer took his view that the assessee failed to

   fulfill the condition laid down under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_36">section 80IB(2)</a> for claiming exemption

   under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_37">section 80IB(4)</a>. On appeal before the ld. CIT(A), the action of

   Assessing Officer was confirmed. Hence, further aggrieved by the order of

</p><p id="p_39">29. We have heard the submission of ld. AR of the assessee and ld. DR for the

   Revenue and perused the material available on record. Ground No.1 relates

   to passing the assessment order beyond the time limit. The ld. AR of the

   served within the statutory period provided under <a href="/doc/581124/" id="a_38">section 153</a> of the Act

   being time barred and deserves to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_40">30. We have noted that the assessment relates to the Assessment Year 2009-10.

   The assessment order was passed on 29.12.2011 under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_39">section 143(3)</a>. The

   time period prescribed during the relevant time was 24 month from the end

   of relevant Assessment Year. Therefore, the assessment order passed by

   Assessing Officer on 29.12.2011 is within the period as prescribed under

   <a href="/doc/581124/" id="a_40">section 153</a> of the Act. Hence, ground of appeal raised by assessee is

   dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_41">31. Ground No.2 relates to non-service of notice under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_41">section 143(2)</a> by

   Assessing Officer. The ld. AR of the assessee has not argued anything in

   support of this ground of appeal. The perusal of record reveals that the

   statutory notice under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_42">section 143(3)</a> was served by ITO Ward-3(2), Kalyan

   on 20.08.2010 through registered AD. The assessee failed to bring any

   contrary law to our notice that the Assessing Officer was required a fresh

   notice in addition to the notice served by his predecessor. Therefore, we do

   not find any merit in the grounds of appeal raised by assessee. Hence,

   dismissed.

<p id="p_44">33. Ground No.4 relates to confirming the disallowance of deduction under

  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_43">section 80IB(4)</a>. The ld. AR of the assessee submits that the main business

  activity of assessee is of manufacturing of different kind of Wire Mesh,

  Grill, Netting, fencing, Iron, Wave Cloth of stainless steel. The ld. AR for

  the assessee submits that the assessee produced sufficient documentary

  evidence before the Assessing Officer in order to establish the

  manufacturing activities commenced before 31.03.2004 which consist of

  sale invoices to the purchase invoice, invoice for purchase of assets,

  electricity bills etc. The Assessing Officer disregarded all the documentary

  evidences. The ld AR further submits that though the assessee started

  manufacturing activity before 31.03.2004, but the assessee has not claimed

  deduction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_44">section 80IB(10)</a> for AY 2004-05, as there was loss. The

  Assessing Officer solely relied upon the answer given by assessee in

  response to question no. 8 of the statement of assessee, recorded under

  <a href="/doc/727816/" id="a_45">section 131</a>. The Assessing Officer has not taken note of the fact that the

  statement was retracted by assessee vide letter dated 28.12.2011. The

  retraction of the assessee is supported by affidavit of the assessee. The

  assessee furnished all the condition as prescribed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_46">section 80IB(2)</a> for

   along with the computation of total income. The assessee has clearly

   mentioned in Note No.2 to the computation of income that the assessee

   started new industrial undertaking for manufacturing Wire Mesh at Daman

   in March 2004. The assessee not availed the benefit of exemption under

   documentary evidences furnished by the assessee. The assessing officer

   solely based his finding on the answer given in response to question No.8 of

   the statement of assessee recorded by him. There is no finding of the

   assessing officer that the assessee has not fulfilled the requisite conditions as

   assessment year. This fact has been clearly mentioned by the assessee in

   Note 2 annexed with the computation of income for AY 2004-05. The

   assessee claimed exemption under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_54">section 80IB(4)</a> only from AY 2005-06

   onwards. There is no finding of the assessing officer that the assessee is not

   engaged in manufacturing activities in all subsequent assessment years.

   Now we are concerned with AY 2009-10.
</p>
<p id="p_50">37. The assessing officer disallowed exemption under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_55">section 80IB(4)</a> on two

   counts i.e (i) the assessee shown the purchase of Machinery on 27th March

   2004 from Jhajjar Haryana and the date of delivery of machine is 30th March

   2004 and that it was not humanly possible to start production within three

   days. (ii) Welding of wire is not manufacturing. In our view the starting or

   not starting of production in the month of March 2004 in newly established

   unit may be relevant fact for seeking exemption under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_56">section 80IB(4)</a>for

   AY 2004-05. In fact the assessee has not claimed such exemption for AY

   2004-05. The assessing officer doubted the production in March 2004 only

   and reopened the assessment for 2005-06 to 208-09. The assessee for the

   first time claimed the exemption of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_57">section 80IB(4)</a> from AY 2005-06

   premises and thus not fulfilled the condition of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_58">section 80IB(2)</a> of the Act

   and that business carried out by the assessee is not manufacturing activities.

</p><p id="p_51">38. The assessee is engaged in the manufacturing of steel wire mash, this fact is

   not disputed by the lower authorities. The lower authorities have disputed

   that mare welding of wire is not part of manufacturing process. The assessee

   is making new product from steel wire by converting it into a wire mash,

   which is distinct product and marketable separately from the raw material .

   The nature of business activity of assessee is also not disputed by the lower

   authorities. The Hon'ble Madras High Court in CIT Vs Esquire Translam

   Industries [2012] 25 taxmann.com 98 (Mad) held that conversion of raw

   material, namely electrical steel in to lamination, which is a distinct

   commercial product, marketable separately from raw material, amounts to

   'manufarure' for the purpose of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_59">section 80IB</a>. Therefore,                              respectfully

   following the ration of decision of Hon'ble Madras High Court, we are of

   the view that the assessee is engaged in the business of manufacturing

   The other objection of the lower authorities that the assessee is running his

   business activity in a rented accommodation is also misconceived as there is

   no such condition prescribed in the subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_61">Section 80IB</a>. in the

</p><p id="p_55">   40. The assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">          1) The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-1 (CIT(A)) Thane ought to
          have held that the Assessment Order passed u/s.143(3) of the Act dated 4th
          March, 2013 (the said Assessment Order) is bad in law and void ab initio as
          the said Assessment Order has been passed on conjectures and surmises and
          not on the basis of facts and documents furnished to the Assessing Officer.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">          2) The CIT(A) has grossly erred in law and on facts by confirming the
          disallowance of deduction ofRs.10,04,176/- u/s.80IB(4) of the Act.
          The CIT(A) ought to have held that the assessee is entitled to deduction of
          Rs. 10,04,176/- u/s.80IB(4) of the Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">          The aforesaid grounds of appeal are without prejudice to one another.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">   41. Ground No. 1 of the appeal is general in nature. The ld AR for the assessee

      has not made any specific submissions, therefore this ground of appeal is

      treated as not pressed and thus dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_57">   42. Ground No. 2 identical to the ground No. 4 of appeal for AY 2009-10,

      which we have decided in favour of the assessee. Thus following the

      principal of consistency this grounds of appeal is also allowed with similar

      direction.
