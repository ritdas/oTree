</p><p id="p_2">1.           We have heard Mr.Niraj D.Buch, learned advocate for
the petitioner and Mr.Parth Bhatt, learned AGP for the respondent
No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.           This         petition     has    been     filed   by   the   petitioner
challenging the order dated 23.12.2014, by which, the certain
directions have been issued under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The petitioner has
an alternative remedy for filing an appeal challenging this order
before the National Green Tribunal, Western Bench at Pune under
<a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_3">Section 33(B)</a> of the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.           Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that since
the impugned order has been passed without affording any
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, therefore, this petition
may be maintainable in view of the Apex Court's decision in the
case of <a href="/doc/172383107/" id="a_4">Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks</a>,
reported in (1998) 8 SCC 1, wherein it has been held that three
grounds have been provided for entertaining a Writ Petition even if
there is an alternative remedy available.

ground that the principles of nature justice has been violated for

the reasons that the special tribunal has been provided in view of
the directions contained in paragraphs 35 and 39 of the decision in
the case of <a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_5">Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan v. Union
of India and others</a> reported in (2012) 8 SCC 326.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.                 For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion that
since the petitioner has a statutory remedy for filing an appeal
before the National Green Tribunal, Western Bench at Pune, this
petition          stands   dismissed   on    the     ground   of   availability   of
alternative remedy.
