<p id="p_3">             On the oral prayer of learned counsel for the
petitioner, (1) National Mission for Clean Ganga through
its Director, (2) Secretary, Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change, (3) Central Pollution Control
Board and (4) Union of India through Ministry of Water
Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation,
are added as respondent nos.5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively.
Registry is directed to implead those respondents in the
array of parties.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.           The present petition, in the nature of public
interest litigation, has been instituted by an advocate
practicing in this Court.         Petitioner has highlighted the
pollution of river Ganga.           According to the averments
made in the petition, the authorities are remiss in
discharge of their statutory duties. It is averred in the
petition that the Uttarakhand Environment Protection
and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) conducted a study
and slotted the water of river Ganga in four categories: (a)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>




being fit for drinking, (b) for bathing, (c) for agriculture
and (d) for excessive pollution.         The level of coliform
bacteria in the river water is above the prescribed limit.
The coliform found in the water should be below 50
mpn/100 ml to be fit for drinking; less than 500
mpn/100 ml for bathing and below 5000 mpn/100 ml for
agricultural use.   The present level of coliform in river
Ganga has reached 5500 mpn/100 ml. The main cause
attributed to the higher level of coliform is the disposal of
human faeces, urine and sewage directly thrown into the
river from its origin in Gaumukh till it reaches Haridwar.
A startling revelation has been made in the petition that
the sewage of 89 million litres per day (mld) is released
into river Ganga from 12 municipal towns that fall along
its route. The quality of river Ganga has deteriorated so
much that is not fit even for taking a bath.               The
untreated wastewater and effluents from various units
are also discharged directly into the river. The Sewage
Treatment Plant (STP) at Jagjeetpur alone releases 129
million litres daily in the Ganga with a faecal coliform
concentration of about 34 million/100 ml.             It causes
serious threats to the quality of river water as well as
health hazards to million of devotees and the people who
are dependent on the river.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.          According to the averments made in the
petition, though the respondents are aware of the
situation of further decreasing quality of water, but they
have not taken any preventive or remedial measures.
The flora and fauna dependent on the river is also
adversely   affected.    It   is   not   only   the   Municipal
Corporations, Municipal Councils and Nagar Panchayats,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>




who are directly releasing the untreated waste in the
water, but several Ashrams are also throwing faecal
waste in Ganga.        Petitioner has highlighted that the
sewer lines should be diverted away from river Ganga
and   the   capacity   of   Sewage   Treatment   Plants   be
enhanced.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.          A reply has been filed on behalf of respondent
no.2 on the affidavit of Sri S.S. Pal, Scientific Officer,
Uttarakhand Environment Protection &amp; Pollution Control
Board, Dehradun. According to the reply filed, the water
quality at Laxman Jhula, Rishikesh meets Category 'A'
standards, whereas at Harki Paudi, Haridwar, the water
quality meets the 'B' category standards. The respondent-
State Pollution Control Board, itself, has admitted that
the water of Ganga is not fit for drinking at Haridwar. It
has also categorically been admitted in the reply that
though, the level of coliform is high but all other
parameters, such as Dissolved Oxygen and Bio Chemical
Oxygen Demand are well within limits. The STPs located
at Haridwar and Rishikesh are regularly being monitored.
There is one operational Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of
3-MLD capacity at Swargashram and 6-MLD Oxidation
Pond at Rishikesh, which are also operational. Further,
3 more STPs are in operation in Haridwar having the
respective capacity of 18 MLD, 27MLD and 18MLD. In
pursuance of the inspections carried out by a Joint
Inspection Team at Haridwar and Rishikesh, it was found
that the existing STPS are under-capacity in comparison
to the sewage load that is received from two towns. The
matter has been taken up with Uttarakhand Peyjal
Nigam and Uttarkhand Jal Sansthan to take appropriate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>




measures for treatment of the sewage generated/collected
from Haridwar and Rishikesh.               Respondent No.2 has
issued 82 Show cause notices and 44 Closure notices in
the year 2014-15. In the year 2015-16, 180 Show cause
notices and 106 Closure Notices were issued to the
defaulting units, industries, hotels etc. in the State due
to non-compliance of the provisions of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.          Necessary directions have also been issued to
the grossly polluted industries like Pulp &amp; Paper
Industries,     Sugar        Industries,        Distilleries,   Textile
industries etc. for installation of Real Time Effluent
Quality Monitoring Systems at their effluent outlet
points. Furthermore, the Real Time Monitoring Systems
have been installed and Real Time Data is being
transmitted to the Central Pollution Control Board and
the State Pollution Control Board. Directions have also
been   issued        to     as    many     as     Seven     Ashrams/
Dharamshalas         situated      in    Haridwar,      which     were
disposing the wastewater into the drain leading to river
Ganga, to stop the disposal of wastewater generated from
their premises.           Directions have also been issued to
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., Ranipur, Haridwar for
installation of 11 MLD Capacity Sewage Treatment Plant
(STP). Further directions were issued by respondent no.2
to as many as 21 Hydroelectric Projects located in the
mainstream      of        Ganga    for   installation     of    Sewage
Treatment     Plants        of    appropriate      capacity     during
construction phase and operational phase. Furthermore,
Closure notices have also been issued to 12 Hotels
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>




situated in the main course of Ganga due to non-
compliance of provisions of the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.             A reply on behalf of respondent no.1- State of
Uttarakhand has also been filed on the affidavit of Mr.
Ranjit    Singh,     Deputy   Secretary,   Peyjal,   Govt.   of
Uttarakhand, Dehradun. It has been averred in the reply
that the State Government had instructed Uttarakhand
Peyjal Nigam to prepare the DPR for stopping the
pollution during Ardh Kumbh, 2016. The Uttarakhand
Peyjal    Nigam     has   prepared   a   DPR     amounting   to
Rs.266.09 crores for interception and diversion of leftover
drains for treatment to Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs),
new STPs, up-gradation of existing STPs and other
appurtenant works at Haridwar. The same was forwarded
by the State Programme Management Group to the
National Mission for Clean Ganga in the month of
October, 2015 for approval and release of funds,
however, the sanction of the DPR from the Govt. of India
is still awaited.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.             It has also been stated that 80-85 MLD sewage
is being received at STP, Jagjeetpur against which 45
MLD is presently being treated and working properly to
meet     all   parameters/norms.     For   the   treatment   of
remaining 35-40 MLD sewage, a DPR of 40 MLD STP at
Jagjeetpur has already been sanctioned by the National
Mission for Clean Ganga on 29th September, 2015, for
which, bids were invited by the Uttarakhand Peyjal
Nigam but the National Mission for Clean Ganga directed
to put the bidding process on hold as the Govt. of India is
considering to construct the said STP on PPP Model.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 6</span>
<p id="p_10">8.          It has been admitted in the reply that in
Haridwar town, there are 22 drains which are leading to
River Ganga out of which 17 are tapped (16 drains
maintained by Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan and 01 is
maintained        by   Uttarakhand   Peyjal   Nigam).   For
interception and diversion of remaining 5 Nalas, DPR of
Rs.266.09 crores (which includes other works also) have
already been prepared by Uttarakhand Peyjal Nigam and
submitted for approval and release of fund to National
Mission for Clean Ganga on 5.10.2015 but the decision is
still awaited.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.          Water is one of the basic elements.     Neither
human beings nor any animals or aquatic life can survive
without water. There cannot be any vegetation without
water.    Every citizen has a right to clean water under
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India to get clean water
which is also the basic human right.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.         The River Ganga is a way of life for all Hindus,
however, as of today, the river is most polluted due to
continuous discharge of sewage and industrial effluents.
There is a growing need to control and prevent the
pollution into river Ganga and restoration of quality of
river water. It would be apt to mention at this stage that
the      respondent     no.2-   Uttarakhand   Environment
Protection &amp; Pollution Control Board is remiss in
discharge of its statutory duties. The stringent provisions
are contained in the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection)
Act</a>, 1986.       We give the last opportunity to respondent
no.2- Uttarakhand Environment Protection &amp; Pollution
Control Board to strictly comply with the environmental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>




laws failing which the Court may order for its dissolution.
In that eventuality, the duties, being discharged by
respondent no.2, would be delegated to the Central
Pollution Control Board in order to save River Ganga.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.       The Central Pollution Board is directed to take
stern action against the officers/officials of respondent
no.2 -Uttarakhand Environment Protection &amp; Pollution
Control Board for not implementing the environmental
laws in the State of Uttarakhand.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.       We have also gone through the pictures placed
on record by the petitioner, whereby several Drains are
opening in river Ganga.       There is plastic strewn in the
rivers, river banks, public places i.e. bus stand, railway
station, parks etc. Huge garbage is dumped on the banks
of river Ganga. The Pooja Samagri is also dumped in the
river. The industrial waste/effluents are being thrown in
the river directly.    Seven Ashrams are disposing the
wastewater directly in the river which has lead to
decrease the quality of water.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.       What      emerges     out       from    the    facts,    as
enumerated hereinabove, that the quality of river Ganga
is deteriorating rapidly everyday. The water is not fit for
drinking at Haridwar.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.       The    Parliament         has    enacted      the    Water
(Prevention   and     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control       of    Pollution)    Act</a>,   1974
(hereinafter to be referred as the Act of 1974).                  The
Statement of Objects and Reasons of the said Act are that
the problem of pollution of river and streams has
assumed considerable importance and urgency in recent
years as a result of the growth of industries and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                8</span>




increasing tendency to urbanization. Thus, it is essential
to ensure that the domestic and industrial effluents are
not allowed to be discharged into the watercourse
without adequate treatment as such discharges would
render the water unsuitable as source of drinking water
as well as for supporting fish life and for use in irrigation.
Pollution of rivers and streams also causes increasing
damage to the country's economy. <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_8">Section 2(dd)</a> of the
Act of 1974 explains the term 'outlet' to include any
conduit pipe or channel, open or closed, carrying sewage
or trade effluent or any other holding arrangement which
causes, or is likely to cause, pollution.       Pollution has
been defined under <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_9">Section 2(e)</a>.          The term 'sewage
effluent' has been defined under <a href="/doc/167777868/" id="a_10">Section 2(g)</a> which
means effluent from any sewerage system or sewage
disposal works and includes sullage from open drains.
<a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_11">Section 2(gg)</a> explains the 'sewer' to mean any conduit
pipe or channel, open or closed, carrying sewage or trade
effluent.   As per <a href="/doc/41018319/" id="a_12">Section 2(j)</a>, the 'stream' includes (i)
river; (ii) water course (whether flowing or for the time
being dry); (iii) inland water (whether natural or artificial);
</p><p id="p_17">iv) sub-terranean waters and (v) sea or tidal waters to
such extent or, as the case may be, to such point as the
State Government may, by notification in the Official
Gazette, specify in this behalf. <a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_13">Section 2(k)</a> defines 'trade
effluent' which includes any liquid, gaseous or solid
substance which is discharged from any premises used
for carrying on any [Industry, operation or process, or
treatment and disposal system], other than domestic
sewage.     <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> of the Act of 1974 provides for
Constitution of a Central Board and <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_15">Section 4</a> empowers
the State to constitute the State Boards. The functions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              9</span>

<p id="p_52">26.       In   the   book    'Aspects   of   Geology   and
Environment of the Himalaya' authored by Charu C. Pant
and Arun K. Sharma, the article has been written by H.C.
Nainwal and C. Prasad under the caption 'Studies of
Glacial and Glacio-Fluvial Geomorphology of Gangotri
Glacier in between Gaumukh and Gangotri, Garhwal
Himalaya'. In this article, the Gangotri Glacier has been
declared as valley type glacier, which extends from
Chaukhamba peak (7000 m a.s.l.) and flows towards
northwest, with its snout at Gaumukh (4120 m a.s.l.)
The glacier covers a glacierised area of 258.56 km2. It is
about 30.20 km long, and its width varying from 0.5 to
2.5 km. It is located in the area bounded by latitude 300
43' 22"-300 55' 49" N and longitude 790 4'41"-790 16' 34"
E. Its three main tributaries viz. Raktvaran, Chaturangi

and Kirti, merge at different altitudes into the trunk
glacier.    The oldest terminal moraine of the Gangotri
glacier    is    at   Sukhi     below    Jhala    which    probably
represents the snout during the Pleistocene glaciation.
According to the authors, the data shows a marked
shrinkage in the ice cover. The date shows that within a
span of six years, the snow cover shrunk for 3.1% in the
peak accumulation period and 3.3% in peak ablation
periods.        The data collected for 61 years (1936-1996)
show that the total recession of Gangotri glacier was
1147 meter, with the average rate of 19 meter per year.

written by Anjani K. Tangri under the title 'Shrinking
Glaciers of Uttaranchal: Cause of Concern and Hope for
the   Future'.         According    to   the     author,   temporal
monitoring of the configuration of snout of Gangotri
glacier     through       multi-date        satellite   data    has
demonstrated that the snout has been on continuous
retreat as well. Between 1962 to 1982, the rate of retreat
was 46 m/year.           Between 1982 and 1990, the snout
retreated at the rate of 40 m/year, between 1990 and
1994, the rate of retreat is recorded as 37.5 m/year,
whereas between 1994 and 1998, the rate of retreat of
the snout is recorded to be 25 m/year.                  The rate of
retreat of snout of Gangotri glacier has a direct
consequence of the rate of rise in regional temperatures.

published a compilation on Pollution Assessment: River
Ganga in the month of July, 2013.                According to this
report, the total length of the river Ganga is 2525
kilometres.        It travels about 450 kilometres through
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                             19</span>




Uttarakhand. It is the largest river basin in India. The
total surface water resource of Ganga river has been
assessed as 33 X 107 cusec out of which 7 X 107 cusec of
surface water has been put to use.       In addition, the
annual groundwater potential for irrigation, domestic and
industrial usage in the Ganga basin has been assessed at
11 x 107 cusec and out of which 7 X 107 cusec of
groundwater is being used as per records of Central
Ground Water Board.      There is Upper Ganga Reach,
Middle Ganga Reach and Lower Ganga Reach. The river
Ganga, in the upper reaches, flows on a steep and
narrow bed, mostly rocks and boulders.        This reach is
considered to have immense positional for harnessing
hydropower.   The river in the middle reach enters and
flows in plains, meandering mostly on a bed of fine sand.
The lower Ganga reach has wide and considerable
changes in the sediment transport and deposition is
observed which eventually leads to frequent change in
the river course and wide spread flooding.
</p>
<p id="p_55">29.       In order to assess the water quality of river
Ganga, the Central Pollution Control Board has set up 57
water quality monitoring stations on the main stem of
river Ganga, in association with State Pollution Control
Boards of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand
and West Bengal. There are 11 Water Quality Monitoring
Stations in the State of Uttarakhand.        The monitoring
results obtained during 2011 under National Water
Quality Monitoring Programme reflect that organic matter
and bacterial population of faecal origin continue to
dominate the pollution problem in River Ganga.         The
major water quality concerns, as revealed from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                               20</span>




monitoring results, are pathogenic pollution as reflected
through indicators i.e. Total Coliforms (TC) &amp; Faecal
Coliform (FC), organic matter as reflected through
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). The water quality
assessment in Uttarakhand, as per BOD, ranges from
0.2-11.0 mg/l. The highest value 11.0 mg/l is observed
at D/s Haridwar.     River Ganga at D/s of Raiwala and
D/s of Rishikesh is not meeting the water quality criteria
for bathing with respect to BOD.           The Faecal Coliform
value ranges from 5-46000 MPN/100ml and not meeting
the   water    quality   criteria    for    bathing      in   river
Alaknananda at Rudraprayag before confluence and after
confluence, River Mandakini and at Devprayag.                 The
Total Coliform value ranges from 5-58000 which do not
meet the primary water criteria based on designated best
use of category 'C' at all monitored locations of river
Alaknanda and Mandakini; and in river Ganga at
downstream Raiwala and downstream Haridwar. The
higher value of coliform bacteria and organic pollution is
observed in Upper Ganga due to open defecation and
discharge of waste water directly through small drains
into the river.    It is also observed that the location
Haridwar appears as a critical condition.
</p>
<p id="p_56">30.        As far as spatial and temporal trend of water
quality   is   concerned,   as      per    the   Water    Quality
Assessment, the standards and parameters of the water
quality has deteriorated in the Upper Stretch of Uttar
Pradesh. The BOD does not comply with the standards
at most of locations for the period 2006-2011. On an
average, the river Ganga, in upper and lower stretch of
Uttar Pradesh, was polluted. The quality of water, when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                              21</span>




the river entered in Bihar, was also poor.      The Total
Coliform Values range from 1400-90,000 do not meet the
criteria.    Higher faecal coliform is observed than the
criteria at most of the monitored locations.    The water
quality of River Ganga with respect to DO, BOD, Faecal
Coliform, Total Coliform and conductivity in the stretch
of West Bengal from Baharampur to Diamond Harbour
for the year 2011, also did not meet the required
parameters. All the riparian States have the right to get
the unpolluted water to use for irrigation, bathing and
drinking purposes.

Garhwal, Uttarakhand. The river flows south west from
Kumaun-Himalaya. It is a tributary of the river Ganga.
Ramganga descends upon the plains from the Corbett
National Park near Ramnagar in Nainital district and
flows    through    the    plains     of   Kalagarh,   Afzalgarh,
Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and finally
merges with river Ganga near Kannauj (Uttar Pradesh).

<p id="p_77">50.         The Central Pollution Control Board in its
assessment has made the following conclusion: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">      "The River Ganga suffers from myriad problems,
      most significant ones being the lean flow during
      dry   season.    Discharge       of   untreated   and/or
      partially     treated       sewage     and     industrial
      wastewater into the river is a key issue. Diversion
      of river water through Upper and Lower Ganga
      canals, leaving virtually very little flow in the main
      river stream makes dilution difficult even for the
      treated sewage. In Uttar Pradesh, there is need of
      treatment of sewage and availability of proper
      conveyance system for sewage. River Ganga also
      needs minimum ecological flow for its survival in
      the stretch of Uttar Pradesh. Since a river is a
      living eco-system and therefore ultimate goal
      should be to protect the functioning of the river eco-
      system. Major Tributaries of river Ganga namely
      Ramganga        and     Kali-East     need    immediate
      attention as they carry industrial and domestic
      pollution load of Uttrakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
      Major industrial sector namely, Tannery, Sugar &amp;
      Distillery,   Pulp    and    Paper    mills   contributes
      significant pollution load to river Ganga and its
      tributaries. There is immediate need of firm
      environment surveillance in order to check their
      compliance with environmental standards. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                    28</span>




      pertinent to mention that incessant discharge of
      treated sewage (BOD level of 30 mg/l) cannot
      bring the river water to bathing quality level in
      lean season, even if sewage get 100% treatment.
      Therefore, it is neccesary that minimum flow
      throughout the year is maintained to support eco-
      system of river and aquatic life. It would be
      advisable to create more water storage facility for
      Ganga riverine system and release water in the
      lean period to effectively maintain minimum flow
      in the river."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">51.         The assessment made by the Central Pollution
Control Board depicts the grim reality of the sacred/
pious river Ganga. The Sewage Treatment Plants are not
working to the maximum capacity.                  There is an urgent
need to set up new STPs by the Central Pollution Control
Board as well as the Ministry of Environment, Forest and
Climate Change. All the drains opening into the river
Ganga are required to be intercepted and diverted. Even
after the treatment, the water does not meet the
requirements as per the report of the Central Pollution
Control Board.         The need of the hour is to save river
Ganga as well as its tributaries and to minimise the
pollution. There has to be sustainable development. The
industry is a must for the nation but the necessary
precautions are required to be taken to save the
environment.      The      focus        is   on    the    sustainable
development.     It     can   be    termed        as   "precautionary
principles". All the industries should ensure that no
industrial waste is dumped into the rivers without proper

<p id="p_79">52.        The book 'The Himalayan Gazetteer' authored
by Edwin Thomas Atkinson Volume-3, published on 19th
February, 1986, defines Gangotri Glacier as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      "Gangotri, in patti and parganah Taknaur of Tihri, a
      small temple on the right bank of the Bhagirathi, is
      situate in north latitude 300-59'-10'' and east
      longitude 780-59'-30", about ten miles south-east of
      its source at an elevation of 10,020 feet above the
      level of the sea. A gunshot below Gangotri the Kedar
      Ganga, a rapid and considerable stream, debouches
      into the Bhagirathi at a place called Gaurikund, a
      place of ablution for pilgrims. The hills here recede a
      little, and above Gaurikund the bed of the Bhagirthi
      widens into a small shingly space, in which the river
      flows rapidly, changing its course as the floods direct
      it. Just at the gorge of this space a bridge has been
      thrown across, and just above the bridge, in a bay
      formed by a reach of the river in this shingly place,
      fifteen feet above the stream, is situate the small
      temple dedicated to the goddess Ganga. This was
      erected by Amr Singh, Thapa, the chief of the
      Gorkhali commanders in Gargwal early in the
      present century. The temple is erected on the sacred
      stone where tradition has it, Bhagirath used to
      worship Mahadeo. It is a small building of a square
      form, for about 12 feet high and rounding in to the
      top in the manner common to temples in the hills. It is
      quite plain, coloured white with red mouldings, and
      surmounted with the usual melon-shaped ornament
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                         30</span>




commonly known as a Turk's cap. From the eastern
face of the square which is turned nearly to the
sacred source, there is a small projection covered
with a stone roof, in which is the entrance facing
east, and just opposite to this there is a smaller
temple of similar shape dedicated to Bhaironji, as the
guardian of the shrine. The larger temple contains
small statues of Ganga, Bhagirath, and other deities
supposed to be connected with the locality.         The
whole is surrounded by a wall built of unhewn stone
and mortar, and the space this contains is paved
with flat stones.     In this space, too, there is a
comfortable but small house for the officiating
Brahmans.      Without the enclosure there are a few
wooden sheds constructed for the accommodation of
pilgrims, who also find shelter in caves formed by
overhanging stones, of which there are many.</blockquote>
<p id="p_80">      Fraser writes:-"There are several pools, called
by the names Brahmakund, Vishnukund, and others
of corresponding import.          Ablution in these is
considered an import part of the ritual to be observed
by pilgrims who visit this spot, considered popularly
to be the source of the Ganga, as further progress up
the   stream    is   generally,    though   erroneously,
regarded as impracticable.        Though this ablution,
with due donations to the officiating Brahmans, is
considered to cleanse from all offences, the number
of pilgrims is not considerable in consequence of the
great length and ruggedness of the journey, and the
difficulty of obtaining subsistence by the way.
Flasks and similar vessels are filled at Gangotri with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                           31</span>




the sacred water of the stream, and being sealed by
the officiating Brahman, are conveyed to the plains,
where they are highly prized. Gangotri is below the
upper limit of forests; deodars growing here, though
to no great size, and birch trees thriving remarkably.
The mean breadth of the Bhagirathi or Ganga here
was ascertained by Hodgson, on the 26th of May, to
be forty-three feet, the depth eighteen inches, the
current very swift, and over rounded stones. On the
second of June following, he conjectured its volume to
be doubled, in consequence of the rapid melting of
the snow. Renuell's account of Gangotri would
scarcely have been expected from one who usually
displays so much information and judgment, "This
great body of water (the Ganga) now forces a
passage through the ridge of mount Himmaleh, at the
distance possibly of 100 miles below the place of its
first   approach   to    it,    and,      sapping       its    very
foundations,    rushes         through     a    cavern,        and
precipitates itself into a vast basin, which it has worn
in the rock at the hither foot of the mountains. The
Ganga thus appears to incurious spectators to derive
its orginal springs from this chain of mountains, and
the mind of superstition has given to the mouth of the
cavern the form of the head of a cow.
</p>
<p id="p_81">        This idea is also mentioned by the Persian
authors and Pere Tieffenthaler also notices it; but the
Brahman priest in charge met there by Fraser in
1816 ridiculed the idea of the stream proceeding from
a rock like a cow's mouth, and pointed out the actual
source.      Herbert    estimates        the   length     of    the

Bhagirathi from its source near Gangotri to its
entrance to the plains at 203 miles. The elevation of
the temple above the sea is 10,319 feet. About a kos
from Gangotri is a place called Patangani, which is
noted as the spot where the five Pandawas remained
for twelve years worshipping Mahadeo after his
retreat from Lanka to the Himalaya after that they
ascended the Swargaruini peak, whence the Ganga
flows, and there four of them died and their spirits
ascended to heaven.     The fifth Yuddhishthira was
translated bodily at the same time. Mr. Griffith thus
recounts the birth of the Ganga:-

            Gau-mukh, or the cow's mouth, is the name
       given to the glacier cavern from which the head-
       waters issue on the melting of the ice and snow.
       This glacier has its origin on the western slopes of
       the Satopanth group of peaks, the eastern slopes of
       which are covered by the glaciers above Badrinath in
       the Mana valley.     It also is connected with the
       glaciers along the northern slopes of the Kedarnath
       peak, on the south face of which is the temple of that
       name, so that the three great places of pilgrimage are
       all within a few miles of horizontal distance from
       each other. The name Gau-mukh is also given to the
       prayer-bag which conceals the mudras made in the
       ceremony of the sandhya."

Ganga: holy, deadly river', it is stated that Gaumukh, the
source of the River Ganga, is one of the most sacred
places in Hinduism. But in truth the entire river, flowing
for more than 2,500km across north India from the
mountainous haunts of the snow leopard to the tiger-
infested mangrove swamps of the Bay of Bengal, is
holy. Ma Ganga or Mother Ganga, described by Harvard
religious scholar Diana Eck as "the archetype of sacred
waters",   is    worshipped   as   a   goddess   by   Hindus
worldwide. Her water has even been ceremonially poured
into a well built on the orders of a generous 19th-century
maharaja for the English villagers of Stoke Row, near
Reading.   The Ganga has helped to sustain a tenth or
more of the world's population with food, water and fish
for millennia.     In his famous travel book Slowly Down
the Ganga (1966), Eric Newby lists translations for 108 of
the sacred Sanskrit names for the river, among them
"eternally pure" and "a light amid the darkness of
ignorance". According to the 2011 water quality statistics
published by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
</p><p id="p_100">-- the Yamuna's water at Okhla contains 1.1 billion
faecal coliform bacteria per 100ml, nearly half-a-million
times the (Indian) recommended bathing limit of 2,500.
The reason is clear. Half of India's 1.3 billion inhabitants
lack toilets; if they have them, they may not be connected
to drains; if they are, there may be no sewage treatment
plant; and if there is, it may not be working. More than
300,000 Indian children under five die each year from
diarrhoea, many of them in the Ganga basin. Equally
sinister are the findings of scientists investigating the
rapid, sewage-borne spread of genes known as NDM-1
and NDM-4 (NDM stands for New Delhi metallo-beta-

<p id="p_101">lactamase). NDM-1 was first detected in Delhi drinking
water in the year 2010. Poor sanitation was once again
the cause of contamination.        In the 19th century, the
Thames was so thick with sewage and industrial waste
that cholera broke out and sittings of the Commons were
abandoned because of the "Great Stink" of 1858. Today,
fish and waterbirds have returned to the river.

<p id="p_102">57.       The Ganga is serving an estimated pollution of
500 million people or more, which is larger than any
other river in the world.     The Ganga action plan was
launched by Shri Rajeev Gandhi, the then Prime Minister
of India. In the budget tabled in Parliament on 10th July
2014,   the   Union   Finance       Minister   Arun   Jaitley
announced an integrated Ganga development project
titled 'Namami Gange' and allocated 2,037 crore for this
purpose. The program has a budget outlay of Rs. 20,000
crore for the next 5 years.   This is a significant four-fold
increase over the expenditure in the past 30 years. The
Centre is also planning to establish a 4-battalion Ganga
Eco-Task Force.

Climate Change on the hydrological regime of the Indus,
Ganga and Brahmaputra river basins: a review of the
literature', which appeared in the International Journal of
Water Resources Development, 2015, it is stated that the
Ganga originates in the high-altitude areas of the
Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, with tributaries
flowing south from China, Nepal and India into the Indo-
Gangetic Plain. The Ganga merges with the Brahmaputra
in an extensive delta area in India and Bangladesh,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                              37</span>




finally emerging in the Bay of Bengal. The basin
encompasses     diverse   topography,    ecosystems     and
biodiversity, from the alpine arid rain-shadow areas of
the Tibetan Plateau through the steep topography of the
high mountains, including the world's highest point, Mt.
Everest (8848 m asl), to the flat plains.    Many studies
have shown an increasing trend in temperature in Ganga
Basin.

<p id="p_104">59.       In an article which appeared in New-York
Times written by George Black under the caption 'What it
Takes to Clean the Ganges' dated 25.7.2016, it has been
stated that hundreds of millions of Hindus, in India and
around the world, worship the Ganga. The Ganga is not
just a river but also a goddess.    The sixteenth-century
Mogul emperor Akbar called it "the water of immortality,"
and insisted on serving it at court. In 1615, Nicholas
Withington, one of the earliest English travellers in India,
wrote that water from the Ganga "will never stinke,
though kept never so longe, neyther will anye wormes or
vermine    breede    therein."       Like   most     Indian
municipalities, Uttarkashi--a grimy cement-and-cinder-
block town of eighteen thousand--has no proper means
of disposing of garbage. Instead, the waste is taken to an
open dump site, where, after a heavy rain, it washes into
the river. The Ganga absorbs more than a billion gallons
of waste each day, three-quarters of it raw sewage and
domestic waste and the rest industrial effluent, and is
one of the ten most polluted rivers in the world.

that Mark Twain, upon visiting in the 1890s, quipped
that it is "older than history, older than tradition, older
even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them
put together!"    The Ganga River basin, according to
Colorado State University fluvial geoscientist Ellen Wohl,
supports   a   staggering   10    percent   of   the   world's
population. This includes all ways in which the water is
used for survival: for growing rice and other crops,
bathing, drinking, providing fish and other animals as a
food source, and more.      The pollution has also slowed
down or made stagnant many once free-flowing areas of
the Ganga. Stagnation is where the mosquitoes thrive,
and with mosquitoes comes malaria. The deadliest form
of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is on the rise in India,
and the worst may be yet to come.

<p id="p_106">61.        In addition to the above, the Court can also
take judicial notice of the fact that there is no proper
disposal of garbage strewn on the river banks. It is the
duty cast upon the municipal bodies to dispose of the
garbage in a scientific manner by setting up Garbage
Treatment Plants.    Accordingly, the Municipal Bodies,
throughout the State of Uttarakhand, are directed to
dispose of the garbage in scientific lines by setting up
Garbage Treatment Plants under the Municipal Solid

     on the banks of the river Ganga is considered to be
     one of the oldest human settlements in the world. It
     is the popular belief that the river Ganga is the
     purifier of all but we are now led to the situation that
     action has to be taken to prevent the pollution of the
     water of the river Ganga since we have reached a
     stage that any further pollution of the river water is
     likely to lead to a catastrophe. There are today large
     towns inhabited by millions of people on the banks of
     the river Ganga. There are also large industries on its
     banks. Sewage of the towns and cities on the banks
     of the river and the trade effluents of the factories
     and    other    industries    are   continuously   being
     discharged into the river. It is the complaint of the
     petitioner that neither the Government nor the people
     are giving adequate attention to stop the pollution of
     the river Ganga. Steps have, therefore, to be taken for
     the purpose of protecting the cleanliness of the
     stream in the river Ganga, which is in fact the life
     sustainer of a large part of the northern India.

<p id="p_108">19. The river Ganga is one of the greatest rivers of
the world, although its entire course in only 1560
miles from its source in Himalaya to the sea. There
are many rivers larger in shape and longer in size
but no river in the world has been so great as the
Ganga. It is great because to millions of people since
centuries it is the most sacred river, it is called
"Sursari" river of the Gods, Patitpawani' purifier of all
sins and 'Ganga Ma' Mother Ganga. To millions of
Hindus, it is the most sacred, most venerated river on
earth. According the Hindus belief and Mythology to
bathe in it is to wash away guilt, to drink the water,
having bathed in it, and to carry it away in
containers for those who may have not had the good
fortune to make the pilgrimage, to it, is meritorious.
To be cremated on its banks, or to die there, and to
have one's ashes cast in its waters is the the wish of
every Hindu. Many saints and sages have perused
their quest for knowledge and enlightenment on the
banks of the river Ganga. Its water has not only
purified the body and soul of the millions but it has
given fertile land to the country in Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar. Ganga has been used as means of water
transport for trade and commerce. The Indian
civilization of the Northern India thrived in the plains
of Ganga and most of the important towns and
places of pilgrimage are situated on its banks. The
river Ganga has been part of Hindu civilization. Pt.
Jawahar Lal Nehru who did not consider himself a
devout Hindu gave expression to his feelings for the
Ganga that is to be found in his will and Testament,
a short extract from which is as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                         41</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">     My desire to have a handful of my ashes
     thrown into the Ganga at Allahabad has no
     religious   significance,   so   far   as    1   am
     concerned. I have no religious sentiment in the
     matter. I have been attached to the Ganga
     and the Jamuna rivers in Allahabad ever
     since my childhood and, as I have grown
     older, this attachment has also grown. I have
     watched their varying moods as the seasons
     changed, and have often thought of the
     history and myth and tradition and song and
     story that have become attached to them
     through the long ages and become part of
     their flowing waters. The Ganga, especially,
     as the river of India, beloved of her people,
     round   which    are    intertwined    her   racial
     memories, her hopes and fears, her songs of
     triumph, her victories and her defeats. She
     has been a symbol of India's age-long culture
     and civilisation, ever-changing, ever-flowing,
     and yet ever the same Ganga. She reminds
     me of the snow-covered peaks and the deep
     valleys of the Himalayas, which I have loved
     so much, and of the rich and vast plains
     below, where my life and work have been
     cast.
</blockquote><p id="p_109">20. The river Ganga is the life line of millions of
people of India, Indian culture and civilization has
grown around it. This great river drains of eight
States of India, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana,
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar
and West Bengal. The Ganga has always been an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                         42</span>




integral part of the nation's history, cultures and
environment. It has been the source of sustenance for
the millions of people who have lived on its banks
from time immemorial.
</p>
<p id="p_110">21. Millions of our people in the Ganga drink its
water under an abiding faith and belief to purify
themselves to achieve moksha release from the cycle
of birth and death. It is tragic that the Ganga, which
has since time immemorial, purified the people is
being polluted by man in numerous ways, by
dumping of garbage, throwing carcass of dead
animals   and    discharge   of   effluents.   Scientific
investigations and survey reports have shown that
the Ganga which serves one-third of the India's
population is polluted by the discharge of municipal
sewage and the industrial effluents in the river. The
pollution of the river Ganga is affecting the life,
health, and ecology of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The
Government as well as Parliament both have taken a
number of steps to control the water pollution, but
nothing substantial has been achieved. I need not
refer to those steps as my learned brother has
referred to them in detail. No law or authority can
succeed in removing the pollution unless the people
cooperate. To my mind, it is the sacred duty of all
those who reside or carry on business around the
river Ganga to ensure the purity of Ganga. Tanneries
at Jajmau area near Kanpur have been polluting the
Ganga in a big way. This Court issued notices to
them but in spite of notices many industrialists have
not bothered either to respond to the notice or to take
elementary steps for the treatment of industrial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                               43</span>




      effluent before discharging the same into the river.
      We are therefore issuing the directions for the closure
      of those tanneries which have failed to take minimum
      steps required for the primary treatment of industrial
      effluent. We are conscious that closure of tanneries
      may bring unemployment, loss of revenue, but life,
      health and ecology have greater importance to the
      people."

<p id="p_112">      19. Consciousness for environmental protection is of
      recent origin. The United Nations Conference on

      and the follow-up action thereafter is spreading the
      awareness. Over thousands of years men had been

successfully exploiting the ecological system for his
sustenance but with the growth of population the
demand for land has increased and forest growth
has been and is being cut down and man has started
encroaching upon Nature and its assets. Scientific
developments have made it possible and convenient
for man to approach the places which were hitherto
beyond      his   ken.   The   consequences   of     such
interference with ecology and environment have now
came to be realised. It is necessary that the
Himalayas and the forest growth on the mountain
range should be left uninterfered with so that there
may be sufficient quantity of rain. The top soil may
be preserved without being eroded and the natural
setting of the area may remain intact. We had
commended earlier to the State of Uttar Pradesh as
also to the Union of India that afforestation activity
may be carried out in the whole valley and the hills.
We have been told that such activity has been
undertaken. We are not oblivious of the fact that
natural resources have got to be tapped for the
purposes of social development but one cannot forget
at the same time that tapping of resources have to be
done with requisite attention and care so that ecology
and environment may not be affected in any serious
way; there may not be any depletion of water
resources     and    long-term   planning     must    be
undertaken to keep up the national wealth. It has
always to be remembered that these are permanent
assets of mankind and are not intended to be
exhausted in one generation.

we need again the broad picture of water-related
diseases.   So,   because      of   these   two   tropical
characteristics -warmth ad poverty - a wider view
than in temperate lands is necessary. (P.331)

Water-borne diseases - The classical water-borne
diseases are due to highly infective organisms
where only rather few are needed to infect
someone, relative to the levels of pollution that
readily occur. The two chief ones have a high
mortality if untreated and are diseases which a
community is very anxious to escape: typhoid and
cholera. Both are relatively fragile organisms
whose sole reservoir is man.
</p>
<p id="p_117">These two diseases occur most dramatically as the
"common source out-break" where a community
water supply gets contaminated by faces from a
person suffering from, or carrying, one of the
infections. Many people drink the water and a
number of these fall ill from the infection at about
the same time.
</p>
<p id="p_118">Typhoid is the most cosmopolitan of the classical
water-borne infections. In man it produces a severe
high fever with generated systemic, more than
intestinal, symptoms. The bacteria are ingested
and very few are sufficient to infect. The typhoid
patient is usually too ill to go out polluting the water
and is not infective prior to falling sick. However, a
small proportion of those who recover clinically
continue to pass typhoid bacteria in their faces for
months or years; these carriers are the source of
water-borne infections. Gallstones predispose to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                48</span>




carrier state as the bacteria persist in the inflamed
gall bladder. In the tropics, lesions of Schistosoma
haematobium in the bladder also act as node of
infection, producing urinary typhoid carriers, whilst
rectal schistosomiasis combined with typhoid leads
to a persistent severe fever lasting many months.
Typhoid bacteria survive well in water but do not
multiply there.
</p>
<p id="p_119">Cholera is in some ways similar to typhoid, but its
causative bacteria are more fragile and the clinical
course is extremely dramatic. In classical cholera
the onset of diarrhea is sudden and its volume
immense so that the untreated victim has a high
probability of dying from dehydration within 24
hours or little more.
</p>
<p id="p_120">Several other infections are water borne but are
less   important        than        typhoid   and    cholera.
Leptospirosis,    due     to    a     spirochaete,   has   its
reservoir in wild rodents which pollute the water.
Leptospis can penetrate the skin as well as being
ingested. They produce jaundice and fever, called
'Weil's disease, which is severe but not common.
</p>
<p id="p_121">14. The amount of suffering which the members of
the public are likely to undergo by using highly
polluted water can be easily gathered from the
above extract.

      books written for the said purpose and distribute
      them to the educational institutions free of cost.
      Children should be taught about the need for
      maintaining   cleanliness       commencing     with   the
      cleanliness of the house both inside and outside,
      and of the streets in which they live. Clean
      surroundings lead to healthy body and healthy

for permitting him to collect slurry from the raiyati
land. These petitions were dismissed on the ground of
existence of dispute relating to the title of the land.
</blockquote><p id="p_124">The Petitioner filed a Writ Petition C.W.J.C. No. 887 of
1990 in the High Court of Patna for taking action
against the Deputy Commissioner, Hazaribagh for
implementing the Full Bench judgment of the Patna
High Court in <a href="/doc/78445/" id="a_62">Kundori Labour Co-operative Society

Consequently the collection of slurry which escaped
from the washeries could be settled by the State
Government with any person without obtaining the
sanction of the Central Government. The Petitioner has
been contending before the High Court that the slurry
which was discharged from washeries did not belong
to the Company and he was entitled to collect the
same. Since the Respondent-company prevented the
Petitioner from collecting slurry from its land and as it
further refused to sell any additional quantity of
slurry to him, he entertained grudge against the
Respondent-company. In order to feed fat his personal
grudge he has taken several proceedings against the
Respondent-company          including     the      present
proceedings. These facts are quite apparent from the
pleadings of the parties and the documents placed
before the Court. In fact, there is intrinsic evidence in
the petition itself that the primary purpose of filing this
petition is not to serve any public interest instead it is
in self interest as would be clear from the prayer
made by the Petitioner in the interim stay application.
The Petitioner claimed interim stay application. The
Petitioner claimed interim relief from this Court
permitting him to arrest/collect sludge/slurry flowing
out of the washeries of the Respondents Nos. 4 and 5

and other authorities for not preventing him from
collecting the sludge/slurry and transporting the

      Petitioner clearly indicates that he is interested in
      collecting the slurry and transporting the same for the
      purposes of his business. As already stated a Full
      Bench of the Patna High Court held that the slurry
      was not coal and the provisions of the Mines and
      Mineral (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_64">Development) Act</a>, 1957 were
      not applicable, the State Government was free to
      settle the same and the Tata Steel &amp; Iron Co. had no
      right to collect the slurry which escaped from its
      washeries. The Respondent-company filed an appeal
      before this Court. During the pendency of the
      aforesaid appeal, the Petitioner filed the present
      petition. The appeal preferred by the Tata Iron &amp; Steel
      Co. Ltd. and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. was allowed by
      this Court and the judgment of Patna High Court was
      set aside. The judgment of this Court is reported in JT

      human and healthy environment. Environmental
      protection, therefore has now become a matter of
      grave    concern     for   human   existence.   Promoting
      environmental protection implies maintenance of the
      environment as a whole comprising the man-made
      and the natural environment. Therefore, there is a
      constitutional imperative on the State Government
      and the municipalities, not only to ensure and safe-
      guard proper environment but also ah imperative
      duty to take adequate measures to promote, protect
      and improve the environment man-made and the

<p id="p_127">67.        Their Lordships of Hon. Supreme Court in
'Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_72">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India
and others</a>' (1996) 5 SCC Page 281, have held that High
Courts must shoulder greater responsibilities in taking
up local issues of which they can have closer awareness
and easy monitoring such as ecological matters in their
respective States in the light of law laid down by the
Supreme Court. This would ensure that the orders
passed are effective and complied with. Their Lordships
further held that the enactment of a law, but tolerating
its infringement, is worse than not enacting law at all.
The continued infringement of law, over a period of time,
is made possible by adoption of such means which are
best known to the violators of law. Continued tolerance of
such violations of law not only renders legal provisions
nugatory      but   such    tolerance    by   the   Enforcement
Authorities encourages lawlessness and adoption of
means which cannot, or ought not to, be tolerated in any
civilized society. Their Lordships have further held that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                55</span>




with rapid industrialisation taking place, there is an
increasing threat to the maintenance of the ecological
balance. The primary effort of the Court, while dealing
with the environmental related issues, is to see that the
enforcement agencies, whether it be the State or any
other authority, take effective steps for the enforcement
of the laws. The Courts, in a way, act as the guardian of
the people's fundamental rights but in regard to many
technical matters, the Courts may not be fully equipped.
In paragraph nos.26, 28 and 41, it was held as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">     "26. Enactment of a law, but tolerating its
     infringement, is worse than not enacting law at all.
     The continued infringement of law, over a period of
     time, is made possible by adoption of such means
     which are best known to the violators of law.</blockquote>
<p id="p_128">     Continued tolerance of such violations of law not
     only renders legal provisions nugatory but such
     tolerance    by    the     Enforcement        Authorities
     encourages lawlessness and adoption of means
     which cannot, or ought not to, be tolerated in any
     civilized society. Law should not only be meant for
     law abiding but is meant to be obeyed by all for
     whom it has been enacted. A law is usually
     enacted because the Legislature feels that it is
     necessary. It is with a view to protect and
     preserve the environment and save it for the future
     generations and to ensure good quality of life that
     the Parliament enacted the Anti-Pollution Laws,
     namely,     the   <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_73">Water    Act</a>,   <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_74">Air   Act</a>    and   the
     <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_75">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_76">These Act</a>s
     and Rules framed and the Notification issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                           56</span>




thereunder     contain   provisions   which   prohibit
and/or regulate certain activities with a view to
protect and preserve the environment. When a law
is enacted containing some provisions which
prohibits certain types of activities, then, it is of
utmost importance that such legal provisions are
effectively enforced. If a law is enacted but is not
being voluntarily obeyed, then, it has to be
enforced. Otherwise, infringement of law, which is
actively or passively condoned for personal gain,
will be encouraged which will in turn lead to a
lawless society. Violation of anti-pollution laws not
only adversely affects the existing quality of life
but the non-enforcement of the legal provisions
often   results   in     ecological   imbalance   and
degradation of environment, the adverse affect of
which will have to be borne by the future
generations.
</p>
<p id="p_129">28. There is no challenge to the validity of main
Notification. Counsel for all the parties are agreed
that the main Notification is valid and has to be
enforced. Instances have been given by the
petitioner as well as some of the interveners where
in different States, infringement of the main
Notification is taking place but no action has been
taken by the authorities concerned. The courts are
ill-equipped and it is not their function to see day
to day enforcement of law. This is an executive
function which it is bound to discharge. A public
interest litigation like the present, would not have
been necessary if the authorities, as well as the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                        57</span>




people concerned, had voluntarily obeyed and/or
complied with the main Notification or if the
authorities   who    were    entrusted   with   the
responsibility, had enforced the main Notification.
It is play the failure of enforcement of this
Notification which has led to the filing of the
present petition. The effort of this Court while
dealing with public interest litigation relating to
environmental issues, is to see that the executive
authorities take steps for implementation and
enforcement of law. As such the Court has to pass
orders and give directions for the protection of the
fundamental rights of the people. Passing of
appropriate orders requiring the implementation of
the law cannot be regarded as the Court having
usurped the functions of the Legislature or the
Executive. The orders are passed and directions
are issued by the Court in discharge of its judicial
function namely; to see that if there is a complaint
by a petitioner regarding the infringement of any
Constitutional or other legal right, as a result of
any wrong action or inaction on the part of the
State, then such wrong should not be permitted to
continue. It is by keeping the aforesaid principles
in mind that one has to consider as to what
directions should be issued to ensure, in the best
possible manner, that the provision of the main
Notification which has been issued for preserving
the coastal areas are not infringed.

<p id="p_130">41. With rapid industrialisation taking place,
there is an increasing threat to the maintenance of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                              58</span>




the ecological balance. The general public is
becoming     aware      of        the    need    to    protect
environment. Even though, laws have been passed
for the protection of environment, the enforcement
of the same has been tardy, to say the least. With
the governmental authorities not showing any
concern with the enforcement of the said Acts, and
with the development taking place for personal
gains at the expense of environment and with
disregard to the mandatory provisions of law,
some public spirited persons have been initiating
public   interest   litigations.        The   legal   position
relating to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Courts
for preventing environmental degradation and
thereby, seeking to protect the fundamental rights
of the citizens, is now well settled by various
decisions of this Court. The primary effort of the
Court, while dealing with               the environmental
related issues, is to see that the enforcement
agencies, whether it be the State or any other
authority, take effective steps for the enforcement
of the laws. The Courts, in a way, act as the
guardian of the people's fundamental rights but in
regard to many technical matters, the Courts may
not be fully equipped. Perforce, it has to rely on
outside agencies for reports and recommendations
whereupon orders have been passed from time to
time. Even though, it is not the function of the
Court to see the day to day enforcement of the
law, that being the function of the Executive, but
because of the non-functioning of the enforcement
agencies, the Courts as of necessity have had to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                    59</span>




      pass orders directing the enforcement agencies to

<p id="p_131">68.              Their Lordships of Hon. Supreme Court in
'<a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_77">Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union of India and
others</a>' (1996) 5 SCC Page 647, have held that while the
industries are vital for country's development, but having
regard      to     pollution    caused     by   them,   principle    of
Sustainable Development has to be adopted as a
balancing          concept.     "Precautionary      Principle"      and
"Polluter Pays Principle" are acceptable as part of the law
of    country         and      should     be    implemented.        The
precautionary environmental measures should be taken
by the State Government and statutory authorities and
lack of scientific certainty cannot be a ground for
postponing such measures where there are serious
threats to ecology. The discharge of untreated effluent by
tanneries in the State renders the river water unfit for
human consumption, contaminating the subsoil water
and spoiling the physico-chemical properties of the soil
making it unfit for agricultural purposes.                 Such an
industry cannot be permitted to continue their operation
unless they set up pollution control devices.                    Their
Lordships, in paragraph nos.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20 and
24, have held as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">      "9.        It is no doubt correct that the leather industry
      in India has become a major foreign exchange
      earner and at present Tamil Nadu is the leading
      exporter        of    finished     leather   accounting    for
      approximately 80% of the country's export. Though

</blockquote>
<p id="p_132">10. The traditional concept that development and
ecology are opposed to each other, is no longer
acceptable.     "Sustainable    Development"    is   the
answer. In the International sphere "Sustainable
Development" as a concept came to be known for
the first time in the Stockholm Declaration of 1972.
Thereafter, in 1987 the concept was given a
definite shape by the World Commission on
Environment and Development in its report called
"Our   Common      Future".     The   Commission     was
chaired by the then Prime Minister of Norway Ms.
G.N. Brundtland       and as such the report is
popularly known as "Brundtland Report". In 1991
the World Conservation Union, United Nations
Environment Programme and World Wide Fund for
Nature, jointly came out with a document called
"Caring for the Earth" which is a strategy for
sustainable living. Finally, came the Earth Summit
held in June, 1992 at Rio which saw the largest
gathering of world leaders ever in the history -
deliberating and chalking out a blue print for the
survival   of   the   planet.    Among    the   tangible
achievements of the Rio Conference was the
signing of two conventions, one on biological
diversity and another on climate change. These
conventions were signed by 153 nations. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                              61</span>




delegates also approved by consensus three non
binding     documents        namely,     a   Statement       on
Forestry Principles, a declaration of principles on
environmental policy and development initiatives
and Agenda 21, a programme of action into the
next century in areas like poverty, population and
pollution. During the two decades from Stockholm
to Rio "Sustainable Development" has come to be
accepted as a viable concept to eradicate poverty
and improve the quality of human life while living
within the carrying capacity of the supporting eco-
systems. "Sustainable Development" as defined by
the Brundtland Report means "development that
meets      the     needs     of   the     present      without
compromising the ability of the future generations
to meet their won needs". We have no hesitation in
holding    that      "Sustainable      Development'     as    a
balancing        concept      between        ecology      and
development has been accepted as a part of the
Customary International Law though its salient
features      have     yet   to   be    finalised   by       the
International Law jurists.
</p>
<p id="p_133">11. Some of the salient principles of "Sustainable
Development", as culled-out from Brundtland Report
and   other      international    documents,     are     Inter-
Generational Equity, Use and Conservation of
Natural Resources, Environmental Protection, the
Precautionary Principle, Polluter Pays principle,
Obligation to assist and cooperate, Eradication of
Poverty and Financial Assistance to the developing
countries. We are, however, of the view that "The
Precautionary Principle" and "The Polluter Pays"
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                 62</span>
<p id="p_134">principle are essential features of "Sustainable
Development". The "Precautionary Principle" - in the
context of the municipal law - means :
</p>
<p id="p_135">(i)    Environmental        measures           -    by     the     State
Government and the statutory authorities - must
anticipate,     prevent     and        attack       the    causes     of
environmental degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_136">(ii)   Where     there    are        threats       of    serious     and
irreversible damage, lack of scientific certainty
should not be used as a reason for postponing
measures to prevent environmental degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_137">(iii) The "Onus of proof is on the actor or the
developer/industrialist to show that his action is
environmentally benign.
</p>
<p id="p_138">12. "The Polluter Pays" principle has been held to be
a sound principle by this Court in Indian Council for
Enviro - <a href="/doc/77633/" id="a_78">Legal Act</a>ion v. Union of India, J.T. (1996) 2
</p><p id="p_139">196. The Court observed, "We are of the opinion that
any principle evolved in this behalf should be
simple, practical and suited to the conditions
obtaining in this country". The Court ruled that
"Once the activity carried on is hazardous or
inherently dangerous, the person carrying on such
activity is liable to make good the loss caused to any
other person by his activity irrespective of the fact
whether he took reasonable care while carrying on
his activity. The rule is premised upon the very
nature of the activity carried on". Consequently the
polluting      industries    are        "absolutely         liable    to
compensate for the harm caused by them to
villagers in the affected area, to the soil and to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                          63</span>




underground water and hence, they are bound to
take all necessary measures to remove sludge and
other pollutants lying in the affected areas". The
"Polluter Pays" principle as interpreted by this Court
means that the absolute liability for harm to the
environment extends not only to compensate the
victims of pollution but also the cost of restoring the
environmental    degradation.   Remediation    of   the
damaged environment is part of the process of
"Sustainable Development" and as such polluter is
liable to pay the cost to the individual sufferers as
well as the cost of reversing the damaged ecology.
</p>
<p id="p_140">13. The Precautionary Principle and the Polluter
Pays Principle have been accepted as part of the law

<p id="p_144">Apart from the constitutional mandate to protect and

under the control of the Governments concerned. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_89">The
Water Act</a> prohibits the use of streams and wells for
disposal of polluting matters. Also provides for
restrictions on outlets and discharge of effluents
without      obtaining      consent     from    the     Board.

include sentence of imprisonment. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_90">The Air Act</a>

</p>
<p id="p_145">14.      In view of the above mentioned constitutional
and statutory provisions we have no hesitation in
holding that the precautionary principle and the
polluter pays principle are part of the environmental
law of the country.
</p>
<p id="p_146">20.      It is thus obvious that the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_95">Environment Act</a>
contains useful provisions for controlling pollution.
The main purpose of the Act is to create an authority
or authorities under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_96">Section 3(3)</a> of the Act with
adequate powers to control pollution and protect the
environment. It is a pity that till date no authority
has been constituted by the Central Government.
The work which is required to be done by an
authority in terms of <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_97">Section 3(3)</a> read with other
provisions of the Act is being done by this Court and
the other Courts in the country. It is high time that
the Central Government realises its responsibility
and      statutory    duty    to   protect        the     degrading
environment in the country. If the conditions in the
five districts of Tamil Nadu, where tanneries are
operating, are permitted to continue then in the near
future     all    rivers/canals      shall         be      polluted,
underground          waters   contaminated,              agricultural
lands turned barren and the residents of the area
exposed      to   serious     diseases.      It    is,     therefore,
necessary for this Court to direct the Central
Government to take immediate action under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_98">Environment Act</a>.

'<a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_100">M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath and others</a>' (2000) 6 SCC Page
213, have held that causing disturbance to ecological
balance would be hazardous to 'life' within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_101">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It was further
held that even exemplary damages can be imposed as a
deterrent      for     causing     pollution        and     environment
degradation.         In paragraph no.24, Their Lordships held
as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">      "24.   Pollution is a civil wrong. By its very nature,
      it is a Tort committed against the community as a
      whole. A person, therefore, who is guilty of causing
      pollution has to pay damages (compensation) for
      restoration of the environment and ecology. He has
      also to pay damages to those who have suffered
      loss on account of the act of the offender. The
      powers of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_102">Article 32</a> are not
      restricted and it can award damages in a PIL or a

      as a deterrent for others not to cause pollution in
      any manner. Unfortunately, notice for exemplary
      damages was not issued to M/s. Span Motel
      although it ought to, have been issued. The
      considerations for which "fine" can be imposed upon

      notice be issued to M/s. Span Motel to show cause
      why in addition to damages, exemplary damages be

<p id="p_149">70.          About 300 billion liters of untreated sewage
flows into river Ganga per day.           It is the sixth most
polluted river in the world. People urinate and defecate
on the banks of river. Cattle owners bring their animals
for bathing in river Ganga.          People spit on the Ghats.
Mark Twin famously said: "Benares is older than history,
older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks
twice as old as all of them could together".

<p id="p_150">71.          The presence of beggars is also a disgusting
site. There about 100 towns and thousands of villages
situate along the banks of Ganga. There is an emergent
need to restore ecological flow of water and to prevent
waste water i.e. sewage and industrial wastes from
entering the river.      River Ganga covers 26 percent of

country's landmass and supports 23 percent of its
population. The launching of schemes to clean Ganga,
till, date, have not delivered any tangible result. There is
lack of monitoring of all the ongoing projects and the
multiplicity of bodies/authorities has further impeded
the Clean Ganga Projects. Rhetoric alone is not sufficient
to clean the Ganga.       The agencies, working to save
Ganga, must have an umbrella organization. There is an
urgent need for Inter-governmental Consultation to save
river Ganga. <a href="/doc/1331118/" id="a_103">Article 263</a> of the Constitution of India
provides for Inter-State Council. It reads as under: -

<p id="p_151">72.        <a href="/doc/1331118/" id="a_104">Article 263</a> of the Constitution visualizes for
the setting up of an inter-State Council for settlement of

<p id="p_152">73.        In the report of the National Council to Review
the Working of the Constitution (submitted to the
Government      in   March,        2002),   the   Committee
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                   69</span>




recommended for setting up of an inter-State Council
called "Inter-Governmental Council (IGC)" which should
be charged with the duties set out in clauses (a) and (b)
of <a href="/doc/1331118/" id="a_105">Article 263</a>, other than socio-economic planning and
development.
</p>
<p id="p_153">74.        In order to save Ganga from extinction, it is
desirable to have an inter-State Council under <a href="/doc/1331118/" id="a_106">Article
263</a> of the Constitution of India to consider and
recommend the guiding policies in regard to the matters
concerning      the   pollution    of   river   Ganga     including
preventive as well as remedial environmental ecological
matters.     River Ganga originates from the State of
Uttarakhand, then it flows down to the States of Uttar
Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal.                  All the
Chief Ministers of the riparian States can be inducted as
members of the inter-State Council along with various
experts in the field of ecology, environment, irrigation etc.
The Council, so constituted, shall be responsible for
making recommendations to the Central Government. It
shall always be open to the Central Government to
consider the recommendations made by the Council to
save river Ganga in the right perspective.                       Their
Lordships of Hon. Apex Court in the case of '<a href="/doc/1651190/" id="a_107">Dabur India
Ltd. &amp; another v. State of U.P. &amp; another</a>' (1990) 4 S.C.C.
Page 113, have observed that the government should
consider feasibility of setting up of a machinery under a
Council    to   be    formed      under   <a href="/doc/1331118/" id="a_108">Article   263</a>     of    the
Constitution to adjudicate and adjust the dues of the
respective governments.        Their Lordships have held as
under: -
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                         70</span>
<p id="p_154">"31. Before we part with this case, two aspects have

to be adverted to -- one was regarding the allegation
of the petitioner that in order to compel the petitioners
to pay the duties which the petitioners contended
that they were not liable to pay, the licence was not
being renewed for a period and the petitioners were
constantly kept under threat of closing down their
business in order to coerce them to make the
payment. This is unfortunate. We would not like to
hear from a litigant in this country that the
government is coercing citizens of this country to
make payment of duties which the litigant is
contending not to be leviable. Government, of course,
is entitled to enforce payment and for that purpose to
take all legal steps but the government, Central or
State, cannot be permitted to play dirty games with
the citizens of this country to coerce them in making
payments which the citizens were not legally obliged
to make. If any money is due to the government, the
government should take steps but not take extra-
legal steps or manoeuvre. Therefore, we direct that
the right of renewal of the petitioner of licence must
be judged and attended to in accordance with law
and the occasion not utilised to coerce the petitioners
to a course of action not warranted by law and
procedure. Secondly, in a situation of this nature, we
are of the opinion that the government should
consider feasibility of setting up of a machinery
under a Council to be formed under <a href="/doc/1331118/" id="a_109">Article 263</a> of the
Constitution to adjudicate and adjust the dues of the
respective governments. In these peculiar facts, it
appears that the dispute is under two different
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                 71</span>




      Central   legislations    and   under    one   the   State
      authorities will realise and impose the taxes on
      finding on certain bases and under the other the
      same transaction may be open to imposition by
      Central Government authorities on a particular view
      of the matter. In such a situation, how and wherein
      the refund should be made of any duty paid in
      respect of part of a transaction to one of the
      authorities, the State or the Centre, to be adjusted
      should be the subject matter of a settlement by the
      Council to be set up under <a href="/doc/1331118/" id="a_110">Article 263</a> of the
      Constitution. This is a matter on which we draw the
      attention of the concerned authorities for examination
      because <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_111">Section 3</a> of the 1955 Act and <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_112">Section 3</a> of
      the 1944 Act may overlap similar transaction in
      certain cases."
</p>
<p id="p_155">75.        Billions     of   rupees   have    been   spent   for
restoration of quality of water of river Ganga. However,
the fact of the matter is that the quality of water of river
Ganga, instead of being restored as per the norms, has
further deteriorated.
</p>
<p id="p_156">76.        All the rivers have the basic right to maintain
their purity and to maintain free and natural flow. River
Ganga is flowing since time immemorial. It has provided us
drinking water and irrigated our lands. River Ganga is the
soul of India. In our National Anthem, there is a reference
of most sacred rivers Ganga and Yamuna, which shows our
respect and cultural values for the rivers. However, the fact
of the matter is that we have polluted her soul by
permitting the pollutants to be discharged into the
river without treatment.         We have to change our
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                72</span>




rituals with the passage of time in order to maintain the
purity of water of river Ganga. One or two generations
cannot be permitted to pollute the rivers and to destroy
their free and natural flow. The rivers must exist in their
pristine glory for coming generations. The Courts cannot
permit impairment of water quality of rivers.
</p>
<p id="p_157">77.         The legislation, till now, has not helped to save
Ganga.     We need a comprehensive legislation at the
national level dealing with the Ganga alone.                  The
implementation of laws is as important as framing of
laws. Whosoever pollutes the rivers, infringes the human
rights of others. There is an urgent need not to promote
water based heavy industries like sugarcane, pulp paper
etc. in the close vicinity of river Ganga. Henceforth, no
commercial establishment should be permitted on the
river banks where more than fifty persons are employed
without Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) or Effluent
Treatment Plants.      We should not permit throwing of
cloth, plastic and huge quantity of flowers in the rivers.
The State is required to make endeavour to protect and
improve the environment and to safeguard the forests
and wild life of the country under <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_113">Article 47</a> of the
Constitution of India. It is the fundamental duty of all of
us, under <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_114">Article 51-A</a> of the Constitution of India, to
protect and improve the natural environment including
forests,   lakes,   rivers   and    wild   life,   and   to   have
compassion for living creatures.
</p>
<p id="p_158">78.         The     Court,   though,       cannot    direct    the
Legislature to frame the laws, but since, there is an
emergency to protect the river Ganga from extinction, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                               73</span>




Court can, at least, make a suggestion to the Union of
India to make national law to protect river Ganga.
