                 contract labours numbering 30 without obtaining Labour Licence from the

                 Assistant Labour Commissioner(Central), Chennai. Hence, the complaint.



</p><p id="p_4">                          2.1. The learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted

                 that the respondent is a Labour Enforcement Officer and lodged a

                 complaint without any sanction obtained as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section

                 197</a> Cr.P.c. and filed the complaint before the Magistrate. The Magistrate

                 without even considering whether the prosecution was initiated after

                 obtaining sanction or not mechanically have taken cognizance and issued

                 summons to the petitioner. The petitioner is a public servant under the

                 of TEXCO i.e. Tamil Nadu Ex-Servicemen Corporation Limited, hereinafter

                 called TEXCO, the undertaking of the Government of Tamil Nadu. While

                 discharging his official duty, he failed to obtain Labour Licence to engage

                 contract labours and as such while discharging his official duty, the

                 offence was committed. Therefore, necessarily the respondent ought to

                 have obtained sanction as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. to

                 Undertaking is including the TEXCO and the General Manager of the

                 TEXCO is a public servant coming under the State Government.

                 petitioner under the alleged violation as under the Contract Labourer

                 (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970.   In this regard, he also cited the

                 judgment of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in Crl.Petition No.851 of

                 2005 in the case of Sri Victor Joseph and Anr. Vs. the State rep. by

                 person to lodge a complaint against the petitioner. Further she submitted

                 that the petitioner does not have any immunity under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C.

                 for the reason that the petitioner is not a public servant. The petitioner is

                 engaged in contractual work with IIT which is a Central Government

                 organisation and as such the sanction required under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_11">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C.

                 does not arise.

</p><p id="p_9">                          4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned

                 counsel for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">                          5.The respondent lodged the complaint under Section 23 of the

                 Contract Labourer (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 for the offences

                 punishable under <a href="/doc/140882/" id="a_13">Section 12(1)</a> of the same Act.        The petitioner is the

                 sole accused in the complaint.     The crux of the allegation is that the

                 petitioner failed to obtain licence from the Assistant Labour Commissioner

                 (Central), Chennai for engaging contract labours numbering 30 for the

                 contractual work with IIT, Chennai.       It is also seen that infringements

                 found on the inspection of the respondent and issued show cause notice

                 to the petitioner. After receipt of the same, the petitioner did not reply

                 and hence the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">                          6.The learned counsel for the petitioner raised two grounds. The

                 first one is that the petitioner is the General Manager of the TEXCO and it

                 is completely controlled by the Government of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, he

                 is a Government servant of Tamil Nadu and as such the respondent is

                 being the Central Government has no power to initiate any complaint. In

                 this regard, the <a href="/doc/1360938/" id="a_14">Section 2(1)(a)</a> of the said Act is extracted as follows:




http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                              7</span>

                          establishment is situated."



</pre><p id="p_15">                             7.In the case on hand, the TEXCO Limited is functioning within

                 the State of Tamil Nadu and it is an establishment of which the

                 appropriate Government is not the Central Government. As contemplated

                 under <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_16">Section 2(1)</a> (a) of the said Act provides that in respect of certain

                 establishment the appropriate Government would be Central Government.

                 Therefore, the complaint lodged by the respondent of the Central

                 Government is not maintainable as against the petitioner.



</p><p id="p_16">                             8.The second point raised by the petitioner is that the petitioner

                 presently is a contractor and he has been executing the work of security

                 work at IIT, Chennai by employing 30 contract labours.                  He has been

                 deputed as General Manager of TEXCO and he is a public servant under

                 the Government of Tamil Nadu.               While he was discharging his duty to

                 Cr.P.C. A reading of <a href="/doc/1235626/" id="a_18">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/198523/" id="a_19">5</a> of Cr.P.C. would make it clear that

                 the provisions<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure are very much applicable

                 for investigation, enquiry or trial otherwise while dealing with the offence.

                 In the case on hand, Section 23 of the Contract Labourer (Regulation and

                 Abolition) Act, 1970 provides as to who is competent to present the

                 private complaint in respect of the offence committed by the contractor.

                 <a href="/doc/708192/" id="a_21">Section 23</a> of the said Act reads as follows:

                          the moment the offence under the 1974 Act is alleged against the
                          Head of the Department of a government department. It is a
                          rebuttable presumption and under the proviso to <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_38">Section 48</a>, the Head
                          of the Department will get an opportunity to demonstrate that the
                          offence was committed without his knowledge or that in spite of due
                          diligence to prevent the commission of such an offence, the same
                          came to be committed. It is far different from saying that the
