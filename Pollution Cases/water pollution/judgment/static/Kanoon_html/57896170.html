<p id="p_1">               Both the present petitions are filed by the petitioners under Articles
         14, 19, 21 and 226 of the Constitution of India as well as for challenging
         the notifications under sec. 144<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1"> of the Criminal Procedure Code</a> dated
         21.6.2016 and 20.7.2016, on the grounds stated in the memo of petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         2.    Heard learned counsel Shri BC Dave as well as learned counsel
         Shri Bhushan Oza appearing for the petitioners and learned Government
         Pleader Ms. Manisha Lavkumar Shah appearing with learned AGP Shri
         Amit Barot as well as learned AGP Shri VR Jani.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         3.    Learned counsel Shri Dave referred to the notification and
         submitted that the Jt. Commissioner of Police has issued the notification
         which is exceeding the jurisdiction and the power. He emphasised that
         the provisions of sec. 144 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">CrPC</a> for issuance of such notification is for
         2 months whereas it is for more than 2 months exceeding the duration.
         He also submitted that the right of the petitioners is also violated and
         successive issuance of such notification may not be permitted. In support
         of his submission has referred to and relied upon the observations made
         by Hon'ble Apex Court in a judgment reported in (1983) 4 SCC 522 in
         the case of <a href="/doc/798012/" id="a_3">Acharya Jagdishwaranand Avadhuta and ors.                                     v.
         Commissioner of Police, Calcutta</a> and anr. He also submitted that it

         qua the height cannot be prohibited or restricted. He submitted that if
         such restrictions are imposed, it could affect their fundamental right and
         he also referred to the judgment of the co-ordinate bench of the High
         Court (Coram: Abhilasha Kumari, J.) in Special Civil Application No.
         6750 of 2011 dated 25.8.2011 and referred to the observations made
         therein and submitted that the present petition may be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         4.    Learned counsel Shri Bhushan Oza supported the submissions
         made by learned counsel Shri Dave and submitted that the right to life
         under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Art. 21</a> gives the right to make such idols and earn their livelihood
         for which there cannot be any restriction as to the manner or the height of
         such idols. He submitted that both the material to be used like POP or
         clay cannot be restricted or prohibited and also the height of the idols
         cannot be restricted. He further submitted that it is also offending <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Art. 14</a>
         inasmuch as if it is made in certain areas there is a notification under sec.
         144 whereas in another area there is no such restriction and therefore it
         affects the right of the petitioners who are making such idols and have a
         right to transport and sell elsewhere also where there is no such
         prohibition or restriction by any such notification issued under sec. 144 of
         <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">CrPC</a>. Learned counsel Shri Oza referred to the background of facts and
         submitted that any such restrictions affect the fundamental right to carry
         on trade or business. Lastly learned counsel Shri Oza has stated that at
         least for this year where they have started making such idols since long, if
         that notification is implemented it may adversely affect them. They have
         also voiced their apprehension about the action that may be taken under
         sec. 188 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">CrPC</a>. He has also stated that this is without prejudice to the
         rights of the petitioners to challenge the fresh notification which has been
         issued.

         well as the affidavit-in-reply filed by the Collector. She submitted that

         the submissions with regard to violation of fundamental right is
         misconceived and submitted that it is always subject to reasonable
         restrictions. She submitted that there is no total prohibition or ban either
         on use of POP or sale and marketing of such idols.                      However, she
         submitted that depending upon the exigencies in respective districts such
         notifications are issued and therefore there cannot be any universal
         application. Learned Government Pleader Ms. Shah has also submitted
         that the right of the petitioner has to be considered vis-a-vis public
         interest or the right of the society as a whole. She submitted that about
         40,000 such idols of POP are immersed in the water and therefore the
         Corporation has been making arrangement of artificial water bodies
         where the immersion could take place which in turn will be collected and
         taken to the high sea. She pointedly referred to the observations made in
         the order of the National Green Tribunal, Bhopal Bench, on this issue
         directing the State Governments to issue some guidelines. She submitted
         that it has been specifically observed with regard to the possible damage
         which has been considered. Similarly, learned Government Pleader Ms.
         Shah referred to the observations made in the order of the National Green
         Tribunal produced at Annexure-R/1 to the affidavit-in-reply in Special
         Civil Application No. 14394 of 2016.                 She has emphasized the
         observations made in para 49 which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "We expect that the Pollution Control Boards or the State
               Government would also decide and set out norms/benchmark for
               the heights of Pop idols which are to be ultimately immersed, in
               accordance with the nature of the immersion places, even though
               PoP is not found to be an "environment pollutant". For example,
               the idols to be immersed into sea water may not be of more than 8-
               10 ft. height and the idols to be immersed in ponds may not be of
               more than 5 ft. height, so on and so forth. So also, the local bodies
               may be required to create artificial ponds, in the absence of
               appropriate water resources like ponds, lakes, etc. for temporary
               purpose of immersion of PoP idols."

</p><p id="p_7">         6.     As regards the authority or jurisdiction of the Commissioner, she
         has referred to the notification at Annexure R/2 dated 8.11.1982 and
         submitted that the Commissioner of Police or Jt. Commissioner of Police
         or Superintendent of Police are empowered by this notification to
         exercise the powers under sec. 144 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">CrPC</a>. She submitted that on the
         aspect of duration also depending upon the exigencies the notification has
         been issued afresh for which there cannot be any objection. Learned
         Government Pleader Ms. Shah, therefore, submitted that the present
         petitions may not be entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         7.     In rejoinder, learned counsel Shri Oza submitted that let there be
         some kind of either statutory provision in the form of law or uniform
         guidelines and till then the exercise of power under sec. 144 is not
         justified.   He submitted that at lest for the present year where the
         petitioners have already made the idols may not have to suffer and some
         suitable observations/directions may be given.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         8.     In view of these rival submissions, it is required to be considered
         whether the present petitions deserve consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_10">         9.     The first aspect as regards the jurisdiction or authority of the
         Commissioner of Police or Jt. Commissioner of Police to issue such
         notification is squarely answered in view of the notification dated
         8.11.1982 produced with the affidavit-in-reply filed by the State.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         10.    Another facet of the submission which has been emphasised
         referring to the right to earn livelihood under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_9">Art. 21</a> and Art 14 require a
         closer scrutiny. In fact, such submissions are thoroughly misconceived
         inasmuch as there is no prohibition, restriction on their right to earn
         livelihood while making such idols or selling or transporting them.
         Again, there cannot be any fundamental right to make idols or a thing of a

         particular material only of a particular size or height inasmuch as there
         could be a reasonable restriction. It is well accepted that the right under
         <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_10">Art. 19</a> of freedom of trade or business cannot be claimed in absolute
         terms as it is always subject to reasonable restrictions as envisaged while
         framing the Constitution. Further, there is no restriction or prohibition to
         earn livelihood and if with the passage of time such right is required to be
         regulated it would also not offend <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_11">Art. 19</a> or 21. An example can be cited
         with reference to the right to earn livelihood by hawking which is also
         considered vis-a-vis the right of the public and public nuisance and it has
         been well accepted that it has to be subject to reasonable restrictions
         while accepting the right of such people to earn their livelihood by street
         vending or hawking.
</p>
<p id="p_12">         11.   Therefore, such submissions which have been made in absolute
         terms claiming the right that the idols of PoP could be made or it can be
         of a particular height which is not restricted in certain areas and it is
         restricted in certain areas by issuance of such notifications under sec. 114
         of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">CrPC</a> and therefore it violates <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Art. 14</a> is throughly misconceived. In
         fact, it depends upon the exigencies as well as the relevant factors like
         nuisance, possible damage to natural water bodies and therefore there is
         no restriction or prohibition. All that is provided is that the idols of PoP
         could be immersed in a particular place created for that purpose by the
         Corporation which in turn will collect such debris or remains of such
         immersion and carry to high sea or other place so that it is disposed of.
         Again, for that the Corporation or the authority has to create such
         artificial water bodies which may have some limited area and therefore
         depending upon the technical aspects the restriction may have been
         placed on the size of the idols. Further, as stated in the affidavit-in-reply,
         there may be high tension wire passing on the road and when such big
         idols are being transported it will not be in public interest and therefore
         considering the aspect of public safety, public interest and/or public

         nuisance necessary guidelines have been issued by the National Green
         Tribunal which have been referred to and in fact it is on the basis of such
         directions issued the State authorities have taken positive steps in public
         interest and no fault could be found. In fact, it is a matter of change of
         mindset or attitude which is required to be considered that when the
         judicial or quasi-judicial authority having examined the relevant aspects
         have issued broad guidelines and also issued directions for the steps or
         measures to be taken by the authority in public interest the same is
         questioned on issues like fundamental right or unreasonable restrictions.
         It has been observed,

               "43. Incidentally, we may mention here that immersion of idols
               must not diminish obeisance for the Gods/Goddesses. One who
               has seen mutilated PoP idols resurging on surface of the sea water,
               after the high-tide is over, will not forget the pathetic sight and
               plight of the PoP idols, which were at the centre of
               worshipping/Pandals before a few hours prior to the immersion
               thereof. The sight of such mutilated idols, some of them having
               broken hands, some of them having partly beheaded bodies, some
               of them having loss of legs, etc. give serious jolt to the religious
               sentiments of the prudent spectators.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                      We do not see any reason why the idols of Gods/Goddesses
               should not have sanctity and due respect even after the immersion.
               We mean to say, the after\math of the immersion should not result
               into colossal disrespect to the idols of Gods and Goddesses on
               account of adoption of improper immersion process. One cannot
               be oblivious of the fact that when head of a soldier is found
               chopped at the hands of the enemy, the public sentiments are
               seriously hurt. And, it is a justified reaction as well as most natural
               reaction of the citizens. It does not stand to reason, therefore, that
               religious sentiments also will not be hurt to see the beheaded or
               otherwise mutilated idols of Gods/Goddesses which come on
               surface of the water at the shore of the sea, ponds or other water
               bodies as a result of backlash or reverse water waives. Needless to
               say, therefore, that it would be in the interest of the public to avoid
               the hurting of religious sentiments by regulating immersion process
               and use of the PoP for making/manufacturing of idols of
               Gods/Goddesses.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_14">                47. We also direct the said PCBs to examine whether the
                immersion of PoP made idols, in fact, cause nuisance, though the
                PoP by itself may not be a water pollutant. After conducting such
                scientific study by appointing an Expert Committee, the Pollution
                Control Board or the Central Government or the State Government
                may issue appropriate directions in accordance with the powers
                available under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_14">section 33-A</a> of the Water Act, in order to control
                water pollution or to avoid the nuisance caused on account of
                immersion of the PoP made idols."
</p>
<p id="p_15">         12.    Therefore, as there cannot be any fundamental right in absolute
         terms as sought to be canvassed, the submissions are misconceived. In
         fact, it is not a case of total prohibition or restriction but rather a matter of
         regulating such rights. It is well-settled that such fundamental rights are
         also to be considered and balanced with other claims or public interest.
         Therefore, when there are conflicting or competing rights or claims made
         by an individual or a group vis-a-vis public interest or the society as a

         prohibiting the procession which may have some bearing on a particular
         right or observance with regard to the tenets of a particular religion. It is
         in this background the observations have been made. Therefore, it has to

         any bearing.

         (Coram: Bhaskar Bhattacharya, CJ &amp; JB Pardiwala, J.) vide order dated
         14.9.2012 has clearly observed that they have not entered into the merits

         made clear,

         powers. At the cost of repetition it is stated that there is no total ban or
         prohibition either qua the use of material like PoP or making, selling, or
         transport of any such idols. All that is done is it is regulated for the
         purpose of immersion which in turn may have a bearing on the technical
         aspects like the size of the pond or artificial water body which may be
         created by the Corporation for immersion of idols made of PoP which in
         turn require some regulation with regard to the size which cannot be said
         to be arbitrary which would call for any interference by the court in
         exercise of the concept of judicial review.
