</pre><p id="p_3">            The respondent Board has appeared and filed a counter

affidavit through Shri Arun Walia, Standing counsel for the Board. With

consent this petition has been heard by us for final disposal.

</p><p id="p_4">            The petitioner calls in question the correctness of an order

dated 20.11.2008/4.12.2008 issued under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 directing closure of the unit set up by the

petitioner for distillation of acids at Bahalgarh on the Karnal G.T.Road on

the outskirts of Delhi in district Sonipat. The challenge arises in the

following circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            The petitioner is a registered partnership firm which has set up

a small scale unit engaged in the sale of Chemicals since the year 1962 at

Village Bahalgarh in Sonipat district of Haryana. The unit in question is

according to the petitioner purchasing Hydrochloric Acid, Sulphuric Acid,

Nitric Acid and Calcium Nitrate from Gujrat Alkalis and National Fertilizers

Limited. The acids so purchased are brought to the unit aforementioned for

purification, packaging and for utilizing a part of the same to manufacture

Calcium Nitrate. The petitioner's case is that the unit is a small scale unit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 2                          CWP No. 20767 of 2008.</span>

and there are hardly any emissions from the same or any effluent

discharge to require any Pollution Control measures or effluent treatment

plant. According to the Board the unit in question was inspected by the

Field Staff on 29.05.2008 who noticed that the unit was discharging

untreated effluent in the open land without any ETP for treatment of the

said effluent and that the unit had not provided APCM (Air Pollution Control

Measure) for emissions arising from the distillation process or emanating

from the coal fired bhatties being used in the unit. In the opinion of the field

staff, the unit was violating <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Sections 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_5">26</a> of the Water(Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and 21/22 of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             On receipt of the reports aforementioned, the Regional Office,

Sonipat Region issued a show cause notice dated 3.6.2008 to the unit for

its closure under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_8">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and 31-A of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. In response to the said notice, the unit submitted a

written reply in which it was inter alia stated that although the unit was

earlier processing some of the products in the premises but due to various

economic reasons and cut throat competition in the market most of the

goods are now being purchased as finished products only. The unit further

stated that the discharge of effluents has considerably gone down on

account of the said reasons. It also stated that although the APCM system

of an approved type stands already installed in the unit, yet since the

manufacturing process was at a very low scale, there was no need to keep

the APCM system in operation as there were hardly any fugitive emissions.

The effluent discharge, according to the unit, was in its own agricultural

land and not in the surrounding area.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             Upon consideration of the reply, the Regional Officer

recommended to the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board that the reply
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> 3                          CWP No. 20767 of 2008.</span>

submitted by the petitioner was unsatisfactory and that the unit deserved to

be given a personal hearing at the Head Office level. Consequently, a

notice was issued to the Unit for a personal hearing scheduled for October

15, 2008. Shri Naresh Lal Chaudhary, partner of the Unit appeared on the

said date before the competent authority and made a signed statement

promising to undertake the following measures:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">           "Shri Naresh Lal Chaudhary Partner on behalf of the said firm

<p id="p_23">
             The Regional Officer then submitted another report dated

6.11.2008, according to which the unit had neither submitted the scheme

for upgradation of the     APCM nor furnished a bank guarantee of Rs.

50,000/-. The Regional Officer, accordingly recommended the closure

action under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_15">Section 33-A</a> of the Water Act, 1974. On receipt of the said

recommendation, the Board has passed an order and directed closure of

the unit under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_16">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974. The present petition assails the validity of the said order, as

already noticed above.
</p>
<p id="p_24">             On behalf of the petitioner it was strenuously argued by Mr.

Chahal that the field staff had at no stage visited the unit nor were any

samples taken of the emissions or the treated effluent. It was urged by him

that the notice issued by the Regional Office was mala fide and that the

unit was being harassed because it had declined to satisfy the demands of

the officers in the Regional Office. There is in our opinion no merit in that

contention. The reply submitted by the petitioner-unit to the show cause

notice issued by the Regional Office does not make any suggestion what

so ever that the field staff of the Pollution Control Board had not visited the

unit. If the show cause notice had in deed been issued without visit by the

field staff that ought to have been the first objection from the petitioner in

the reply to the show cause notice. There is no explanation much less a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> 5                         CWP No. 20767 of 2008.</span>

cogent one forthcoming from the petitioner for not pointing out this aspect

in the reply sent by it to the show cause notice. Not only that in the course

of hearing before the Pollution Control Board also the unit at no stage had

alleged that the field staff had not visited the unit or that there was no

pollution being caused by the working of the unit. On the contrary the

managing partner of the unit appeared before the board and specifically

undertook    to take all such measures as were necessary to prevent

pollution. The undertaking inter alia was to the effect that the unit shall

furnish a Bank guarantee for Rs. 50,000/- as is evident from a bare reading

of the written statement made before the Board and extracted by us in the

earlier part of this order. It is, therefore, difficult for us to appreciate the

argument that the field staff had not visited the unit nor is it possible for us

to accept the submission made before us that there was no necessity for

the installation of any anti pollution control measures or the effluent

treatment plant. Having appeared before the Board and undertaken to

provide both the measures we fail to appreciate how the petitioner can still

argue that the unit did not call for either of the two requirements.

</p><p id="p_25">             Mr. Chahal next contended that the undertaking referred to by

the Pollution Control Board and extracted by us in the earlier part, was

taken from the petitioner without giving sufficient opportunity to it to think

and deliberate over the matter. There is no merit in that contention either.

The writ petition is totally silent about the alleged coercion or lack of

reasonable opportunity to the unit to properly respond to the show cause

notice. The argument that since the manufacturing process has reduced

substantially on account of the cut throat competition in the market, it is

neither necessary to have the APCMs functional nor provide for any

effluent treatment plant needs notice only to be rejected. So long as the

unit is working at what ever levels of production and so long as there is no

exemption granted by any provisions of the law to a unit we find it difficult
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> 6                              CWP No. 20767 of 2008.</span>

to say how the requirements of law can be circumvented by simply stating

that the output has gone down. At any rate the question which is under

consideration in the present proceedings is limited to finding out whether

the order impugned in the present writ petition suffers from any error of

jurisdiction or material irregularity. Learned counsel vehemently argued that

the Environmental Engineer had in terms of a communication addressed by

him to the Financial Manager District Industries, Kundli stated that the

working of the unit did not result in any pollution. He urged that on the face

of the said certificate it was not possible for the Board to issue a show

cause notice or an order shutting down the unit. There is in our opinion no

merit even in that contention. A careful reading of Annexure P-4 to the writ

petition reliance whereupon was placed by Mr. Chahal, does not in our

opinion show any certificate having been given by the           Environmental

Engineer as is sought to be assumed by Mr. Chahal. All that the letter

refers to is "that the petitioner unit is engaged in the process of purification

of commercial Acids." It also refers to the process of the distillation being in

glass flasks through glass tubes and condensation by cooling process

through water. The context in which the letter was addressed by the

Environmental Engineer to the Financial Manager is also not very clear

from the communication in question although it appears that there was

some case pending in the Supreme Court arising from some decision

rendered by the High Court of Gujarat. Be that as it may, whether the unit

is causing any pollution and if so what measures need to be taken or what

kind of ETP would be effective is a matter that has to be determined. The

question whether the petitioner unit was causing any pollution has not been

examined by any court or authority leave alone the Supreme Court in any

earlier round of litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_26">             It was lastly contended by Mr. Chahal that the issue regarding

exemption of the unit which has already been sealed by the Pollution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> 7                         CWP No. 20767 of 2008.</span>

Control Board, could be directed to be re-examined by an independent

authority like a Sub-Committee to be appointed by the Central Pollution

Control Board to identify whether or not the unit is causing any pollution

and if so what measures would be essential to satisfy the requirements of

law. Mr. Walia, we must say in fairness was not averse to any such sub-

committee being appointed for getting the unit tested or the efficacy of the

APCM and the ETP determined. The Central Pollution Control Board, it

was submitted, be asked to appoint a sub committee to look into the

working of the unit and to recommend suitable measures to control the

pollution. We, therefore, see no reason to decline the limited prayer made

by the petitioner. The fact that the unit had been sealed does not mean that

it cannot re-start its activities provided it satisfies the authority concerned

regarding the installation and the efficacy of APCM and ETP.

</p><p id="p_27">             We accordingly direct that the Central Pollution Control Board

shall constitute a Sub-Committee of experts familiar with the subject of

pollution resulting from the purification of acids etc. to inspect the unit and

to suggest ways and means by which the emissions and the discharge can

be kept within permissible limit. It goes without saying that the committee

so constituted shall be free to examine the measures if any already in

existence or require any further augmentation of such measures. The

committee can see the actual working of the unit before it can make any

recommendations on the subject. We direct that at the request of the

committee, the Haryana Pollution Control Board shall have the seals of the

unit removed to enable the committee to inspect the same and to put the

unit on trial run in order to enable the committee members to take samples

or to check the working of the systems if any. We, however, make it clear

that after the trial run is complete, the Board shall be free to reseal the unit

which shall continue till such time the Central Pollution Control Board is

satisfied with the installation of APCM and the ETP, if any suggested by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> 8                        CWP No. 20767 of 2008.</span>

Sub-Committee and till final orders on the same are passed by the said

Board. We further make it clear that the time frame within which the unit

will be put on trial run for the purposes of inspection by the Sub Committee

shall be left to be determined by the Sub-Committee.

</p><p id="p_28">            The Sub-Committee shall be constituted by the Central

Pollution Control Board, within one month from today. The Committee shall

undertake the process and complete the same within four weeks thereafter.

Final orders on the subject shall be passed by the Central Pollution Control

Board expeditiously but not later than four weeks from the date the Sub-

Committee submits the report.
