HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL

SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1.    The unsuccessful petitioner in W.P. (C) No. 5114/2016 is the
appellant before us.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition by the order
under appeal dated 02.06.2016 holding as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "... This Court also finds that there is no prayer in the
             writ petition to strike down the revised fee schedule.
             Consequently, no relief with regard to the fee schedule
             can be granted to the petitioner.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">LPA No.444/2016                                                    Page 1 of 6</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              13. At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner
             wishes to amend the writ petition. However, this Court is
             of the opinion that the present writ petition is liable to be
             dismissed on another ground also inasmuch as the
             petitioner has not approached this Court with clean
             hands as it had been polluting the city for the last twenty
             years i.e. from 1993 to 2013. During this period, neither
             a "consent to establish" nor a "consent to operate" had
             been obtained by the petitioner.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             14. To say that the lapse on the part of the petitioner was
             an innocent non-compliance is to trivialise a statutory
             provision which has a direct and vital impact on the life
             of the citizens of this city. Since a very important and
             salutary provision of the environmental law has not been
             complied with by the petitioner for nearly twenty years,
             this Court is of the view that the petitionerâ€Ÿs writ petition
             cannot be entertained by this Court in exercise of
             equitable jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
             Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">             15. Accordingly, the present writ petition is dismissed."

<p id="p_3">3.    We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused
the material available on record.
</p><p id="p_4">4.    It was contended by Ms. Jyotika Kalra, counsel for the appellant that
the respondent had illegally and unjustifiably enriched itself to the tune of
Rs. 39,54,900/- by adopting the fee structure as per the DPCC Board
Meeting dated 09.12.2009 replacing the earlier fee structure of Rs. 2300/-
per annum with Consent to Establish fee of Rs. 2,00,000/- per annum
retrospectively. It was further contended that the appellant under imminent
threat of its closure and being under coercion, undue influence and
misrepresentation deposited Rs.41 lakhs on 19.08.2013 under protest and is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">LPA No.444/2016                                                        Page 2 of 6</span>
 now insisting on refund of Rs. 39,54,900/-. It was urged that the non
compliance of statutory provisions was an inadvertent omission and further
contended that the Show Cause Notice under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a> was
issued for the first time after a lapse of twenty years.
</p><p id="p_5">5.     To substantiate the arguments of the appellant learned counsel relied
upon the judgment of this court of <a href="/doc/147925760/" id="a_4">Delhi Pollution Control Committee and
ors vs Splendor Landbase Ltd and Ors</a> reported in 2012 LawSuit (Del) 129
and Mafatlal Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs UOI &amp;Ors reported in 1997 5 SCC
</p><p id="p_6">536.
</p><p id="p_7">6.     Per Contra, Mr. Sanjeev Ralli learned counsel for the respondent
contended that as per the inspection by DPCC officials on 05.04.2013 it was
observed that no consent was obtained and there has been a serious default
on the part of the appellant company as they have been responsible for
discharging effluents which is ultimately flowing into the stream or well or
sewer or on land. Counsel further contended that the payment to be made by
the appellant is a result of condonation fee and not the result of imposition of
any penalty and thus the judgment relied upon by the counsel for the
appellant was not applicable.
</p><p id="p_8">7.     In the case before us, the prayer made by the appellant is for the
refund of the money alleged to have been paid under protest without
challenging the statutory provision. From the perusal of the facts and
circumstances of the case, we are of the considered view that though High
Court has power to pass any appropriate order in the exercise of the powers
conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution such a petition solely
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">LPA No.444/2016                                                        Page 3 of 6</span>
 praying for the issue of a writ directing the respondent to refund the money
is not ordinarily maintainable specifically when the validity of the fee
structure is not challenged and refund of the money as the consequential
relief is not claimed therein.
</p><p id="p_9">8.    However, assuming for the sake of arguments that the appellant herein
had submitted before the Learned Single Judge that he would amend the writ
petition, scrutiny of the record shows that the appellant is a company
running a hotel since 1993 and as per the policy of DPCC the activity of the
said unit falls under the 'Orange Category'. As per the consent policy as
finalized in meeting dated 09.01.2007 'Consent to establish' or Consent to
operate' an Industrial plant in Delhi was the first step for any industry/trade
(this included any activity involving manufacturing process and /or emitting
pollution, by way of water pollution, Air and Noise pollution). Any unit that
applied for 'consent to operate' without first obtaining 'consent to establish'
was required to pay condonation fee for the entire period of its existence
subject to a maximum from the year 1991 i.e since the inception of Delhi
Pollution Control Committee. By way of earlier fee structure the appellant
was required to pay Rs.2300/- annual consent fee for both Air act and Water
act. Coming to the new fee structure for obtaining consent fee as per the
Delhi Pollution Control Committee Board meeting dated 09.12.2009 fee for
'Consent to establish' for Orange category was Rs.1,00,000/- and fee for
'Consent to Operate' per year for Orange category was Rs. 2,00,000/-.
Perusal of the show cause notice dated 30.04.2013 showed that the appellant
company was operating the unit without obtaining consent from DPCC since
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">LPA No.444/2016                                                       Page 4 of 6</span>
 their establishment and as per the submission of the respondent the appellant
company had been polluting the city for the last twenty years from 1993.
</p><p id="p_10">9.    We find no force in the argument of the appellant that the non
compliance of the statutory provision was an inadvertent omission and
further that the respondent themselves for the first time in exercise of their
powers under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a> served the show cause notice after
a lapse of twenty years. Violating the mandatory provisions in the aforesaid
Acts which disallowed any person without previous consent of the DPCC to
establish an industrial unit , operation or process which is likely to cause
water or air pollution, the appellant company was established and was
operating their unit and engaged in the activity of Hotel thereby causing
pollution. The non compliance of consent as per statutory provision cannot
be termed as an innocent non compliance, rather it is a wilful non
compliance of the provisions and the appellant cannot take shelter by
submitting ignorance or inadvertent omission of the mandatory statutory
provision.
</p><p id="p_11">10.   As far as contention of the appellant that imposition of penalty in the
form of condonation fee for obtaining the prior consent to establish and
operate is unconstitutional is concerned, we do not find any force in the
argument as the appellant has not challenged the validity of consent policy
before any of the Court.
</p><p id="p_12">11.   The judgment relied upon the counsel for the appellant i.e <a href="/doc/147925760/" id="a_8">Delhi
Pollution Control Committee and ors vs Splendor Landbase Ltd and Ors</a>
reported in 2012 LawSuit (Del) 129 and Mafatlal Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">LPA No.444/2016                                                      Page 5 of 6</span>
 UOI &amp; Ors reported in 1997 5 SCC 536 is not applicable to the present case
at hand as the aforementioned case does not involve any question of fee
structure rather it is relating levying of penalties by way of fine or
imprisonment.
</p><p id="p_13">12.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we do not find any
justifiable reason to interfere with the order under appeal and accordingly,
the appeal is dismissed.
