under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 bearing

complaint case Nos.1439/1/08; 649/1/2009 &amp; 573/2009 pending against

them before Mr. Sandeep Yadav, Senior Civil Judge cum Rent Controller,

District South, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi are proposed to be

decided by this common judgment because the legal issue that arises for

consideration in all these petitions is common.
</p>
<p id="p_7">2     The facts of the case giving rise to these petitions briefly stated are

as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">      Respondent       No.    2    M/s   Appreciate   Fincap    Private   Limited

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                                Page 2 of 24</span>
 (hereinafter to be referred as the 'complainant company') had filed three

complaints under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> read with <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_4">Section 142</a> of the Negotiable

Instruments Act, 1881 against the petitioners Mr. Manish Parwani &amp; Mr.

Shekhar Narasimhan, accused No. 1 company M/s HKK Buildwell Private

Limited and its two other Directors namely Sanjay Gambhir and Reena

Gambhir arrayed as accused Nos. 2 &amp; 3 in the complaints. The case of

the complainant company is that two persons namely Mr. Harvinder

Singh &amp; Smt. Kuldeep Kaur (both promoters and only shareholders of

5,000 shares each) had incorporated a company named and styled as M/s

HKK Buildwell Private Limited (hereinafter to be referred as 'accused No.

1 company'). The said company had purchased eight acres and three

marlas of land in Sonepat for a sale consideration of approximately

Rs.6.85 crores. In pursuance thereof, accused No.1 company had

borrowed a sum of Rs.7,43,57,000/- from various persons including the

complainant company. As per the case of the complainant company, out

of the said amount of Rs.7,43,57,000/- borrowed by accused No. 1

company, a sum of Rs.2,26,85,000/- was borrowed by the said company

from the complainant company. After borrowing the said amount of

money, accused No. 1 company had completed the sale transaction of

the aforestated land and executed a sale deed for the said land on

11.10.2006. It is further the complainant company's case that in the year

2007, the aforesaid shareholders of accused No. 1 company (i.e. Mr.

Harvinder Singh &amp; Smt. Kuldeep Kaur) entered into an agreement with

one company M/s D.D. Townships Limited and by virtue of the said

agreement, the entire shareholdings of accused No. 1 company was

brought over by the said M/s D.D. Townships Limited. In terms of the said

arrangement between the said shareholders of accused No. 1 company

and M/s D.D. Townships Limited, the accused Nos. 2 &amp; 3 namely Sanjay

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                         Page 3 of 24</span>
 Gambhir and Reena Gambhir were appointed as Directors of accused No.

1 company on 20.04.2007. In further terms of the aforesaid arrangement,

Mr. Harvinder Singh &amp; Smt. Kuldeep Kaur had resigned from the

directorship of accused No. 1 company w.e.f. 26.04.2007.

3     It is the case of the complainant company that the entire

shareholdings of accused No. 1 company vested in M/s D.D. Townships

Limited on the basis of an agreement as mentioned hereinabove. The

petitioners being accused Nos. 4 &amp; 5 had become Directors of accused

No. 1 company w.e.f. 20.06.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4     The complainant company is stated to had given a loan of

Rs.2,26,85,000/- to accused No. 1 company by means of six cheques of

dates between 10.10.2006 and 24.04.2007 drawn on South Indian Bank

Limited, Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi, details whereof are given in para 7

of the complaint at page 40 of file of Crl.M.C. No. 503/2010.

5     As per the complainant company, the accused Nos. 1 to 5 had

given nine post dated cheques of dates between 25.10.2007 and

17.11.2007 for a total amount of Rs.2,26,85,000/- to the complainant

company to clear their loan liability with an assurance that these cheques

are good for payment and would be honoured on presentation. However,

all the above nine cheques given by the accused persons including the

petitioners were returned unpaid with the remarks 'funds insufficient' and

these cheques were bounced between 26.10.2007 and 20.11.2007. The

complainant company is stated to had given a statutory notice dated

22.12.2007 to all the accused persons informing them about the

bouncing of the cheques and calling upon them to make the payment of

the said cheques within 15 days. Since the payment was not made

despite service of legal notice dated 22.12.2007, the complainant

company filed two separate complaints being CC No. 573/2009 and CC

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                            Page 4 of 24</span>
 No.649/1/09 under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Sections 138</a>/<a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_6">142</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act

against the petitioners, accused No. 1 company and its two other

Directors namely Sanjay Gambhir and Reena Gambhir.

6     The complainant company also filed a third complaint being CC

No.1439/1/08      against    the   same      accused     persons     against   whom

abovementioned two complaints were filed alleging that the complainant

company had given an additional amount of Rs.1.10 crores to accused

No. 1 company vide cheque No.137975 dated 20.04.2007 required by the

said company for clearing the post dated cheques of Rs.2,17,87,196/-

given by it to one Sh. Rajbir son of Sh. Ramsukh at the time of purchase

of agricultural land measuring eight acres and three marlas in Sonepat.

The accused No. 1 company is alleged to had given six cheques of total

amount of Rs.1.10 crores to the complainant company of dates between

20.11.2007 and 30.11.2007 to clear its loan liability of Rs.1.10 crores

given to it by the complainant company. Details of these six cheques are

given in para 4 of the complaint (Annexure P-3) at page 34 of file of

Crl.M.C. No. 450/2010. The complainant company has stated that it could

not institute proceedings against the accused persons in respect of first

cheque No. 367018 dated 20.11.2007 for Rs.25 lacs within the stipulated

period as provided under the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_7">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>. However, the

complainant company is stated to had presented the remaining five

cheques mentioned in para 4 of its complaint for encashment to its

banker on 16.05.2008 but all these five cheques were returned as

dishonoured by the bankers of the accused No. 1 company with the

remarks     'Payment     stopped       by   drawer'    vide   bank    memo     dated

16.05.2008. Immediately thereafter, the complainant is stated to had

sent a legal notice dated 02.06.2008 to the accused persons through

registered A.D. post and UPC post but the accused persons failed to make

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                                    Page 5 of 24</span>
 payment despite service of the said notice. Hence, the complainant

company filed the third complaint against the accused persons as stated

above. It may be noted that in this third complaint, petitioner No. 2 Mr.

Shekhar Narasimhan was not arrayed as an accused for reasons best

known to the complainant company though the name of petitioner No. 2

finds mention as accused person in the remaining two complaints

mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7     The pre-summoning evidence was filed by the complainant

company before the trial court by way of affidavits. The court below vide

impugned orders dated 08.01.2008 and 04.09.2008 summoned all the

accused persons including the petitioners in the abovementioned three

complaint cases filed under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">Sections 138</a>/<a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_9">142</a> of the Negotiable

Instruments Act and it is aggrieved there from, the petitioners have filed

these petitions seeking quashing of summoning orders/complaint cases

pending against them.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8     The main ground on which the quashing is sought by the

petitioners is that they were independent and non-executive Directors of

accused No. 1 company and had nothing to do with its day-to-day

management. Their further case is that they both were inducted as

Directors of accused No. 1 company on 20.06.2007 and had resigned

from the directorship of the said company on 24.10.2007 and that they

were not the Directors of the company at the time of commission of the

offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_10">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act. They have

supported their plea that they were not the Directors of accused No. 1

company at the time of commission of the alleged offence by placing

reliance on Forms No 32 filed by accused No. 1 company with the

Registrar of Companies, Ministry of Company Affairs {Annexure P-2

(colly.)} at pages 30-31 and 35-36 of file of Crl.M.C. No. 503/2010. These

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                          Page 6 of 24</span>
 Forms No. 32 filed along with the petition are certified copies issued by

Registrar   of   Companies      and according   to these documents,   the

petitioners are shown to had resigned from the directorship of accused

No. 1 company w.e.f. 24.10.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9     The three complaints in question under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">Sections 138</a>/<a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_12">142</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act were filed by the complainant company in

respect of total 14 cheques allegedly given by accused No. 1 company

which were returned unpaid. All these 14 cheques, as per complaints,

were of dates after the resignation by the petitioners from the

directorship of accused No. 1 company. Admittedly, these cheques were

returned unpaid by the banker of the complainant company after

24.10.2007 i.e. date of resignation        by the petitioners from the

directorship of accused No. 1 company.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10    I have heard the argument of Mr. Rajiv Nayar, learned senior

counsel who appeared on behalf of the petitioners and also of Mr.Ramesh

Gupta, learned senior counsel who appeared on behalf of respondent No.

2 (complainant company). I have also perused the entire record of these

cases and have given my anxious consideration to the rival arguments

advanced by the counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11    The main argument of the learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of the petitioners was that the petitioners could not have been

summoned by the trial court for offences under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">Sections 138</a>/<a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_14">142</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act allegedly committed by accused No. 1

company as they had ceased to be the Directors of the said company on

the date of commission of the offence. He has placed reliance on Form

No. 32 at pages 31-36 of the paper book of Crl.M.C. No. 503/2010 to show

that both the petitioners who seek quashing of summoning order and

criminal complaint under Sections 138/142 of the Negotiable Instruments

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                         Page 7 of 24</span>
 Act had resigned from the directorship of accused No. 1 company on

24.10.2007, i.e., much before the date of the commission of the offences

which admittedly were committed after the said date.

</p><p id="p_15">12.   Per contra, Mr. Ramesh Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of respondent No. 2 (complainant company) had argued that

Forms No. 32, on which reliance is placed on behalf of the petitioners,

were filed by accused No. 1 company with the Registrar of Companies,

Ministry of Company Affairs on 09.01.2008 and 13.01.2008 respectively

and, therefore, according to him, whether the petitioners had ceased to

be the Directors of accused No. 1 company or not on the date of

commission of offence is a disputed question of fact and cannot be gone

into by this Court at this stage.      He has also contended that the

complainant company had specifically pleaded in its complaint that all

the accused persons including the petitioners were responsible for day-

to-day management of the affairs of the accused No. 1 company, and

therefore, they, according to him, are jointly and vicariously liable for

criminal liability arising out of bouncing of cheques in question.      The

learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No. 2 company

had placed reliance on two judgments of this Court, viz., Anurag Modi

Vs. M.S.T.C. Limited, 2002 (1) JCC 206 (DHC) and K.P.G. Nair Vs. State,

2008 (III) AD (Cr.) (DHC) 214 in support of his contention that once the

accused persons have been summoned to face trial under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_15">Section 138</a> of

the Act, the question whether such persons had resigned from the

accused company and had ceased to be responsible for day-to-day

business of the accused company can be decided only after evidence is

led by the parties at the appropriate stage.
</p>
<p id="p_16">13.   From the above rival arguments advanced by the learned counsel

for both the parties, the legal issue that arises for consideration in these

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                            Page 8 of 24</span>
 petitions is whether the summoning orders issued by the court below

against the petitioners are sustainable or whether the petitioners can be

held vicariously liable for the offence committed by accused No. 1

company after the petitioners had ceased to be the Directors of the said

company.
</p>
<p id="p_17">14    Proper and smooth functioning of all business transactions,

particularly of cheques as instruments primarily depends upon the

integrity and honesty of the parties. Undoubtedly, dishonour of a cheque

by the bank causes incalculable loss, injury and inconvenience to the

payee and the entire credibility of the business transactions within and

outside the country suffers a serious setback. A company being an

artificial person created by law acts through its directors and officers who

are responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. A

criminal liability on account of dishonour of cheque primarily falls on the

drawer company and is extended to officers of the Company. The normal

rule in the cases involving criminal liability is against vicarious liability,

that is, no one is to be held criminally liable for an act of another. This

normal rule is, however, subject to exception on account of specific

provision being made in statutes extending liability to others. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_16">Section 141</a>

of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 ("<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_17">NI Act</a>") regulates offences by

companies.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15    <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_18">The Act</a> has created a deemed offence under a legal fiction,

whenever a cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him

bounces either for insufficiency of the funds in the account or it exceeds

the arrangements made. It is apparent that the person who has drawn

the cheque on an account maintained by him alone is liable in the event

of bouncing of the cheque later. When the company is the drawer of the

cheque, such company is the principal offender, and the remaining

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                             Page 9 of 24</span>
 persons are made offenders by virtue of the legal fiction created by the

legislature as per the said section. The actual offence should be

committed by the company and then alone the other two categories

would also become liable for the offence. Penal statues provide

constructive vicarious liability and should be construed much more

strictly. When conditions are prescribed for extending such constructive

criminal liability to others, the Courts will insist upon strict literal

compliance. There is no question of inferential or implied compliance.

16    With the assistance of latest decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court of India, we shall be examining the provisions relating to <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_19">Section

141(1)</a> and shall attempt to determine who are the persons who shall be

responsible and can be made liable for an offence done by a company?

Who is responsible to the company for the conduct of its business, and

who could be said to be in-charge thereof? How does one identify such

persons? Is it that a person by virtue of being a director, manager or

secretary of a Company automatically becomes liable under this section?

Is it necessary to have an averment in the complaint that at the time

when this offence was committed, such a person was in charge of and

was responsible to the company for the conduct of business of the

company?

<p id="p_19">17    <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_20">Section 141</a> of the NI Act, 1881 regulates offences by Companies. It

<p id="p_20">18    When a cheque issued by a company is dishonoured, in addition to

the Company, the following persons are deemed to be guilty of the

offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      a. Every person who at the time the offence was committed, was
      in-charge of and was responsible to the company for the
      conduct of the business of the company;</blockquote><p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      b. Any Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of the
      company with whose consent and connivance, the offence under
      <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_22">section 138</a> had been committed; and

      c. Any Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of the
      company whose negligence resulted in the offence under

19    <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_24">Section 141</a> contains conditions, which have to be satisfied before

the liability can be extended to officers of a company. Since the provision

creates criminal liability, the conditions have to be strictly complied with.

The conditions are intended to ensure that a person who is sought to be

made vicariously liable for an offence of which the principal accused is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                                   Page 11 of 24</span>
 the Company, had a role to play in relation to the incriminating act and

further that such a person should know what is attributed to him to make

him liable. The key words which occur in the Section are "every person".

These are general words and take every person connected with a

company within their sweep. Therefore, these words have been rightly

qualified by use of the words "who, at the time the offence was

committed, was in charge of and was responsible to the company for the

conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be

deemed to be guilty of the offence etc." What is required is that the

persons who are sought to be made criminally liable under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_25">Section 141</a>

should be at the time the offence was committed, in charge of and

responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the

company.
</p>
<p id="p_23">20    Every person connected with the company shall not fall within the

ambit of the provision. It is only those persons who were in charge of and

responsible for conduct of business of the company at the time of

commission of an offence, who will be liable for criminal action. It follows

from this that if a director of a Company who was not in charge of and

was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at

the relevant time, will not be liable under the provision. The liability

arises from being in charge of and responsible for conduct of business of

the company at the relevant time when the offence was committed and

not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a company.

Conversely, a person not holding any office or designation in a Company

may be liable if he satisfies the main requirement of being in charge of

and responsible for conduct of business of a Company at the relevant

time. Liability depends on the role one plays in the affairs of a Company


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                            Page 12 of 24</span>
 and not on designation or status. If being a Director or Manager or

Secretary was enough to cast criminal liability, the Section would have

said so. Instead of "every person" the section would have said "every

Director, Manager or Secretary in a Company is liable"....etc. The

legislature is aware that it is a case of criminal liability which means

serious consequences so far as the person sought to be made liable is

concerned. Therefore, only persons who can be said to be connected with

the commission of a crime at the relevant time have been subjected to

action.
</p>
<p id="p_24">21    The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in various cases that the

words "was in-charge of, and was responsible to the company for the

conduct of the business of the company" refer to a person who is in

overall control of the day-to-day business of the company. The Court

pointed out that, though a person may be a director and, thus, belongs to

the group of persons making the policy followed by the company, yet

may not be in-charge of the business of the company; that a person may

be a manager who is in-charge of the business but may not be in overall

charge of the business; and that a person may be an officer who may be

in-charge of only some part of the business It is, however, observed by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the words in <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_26">Section 141(1)</a> of the Act

need not be incorporated in a complaint as magic words. But, at the

same time, the substance of the allegations read as a whole, should

answer and fulfil the requirements of the ingredients of the said

provision.
</p>
<p id="p_25">22    If a mere reproduction of the wording of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_27">Section 141</a> (1) in the

complaint is sufficient to make a person liable to face prosecution,

virtually every officer / employee of a company without exception could


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                         Page 13 of 24</span>
 be impleaded as an accused by merely making an averment that at the

time when the offence was committed he was in-charge of and was

responsible to the company for the conduct and business of the

company. This would mean that if a company had 100 branches and the

cheque issued from one branch was dishonored, the officers of all the

100 branches could be made accused by simply making an allegation

that they were in-charge of and were responsible to the company for the

conduct of the business of the company. That would be an absurd thing

and not intended under the Act. As the trauma, harassment and hardship

of a criminal proceedings in such cases, can be more serious than the

ultimate punishment, it is not proper to subject all and sundry to be

impleaded as accused in a complaint against a company, even when the

requirements of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_28">Section 138</a>, read with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_29">Section 141</a>, are not fulfilled.

23    There is no universal rule that a director of a company is in charge

of its everyday affairs. There is no magic as such in a particular word, be

it Director, Manager or Secretary. It all depends upon respective roles

assigned to the officers in a company. A company may have Managers or

Secretaries for different departments, which means, it may have more

than one Manager or Secretary. These officers may also be authorised to

issue cheques under their signatures with respect to affairs of their

respective departments. Will it be possible to prosecute a Secretary of

Department-B       regarding    a      cheque   issued   by   the   Secretary   of

Department-A which is dishonoured? The Secretary of Department-B may

not be knowing anything about issuance of the cheque in question.

Therefore, mere use of a particular designation of an officer without

more, may not be enough by way of an averment in a complaint.

 several enactments dealing with offences by companies i.e. <a href="/doc/1989338/" id="a_31">Section 278</a>

any indication as to who are the persons responsible to the company, for

the conduct of the business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_26">25    To decipher and to understand the meaning of the "persons in

charge' as defined in <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_42">Section 141(1)</a> of the NI Act, we may have to

examine the provisions of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_43">Companies Act</a>, 1956, the law relating to and

regulating the companies. A company, though a legal entity, yet can act

only through its Board of Directors. <a href="/doc/1202543/" id="a_44">Section 291</a> of the Companies Act,

1956 provides that subject to the provisions of this Act, the Board of

Directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such powers, and

to do all such acts and things, as the company is authorized to exercise

and do. A director may be attending meetings of the Board of Directors of

the Company where usually they decide policy matters and guide the

course of business of a company. It may be that the Board of Directors

may appoint sub-committees consisting of one or two directors out of the

Board of the Company who may be made responsible for day-to-day

functions of the Company. These are matters, which form part of

resolutions of Board of Directors of a Company. Nothing is oral. What

emerges from this is that the role of a director in a company is a question

of fact depending on the peculiar facts in each case. There is no universal

 rule that a director of a company is in charge of its everyday affairs.

26    A visit to some provisions of <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_45">Companies Act</a>,1956 shall enable us to

appreciate the role and functions of certain key managerial personnel as

engaged by companies.

<p id="p_30">30    In the present case, the petitioners claim that they had resigned

from the Directorship of the accused No. 1 company on 24.10.2007 and

all the 14 cheques, which are subject matter of the three complaints in

question, were of dates after the said date and according to them, the

offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_58">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act was

committed after they had ceased to be the Directors of the said

company.       The complainant company had disputed the date of

resignation by the petitioners from the directorship of the accused No. 1

company stating that Forms No. 32 in regard to their resignation was

filed by the accused company in the Office of Registrar of Companies,

Ministry of Company Affairs on 09.01.2008 &amp; 13.01.2008 respectively

and, therefore, according to the complainant company, the petitioners

were the Directors of the said company till that date and are, therefore,

jointly and vicariously liable for the offence in regard to which they have

been summoned by the trial court.          I do not find any merit in this

argument urged on behalf of the complainant company. Forms No. 32

relied upon on behalf of the petitioners are at pages 31-36 of the paper


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">Crl.M.C. Nos. 450, 501 &amp; 503 of 2010                               Page 19 of 24</span>
 book of Crl.M.C. No. 503/2010. A perusal of these forms would show that

they are certified copies issued from the Office of Registrar of Companies

and according to these forms, the petitioners are shown to had resigned

from the directorship of accused No. 1 company on 24.10.2007. On the

face of these Forms No. 32, no dispute regarding date of resignation of

the petitioners from the directorship of accused No. 1 company is

tenable. Furthermore, even if it is assumed that the petitioners continue

to remain Directors of accused No. 1 company on the date of commission

of the offence still they cannot be held vicariously liable for the offence

because there is nothing in the complaints filed by the complainant

company to show that the petitioners were in any manner responsible for

day-to-day management of the affairs of the said company.                At this

stage, it shall be relevant to refer to contents of paras 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 of the

complaint of complaint case bearing No. 1439/1/08 (Annexure P-3 at

      were going, the complainant was requesting the accused Nos. 1

      accused Nos. 2 to 4 were jointly and severally looking after and
      managing the day to day affairs of the accused No. 1.
      Accordingly, towards the discharge of the said liability, the

<p id="p_31">31    It may be seen that in the above mentioned complaint, the

complainant company has impleaded only petitioner No. 1 as one of the

 accused persons and chose not to implead petitioner No. 2 as an accused

for reasons best known to it. Although as per the other two complaints in

question, both the petitioners have been arrayed as accused persons in

those complaints stating that they along with other Directors, being

accused Nos. 2 &amp; 3, had assured the complainant company that the

cheques in question will be honoured as and when presented for

encashment. Admittedly as per own case of the complainant in complaint

case No. 1439/1/08, the entire shareholding of the said company was

held by accused Nos. 2 &amp; 3 namely Sanjay Gambhir &amp; Reena Gambhir,

who are husband &amp; wife and this shows that the petitioners had neither

any financial stake in the company nor any effective control over the said

company till the time they remained its Directors, i.e., 24.10.2007. The

judgments referred and relied upon by the learned senior counsel

appearing on behalf of the complainant company are not applicable here

since in the present case there does not seem to be any dispute

regarding the date of resignation by the petitioners from the directorship

of accused No. 1 company and, therefore, this, in the opinion of this

Court, cannot be a question of trial.    The complainant company has

completely failed to show by reference to its complaints in question as to

how and in what manner the petitioners were responsible for conducting

the business on behalf of accused No. 1 company so long they remain its

Directors. Hence, vicarious liablity cannot be fastened on them.

32    For the foregoing reasons, I have no hesitation in holding that the

impugned summoning orders passed by the trial court againt the

petitioners cannot be sustained either on facts or in law and the same are

hereby set aside. Consequently, all the three criminal complaints bearing

Nos. 573/2009; 64/1/09 &amp; 1491/1/2008 in so far as the petitioners are

shall continue against the remaining accused persons as per law. Subject

to that all these petitions are allowed and stand disposed of accordingly
