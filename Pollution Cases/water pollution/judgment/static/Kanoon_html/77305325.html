<p id="p_2">                               OVERVIEW

 1                 As per the administrative order dated 26th October 2016
 passed by Hon'ble the Chief Justice, this PIL has been specially assigned
 to a Bench presided over by one of us (A.S. Oka, J.). This petition was
 substantially heard in November 2017, but was adjourned for various
 reasons including the reason of pendency of a writ Petition challenging
 acquisition of land for setting up a Sewage Treatment Plant. Lastly it
 was heard on 1st November 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_3"> 2                 This Public Interest Litigation concerns pollution of river
 Godavari. River Godavari is the second longest river in India after the
 river Ganges. It is popularly known as "Dakshin Ganga" (Ganges of
 south). River Godavari is one of the main sources of water supply to the
 city of Nashik. The orders passed from time to time in this PIL will show
 that considering large scale pollution of the river due to various
 reasons, several steps are required to be taken for rejuvenation of the
 river and for preventing pollution of the said river.

 rivers was well recognised. This fact is noted by the Apex Court in the

                   sky, rivers, sea, plants, trees and every form of life.
                   Majority of people still consider it as their sacred duty to
                   protect the plants, trees, rivers, wells, etc. because it is
                   believed that they belong to all living creatures."

 4                 The petitioners are citizens of India who are residents of
 Nashik. The substantive relief claimed in this PIL is to issue a direction
 to the respondents to clean the polluted Godavari river. Godavari is
 India's second longest river after the Ganges. Its source is in
 Triambakeshwar near Nashik. It flows for approximately 1,465
 kilometres draining the states of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra
 Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and
 Puducherry and emptying into Bay of Bengal through its extensive
 network of tributaries. Measuring up to 312,812 sq km, it forms one of
 the largest river basins in the Indian subcontinent, with only the Ganges
 and Indus rivers having a larger drainage basin. In terms of the length,
 catchment area and discharge, the Godavari river is stated to be the
 largest in peninsular India. The river has been revered in Hindu
 scriptures . There are 350 or more major or minimum dams and
 barrages constructed in the Godavari river basin. It has many tributaries
 such as Kadva, Shivana, Purna, Kadam,Pranahita, Indravati, Taliperu,
 Sabari,Nasardi, Darna, Pravara, Manjra etc.

 equally applies to Godavari. He said thus:

<blockquote id="blockquote_4"> 6                 In this petition, mainly a grievance is made about the
 pollution of the river in and around the city of Nashik and the failure of
 all concerned authorities to maintain the river clean. The orders passed
 from time to time will show that there is hardly any dispute between
 the parties that the river has been considerably polluted. The reports
 and photographs on record show the extent of pollution. There are
 several holy places located on the banks of the river in or around
 Nashik. The major factors which have led to pollution have been set out
 in paragraph 6 of the order dated 7th March 2014 in this PIL by which
 Rule was issued and interim directions were issued. Paragraph 6 reads
 thus :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            "6. There is no dispute between the parties that the river water
                has been polluted to a great extent. There are various
                factors which have led to the extensive water pollution. On
                the bank of the river, there are many holy places like
                Someshwar Temple, Navsha Ganapati Temple, etc. There
                are well-known religious places like Laxman Kund, Ram
                Kund etc. Lacs of devotees visit the said places and ghats
                on river Godavari in or around Nashik. Many of them do
                "asthi visarjan" (immersion of ashes) in the river. Many of
                them undertake mass bathing. Obsequious ceremonies such
                as "dashkriya vidhi" are being performed. There are two
                industrial areas at Nashik known as 'Satpur' and 'Ambad'. It
                is alleged that there is no CETP constructed for the
                treatment of the industrial waste generated in the MIDC
                areas. The river is being used for industrial as well as
                domestic waste disposal. Beyond the limits of Nashik City,
                on a large scale, there are agricultural activities carried out
                on both the sides of the river. Moreover, the City of Nashik
                is ever growing. There are large number of industries
                which are set up in or around Nashik. There has been
                population explosion at Nashik. Apart from these several
                factors which are the causes for pollution, even the

<blockquote id="blockquote_6"> 7                 Judicial notice will have to be taken of the additional
 causes. As stated earlier, there are several holy places of religion in and
 around the city of Nashik on the banks of Godavari. Barring few
 exceptions, the places of religion near Godavari are littered with
 garbage. As the places of religion are frequented by large number of
 devotees, various articles and waste are being indiscriminately
 discharged in Godavari. Sufficient number of toilets are not available
 around the places of religion having latest technology. There are
 instances of people answering nature's call on the banks of the river.
</blockquote><p id="p_5"> Vehicles are being taken on the river bed and washed in the                     bed.
 Though the State has imposed ban on use of plastic articles of various
 categories, still people throw plastic articles and plastic bags containing
 garbage and other material. After "Kumbhamela" of 2015, which is a
 major religious event which takes place after every 12 years, substantial
 quantity of water was required to be released from up-stream dams for
 cleaning the dirt in the river.

<p id="p_6"> 8                 Apart from the detailed order dated 7 th March 2014,
 various interim orders have been passed from time to time. The interim
 orders will show that the State Government as per the directions of this
 Court has set up a Committee headed by the Divisional Commissioner,
 Nashik which is monitoring the implementation of the orders passed by
 this Court from time to time. Moreover, under the interim orders, the
 CSIR - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (for short
 "NEERI") was appointed as an expert authority which has submitted
 various reports containing short term and long term measures. There
 are interim orders issued by this Court from time to time for directing

<p id="p_7">                               POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION
 9                 Before we deal with the submissions and the law on the
 subject, it will be necessary to note the points which broadly arise in
 this PIL :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            (I)    The first issue will be of steps required to be taken for
                   rejuvenation of River Godavari;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            (II) The second issue is of taking various preventive
                   measures such as preventing throwing of garbage, waste
                   material, dried flowers used for pooja (known as
                   "Nirmalya") etc. into the river, carrying objectionable
                   activities in the dry river bed or on or near the bank of
                   the river. The issue is also of            preventing illegal
                   constructions, both temporary and permanent, on the
                   river bed and surrounding areas of the river. The issue
                   will be of preventing the pollution created by the
                   religious ceremonies performed in the temples and holy
                   places as well as on open spaces in and around Nashik
                   due to indiscriminate throwing of articles into the river.;
            (III) The failure to set up adequate number of Sewage
                   Treatment Plants (STPs) in the city of Nashik which will
                   prevent discharge of untreated sewage water into the

            (V) The failure of the authorities to take suitable measures
                   for preventing pollution of the river during the major
                   religious events such as Kumbha Mela which is held in
                   Nashik after every 12 years; and
            (VI) The failure of the citizens to co-operate with the
                   authorities for preventing pollution of the river and the
                   failure of the citizens to perform their fundamental duty
                   under clause (g) of <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_2">Article 51A</a> of the Constitution of
                   India.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8"> 10                As far as the legal issues are concerned, the same revolve
 around the legal and constitutional obligations of the State Government
 and the Municipal Corporation of City of Nashik (for short "the said
 Municipal Corporation"). The said Municipal Corporation has been
 constituted under the provisions of the Maharashtra Municipal
 Corporations Act, 1949 (for short "the said Act of 1949"). It is also a
 planning authority within the meaning of the Maharashtra Regional and
 Town Planning Act, 1966 (for short "the said Act of 1966"). The citizens
 have fundamental right to live in pollution free atmosphere. The
 pollution can be of air, noise and water. Moreover, the doctrine of
 public trust is squarely applicable to the rivers inasmuch as the State is
 the owner of the river beds and the water flowing in the rivers. As held
 by us, precautionary principle will also apply in the present case. Under
 clause (g) of <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_3">Article 51A</a> of Constitution of India, it is the duty of every
 citizen to protect and improve environment including various lakes,
 rivers, etc. Moreover, the directive principles of State Policy enjoin the
 State to prevent pollution of the rivers. We are dealing with the legal
 aspects separately.</p><pre id="pre_2">

 11                Apart from the core issues, several other issues have been
</pre><p id="p_9"> dealt with such as the issue of permission granted to the seventh
 respondent M/s. Indiabulls by the State Government to lift water from
 river Godavari. The permission has been granted to the said respondent
 to lift the treated water released by the Sewage Treatment Plants
 (STPs) constructed by the said Corporation. Under the agreement with
 the State Government, the seventh respondent was given three options.
 The first one was of lifting water from the storage sump near the STPs.
 The second option was of taking water from existing storage Bandhara
 on the Godavari River and the third option was drawing water by
 constructing a storage Bandhara/barrage of Godavari River. It appears
 that the seventh respondent is lifting the water near the barrage
 constructed by the eighth respondent at Eklahare which is downstream.
 There is an order dated 11th September 2015 which deals with this
 controversy which notes that the water from STPs is being released into
 River Godavari which goes downstream and the same is lifted by the
 seventh respondent from the barrage constructed by the eighth
 respondent. The same order discusses the issue about water allocation
 made to eighth respondent - Maharashtra State Power Generation
 Company Limited. The issue concerning the seventh respondent has
 been dealt with by the aforesaid order dated 11 th September 2015 by
 issuing certain directions on the basis of the agreement.

                          PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE

 17                The issue of applicability of the doctrine of public trust
 in India is no longer res integra. In the case of M.C. Mehta Vs. Kamal
 Nath2, the law has been laid down by the Apex Court in paragraphs
 23, 24 , 25 34 and 35 which read thus :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">        "23.       The notion that the public has a right to expect
                   certain lands and natural areas to retain their natural
                   characteristic is finding its way into the law of the
                   land. The need to protect the environment and ecology
                   has been summed up by David B. Hunter (University of
                   Michigan) in an article titled An ecological perspective on
                   property: A call for judicial protection of the public's
                   interest in environmentally critical resources published in
                   Harvard Environmental Law Review, Vol. 12 1988, p.

                   only so much human activity before limits are reached.
                   This lesson was driven home by the oil crisis of the
                   1970s as well as by the pesticide scare of the 1960s. The

                   finiteness of the environment, when coupled with human
                   dependency on the environment, leads to the
                   unquestionable result that human activities will at some
                   point be constrained.

                   our freedom; these constraints are not the product of
                   value choices but of the scientific imperative of the
                   environment's limitations. Reliance on improving
                   technology can delay temporarily, but not forever, the
                   inevitable constraints. There is a limit to the capacity of
                   the environment to service ... growth, both in providing
                   raw materials and in assimilating by-product wastes due
                   to consumption. The largesse of technology can only
                   postpone or disguise the inevitable.'

                         Professor Barbara Ward has written of this
                   ecological imperative in particularly vivid language:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">                           'We can forget moral imperatives. But today the
                   morals of respect and care and modesty come to us in a
                   form we cannot evade. We cannot cheat on DNA. We
                   cannot get round photosynthesis. We cannot say I am
                   not going to give a damn about phytoplankton. All these
                   tiny mechanisms provide the preconditions of our
                   planetary life. To say we do not care is to say in the most
                   literal sense that "we choose death".'

                          There is a commonly-recognized link between
                   laws and social values, but to ecologists a balance
                   between laws and values is not alone sufficient to ensure
                   a stable relationship between humans and their
                   environment. Laws and values must also contend with
                   the constraints imposed by the outside environment.
                   Unfortunately, current legal doctrine rarely accounts for
                   such constraints, and thus environmental stability is
                   threatened.

                   term effects on environmental and therefore social
                   stability. To ecologists, the need for preserving sensitive
                   resources does not reflect value choices but rather is the
                   necessary result of objective observations of the laws of
                   nature.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_61">                           In sum, ecologists view the environmental sciences
                   as providing us with certain laws of nature. These laws,
                   just like our own laws, restrict our freedom of conduct
                   and choice. Unlike our laws, the laws of nature cannot
                   be changed by legislative fiat; they are imposed on us by
                   the natural world. An understanding of the laws of

<blockquote id="blockquote_62">        24.        The ancient Roman Empire developed a legal theory
                   known as the "Doctrine of the Public Trust". It was
                   founded on the ideas that certain common properties
                   such as rivers, seashore, forests and the air were held
                   by Government in trusteeship for the free and
                   unimpeded use of the general public. Our
                   contemporary concern about "the environment" bear
                   a very close conceptual relationship to this legal
                   doctrine. Under the Roman law these resources were
                   either owned by no one (res nullious) or by every one in
                   common (res communious). Under the English common
                   law, however, the Sovereign could own these resources
                   but the ownership was limited in nature, the Crown
                   could not grant these properties to private owners if the
                   effect was to interfere with the public interests in
                   navigation or fishing. Resources that were suitable for
                   these uses were deemed to be held in trust by the Crown
                   for the benefit of the public. Joseph L. Sax, Professor of
                   Law, University of Michigan -- proponent of the Modern
                   Public Trust Doctrine -- in an erudite article "Public
                   Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial

                   English law -- the nature of property rights in rivers, the
                   sea, and the seashore. That history has been given
                   considerable attention in the legal literature, need not be
                   repeated in detail here. But two points should be
                   emphasized. First, certain interests, such as navigation
                   and fishing, were sought to be preserved for the benefit
                   of the public; accordingly, property used for those
                   purposes was distinguished from general public property
                   which the sovereign could routinely grant to private
                   owners. Second, while it was understood that in certain
                   common properties -- such as the seashore, highways,
                   and running water -- 'perpetual use was dedicated to
                   the public', it has never been clear whether the public
                   had an enforceable right to prevent infringement of
                   those interests. Although the State apparently did protect
                   public uses, no evidence is available that public rights
                   could be legally asserted against a recalcitrant
                   government."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_64">        25.        The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle
                   that certain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests
                   have such a great importance to the people as a whole
                   that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a
                   subject of private ownership. The said resources being a
                   gift of nature, they should be made freely available to
                   everyone irrespective of the status in life. The doctrine

                   resources which are by nature meant for public use
                   and enjoyment. Public at large is the beneficiary of

                   and open lands in their pristine purity and those charged

                   pressures of the changing needs of an increasingly

                   extent upon open lands heretofore considered inviolate
                   to change. The resolution of this conflict in any given
                   case is for the legislature and not the courts. If there is a
                   law made by Parliament or the State Legislatures the
                   courts can serve as an instrument of determining
                   legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial
                   review under the Constitution. But in the absence of any
                   legislation, the executive acting under the doctrine of
                   public trust cannot abdicate the natural resources and
                   convert them into private ownership, or for commercial
                   use. The aesthetic use and the pristine glory of the
                   natural resources, the environment and the
                   ecosystems of our country cannot be permitted to be

<blockquote id="blockquote_71">        54.        The heart of the public trust doctrine is that it imposes

                   their administrators on behalf of all the people and
                   especially future generations. For example, renewable
                   and non-renewable resources, associated uses, ecological
                   values or objects in which the public has a special
                   interest (i.e. public lands, waters, etc.) are held subject
                   to the duty of the State not to impair such resources,

                   assets. Professor Joseph L. Sax in his classic article, "The
                   Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resources Law: Effective
                   Judicial Intervention" (1970), indicates that the public
                   trust doctrine, of all concepts known to law, constitutes
                   the best practical and philosophical premise and legal
                   tool for protecting public rights and for protecting and

 24                The holy places in the city and banks of the river as well
 as river beds are frequented by large number devotees. There are
 various activities conducted in the river bed. This Court had an
 occasion to consider the said issue in connection with river
 Chandrabhaga which flows through the famous religious town of
 Pandharpur. This Court dealt with the right of pilgrims (known as
 "Warkaris") to use the river bed for various religious activities.
 Various directions have been issued by this Court on the said issue in
 PIL No.8 of 2012 in the case of Campaign against Manual Scavenging
 in Maharashtra Vs. The State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. One of the orders
 which is of some relevance is the order dated 24 th December 2014.
 By the said order, the specific direction was issued by this Court to
 the State to ensure that the river bed of Chandrabhaga should not be
 used for erection of any temporary pandals or other construction or
 shelters or for any prohibitory activity. Without touching the
 principles laid down in the said orders, the First Court, by a
 subsequent order, has permitted erection of temporary structures in
 River bed for few days in a year during major religious festivals. This
 Court directed the State to remove illegal constructions made in the
 river bed and on the banks of the river. Paragraph 9 of the said order

 dated 24th December 2014 is material which reads thus :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_97">        "9.        In the order dated 3rd July, 2014, this Court has made
                   extensive reference to Clause (g) of <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_40">Article 51</a> A of the
                   Constitution of India, which lays down fundamental duty
                   of every citizen to protect and improve the natural
                   environment including forests, lakes and rivers. This
                   Court has noted that Clause (g) of <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_41">Article 51</a> A of
                   Constitution of India provides that every citizen should
                   have compassion for living creatures and therefore, every
                   citizen should have compassion for other citizens. Under
                   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_42">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, every citizen has a
                   fundamental right to have live in a pollution free
                   atmosphere and a right to live in healthy conditions. As
                   stated in earlier, the Varkaris have been regularly visiting
                   Pandharpur very religiously in large numbers to offer
                   their prayers to Vitthal and Rukmini. It is obvious that
                   the Varkaris will have to religiously implement the
                   constitutional provisions especially the duty of every
                   citizen to protect and improve the natural
                   environment as also protect the rivers from pollution.
                   The Varkaris have to respect the fundamental right
                   available to the citizens of Pandharpur to live with
                   dignity and in a pollution free atmosphere. It is for
                   this reason that this Court has already appointed the
                   National Environmental Engineering Research Institute
                   (NEERI) to advise on steps to be taken for preventing the
                   pollution of river Chandrabhaga and for rejuvenation of
                   river Chandrabhaga. In fact, a report dated 20 th
                   September, 2014 submitted by NEERI is already on
                   record. It is, therefore, obvious that considering the
                   constitutional mandate, the Varkaris will have to accept
                   and abide by what is stated before this Court by "Shri
                   Varkari Prabodhan Mahasamiti" and their office bearers.
                   Therefore, we make it clear that apprehensions
                   expressed by some of the Varkaris are completely
                   uncalled for."

                   <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_43">Article 25</a> of the Constitution of India. The scope of
                   <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_44">Article 25</a> has been repeatedly interpreted by the Apex
                   Court right from its leading judgment in Sardar Syedna
                   Taher Saifuddin Saheb Vs. The State of Bombay
                   [(1962)SUPP SCR 496] The said judgment holds that the
                   protection of <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_45">Article 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_46">26</a> extends to rituals and
                   observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which
                   are integral parts of religion. Thus, unless such
                   ceremonies are found to be an integral part of religion,
                   the protection under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_47">Article 25</a> cannot extended. The
                   learned amicus curiae has relied upon the decision of the
                   Commissioner of Police and Others Vs. Acharya
                   Jagdishwarandanda Avadhuta and Anr. [(2014)12 SCC
                   770]. In paragraph 9 of the said decision, the Apex Court
                   observed thus :

<blockquote id="blockquote_104">                   "9.    The protection guaranteed under Articles 25 and
                   26 of the Constitution is not confined to matters of
                   doctrine or belief but extends to acts done in pursuance
                   of religion and, therefore, contains a guarantee for
                   rituals, observances, ceremonies and modes of worship
                   which are essential or integral part of religion. What
                   constitutes an integral or essential part of religion has to
                   be determined with reference to its doctrines, practices,
                   tenets, historical background etc. of the given religion.
                   What is meant by 'an essential part or practices of a
                   religion' is now the matter for elucidation. Essential part
                   of a religion means the core beliefs upon which a
                   religion is founded. Essential practice means those
                   practices that are fundamental to follow a religious
                   belief. It is upon the cornerstone of essential parts or
                   practices the superstructure of religion is built. Without
                   which, a religion will be no religion. Test to determine
                   whether a part or practice is essential to the religion is to
                   find out whether the nature of religion will be changed
                   without that part or practice. If the taking away of that
                   part or practice could result in a fundamental change in
                   the character of that religion or in its belief, then such
                   part could be treated as an essential or integral part.
                   There cannot be additions or subtractions to such part.
                   Because it is the very essence of that religion and

                                                                                  32 of 53

                   alterations will change its fundamental character. It is
                   such permanent essential parts is what is protected by
                   the Constitution. No body can say that essential part or
                   practice of one's religion has changed from a particular
                   date or by an event. Such alterable parts or practices are
                   definitely not the 'core' of religion where the belief is
                   based and religion is founded upon. It could only be
                   treated as mere embellishments to the non- essential part
                   or practices."

<blockquote id="blockquote_105">                         The test laid down by the Apex Court to
                   determine whether a practice or part thereof is
                   essential to a religion is to find out whether the
                   nature of the religion will be changed without that
                   part or practice. If the taking away that part of
                   practice could result in a fundamental change of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_106">        25.        What is sought to be contended across the bar is that
                   holding of of Bhajans, Kirtans and Gajar on the river
                   bed is an essential part or practice of the religion.
                   The order of this Court does not prevent
                   Warkari/pilgrims from organising Kirtan, Bhajan and
                   Gajar. The order of this Court holds that the said
                   activities cannot be carried out on the river bed.
                   Thus, by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that
                   act of imposing ban on erecting temporary structures
                   on the river bed will amount to the change in the
                   character of the religion or its beliefs. The test laid
                   down by the Apex Court is whether a practice is an
                   essential part of religion. The fundamental right
                   under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_48">Article 25</a> is available in case of essential or
                   integral part of religion. Therefore, by no stretch of
                   imagination, <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_49">Article 25</a> can be invoked by the
                   Warkari/organisations for using the river bed. Even
                   assuming that <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_50">Article 25</a> is applicable to such
                   activities, the right under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_51">Article 25</a> is not
                   unqualified. We have already held that any such
                   activity on the river bed will further pollute the river
                   Chandrabhagha thereby creating health hazards to
                   the citizens. While interpreting the scope and purport
                   of the fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_52">Article 25</a> of
                   the Constitution, the fundamental duty envisaged by

 32                There cannot be any dispute that there is an urgent need
 to take all possible steps to make river Godavari free of all kinds of
 pollution. With that object, various interim directions have been
 issued from time to time. Under the interim order dated 7 th March
 2014, a Committee headed by the Divisional Commissioner, Nashik
 (for short "the Committee") was ordered to be constituted. The
 Committee has been constituted as per the said order and further
 directions have been issued to the said Committee by this Court from
 time to time. The Committee is holding regular meetings for
 monitoring the implementation of the directions issued by this Court
 as also for taking steps for implementation of the directions issued by
 this Court. The object of establishing the Committee is to ensure that
 the Revenue Department of the State Government, the said Municipal
 Corporation, the Police, the Pollution Control Board and the NEERI
 other agencies act together in one direction. As pointed out earlier,
 NEERI has been appointed as an expert agency which has submitted
 several reports containing its recommendations. It is the duty of the
 Committee headed by the Divisional Commissioner to take all
 possible steps for implementation of the recommendations of NEERI.
 The Committee headed by the Divisional Commissioner will have be
 empowered to direct NEERI to submit further reports and further
 recommendations. The State Government and the said Corporation

                                                                               36 of 53

 for its day today functioning and for payment to NEERI and other
 expert agencies appointed by the Committee. As the Committee
 headed by the Divisional Commissioner is looking after and
 monitoring the implementation of the interim orders issued by this
 Court, the same Committee will have to perform the duty of
 implementing final directions issued by this Court under this
 Judgment and Order as most of the interim directions will have to be
 continued as final directions. Needless to add that the Committee
 headed by the Divisional Commissioner shall be entitled to issue
 requisitions to various authorities and officers with a view to ensure
 that the directions issued by this Court are complied with. Needless
 to add that the said directions will have to be issued within four
 corners of the law for ensuring the performance of statutory duties of
 various officers. We propose to clarify that if any party or any officer
 or any organisation has any grievance about the steps taken by the
 Committee or directions issued by the said Committee, the same will
 have to be made by way of filing civil application in the disposed of
 PIL and not by way of separate proceedings in this Court or before
 Civil Court. It will be the duty of the Committee headed by the
 Divisional Commissioner to ensure that all the recommendations in
 various reports already submitted by NEERI and which will be
 submitted by NEERI in future are implemented in its true letter and
 spirit.

 process of acquisition. Acquisition will have to be completed within a
 period of one year from today and the Municipal Corporation will
 have to be placed in possession to that part of the reserved land
 which is not placed in possession of the Municipal Corporation so far.

<p id="p_26"> 34                Apart from six STPs which are stated to be functioning,
 the proposed STPs at Gangapur and Pimpalgaon Khamb will play a
 crucial role in reducing the pollution of the river. We make it clear
 that construction of both the STPs will have to be given utmost
 priority by the said Municipal Corporation and STPs will have to be
 made functional within the time bound schedule fixed by the
 Committee. Unless both the STPs become functional all efforts made
 to reduce pollution of the river will be insufficient.

<p id="p_27"> 35                Now, we propose to deal with the other directions which
 are required to be issued. There are various reports of NEERI on
 record. The action plan laid down by NEERI in its various reports
 should be the road map for all activities dealing with the cleaning
 and rejuvenation of River Godavari. Under the interim orders of this
 Court, Godavari River Protection Police Force has been constituted
 which is headed by an officer of the level of Deputy Commissioner.
 The Commissioner of Police, Nashik will have to ensure that
 adequate number of police personnel and officers are part of the said
 force as per the requisitions which may be issued by the Committee
 headed by the Divisional Commissioner from time to time. The said
 Committee will have to take a review of the number of police officers
 and police personnel which are required to be a part of the said
 protection force. Whenever there are major religious festivals,
 additional police personnel and officers will have to be made a part

 of the protection force. The Committee shall take a decision on
 number of police personnel and officers who should be part of the
 protection force. The Committee will submit the recommendations to
 the Commissioner of Police, Nashik within a period of three months
 from today who shall ensure that police personnel and officers are
 deployed to be a part of the protection force as per the
 recommendations of the said Committee. Whenever on account of
 exigencies of religious festivals, additional police force is required,
 the Committed headed by the Divisional Commissioner will send
 necessary requisition to the Commissioner of Police who will be
 under an obligation to provide requisite force. Without help of the
 said protection force, the orders of this Court cannot be
 implemented. A proposal was submitted by the Nashik Municipal
 Corporation on 20th February 2013 for grant of approval for creating
 additional posts for the purposes of establishing a separate and
 dedicated Godavari Conservation Department. If the said proposal is
 not yet decided, the State Government will have to grant necessary
 permission to create posts within a period of two months from today.
 The Municipal Corporation will have to ensure that all the posts are
 filled     in    so    that   Godavari    Conservation    Department          starts
 functioning.

<p id="p_28"> 36                The affidavits on record and the reports on record will
 show that one of the reasons for pollution of the river is failure of
 large number of citizens to perform their fundamental duty under
 clause (g) of <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_59">Article 51A.</a> It is because of this reason that directions
 will have to be issued for preventing the citizens from polluting River
 Godavari. In fact, apart from various factors such as failure of the
 Government agencies and the said Corporation to take measures, the
 pollution could not be prevented due to failure on the part of some of

 citizens about their fundamental duty under <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_61">Article 51A(g)</a> is of great
 deal of importance. The awareness campaign is necessary in schools

 showing films, by holding road shows etc. The said Corporation
 should take lead. Help of the District Legal Services Authorities and
 its Para Legal Volunteers can be taken. We propose to direct the
 Committee to develop its own website. The website can be used for
 various purposes such as uploading the minutes of meeting, for
 receiving complaints, for reporting the action taken on the
 complaints, etc. The website will become a platform for all the
 activities concerning preventing the pollution of the river and its
 rejuvenation.

 have to take steps for demolition of illegal structures constructed on
 the river bed and around the river bed. Moreover, they will have to
 take steps to prevent such illegal constructions, whether temporary or
 permanent. The grievance redress mechanism set up under this
 Judgment will be available for submitting complaints regarding such
 illegal constructions. The Committee on the receipt of the complaints
 shall forward the same to the concerned authorities or officers. The
 said Corporation has been directed to make artificial ponds near the
 river for immersion of Ganapati and other idols. Moreover,
 permanent artificial pond must be created for the immersion of ashes
