     polluting and its fly ash coming out from power generation

     have an adverse impact to the water and also to the

</p>
<p id="p_12">6.   Learned counsel for the intervenor-Maithon Power Ltd.

</p><p id="p_13">     submitted that the Maithon Power Plant is generating 1050

     MW power strictly in compliance with all pollution norms

     and the allegations made by the petitioner in the 'Public

     Interest Litigation' are baseless. Next contention of the

     intervener is that this 'Public Interest Litigation' has been

     filed only in respect of Bee-hive Hard Coke Plant and the

     intervening-petitioner has not been made respondent in this

     'Public Interest Litigation'.
</p>
<p id="p_14">7.   Having regard to the submissions made by the learned

     counsel for the petitioner, we direct the Jharkhand State

     Pollution Control Board to inspect and file a fresh report

     keeping in view the various parameters required to be

     complied    with    and   also   to   inspect   whether   fly   ash
             discharged from the power generating company (Maithon

            Power Ltd.) is within the permissible limits and whether it

            has got any adverse impact on the environment, air, water

            and its effects on agriculture. If need be, JSPCB to engage

            the services of the expert. So far as other units i.e. Bee-hive

            Hard Coke Plant and other industries operating within the

            District of Dhanbad is concerned, the JSPCB shall also file a

            latest report as to whether in compliance of the required

            pollution laws by individual companies any action is being

            taken for such non-compliance.
