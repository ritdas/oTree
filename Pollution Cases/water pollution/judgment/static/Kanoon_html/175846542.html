      THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY        KRISHNA S. DIXIT.J.,
PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING:
                                                  W.P.No.103763/2018

                               -3-



                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      In this writ petition, challenge is laid to the order dated

28.05.2018, whereby the 1st respondent-Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board (hereafter 'KSPCB') has directed the

petitioner to close down its industrial operations and further,

the Managing Director of HESCOM is instructed to issue

necessary    direction   to   the    concerned    Engineers     for

withdrawal/disconnection of power supply to petitioner's

industry forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      It is the case of the petitioner Firm that it has been

carrying on its business relating to meat-trimming, packing

and   preservation    (cold   storage)   having    obtained    the

Combined Consent Order dated 29.05.2015 issued by the

respondent-KSPCB and the Permission dated 22.06.2015

issued by the Directorate of Industries &amp; Commerce,

Government of Karnataka, Bangalore.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      It is further the case of petitioner that the jurisdictional

police has registered Crime No.45/2018 against the petitioner

and that the industrial premises were seized by the police

inter alia alleging the violation of the provisions of the
                                               W.P.No.103763/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              -4-</span>



Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Protection

Act, 1964 as also the Prevention of Cruelty to <a href="/doc/168423045/" id="a_1">Animals Act</a>,

1960.     However, the Dharwad Bench of this Court in

petitioner's W.P.No.102915/2018 (GM-POL), has directed the

police to deliver back the seized premises by the judgment

and order dated 26.04.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        Thereafter, the respondent-KSPCB, because of undue

political influence and after formal exchange of some letters,

has issued the Closer Directions dated 28.05.2018 under

<a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_2">Section 33</a> (A) of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 read with Rule 34 of Karnataka Board for

the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution (Procedure for

Transaction of Business) and the Water (Prevention and

Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976 and also under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_4">Section 31A</a>

of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 read

with Rule 20 (A) of Karnataka Air (Prevention and Control of

Pollution) Rules, 1983. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner is

before this court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        Having heard the Sri.Santosh P Pujary, the learned

counsel for the petitioner and Sri.Gururaj Joshi, the learned
                                                  W.P.No.103763/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                -5-</span>



counsel for the respondents, we decline to entertain this writ

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       The KSPCB Order impugned in this writ petition is

appealable under <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_6">Section 33-B(C)</a> of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. This Court in more or less

similar factual matrix in W.P.Nos.26243-26245/2018 decided

on 02.07.2018, has declined to entertain the challenge on the

ground of availability of alternative remedy by way of statutory

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       However, learned counsel for the petitioner, relying on

the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Mohammed

Shah Nawaz Akhtar and others Vs. 1st ADJ Varanasi and

others reported in JT 2002 (8) SC 69, submits that for a writ of

certiorari, alternative remedy is not a bar; the rule of non-

interference in writ jurisdiction on the ground of availability of

alternative remedy is just a self-imposed restriction and

therefore, in a case where there is a prima facie violation of

principles of natural justice, this Court may not decline the

relief to the petitioner since his fundamental right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_8">Article

19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution of India is violated.
</p><p id="p_8">                                              W.P.No.103763/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              -6-</span>




       We are not impressed by the above argument of the

counsel of the petitioner since apparently, the case involves

disputed questions of facts which need adjudication at the

hands of the Statutory Tribunal in a regularly constituted

appeal.    The case does not involve any extraordinary

circumstances that warrant indulgence of writ Court even

when there is an alternate and equally efficacious remedy

provided by the statute is available.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       Therefore, without any other comment in the matter,

exercise of writ jurisdiction is declined. The petition stands

dismissed, while leaving it open for the petitioner in taking

recourse to appropriate remedy, in accordance with law.
