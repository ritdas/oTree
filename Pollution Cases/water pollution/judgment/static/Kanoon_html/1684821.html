     member   is   on   Board   today   though   it   is   considering   dispute

     that   it   contemplates   election   of   members   on   Board   and   as 
                    
     respondent   nos.3   and     4   are   not   elected   members   but   are 

     nominated by State Government, constitution of Board is contrary 
      


     to <a href="/doc/1861274/" id="a_17">Section  14</a> of Wakf Act. The provision for electoral college and 
   



     election therefrom is mandatory and always the strength of elected 

     members on Board has to be more than the nominated members. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">     No steps to conduct elections from categories to which respondent 

     nos.3 and  4 represent were initiated and hence, the composition or 





     constitution of respondent no.2 Board is bad and object with which 

     respondent   no.   2   has   been   established   is   defeated.     Even   if 

     notification   dated   27/7/2006   declaring   respondent   no.3   to   be 

     elected as its member is presumed to be valid, still other 3 members

     out of total 4 are nominated one.  Shri  Haq, learned counsel  states 




                                                                            
     that   there   were   at   least   2   eligible   candidates   in   constituency 




                                                    
     represented by respondent no.4 and there is nothing on record to 

     show that the other name ie name of Shri A.R. Antule was even 




                                                   
     taken in consideration. The  Government while taking the stand to 

     justify   nomination   of   respondent   no.4     does   not   produce   any 




                                         
     document in support and the burden to support this contention was 
                      
     upon the State. Petitioners need not call for any records as the issue 

     or facts stand concluded because of adjudication by Division Bench 
                     
     of   this   Court   at   Aurangabad   in  Syed   Jameel   Ahmed   s/o.   Syed 

     Janimiya  Vs. State  of Maharashtra through its Secretary, General 
      


     Administration Department and   ors. (supra).  There the challenge 
   



     to   government notification dated 4/9/2008 nominating members 

     on respondent no.2 Board was challenged   and findings recorded 





     therein clinch the issue even in this petition. The provisions of <a href="/doc/631210/" id="a_18">Wakf 

     Act</a> do not disqualify Shri Antule, the Hon'ble Minister only because 





     of his office  as a minister in Central Government. No such reason is 

     recorded in government file and hence, effort to substitute a new 

     contention as a reason can not be countenanced in view of   AIR

     presumed to be elected while the other 3 are nominated and hence

     provisions   of   <a href="/doc/631210/" id="a_26">Wakf   Act</a>,   She   has   argued   that   once   the   Board   is 





     brought into existence  as per <a href="/doc/1188385/" id="a_27">Section 13</a>, a legal person is born and 

     by   defects   like   vacancies   or   in   constitution,   its   life   is   not   taken 





     away.   As   Board   has   to   decide   as   per   majority,   the   number   of 

     members available on Board may fluctuate but that does not effect 

     its   powers   or   adjudication.   She   therefore   contends   that   even   on 

     merits there is no substance in writ petition.

     not entitled to any relief. Respondents no. 3 and  4 were not parties 




                                                        
     to that petition.   He contends that maximum strength possible as

     developments are known to everybody and  petitioners have placed

                  Writ   of   Prohibition   can   be   issued   in   contingencies 

     explained   by   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   in                Thirumala   Tirupati 
                      
     Devasthanams v. Thallappaka Anantha Charyulu (supra).   As held 

     therein,   a   writ   of   prohibition   is   normally   issued   only   when   the 
      


     inferior Court or Tribunal (a) proceeds to act without or in excess of 
   



     jurisdiction,   (b)   proceeds   to   act   in   violation   of   rules   of   natural 

     justice, (c) proceeds to act under law which is itself ultra vires or 





     unconstitutional,   or   (d)   proceeds   to   act   in   contravention   of 

     fundamental rights. The principles, which govern exercise of such 

     power,   must   be   strictly   observed.   A   writ   of   prohibition   must   be 





     issued only in rarest of rare cases. Judicial discipline of the highest 

     order has to be exercised whilst issuing such writs. Hon'ble Apex 

     Court emphasizes that the writ jurisdiction  is original jurisdiction 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:01:57 :::</span>

     be   disguised   in   the   form   of   a   writ.   In   other   words,   this   power 




                                                        
     cannot be allowed to be used "as a clock of an appeal in disguise". 
</p>
<p id="p_40">     Hon'ble   Apex   Court   states   that   lax   use   of   such   a   power   would 




                                                       
     impair the dignity and integrity of the subordinate Court and could 

     also   lead   to   chaotic   consequences.   It   would   undermine   the 




                                          
     confidence of the subordinate Court. It is noticed that  total lack of 
                       
     jurisdiction in the civil Court was not even the stand. Hon'ble Cort 

     mentions that   the civil Court, before which the suit was pending, 
                      
     had   powers   to   decide   on   the   maintainability   of   the   suit   and   to 

     decide   on   questions   of   its   jurisdiction.   The   civil   Court   had 
      


     jurisdiction to decide whether the suit was barred by Section 14 of 
   



     the   A.P.   (Andhra   Area)   Inams   (Abolition   and   Conversion   into 

     Ryotwari)   Act   (37   of   1956)   or   on   principles   of   res 





     judicata/estoppel. Hence, the  Apex Court  holds  that   unless  there 

     was some very cogent or strong reason the High Court should not 





     have prevented the Court of competent jurisdiction from deciding 

     these   questions.   We   find   that   thus   the   question   of   defective 

     constitution   of   Civil   Court   was   not   involved     and   Hon'ble   Apex 

     Court lays down that High Court should not usurp the jurisdiction

     prayers for wits of certiorari and mandamus were misconceived as 
                       
     there   was   no   order   either   judicial   or   quasi-judicial   to   attract 

     certiorari. No mandamus could  go because nothing was required to 
                      
     be done or forborne under the Act. The issue of the notice in the 

     case before it required the parties to re-present their case. There 
      


     was no scope for mandamus to do any duty or act under the statute.

     judicial   decision,   but   the   proceeding   was   found   principally   and

     respondent no.2 Board had come to knowledge of respondent no.1 

     when Aurangabad Division Bench in Syed Jameel Ahmed s/o. Syed

     through their advocate on 20/2/2009 but then its purpose was to 

     persuade State and  Wakf Board to summon all Board Members to 





     attend the meetings. It expressly makes a grievance that 7 members 

     duly appointed on 4/9/2008 were not being summoned to attend 





     the   meeting.   This   notification   dated   4/9/2008   is   set   aside   on 

     29/7/2009 by the   Aurangabad Division  Bench.  Thus  respondents 

     no.2   to   6   are   right   when   they   contend   that   there   is   drastic 

     difference between this demand and   prayers in writ petition. But

     Nos.1633/2008 and  2669/2008. Challenge in those writ petitions 
                       
     was to the order dated 26/3/2008 passed by then chief executive 

     officer of respondent no.2 Wakf Board. All respective parties then

     the controversies were to be looked into by the entire Board, it was 
                      
     obligatory to summon new members also to the meetings. Again the 

     only anxiety expressed was to see that all board members attended 
                     
     the   meetings     and     participate   in   decision   making.     The   alleged

     with the application under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_68">Article 227.</a> Therefore the fact that a suit 

     had already been filed by the appellant was found to be not such a 





     fact the suppression of which could have affected the final disposal 

     of the writ petition on merits. This law clinches the controversy on 

     the point before us.

     as  there   the  challenge   to  notification   issued  on  23/10/1996   was 
                     
     made in 1998 after undergoing selection process of which results

     were   made   on   7/4/1998.   The   challenge   was   found   to   be   after 

     noticing observations of High Court in its earlier judgment dated 
      


     31/8/1998   in   Writ   Petition   No.18307/1998.   Hence,     in   this 
   



     background the said challenge is held belated and suffering from

     consequent   to  judgment  of  Aurangabad  Bench   dated   29/7/2009,

     indulge in conjectural exercise on reasons for their not appearing 
   



     here. In order to force them to appear and to enable us to proceed

     u/<a href="/doc/915285/" id="a_80">Section   14(3)</a>   appointed   respondents   no.4   to   8   before 
                      
     Aurangabad   Bench   as   members   and   those   nominations   were

     practicable to constitute electoral college for any of the categories 

     in <a href="/doc/58561897/" id="a_87">Section 14(1)(b)(i)</a> to (iii). At the end of para 14, the Division 
                     
     Bench   has   concluded   that   opinion   subjectively   reached   by   State 

     Government in this respect can be judicially examined only to find 
      


     out  whether  it  is   based  on  the   circumstances   relevant   under  the 
   



     statutory   scheme.   Then   the   Division   Bench   has   proceeded   to 

     scrutinize   whether   any   such   subjective   satisfaction   is   recorded 





     before   effecting   nominations   on   4/9/2008   and   has   concluded   in 

     end of para 16 that there was no such mention or discussion and 





     State   Government   was   not   even   aware   of   need   recording   such 

     satisfaction. It therefore found that recourse to <a href="/doc/915285/" id="a_88">Section 14(3)</a> was 

     not legal. However, the Bench did not stop there and also perused 

     the government files to find out whether any material to indicate

     Government to derive such conclusion. Its findings in para 18 show 

     that list of eligible members of legislative assembly and  council and

     election from said categories was possible. Secretary, Bar Council of 
                     
     Maharashtra did communicate on 29/7/2008 name of only muslim 

     representative on State Bar Council. In para 25, Division Bench has 
                    
     held   that   special   provision   for   constitution   of   Wakf   Board   by 

     nomination  is made  to meet peculiar situation  in which it is not 
      


     reasonably practicable to constitute electoral college from these 3 
   



     categories. The Division Bench has therefore upheld the  challenge 

     to notification dated 4/9/2008.

     become   an   integral   part   of   the   enactment   and   thus   acquire   the 




                                                     
     tenor or colour of the substantive enactment itself. It can also be 

     used   as   an   optional   addenda   to   the   enactment   with   object   of 




                                         
     explaining the real intendment of statutory provision. It is clarified 
                      
     by   the   learned   authour   that   this   enumeration   of   the   purpose   of 

     proviso is not exhaustive and ultimately, like any other enactment, 
                     
     a proviso needs to be construed on its terms. It is also stated that 

     "exception" is intended to restrict enacting part to particular cases 
      


     while   "proviso"   is   used   to   remove   particular   cases   from   general 
   



     enactment and    provide   for  it specially.  As already  found  above, 

     exception   part   at   the   end   of   <a href="/doc/2843350/" id="a_135">Section   14(4)</a>   avoids   enacting   part 





     therein only when there is recourse to <a href="/doc/915285/" id="a_136">Section 14(3)</a>. But then such 

     recourse must be legal, valid   and ratio contemplated by enacting 





     part must get disturbed thereby. Thus only when the constitution of 

     electoral college for three categories specified in <a href="/doc/34071052/" id="a_137">Section 14(1)(b)</a> 

     of Wakf Act is found not possible and hence, power to nominate is 

     used in terms of its <a href="/doc/915285/" id="a_138">Section 14(3)</a> by State Government and such 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:01:58 :::</span>

     nomination   results   in   more   number   of   nominated   members,   the 




                                                                              
     enacting part is not applicable. Here there is only one nomination ie 




                                                      
     of respondent no.4 and equation did not get disturbed due to it. As 

     is found elsewhere, the unreasonable and undue insistence of State 




                                                     
     Government   to   continue   with   vacancies   has   given   rise   to   this 

     position. Hence, said exception is not attracted in present facts.

     qua non. Further, persons to be so nominated have to be such as 
   



     State deems fit for the post of member on Wakf Board. Hence the 

     State   is   duty   bound   to   consider   even   background   and     status   of 





     person being chosen by it.   Thus there are rigourous requirements 

     and   filters; and nomination  also has  to be  keeping  in mind the 

     importance given to elective process.   Justiciability of this  exercise 





     is already commented upon by us above and has been considered in 

     detail by this Court in its Aurangabad judgment. Thus nomination 

     against posts to be filled in by election is only an exception. S.14

     similar   provisions   from   other   enactments   with   stand   that   this 

     arrangement   in Statute is a standard practice.   However question 




                                        
     before   us   is   not   about   invalidation   of   proceedings   already 
                     
     concluded but pertains to pending one. <a href="/doc/1459092/" id="a_183">Section 22</a> reads as under:--
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                "22.   Vacancies,   etc.,   not   to   invalidate  
                proceedings   of   the   Board.--No   act   or  
                proceeding   of   the   Board   shall   be   invalid  by

                amongst   its   members   or   any   defect   in   the

<p id="p_112">                 It   is   obvious   that   said   section   is   not   an   enabling 

     provision but a saving one. It can not and does not mean that Wakf 





     Board   with   defective   composition   and     vacancies   is   allowed   to 

     proceed to decide and parliament has given it a license to do so.

     Senior   counsel,   in this regard does not show any such leave to 




                                                                               
     decide despite knowledge of defect. Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/335089/" id="a_184">Gulzari

     noticed   and   then   in   para   17,   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   has   gathered 
                     
     intention   of   legislature   not  to  to  render  State     Commission  non-

<p id="p_114">     functional   in   absence   of   president   and   it   is   found   that   in   his 
      


     absence, senior-most   member is to function as president. Facts in 
   



     <a href="/doc/242440/" id="a_188">Akhil Bharat Gosewa Sangha vs. State of A.P. and   others</a>  (supra) 

     reveal that the Chairman and   Member-Secretary of A.P. Pollution 





     control board (APPCB) did not posses necessary qualifications and 

     Hon'ble Apex Court noticed that High Court did not address specific 





     breach of statutory requirements in this respect though it noticed 

     that some of its members were scientific experts. In this background 

     the   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   considers   <a href="/doc/921478/" id="a_189">Section   11</a>   of   the   Water   Act, 

     which provides in terms that "No act or proceeding of a Board or any  




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:01:59 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">                                               70</span>


     committee thereof shall be called in question on the ground merely of  




                                                                               
     the existence of any vacancy in or any defect in the constitution of, the 




                                                      
     Board or such committee, as the case may be." Therefore, applying 

     <a href="/doc/258643/" id="a_190">Section   11</a>   of   the   Act   which   clearly   provides   that   no   act   or 




                                                     
     proceeding of APPCB or any committee thereof shall be called in 

     question, Hon'ble Apex Court concluded that even if there was some 




                                         
     defect in the composition of the APPCB, that would not invalidate 
                      
     the   consent   order   issued   by   it.   Observations   of   Learned   Single 

     Judge  of  Hon'ble   Delhi  High  Court in    <a href="/doc/384205/" id="a_191">Trilochan  Singh  Rana  vs. 
                     
     Joginder Singh Bajwa</a> (supra) are cited to explain interpretation of 

     Section 22 of Delhi Sikh Gurudwaras Act,1971.   That Section is  in 
      


     same  words   as   <a href="/doc/1459092/" id="a_192">Section   22</a>   of   the  Wakf   Act.   The   act  of  manging 
   



     committee   in   co-opting   a   person   to   fill   up   vacancy   of   co-opted 

     member without first filling in vacancy of elected member is found 





     to   be   saved   by   <a href="/doc/1459092/" id="a_193">Section   22</a>   of   said   <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_194">Delhi   Act</a>,   1971.   All   these 

     judgments consider challenge to completed actions or decisions and 





     aggrieved parties there did not try to stop the process midway as is 

     attempted by petitioners before us. It is clear in present facts that 

     <a href="/doc/1459092/" id="a_195">Section 22</a> can not be invoked by State Government to urge that it 

     can not be asked to fill in vacancy of shia member. Such provision 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:01:59 :::</span>

     also does not help it to argue that respondent 2 Board can decide 




                                                                                
     with its existing composition when number of elected members is 




                                                        
     less than nominated one and such decision will be valid.   <a href="/doc/1459092/" id="a_196">Section 

     22</a>   of   the   Wakf   Act   carries   with   it   an   important   rider   that 




                                                       
     invalidation is not possible "by reason only of " existence of vacancy 

     or defect in constitution. Hence, if invalidation is sought only on 




                                          
     one ground the protection under <a href="/doc/1459092/" id="a_197">Section 22</a> will be available   to 
                       
     completed actions. But when more number of elected members is 

     mandated   by   parliament   with   idea   of   infusing   more   democratic 
                      
     element or shia member on Wakf Board is prescribed to give the 

     people   of   that   sect   an   effective   voice   in   Wakf   Board   affairs,   the 
      


     omission to have such more elected members or a shia member may 
   



     prejudice the decision of Wakf   Board. It can not be ignored that 

     Wakf Board has to decide by majority and presently more than 50% 





     of its posts are vacant. The object of parliament behind providing 

     such type of arrangement and  representation stands defeated. It is 





     equally important to note that State Government is not coming up 

     with any explanation or reason for not filling in these vacancies or 

     for   permitting   the   Wakf   Board   as   it   is.     If   interpretation   of 

     respondents is accepted, there can not be any challenge at any time

     license to it to perpetuate such defects in composition or continue

     present   Wakf   Board   which   does   not   have   a   shia   member   or   the 





     elected members more in number than nominated one is not legal
