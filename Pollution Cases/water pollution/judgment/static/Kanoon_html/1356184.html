              WRIT PETITION (C) No.967 OF 1989



Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action                ... Petitioners

Union of India &amp; Others                              ... Respondents





                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Dalveer Bhandari, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.    This is a very unusual and extraordinary litigation where 



even after fifteen years of the final judgment of this court (date 



of   judgment   13th  February,   1996)   the   litigation   has   been 



deliberately kept alive by filing one interlocutory application or 



the other in order to avoid compliance of the judgment.   The 



said judgment of this Court has not been permitted to acquire 



finality till date.  This is a classic example how by abuse of the 



process of law even the final judgment of the apex court can 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>


be  circumvented  for  more than a decade and  a  half.   This is 



indeed   a   very   serious   matter   concerning   the   sanctity   and 



credibility   of   the   judicial   system   in   general   and   of   the   apex 



court in particular.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    An   environmentalist   organisation   brought   to   light   the 



sufferings and woes of people living in the vicinity of chemical 



industrial   plants   in   India.     This   petition   relates   to   the 



suffering   of   people   of   village   Bichhri   in   Udaipur   District   of 



Rajasthan.     In   the   Writ     Petition   No.967   of   1989,   it   was 



demonstrated how the conditions of a peaceful, nice and small 



village   of   Rajasthan   were   dramatically   changed   after 



respondent   no.   4   Hindustan   Agro   Chemicals   Limited   started 



producing certain chemicals like Oleum (concentrated form of 



sulphuric   acid)   and   Single   Super   Phosphate.   Respondent 



numbers   4   to   8   are   controlled   by   the   same   group   and   they 



were   known   as   chemical   industries.     The   entire   chemical 



industrial   complex   is   located   within   the   limits   of   Bichhri 



village, Udaipur, Rajasthan. Pursuit of profit of entrepreneurs 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>


has   absolutely   drained   them   of   any   feeling   for   fellow   human 



beings living in that village.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    The basic facts of this case are taken from the judgment 



delivered   in   the   Writ   Petition   No.967   of   1989.     In   the 



beginning of the judgment of this court delivered on February 



13, 1996, it is observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "It highlights the disregard, nay, contempt for 

      law   and   lawful   authorities   on   the   part   of   some 

      among the emerging breed of entrepreneurs, taking 

      advantage,   as   they   do,   of   the   country's   need   for 

      industrialisation   and   export   earnings.   Pursuit   of 

      profit has absolutely drained them of any feeling for 

      fellow human beings - for that matter, for anything 

      else.   And   the   law   seems   to   have   been   helpless. 

      Systemic   defects?   It   is   such   instances   which   have 

      led   many   people   in   this   country   to   believe   that 

      disregard of law pays and that the consequences of 

      such   disregard   will   never   be   visited   upon   them 

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      -particularly,   if   they   are   men   with   means.   Strong 

      words   indeed   -   but   nothing   less   would   reflect   the 

      deep   sense   of   hurt,   the   hearing   of   this   case   has 

      instilled in us."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">
</blockquote><p id="p_5">4.    It   seems   that   the   court   was   prophetic   when   it   made 



observation   that   at   times   men   with   means   are   successful   in 



avoiding compliance of the orders of this court.  This case is a 



classic   illustration  where   even  after   decade  and  a  half   of  the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>


pronouncement   of   the   judgment   by   this   court   based   on   the 



principle   of   `polluter   pays',   till   date   the   polluters   (concerned 



industries   in   this   case)   have   taken   no   steps   to   ecologically 



restore   the   entire   village   and   its   surrounding   areas   or 



complied with the directions of this court at all.  The orders of 



this court were not implemented by keeping the litigation alive 



by   filing   interlocutory   and   interim   applications   even   after 



dismissal   of   the   writ   petition,   the   review   petition   and   the 



curative petition by this court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    In the impugned judgment, it is mentioned that because 



of  the  pernicious  wastes  emerging   from   the  production   of  'H' 



acid,   its   manufacture   is   stated   to   have   been   banned   in   the 



western   countries.   But   the   need   of   'H'   acid   continues   in   the 



West   and   that   need   is   catered   to   by   the   industries   like   the 



Silver Chemicals and Jyoti Chemicals in this part of the world. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    In   the   impugned   judgment,   it   is   also   mentioned   that 



since   the   toxic   untreated   waste   waters   were   allowed   to   flow 



out freely and because the untreated toxic sludge was thrown 



in the open in and around the complex, the toxic substances 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>


have percolated deep into the bowels of the earth polluting the 



aquifers and the sub-terrain supply of water. The water in the 



wells and the streams has turned dark and dirty rendering it 



unfit for human consumption. It has become unfit for cattle to 



drink and for irrigating the land. The soil has become polluted 



rendering it unfit for cultivation, which is the main source of 



livelihood   for   the   villagers.   The   resulting   misery   to   the 



villagers   needs   no   emphasis.   It   spreads   disease,   death   and 



disaster in the village and the surrounding areas. This sudden 



degradation of earth and water had an echo in Parliament too 



and the concerned Minister said that action was being taken, 



but   nothing   meaningful   was   done   on   the   spot.   The   villagers 



then rose in virtual revolt leading to the imposition of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_1">Section 



144</a>  of the Criminal Procedure Code by the District Magistrate 



in   the   area   and   the   closure   of   Silver   Chemicals   in   January, 



1989.   It   is   averred   by   the   respondents   that   both   the   units, 



Silver   Chemicals   and   Jyoti   Chemicals   have   stopped 



manufacturing   'H'   acid   since   January,   1989   and   are   closed. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">We   may   assume   it   to   be   so,     yet   the   consequences   of   their 



action remain - the sludge, the long-lasting damage to earth, 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                             6</span>


to   underground   water,   to   human   beings,   to   cattle   and   the 



village economy.

<p id="p_9">7.      The   Rajasthan   State   Pollution   Control   Board   (for   short 



"R.S.P.C.B.")   in   pursuance   of   the   show   cause   notice   filed   a 



counter affidavit and stated the following averments:

<p id="p_10">(a)        Re.:       Hindustan   Agro   Chemicals   Limited 

           (respondent   for   short)   [R-4]:   The   unit   obtained 

           'No-Objection Certificate' from the R.S.P.C.B. for 

           manufacturing   sulphuric   acid   and   Aluminum 

           sulphate.   The   Board   granted   clearance   subject 

           to   certain   conditions.   Later   'No-Objection 

           Certificate'   was   granted   under   the   Water 

           [Prevention   and   Control   of   Pollution]   Act,   1974 

           [<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water   Act</a>]   and   Air   (Prevention   and   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control   of

           certain   conditions.   However,   this   unit   changed 

           its   product   without   clearance   from   the   Board.

           promoted   by   the   fourth   respondent   without 

           obtaining   'No-Objection   Certificate'   from   the 

           Board for the manufacture of 'H' acid. The waste 

           water generated from the manufacture of 'H' acid 

           is   highly   acidic   and   contains   very   high 

           concentration   of   dissolved   solids   along   with 

           several   dangerous   pollutants.   This   unit   was 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    7</span>


        commissioned   in   February,   1988   without 

        obtaining   the   prior   consent   of   the   Board   and 

        accordingly, notice of closure was served on April 

        30, 1988. On May 12, 1988, the unit applied for 

        consent   under   Water   and   <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air   Act</a>s   which   was 

        refused. The Government was requested to issue 

        directions for cutting off the electricity and water 

        to   this   unit   but   no   action   was   taken   by   the 

        Government.   The   unit   was   found   closed   on   the 

        date of inspection, viz., October 2, 1989. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">(c)     Re.:  Rajasthan   Multi   Fertilizers  [R-6]:   This   unit

        February   20,   1989.   In   reply   thereto,   the   Board 

        was informed that the unit was closed since last 

        three years and that electricity has also been cut 

        off since February 12, 1988.

        apply for consent under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>s. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">        When   notice   dated   February   20,   1989   was 

        served   upon   this   unit,   the   Management   replied 

        that this unit was closed for a long time. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">(e)     Re.:  Jyoti Chemicals  [R-8]:  This unit applied for 

        'No-Objection   Certificate'   for   producing   ferric 

        alum.   'No-Objection   Certificate'   was   issued 

        imposing   various   conditions   on   April   8,   1988. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">        The  'No-Objection Certificate'  was withdrawn on 

        May   30,   1988   on   account   of   non-compliance 

        with   its   conditions.   The   consent   applied   for 

        under  Water  and  <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air  Act</a>s  by  this unit   was  also 

        refused. Subsequently, on February 9, 1989, the 

        unit applied for fresh consent for manufacturing

          'H'   acid.   The   consent   was   refused   on   May   30, 

          1989. The Board has been keeping an eye upon 

          this   unit   to   ensure   that   it   does   not   start   the 

          manufacture   of   'H'   acid.   On   October   2,   1989, 

          when   the   unit   was   inspected,   it   was   found 

          closed. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">8.     The   Government   of   Rajasthan   filed   counter-affidavit   on 



January 20, 1990. The Para 3 of the affidavit reads as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          "That the State Government is now aware of the 

          pollution of under-ground water being caused by

          Respondent   Nos.   4   to   8   in   the   writ   petition. 

          Therefore,   the   State   Government   has   initiated 

          action   through   the   Pollution   Control   Board   to 

          check further spread of pollution."





</blockquote><p id="p_22">9.     The   State   Government   stated   that   the   water   in   certain 



wells   in   Bichhri   village   and   some   other   surrounding   villages 



has   become   unfit   for   drinking   for   human   beings   and   cattle,

India   (for   short   `MOEF')   in   its   counter   affidavit   filed   on 



February   8,   1990   stated   that   M/s.   Silver   Chemicals   was 



merely   granted   a   Letter   of   Intent   but   it   never   applied   for

<p id="p_24">Commencing production before obtaining industrial licence is 



an   offence   under   Industries   [Development   and   Regulation] 



Act, 1951. So far as M/s. Jyoti Chemicals is concerned, it is 



stated that it has not approached the Government at any time 



even   for   a   Letter   of   Intent.   The   Government   of   India   stated 



that in June, 1989, a study of the situation in Bichhri village 



and   some   other   surrounding   villages   was   conducted   by   the 



Centre   for   Science   and   Environment.   A   copy   of   their   report 



was enclosed with the counter affidavit. The report states the 



consequences  emanating from  the  production  of  'H'  acid  and 



the manner in which the resulting wastes were dealt with by 



Respondents Nos. 4 to 8 thus: 
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "The effluents are very difficult to treat as many of 

      the   pollutants   present   are   refractory   in   nature. 

      Setting   up   such   highly   polluting   industry   in   a 

      critical   ground   water   area   was   essentially   ill-

      conceived.   The   effluents   seriously   polluted   the 

      nearby   drain   and   overflowed   into   Udaisagar   main 

      canal,   severely   corroding   its   cement-concrete   lined 

      bed   and   banks.   The   polluted   waters   also   seriously 

      degraded   some   agricultural   land   and   damaged 

      standing   crops.   On   being   ordered   to   contain   the 

      effluents, the industry installed an unlined holding 

      pond   within   its   premises   and   resorted   to   spraying 

      the   effluent   on   the   nearby   hill-slope.   This   only 

      resulted in extensive seepage and percolation of the

       effluents   into  ground   water   and   their   spread  down 

       the   aquifers.   Currently   about   60   wells   appear   to 

       have   been   significantly   polluted   but   every   week   a 

       few   new   wells,   down   the   aquifers   start   showing 

       signs   of   pollution.   This   has   created   serious 

       problems   for   water   supply   for   domestic   purposes, 

       cattle-watering   crop   irrigation   and   other   beneficial 

       uses,   and   it   has   also   caused   human   illness   and 

       even   death,   degradation   of   land   and   damage   to 

       fruit,   trees   and   other   vegetation.   There   are   serious 

       apprehensions   that   the   pollution   and   its   harmful 

       effects   will   spread   further   after   the   onset   of   the 

       monsoon   as   the   water   percolating   from   the   higher 

       parts   of   the   basin   moves   down   carrying   the

failed to carry out the orders of this Court dated April 4, 1990. 
</p>
<p id="p_30">Accordingly,   this   Court   directed   the   MOEF   to   depute   its 



experts   immediately   to   inspect   the   area   to   ascertain   the 



existence and extent of gypsum-based and iron-based sludge, 



to   suggest   the   handling   and   disposal   procedures   and   to 



prescribe   a   package   for   its   transportation   and   safe   storage. 
</p>
<p id="p_31">The   cost   of   such   storage   and   transportation   was   to   be 



recovered from the concerned respondents. 
</p>
<p id="p_32">13.    Pursuant   to   the   above   order,   a   team   of   experts   visited 



the area and submitted a report along with an affidavit dated 



March   30,   1992.   The   report   presented   a   highly   disturbing 



picture. It stated that the sludge was found inside a shed and 



also at four places outside the shed but within the premises of 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       12</span>


the   complex   belonging   to   the   respondents.   It   further   stated 



that the sludge has been mixed with soil and at many places 



it is covered with earth. A good amount of sludge was said to 



be lying exposed to sun and rain. 
</p>
<p id="p_33">14.    The   report   stated:   "Above   all,   the   extent   of   pollution   in 



the   ground   water   seems   to   the   very   great   and   the   entire 



aquifer   may   be   affected   due   to   the   pollution   caused   by   the 



industry.   The   organic   content   of   the   sludge   needs   to   be 



analysed   to   assess   the   percolation   property   of   the   contents 



from the sludge. It is also possible that the iron content in the 



sludge   may   be   very   high   which   may   cause   the   reddish 



colouration. As the mother liquor produced during the process 



(with   pH-1)   was   highly   acidic   in   nature   and   was 



indiscriminately discharged on land by the unit, it is possible 



that   this   might   have   eroded   soil   and   caused   the   extensive 



damage.   It   is   also   possible   that   the   organic   contents   of   the 



mother   liquor   would   have   gone   into   soil   with   water   together 



with the reddish colour." The report also suggested the mode 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                       13</span>


of   disposal   of   sludge   and   measures   for   re-conditioning   the 



soil. 
</p>
<p id="p_34">15.       In view of the above report, the Court made an order on 



April 6, 1992 for entombing the sludge under the supervision 



of  the officers  of the  MOEF. Regarding revamping of  the soil, 



the   Court   observed   that   for   this   purpose,   it   might   become 



necessary to stop or suspend the operation of all the units of 



the   respondent   but   that,   the   Court   said,   requires   to   be 



examined further. 
</p>
<p id="p_35">16.       The   work   of   entombment   of   sludge   again   faced   several 



difficulties.   While   the   respondents   blamed   the   Government 



officers for the delay, the Government officials blamed the said 



respondents   of   non-cooperation.   Several   Orders   were   passed 



by   this   Court   in   that   behalf   and   ultimately,   the   work 



commenced.

directed on 20th August, 1993 that samples should be taken 



of the entombed sludge and also of the water from the affected 



wells and sent for analysis. Environment experts of the MOEF 



were asked to find out whether the pollution in the well water 



was   on   account   of   the   said   sludge   or   not.   Accordingly, 



analysis was conducted and the experts submitted the Report 



on   November   1,   1993.   Under   the   heading   "Conclusion",   the 



report stated:

      5.1   On   the   basis   of   the   observations   and   analysis 

      results,   it   is   concluded   beyond   doubt   that   the 

      sludge   inside   the   emoted   pit   is   the   contaminated 

      one   as   evident   from   the   number   of   parameters

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">
      5.2   The   ground   water   is   also   contaminated   due   to 

      discharge of H- acid plant effluent as well as H-acid 

      sludge/contaminated soil leachiest as shown in the 

      photographs and also supported by the results. The 

      analysis   result   revealed   good   correlation   between 

      the   colour   of   well   water   and   H-acid   content   in   it. 

      The analysis results show high degree of impurities 

      in   sludge/soil   and   also   in   well   water   which   is   a 

      clear indication of contamination of soil and ground 

      water due to disposal of H-acid waste.

</blockquote><p id="p_38">The report which is based upon their inspection of 

the   area   in   September,   1993   revealed   many   other 

alarming   features.   It   represents   a   commentary   on 

the   attitude   and   actions   of   the   respondents.   In 

Para-2,   under   the   heading   "Site   Observations   &amp; 

Collection   of   Sludge/Contaminated   Soil   Samples", 

the following facts are stated: 
</p>
<p id="p_39">2.1.   The   Central   team,   during   inspection   of   the 

premises   of   M/s.   HACL,   observed   that   H-acid 

sludge (iron gypsum) and contaminated soil are still 

lying   at   different   places,   as   shown   in   Figure   1, 

within the industrial premises(Photograph 1) which 

are   the   left   overs.   The   area,   where   the   solar 

evaporation   pond   was   existing   with   H-acid   sludge 

dumped here and there, was observed to have been 

leveled   with   borrowed   soil   (Photograph   2).   It   was 

difficult   to   ascertain   whether   the   sludge   had   been 

removed   before   filling.   However,   there   are   visual 

evidences of contaminated soil in the area. 
</p>
<p id="p_40">2.2   As   reported   by   the   R.S.P.C.B.   representatives, 

about 720 tonnes out of the total contaminated soil 

and   sludge   scraped   from   the   sludge   dump   sites   is 

disposed   of   in   six   lined   entombed   pits   covered   by 

lime/flash   mix,   brick   soling   and   concrete 

(Photographs were placed on record). The remaining 

scraped   sludge   and   contaminated   soil   was   lying 

near   the   entombed   pits   for   want   of   additional 

disposal   facility.   However,   during   the   visit,   the   left 

over   sludge   and   contaminated   soil   could   not   be 

traced   at   site.   Inspection   of   the   surrounding   area 

revealed that a huge heap of foreign soil of 5 metre 

height   heap   of   foreign   soil   of   5   metre   height 

(Photograph was placed on record) covering a large 

area,  as  also  indicated   in  Fig.   I,  was  raised  on the 

sloppy   ground   at   the   foot   hill   within   the   industry 

premises. The storm water run-off pathway over the 

area   showed   indication   of   H-acid   sludge   leachate 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 16</span>


coming   out   of   the   heap.   Soil   in   the   area   was 

sampled for analysis. 
</p>
<p id="p_41">2.3   M/s.   HACL   has   a   number   of   other   industrial 

units which are operating within the same premises 

without   valid   consents   from   the   R.S.P.C.B.   These 

plants   are   sulphuric   acid   (H2SO4),   fertilizer   (SSP) 

and   vegetable   oil   extraction.   The   effluents   of   these 

units   are   not   properly   treated   and   the   untreated 

effluent   particularly   from   the   acid   plant   is   passing 

through   the   sludge   dump   area   playing   havoc 

(Photograph   was   placed   on   record).   The   final 

effluent   was   collected   at   the   outlet   of   the   factory 

premises   during   operation   of   these   units,   at   the 

time of groundwater monitoring in September 1993, 

by the RSPCB. Its quality was observed to be highly 

acidic (pH : 1.08, Conductivity : 37,100 mg/1, SO4 

:   21,000   mg/1,   Fe   :   392   mg/1,   COD   :   167   mg/1) 

which   was   also   revealed   in   the   earlier   visits   of   the 

Central   teams.   However,   these   units   were   not   in 

operation during the present visit.

<p id="p_42">Under Para 4.2.1, the report stated inter alia: 
</p>
<p id="p_43">The   sludge   samples   from   the   surroundings   of   the 

(presently   nonexistent)   solar   evaporation   and   the 

contaminated   soil   due   to   seepage   from   the   newly 

raised dump site also exhibited very high values of 

the above mentioned parameters. This revealed that 

the   contaminated   soil   is   buried   under   the   new 

dump found by the team.

of   1994   in   this   Court,   under   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_10">Article  32</a>  of   the 

Constitution,   questioning   the   said   Orders   in 

January,   1994.   The   main   grievance   in   this   writ 

petition   was   that   without   even   waiting   for   the 

petitioner's   [Hindustan   Agro   Chemicals   Limited] 

reply   to   the   show-cause   notices,   orders   of   closure 

and disconnection of electricity supply were passed 

and   that   this   was   done   by   the   R.S.P.C.B.   with   a 

malafide intent to cause loss to the industry. It was 

also submitted  that sudden closure of  its plants  is 

likely   to   result   in   disaster   and,   may   be,   an 

explosion and that this consideration was not taken 

into account while ordering the closure. In its Order 

dated   March   7,   1994,   this   Court   found   some 

justification   in   the   contention   of   the   industry   that 

the various counter-affidavits filed by the R.S.P.C.B. 
</p>
<p id="p_48">are   self-contradictory.   The   Board   was   directed   to 

adopt   a   constructive   attitude   in   the   matter.   By 

another   Order   dated   March   18,   1994,   the 

R.S.P.C.B.   was   directed   to   examine   the   issue   of

<p id="p_49">       before   April   11,   1994   and   the   R.S.P.C.B.   was

       storage   tank   for   storing   and   retaining   ten   days 

       effluents   from   the   Sulphuric   Acid   Plant.   The 

       construction of temporary tank was supposed to be 

       an interim measure pending the construction of an 

       E.T.P.   on   permanent   basis.   The   Order   dated   April 

       28, 1994 noted the Report of the R.S.P.C.B. stating 

       that   the   construction   of   temporary   tank   was 

       completed on April 26, 1994 under its supervision.

anything   likely   to   do   mischief   if   it   escapes   must 

keep it at his peril and, if he fails to do so, is prima

collects and keeps there anything likely to do harm 

and   such   thing   escapes   and   does   damage   to

which   escapes   is   present   by   the   consent   of   the 

person   injured   or   in   certain   cases   where   there   is 

statutory   authority.   Vide   Halsbury   Laws   of 

England, Vol. 45 para 1305. Considerable case law 

has developed in England as to what is natural and 

what   is   non-natural   use   of   land   and   what   are 

precisely the circumstances in which this rule may 

be   displaced.   But   it   is   not   necessary   for   us   to 

consider   these   decisions   laying   down   the 

parameters   of   this   rule   because   in   a   modern 

industrial   society   with   highly   developed   scientific 

knowledge   and   technology   where   hazardous   or 

inherently   dangerous   industries   are   necessary   to 

carry   out   part   of   the   developmental   programme, 

this   rule   evolved   in   the   19th   Century   at   a   time

technology   had   not   taken   place   cannot   afford   any 

guidance   in   evolving   any   standard   of   liability 

consistent   with   the   constitutional   norms   and   the 

needs   of   the   present   day   economy   and   social 

structure.   We   need   not   feel   inhibited   by   this   rule 

which   was   evolved   in   this   context   of   a   totally

different kind of economy. Law has to grow in order 

to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and 

keep   abreast   with   the   economic   developments 

taking place in the country. As new situations arise 

the   law   has   to   be   evolved   in   order   to   meet   the 

challenge of such new situations. Law cannot afford 

to   remain   static.   We   have   to   evolve   new   principles 

and   lay   down   new   norms   which   would   adequately 

deal with the new problems which arise in a highly 

industrialised   economy.   We   cannot   allow   our 

judicial   thinking   to   be   constricted   by   reference   to 

the law as it prevails in England or for the matter of 

that   in   any   other   foreign   country.   We   no   longer 

need   the   crutches   of   a   foreign   legal   order.   We   are 

certainly   prepared   to   receive   light   from   whatever 

source   it   comes   but   we   have   to   build   up   our   own 

jurisprudence   and   we   cannot   countenance   an 

argument   that   merely   because   the   law   in   England 

does   not   recognise   the   rule   of   strict   and   absolute 

liability   in   cases   of   hazardous   or   inherently 

dangerous   activities   or   the   rule   as   laid   down   in 

Rylands   v.   Fletcher   as   is   developed   in   England 

recognises certain limitations and exceptions. We in 

India must hold back our hands and not venture to 

evolve   a   new   principle   of   liability   since   English 

courts   have   not   done   so.   We   have   to   develop   our 

own   law   and   if   we   find   that   it   is   necessary   to 

construct a new principle of liability to deal with an 

unusual   situation   which   has   arisen   and   which   is 

likely to arise in future on account of hazardous or 

inherently   dangerous   industries   which   are 

concomitant   to   an   industrial   economy,   there   is   no 

reason   why   we   should   hesitate   to   evolve   such 

principle of liability merely because it has not been 

so done in England.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "The   polluter   pays   principle   demands   that   the

       which   cause   the   pollution,   or   produce   the   goods 

       which   cause   the   pollution.   Under   the   principle   it   is 

       not the role of government to meet the costs involved 

       in   either   prevention   of   such   damage,   or   in   carrying 

       out remedial action, because the effect of this would 

       be   to   shift   the   financial   burden   of   the   pollution 

       incident to the taxpayer. The 'polluter pays' principle 

       was promoted by the Organisation for Economic Co-

       operation   and   Development   [OECD]   during   the 

       1970s   when   there   was   great   public   interest   in 

       environmental   issues.   During   this   time   there   were 

       demands   on   government   and   other   institutions   to 

       introduce   policies   and   mechanisms   for   the

       the   threats   posed   by   pollution   in   a   modern 

       industrialised   society.   Since   then   there   has   been 

       considerable discussion of the nature of the polluter 

       pays principle, but the precise scope of the principle

      Bichhri   village.   The   R.S.P.C.B.   is   directed   to 

      seal all the factories/ units/plants of the said 

      respondents forthwith. So far as the Sulphuric 

      Acid Plant is concerned, it will be closed at the 

      end   of   one   week   from   today,   within   which 

      period   Respondent   No.   4   shall   wind   down   its 

      operations so as to avoid risk of any untoward 

      consequences, as asserted by Respondent No. 

      4 in Writ Petition (C) No. 76 of 1994. It is the 

      responsibility   of   Respondent   No.   4   to   take 

      necessary steps in this behalf. The R.S.P.C.B.

<p id="p_76">      shall seal this unit too at the end of one week 

      from   today.   The   re-opening   of   these   plants 

      shall   depend   upon   their   compliance   with   the 

      directions   made  and  obtaining  of  all  requisite

       permissions   and   consents   from   the   relevant 

       authorities. Respondents  4 to  8  can apply for 

       directions   in   this   behalf   after   such

<p id="p_77">3.     So   far   as   the   claim   for   damages   for   the   loss 

       suffered by the villagers in the affected area is 

       concerned,   it   is   open   to   them   or   any 

       organisation   on   their   behalf   to   institute   suits 

       in   the   appropriate   civil   court.   If   they   file   the 

       suit   or   suits   in   forma   pauperis,   the   State   of 

       Rajasthan   shall   not   oppose   their   applications 

       for leave to sue in forma pauperis.

<p id="p_78">4.     The   Central   Government   shall   consider 

       whether   it   would   not   be   appropriate,   in   the 

       light   of   the   experience   gained,   that   chemical 

       industries   are   treated   as   a   category   apart. 
</p>
<p id="p_79">       Since   the   chemical   industries   are   the   main 

       culprits   in   the   matter   of   polluting   the 

       environment,   there   is   every   need   for 

       scrutinising           their            establishment             and 

       functioning   more   rigorously.   No   distinction 

       should   be   made   in   this   behalf   as   between   a 

       large-scale   industry   and   a   small-scale 

       industry   or   for   that   matter   between   a   large-

</p>
<p id="p_81">       All  chemical  industries,   whether  big  or  small, 

       should be allowed to be established only after 

       taking         into         considerations            all         the 

       environmental   aspects   and   their   functioning 

       should   be   monitored   closely   to   ensure   that 

       they   do   not   pollute   the   environment   around 

       them. It appears that most of these industries 

       are   water-intensive   industries.   If   so,   the 

       advisability   of   allowing   the   establishment   of 

       these industries in arid areas may also require 

       examination.   Even   the   existing   chemical 

       industries   may   be   subjected   to   such   a   study

<p id="p_84">6.    The         suggestion           for         establishment         of 

      environment   courts   is   a   commendable   one. 
</p>
<p id="p_85">      The   experience   shows   that   the   prosecutions 

      launched   in   ordinary   criminal   courts   under 

      the   provisions   of   the   <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water   Act</a>,   <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_20">Air   Act</a>   and 

      <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_21">Environment Act</a> never reach their conclusion 

      either   because   of   the   work-load   in   those 

      courts   or   because   there   is   no   proper 

      appreciation   of   the   significance   of   the 

      environment   matters   on   the   part   of   those   in 

      charge of conducting of those cases. Moreover, 

      any   orders   passed   by   the   authorities   under 

      Water   and   <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_22">Air   Act</a>s   and   the   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_23">Environment   Act</a> 

      are   immediately   questioned   by   the   industries 

      in   courts.   Those   proceedings   take   years   and 

      years to reach conclusion. Very often, interim 

      orders are granted meanwhile which effectively 

      disable   the   authorities   from   ensuring   the 

      implementation of their orders. All this points 

      to   the   need   for   creating   environment   courts 

      which alone should be empowered to deal with 

      all   matters,   civil   and   criminal,   relating   to 

      environment. These courts should be manned 

      by legally trained persons/judicial officers and 

      should   be   allowed   to   adopt   summary 

      procedures.   This   issue,   no   doubt,   requires   to 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                            32</span>


              be   studied   and   examined   indepth   from   all 

              angles before taking any action.
</p>
<p id="p_86">       7.     The   Central   Government   may   also   consider 

              the      advisability          of      strengthening         the 

              environment protection machinery both at the 

              Center and the States and provide them more 

              teeth. The heads of several units and agencies 

              should   be   made   personally   accountable   for 

              any   lapses   and/or   negligence   on   the   part   of 

              their   units   and   agencies.   The   idea   of   an 

              environmental   audit   by   specialist   bodies 

              created   on   a   permanent   basis   with   power   to 

              inspect,   check   and   take   necessary   action   not 

              only against erring industries but also against 

              erring officers may be considered. The idea of 

              an environmental audit conducted periodically 

              and   certified   annually,   by   specialists   in   the 

              field, duly recognised, can also be considered.

<p id="p_87">              The   ultimate   idea   is   to   integrate   and   balance 

              the concern for environment with the need for 

              industrialisation and technological progress."
</p>
<p id="p_88">25.    The orders of this Court have not been implemented till 



date because by filing of number of interlocutory applications 



the respondent nos.4 to 8 have kept the litigation alive.  These

the judgment of this Court for more than fifteen years.

</p><p id="p_90">26.    The   original   record   of   Writ   Petition   No.   967   of   1989 



shows   that   the   R.S.P.C.B.   has   filed   a   report   of   the   National 



Environmental   Engineering   Research   Institute,   for   short 



`NEERI'   in   this   Court   on   6.1.1996.     It   is   on   this   report   that 



reliance was placed by the Court while disposing off the said 



writ petition.  If the report which was submitted in this Court 



by   the   R.S.P.C.B.   was   different   from   the   final   report   which 



was submitted by NEERI to the said Board, then it may have 



been   possible   to   contend   that   the   R.S.P.C.B.   and   its   officers 



were   guilty   of   fabrication.     The   affidavit   of   Mr.   S.N.   Kaul, 



Acting Director of NEERI clearly shows that what was filed in 



this   Court   was   the   copy   of   the   final   report   dated   16.5.1994 



which has been prepared by the NEERI.   In other words, the 



NEERI   itself   states   that   the   report   filed   in   this   Court   by   the 



Board   was   a   copy   of   the   final   report   and   that   there   was   no 



fabrication made therein by the Board or any of its officials.
</p>
<p id="p_91">27.    It   appears   that   the   two   scientists   had   inspected   the 



report in the office of the NEERI and then observed that there 



has   been   a   fabrication   carried   out   by   the   Pollution   Control 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                      34</span>


Board.  From what has been stated hereinabove, the charge of 



fabrication is clearly unfounded.   It is possible that these two 



scientists may have seen the draft report which would be with 



NEERI   but   the   original   report   when   prepared   would   be   one 



which   was,   ultimately,   submitted   to   the   sponsoring   agency, 



namely,   the   R.S.P.C.B.,   and   it   is   only   a   copy   of   the   same 



which could have been retained by NEERI. Be that as it may, 



it is clear that what has been filed in this Court as being the 



final   report   of   the   NEERI   was   the   copy   of   the   final   report 



which   was   received   by   it.     There   is   no   basis   for   contending 



that   any   of   the   respondents   have   been   guilty   of   fabrication.

M/s  Hindustan   Agro   Chemical Ltd.  (for  short  "HACL")  whose 



industrial units situated in Udaipur were directed to be closed 



down   by   this   Court   on   the   premise   that   the   said   units   had 



caused pollution in village Bichhri.  This Court while directing

for closure of the industrial units of HACL vide its order dated 



13.2.1996 had further held that the units be not permitted to 



run until they deposit the remediation costs for restoring the 



environment   in  the   area.     The   Court   accordingly   directed   for 



the attachment of the properties of HACL.

<p id="p_95">29.    There is a serious attempt to reopen the entire concluded 



case   which   stands   fully   concluded   by   the   judgment   of   this 



Court  delivered on 13th  February,  1996.     It may be  pertinent 



to   mention   that   even   the   review   and   curative   petitions   have 



also   been   dismissed.     By   this   application,   the   applicant   has 



also   made   an   attempt   to   introduce   before   this   Court   the 



opinion   of  various   experts,   such   as,   Dr.   M.S.  Govil,   Mr.   S.K. 
</p>
<p id="p_96">Gupta,   Dr.   P.S.   Bhatt   and   Ms.   Smita   Jain   who   visited   the 



Bichhri   village   at   the   instance   of   the   applicant   in   the   year 



2004 to provide a different picture regarding the conditions of 



water and soil in the area.  These experts submitted reports to 



demonstrate   that   now   hardly   any   remediation   measures   are 



required in Bichhri village or adjoining areas.

<p id="p_97">30.    The applicant in this application is seeking a declaration 



that as of now there is no pollution existing in the area which 



may   have   been  caused   by   HACL   and   accordingly   there   is   no 



necessity for this Court to sell the assets of HACL in order to 



carry out any remediation in the area.  This application also is 



a serious attempt to discredit the NEERI report of 1996 once 



again. 
</p>
<p id="p_98">31.    The   sole   object   of   filing   of   the   present   application   is   to 



introduce before this Court recent reports prepared by experts 



at the behest of the applicant to demonstrate to the Court that 



before embarking upon remediation measures and for the said 



purposes   putting   the   properties   of   the   applicant   to   sell,   the 



status   and   conditions   of   water,   soil   and   environment   in   the 



area   as   at   present   be   reviewed   with   a   view   to   realistically 



ascertain whether any measures for remediation are called for 



at all in the area and if yes, then the nature and the current 



cost of the same may be ascertained.
</p>
<p id="p_99">32.    The   applicant   submitted   that   the   report   of   the   NEERI 



which  was  the   basis   for   the  earlier   orders  of this  Court  does 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                      37</span>


not   specify   the   nature   of   remediation   measures   which   were 



considered   necessary.     The   report   merely   indicates   a   lump 



sum   amount   without   giving   its   break   up   as   being   a   rough 



estimate of amount considered by them necessary for carrying 



out remediation measures. 
</p>
<p id="p_100">33.    It   is  stated  in  the   application  that  the  Secretary,   MOEF 



after   issuing   notices   to   the   parties   called   for   the   expert 



opinion   of   Water   and   Power   Consultancy   (WAPCO)   and   of 



Engineers   India   Limited   (EIL),   both   these   institutions   were 



established   by   the   Government   of   India.   Both   these 



institutions wrote to the Secretary that the data available was 



not sufficient to determine the cost of remediation, if any.  The 



Secretary, who under the directions of the Court was directed 



to   determine   the   amount   within   six   weeks   was   left   with   no 



alternative   but   to   simply   affirm   the   lump   sum   amount 



determined by the NEERI.
</p>
<p id="p_101">34.    It   is   stated   that   now   almost   fifteen   years   have   passed 



since the final judgment of this Court and the situation in the 



area needs to be inspected again to find out as to whether any 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                      38</span>


remediation   is   necessary   or   whether   with   passage   of   time 



nature on its own has taken care of the pollution in the area 



and because of the same no further remediation is required to 



be done in the area.   This submission is being made without 



prejudice   to   the   right   of   the   applicant   to   contend   that   the 



applicant   had   not   caused   any   pollution   in   the   area   but   the 



applicant for the limited purpose of this application is ready to 



assume   for   the   sake   of   arguments   that   the   applicant   had 



caused pollution in the area and that the nature in the last so 



many years has taken care of the pollution and on that basis 



there is no pollution existing in the area at present.
</p>
<p id="p_102">35.    One of the issues that came up for consideration before 



this   Court   was   the   liability   of   the   Union   of   India   to   take 



remediation   measures   in   the   area   even   if   the   applicant   were 



not   to   pay   the   remediation   costs   as   determined   by   the 



Secretary, MOEF.  In these proceedings the counsel on behalf 



of  the applicant made a suggestion  to the Court that  a fresh 



team be sent to the units of the applicant to find out whether 



there   is   still   any   pollution   existing   in   the   area   and   also 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                        39</span>


whether any remediation as of today is required to be done or 



not.     It  was   suggested   during   the   course   of   hearing   that   the 



remediation   cost   being   sought   to   be   recovered   from   the 



applicant is not some kind of a decree in which the applicant 



is a judgment debtor but is merely a cost which the applicant 



is   being   made   liable   to   pay   on   the   "Polluter   Pays"   principle 



and   there   is   no   necessity   of   payment   if   there   is   no   pollution 



existing.   Till date there is no working out as to how the cost 



of remediation has been worked out by NEERI which had been 



affirmed by the Secretary, MOEF and which had been further 



affirmed by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_103">36.    According to the applicant, on the basis of the reports of 



some   experts   it   is   quite   evident   that   there   is   no   pollution   in 



and   around   the   factory   premises   of   the   applicant   and 



accordingly there is no need for any remediation to be done in 



the   area   and   the   factory   of   the   applicant   is   required   to   be 



handed   over   to   the   applicant   forthwith   so   that   the   applicant 



may   take   proper   steps   to   re-start   the   factory   and   generate 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                         40</span>


resources   to   meet   the   liabilities   of   the   financial   institutions 



and banks. 
</p>
<p id="p_104">37.    It   is   further   prayed   that   if   this   Court   for   any   reason 



doubts   the   opinion   of   the   experts   placed   by   the   applicant   in 



any   manner,   then   this   Court   may   appoint   any   reputed 



expert/experts   to   visit   the   area   and   to   submit   a   detailed 



report   to   this   Court   relating   to   the   pollution   existing   in   the 



area   as   of   now.     In   other   words,   the   effort   is   to   reopen   the 



concluded case and that also after the review and the curative 



petitions have been dismissed by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_105">38.    There are two main prayers in this application, the first 



prayer   is   that   no   remediation   is   required   to   be   done   in   and 



around   the   industrial   units   of   the   applicant   on   the   basis   of 



the   four   reports   placed   by   the   applicant   along   with   this 



application   or   on   the   basis   of   the   report   submitted   by   the 



expert/experts   appointed   by   this   Court;   and  secondly,  that 



the   Court   may   pass   consequential   order   directing  for   closing 



of these proceedings and thus lift the attachment order dated 



13.2.1996.

reply   affidavits   of   the   respondents   it   is   mentioned   that   on 



13.2.1996   this   Court   directed   closure   of   the   units   of   the 



applicant   for   the   reason  that   the   said   industries   had   caused 



environmental   pollution   in   and   around   the   areas   where 



applicant's units are located.  This Court had further directed 



that the units of the applicant would be permitted to operate 



only   after   depositing   necessary   costs   for   taking   measures   to 



restore   the   environment   of   the   areas.     The   judgment   of   this 



Court was based upon a report dated 5.4.1994 of the NEERI 



which was filed by the R.S.P.C.B. on 6.1.1996.
</p>
<p id="p_107">40.    The   applicant   questioned   the   credibility   of   the   NEERI's 



report.   It is submitted that the remediation cost for restoring 



the   environmental   quality   of   the   area   was   only   Rs.3   crores 



whereas in the report submitted in this Court the remediation 



cost was stated to be Rs.37.385 crores.

<p id="p_108">41.    The   applicant   prayed   that   in   the   interest   of   justice   the 



report dated 25.1.2005 submitted  by the expert group to the 



MOEF   be   ignored   and   either   accept   the   reports   prepared   at 



the   instance   of   the   applicant   or   fresh   direction   be   issued   for 



constitution   of   an   independent   expert   group   not   having   any 



association with NEERI to carry out investigation with relation 



to the environment in the village Bichhri.
</p>
<p id="p_109">42.    According   to   the   applicant,   the   report   of   NEERI   relied 



upon   by   this   Court   was   not   the   authentic   report   which   was 



officially prepared.   Even the copy which was actually filed in 



this matter was without any supporting affidavit and the same 



was merely handed over to this Court at the time of hearing. 
</p>
<p id="p_110">The   applicant   made   his  own  enquiry   and   was   officially   given 



the   report   of   NEERI.     After   comparing   the   report   made 



available   to  the  applicant  from   the  one  filed  in  this matter  it 



came   to   light   that  the   report   actually  filed  in   this  Court   was 



not   bearing   any   resemblance   to   the   conclusion   and   findings 



mentioned in the actual report.  
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                         43</span>
<p id="p_111">43.    It was also submitted that there have also been attempts 



on the part of authorities to shield the role of M/s. Hindustan 



Zinc   Limited   in   causing   environment   damage   in   village 



Bichhri.   This issue needs to be addressed and the same can 



be  possible  only  if   an  organization   having credibility  and  not 



having any association with the NEERI actually carries out a 



detailed investigation.

the   R.S.P.C.B.   in   September,   1992   to   evaluate   the   extent   of 



contamination done by the applicant's plant in Bichhri village

remediation   to   the   government.     The   reports   of   April,   1994 



had alleged that the applicant's units polluted the whole area 



by   discharging   its   H-acid   on   the   land   which   would   cost 



Rs.37.385 crores to clean-up.

the applicant's  units  in the area.   In the application,  serious 



effort has been made to discredit the NEERI report.  It may be

       presented to the Court showed it as 37.385 crores.

on the same lines and graphic description of existence of the

relation to the area in question is basically the contamination 



of   water   and   the   major   factor   contributing   to   the   cause   has 



been  the   improper   disposal  of  sludge  and   liquid  wastes  from 



the  unit.    It  has  been  recommended   by  the  expert  team  that 



due   to   leachable   components   of   the   sludge   the   industry 



should prepare a double line pit containing impervious liners 



comprising   impervious   clay   and   polyethylene   sheets.     The 



sludge   should   be   placed   in   this   lined   pit   and   covered   with 



water   proof   layering   to   such   extent   that   no   water   can 



percolate through the stored sludge.  The soil in the premises 



of the industry has also been contaminated by the disposal of 



liquid   effluents   as   well   as   the   sludge   on   the   ground.     The 



contaminated   soil   needs   to   be   removed   and   the   entire   area 



should be revamped.   All industrial activities going on in the 



premises should be stopped to enable the revamping process.

       Sudden   emergence   of   H-acid   in   wells   W7(Aug.99)

<p id="p_223">96.    Mr. M.C. Mehta, Advocate has filed written submissions 



on   behalf   of   Indian   Council   for   Enviro   Legal   Action.     It   is 



reiterated   in   the   submissions   that   these   applications   are 



blatant   disregard   towards   complying   with   the   directions   of 



this court.    They have made mockery with the environmental 



justice delivery system by filing these applications.  They have 



shown no contrition for causing irreparable damage to the life, 



health and property of the people affected by their commercial 



activities.     The   applicants  are   trying   to   delay   the   payment   of 



Rs.37.385   crores   for   carrying   out   remedial   measures.     This

<blockquote id="blockquote_109">             "On   account  of   (the   respondents)   continuous, 

       persistent   and   insolent   violations   of   the   law....and 

       their   non-implementation   of   the   orders   of   this....

       (the   respondents)   have   earned   the   dubious 

       distinction   of   being   characterized   as   "rogue

       the   poor,   unsuspecting   villagers,   despoiling   their

       environment - all in pursuit of private profit."




</blockquote><p id="p_224">97.    Mr.   Mehta   also   submitted   in   his   submissions   that   the 



applicants   (respondent   Nos.   4   to   8)   are   related   to   the 



discharge   of   untreated   chemical   effluents   in   violation   of   the

caused grave harm to the environment and people in Bichhri 



and surrounding villages. 
</p>
<p id="p_225">98.    In   the   written   submissions   Mr.   Mehta   also   submitted 



that   the   reports   procured   by   the   respondent   companies   by 



hiring   consultants   do   not   hold   any   weight   due   to   lack   of 



substantial scientific investigations.   They cannot in any way 



question   the   credibility   of   nine   scientific   reports,   submitted 



following   extensive   field   visits,   survey   and   research   by

scientists   from   reputed   scientific   institutions   such   as   the 



CPCB, NEERI, SENES, RSPCB and the Centre for Science and 



Environment and other reports, respectively submitted by the 



district   collector   and   the   Court   Commissioner   appointed   by 



this court.  
</p>
<p id="p_226">99.    Mr.   Mehta   also   mentioned   in   his   written   submissions 



that the veracity of the contents of the NEERI report has been 



affirmed   in   at   least   four   subsequent   reports   from   reputed 



scientific   organizations,  MOEF, State  of Rajasthan as well   as 



the district collector. 
</p>
<p id="p_227">100. Mr.   Mehta   has   also   submitted   that   assuming,   though 



not conceding, that there is currently no pollution in Bichhri 



village, this cannot absolve the applicants-industries from the 



obligation   to   pay   monies   necessary   for   eco-restoration   and 



damages caused to the life and health of the people as well as 



their   property   in   the   past.   The   polluters/respondents 



recklessly   destroyed   the   environment,   surface   and 



underground water and the soil and killed fruit trees, animals 



and   vegetation   apart   from   causing   suffering   and   irreparable

innocent   people   living   in   Bichhri   and   surrounding   villages 



cannot be condoned at any cost. 
</p>
<p id="p_229">101. Mr.   Mehta   submitted   that   even   if   it   was   possible   to 



accept that all H-acid traces have been removed, the presence 



of   other   contaminants   in   the   affected   area   (including   highly 



toxic   wastes   emanating   from   the   Sulphuric   Acid   Plant   and 



other plants) would necessitate remediation.  The amount can 



be deposited in a Fund and utilized for remediation, providing 



potable   water,   tree   plantation,   and   such   other   measures 



which  would be  helpful   to the  environment  of the area apart 



from paying damages to the people.  
</p>
<p id="p_230">102. Mr.   Mehta   has   further   submitted   that   this   court   may 



impose   upon   the   errant   industries   as   exemplary   punitive

damages   apart   from   the   amount   required   for   eco-restoration 



by way of remediation of the land, water and the environment. 
</p>
<p id="p_231">This   may   be   considered  in   the   light   of  the   continuing   public 



nuisance   and   suffering   due   to   pollution,   severely   degraded 



environment,   loss  to   the   property,   irreparable   damage   to   the 



ecology   and   precious   natural   resources   -   land,   air,   aquifers, 



surface   water,   flora   and   fauna   -   for   over   twenty   years   since 



the   original   petition   was   filed.     The   implications   of   failing   to 



remediate the affected land, water and environment over such 



an extensive period of time are far more severe than had the 



applicants-industries immediately complied with the orders of 



this court. 
</p>
<p id="p_232">103. Mr.   Mehta   also   placed   reliance   on   a   judgment   of   this 



court in the case of <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_90">M.C. Mehta v.   Kamal Nath and others</a>  



(2000) 6 SCC 213, in which the court observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">             "...pollution   is   a   civil   wrong.     By   its   very 

      nature,   it   is   a   tort   committed   against   the 

      community as a whole.  A person, therefore, who is 

      guilty   of   causing   pollution,   has   to   pay   damages 

      (compensation)   for   restoration   of   the   environment 

      and ecology.   He has also to pay damages to those 

      who have suffered loss on account of the act of the 

      offender.  The powers of this court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_91">Article 32</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                       93</span>


      are   not   restricted   and   it   can   award   damages   in   a 

      PIL or a Writ Petition as has been held in a series of 

      decisions.     In   addition   to   damages   aforesaid,   the 

      person guilty of causing pollution can also be held 

      liable to pay exemplary damages so that it may act 

      as   a   deterrent   for   others   not   to   cause   pollution   in 

      any manner."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_111">
</blockquote><p id="p_233">104. Mr.   Mehta   submitted   that   having   regard   to   the 



respondent's   conduct   in   the   present   case,   it   would   be 



reasonable   to   impose   an   additional   pecuniary   penalty   on 



them.     Reliance   is   placed   on  Minister   for   the   environment  


and   Heritage   v.     Greentree   (No.3)   [2004]   FCA   1317, 


wherein   the   Federal   Court   imposed   a   pecuniary   penalty 



against the respondents totaling $450,000 for having illegally 



cleared     declared   a   Ramsar   wetland.     A   strong   factor 



contributing   to   the   imposition   of   a   substantial   penalty   was 



because   the   actions   of   the   respondent   were   deliberate, 



sustained   and   serious,   they   took   place   over   a   substantial 



period   of   time   and   the   respondents   did   not   exhibit   any 



contrition.  
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                       94</span>
<p id="p_234">105. Mr.   Mehta   also   submitted   that   the   present   case   would 



warrant a severe penalty because the respondents carried out 



their   activities   without   even   possessing   any   appropriate 



licenses.     Respondents   must   be   required   to   pay   exemplary 



damages   so   as   to   act   as   a   deterrent   for   others,   as   also   to 



remedy   the   harm   they   have   caused   to   the   environment   and 



the villagers of Bichhri. 
</p>
<p id="p_235">106. Mr. Mehta has also placed reliance on the famous "Love 



Canal Case"  United States v.   Hooker Chems and Plastics  


Corp.,  722   F.   Supp   960   (W.D.N.Y.   1989).    This   case   was 


initiated   after   it   was   discovered   that   a   school,   homes   and 



rental   units   were   built   over   approximately   21,000   tonnes   of 



chemical waste at Niagara Falls, New York.  The Federal Court 



of New York allowed a claim against the defendants based on 



public   nuisance.     This   case   was   ultimately   settled   with   the 



defendant   agreeing   to   pay   $129   million   to   the   Environment 



Protection Authority.   This case led to the development of the 



Comprehensive   Response   Compensation   and   Environmental  



Liability   Act,   1980,  more   commonly   referred   to   as   the 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                       95</span>


"Superfund", into which polluters contribute monies to enable 



clean-up of toxic sites. 
</p>
<p id="p_236">107. In   the   written   submissions   filed   by   Mr.   Mehta   he   has 



also mentioned about principle of accountability and it is the 



duty   and   obligation   of   the   court   to   protect   the   fundamental 



rights   of   the   citizens   under   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_92">Article   32</a>   of   the   Indian 



constitution.     Pollution   and   public   nuisance   resulting   from 



mis-regulation infringes on the fundamental rights, including 



the   right   to   life   under   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_93">Article   21</a>   of   the   Indian   constitution. 
</p>
<p id="p_237">Mr.   Mehta   also   submitted   that   applicants   are   liable   for 



causing   continuous   suffering   to   the   people   in   Bichhri   and 



surrounding villages.
</p>
<p id="p_238">108. Mr.   Mehta   also   submitted   in   his   written   submissions 



that   in   several   cases   of   environmental   pollution   the   courts 



have   ordered   the   payment   of   damages   by   the   errant 



industries/individuals   responsible   for   causing   pollution   in 



violation   of   environmental   related   issues   and   the   money 



recovered   be   spent   for   remediation   or   eco-restoration   and 



damages be paid to the victims or spent for their benefit.       It 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                                     96</span>


is the duty of the government to ensure proper administration 



of   this   fund   in   a  transparent   and   accountable   manner.     The 



establishment of such a fund would ensure that polluters take 



responsibility   for   their   actions   and   that   monies   derived   from 



penalties,   damages   and   settlement   are   directly   invested 



towards   remediating   the   environmental   damage   that   has 



occurred. 
</p>
<p id="p_239">109. Mr.   Mehta   further   mentioned   in   his   submissions   that 



creation   of   such   a   fund   would   be   consistent   with   the 



precautionary principle which has been evolved and accepted 



by this court.   He has also mentioned that similar funds have 



been   set-up   in   United   States   of   America,   Canada,   Australia, 



Malaysia and other countries.  
</p>
<p id="p_240">110. Mr.   Mehta   also   made   a   reference   regarding  <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_94">Public  


Liability Insurance Act</a>, 1991 which makes it mandatory for 


industries handling hazardous material to be insured against 



environmental   hazards.            However,   this   legislation   only 



provides   relief   to   persons   affected   by   accidents   whilst 



handling   hazardous   materials,   who   are   most   likely   to   be 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                      97</span>


workers.     Members   of  the   local   community   would   not   obtain 



relief   under   this   legislation,   though   they   are   also   adversely 



affected   by   hazardous   industries.     This   is   most   pertinently 



exemplified in the present case. 
</p>
<p id="p_241">111. In   his   written   submissions   Mr.   Mehta   also   submitted 



that the applicants clearly show defiance of the environmental 



laws   and   the   orders   of   this   court.       Mr.   Mehta   prayed   for 



dismissal of Interlocutory Application Nos. 36 of 2004 and 44 



of   2007   with   heavy   costs   and   direct   the   respondents   to 



deposit Rs.37.385 crores with the MOEF as per the judgment 



of this court. 
</p>
<p id="p_242">112. This case raises many substantial questions of law.   We 



would briefly deal with some of them.
</p>
<p id="p_243">113. We   would  also  like   to   discuss   the   concept   of  Finality   of 



the Judgment passed by the Apex Court.
</p>
<p id="p_244">FINALITY OF JUDGMENT


</p><p id="p_245">114. The   maxim   `interest   Republicae   ut   sit   finis   litium'   says 



that it is for the public good that there be an end of litigation 



after   a   long   hierarchy   of   appeals.     At   some   stage,   it   is 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                        98</span>


necessary   to   put   a   quietus.     It   is   rare   that  in   an   adversarial 



system,   despite   the   judges   of   the   highest   court   doing   their 



best,   one   or   more   parties   may   remain   unsatisfied   with   the 



most   correct   decision.     Opening   door   for   a   further   appeal 



could be opening a flood gate which will cause more wrongs in 



the society at large at the cost of rights. 
</p>
<p id="p_246">115. It   should   be   presumed   that   every   proceeding   has   gone 



through   infiltration   several   times   before   the   decision   of   the 



Apex Court.   In the instant case, even after final judgment of 



this court, the review petition was also dismissed.  Thereafter, 



even   the   curative   petition   has   also   been   dismissed   in   this 



case.     The   controversy   between   the   parties  must   come   to   an 



end   at   some   stage   and   the   judgment   of   this   court   must   be 



permitted   to   acquire   finality.     It   would   hardly   be   proper   to 



permit   the   parties   to   file   application   after   application 



endlessly.  In a country governed by the rule of law, finality of 



the   judgment   is   absolutely   imperative   and   great   sanctity   is 



attached   to   the   finality   of   the   judgment.       Permitting   the 



parties   to   reopen   the   concluded   judgments   of   this   court   by

filing repeated interlocutory applications is clearly an abuse of 



the   process   of   law   and   would   have   far   reaching   adverse 



impact on the administration of justice.

case a Bench of seven learned Judges of this Court 

considered,   inter   alia,   the   question:   whether   a 

judgment of the Supreme Court in Northern India  

Caterers case (1967) 3 SCR 399 was required to be 

overruled.   Khanna,   J.   observed:   (SCC   p. 425,   para 

</p><p id="p_266">22)

             "At   the   same   time,   it   has   to   be 

       borne   in   mind   that          certainty   and 

       continuity   are   essential   ingredients   of 

       rule   of   law.   Certainty   in   law   would   be 

       considerably eroded and suffer a serious 

       setback   if   the   highest   court   of   the   land 

       readily overrules the view expressed by it 

       in   earlier   cases,   even   though   that   view 

       has held the field for a number of years. 
</p>
<p id="p_267">       In   quite   a   number   of   cases   which   come 

       up   before   this   Court,   two   views   are 

       possible,   and   simply   because   the   Court 

       considers that the view not taken by the 

       Court   in   the   earlier   case   was   a   better 

       view   of   the   matter   would   not   justify   the 

       overruling of the view. The law laid down 

       by   this   Court   is   binding   upon   all   courts 

       in   the   country   under   <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_127">Article   141</a>   of   the

       over   the   country   are   decided   in 

       accordance   with   the   view   taken   by   this 

       Court.  Many  people   arrange   their   affairs 

       and   large   number   of   transactions   also 

       take place on the faith of the correctness 

       of the view taken by this Court. It would 

       create   uncertainty,   instability   and

      cases   have   been   decided   and   many

      be not the correct law."
</p>
<p id="p_268">42.  The concern of this Court for rendering justice 

in a cause is not less important than the principle 

of   finality   of   its   judgment.   "We   are   faced   with 

competing   principles   --   ensuring   certainty   and 

finality of a judgment of the Court of last resort and 

dispensing justice on reconsideration of a judgment 

on the ground that it is vitiated being in violation of 

the principles of natural justice or giving scope for 

apprehension   of   bias   due   to   a   Judge   who 

participated   in   the   decision-making   process   not 

disclosing his links with a party to the case, or on 

account of abuse of the process of the court. Such a 

judgment,   far   from   ensuring   finality,   will   always 

remain   under   the   cloud   of   uncertainty.   Almighty 

alone   is   the   dispenser   of   absolute   justice   --   a 

concept which is not disputed but by a few. We are 

of the view that though Judges of the highest court 

do their best, subject of course to the limitation  of 

human   fallibility,   yet   situations   may   arise,   in   the 

rarest   of   the   rare   cases,   which   would   require 

reconsideration   of   a   final   judgment   to   set   right 

miscarriage of justice complained of. In such case it 

would   not   only   be   proper   but   also   obligatory   both 

legally and morally to rectify the error. After giving 

our   anxious   consideration   to   the   question,   we   are 

persuaded   to   hold   that   the   duty   to   do   justice   in 

these rarest of rare cases shall have to prevail over 

the   policy   of   certainty   of   judgment   as   though   it   is 

essentially   in   the   public   interest   that   a   final 

judgment   of   the   final   court   in   the   country   should 

not   be   open   to   challenge,   yet   there   may   be 

circumstances,   as   mentioned   above,                  wherein 

declining   to   reconsider   the   judgment   would   be

      under   the   color   and   pretence   of   law   inasmuch   as

proprietary   interest   in   the   subject   matter   of   the   proceedings 



as   in   Dimes  v.  Proprietors   of   Grand   Junction   Canal , 



(1852)   3   H.L.   Cases   759.   The   courts   should   hesitate   long

immediately create uncertainty as to what are the parameters 



of that category and what is the test to be applied in the case 



of that category." Lord Goff of Chievely stated that 



     "I wish to draw attention  to the fact that there are 

     certain  cases in which it  has been  considered that 

     the   circumstances   are   such   that   they   must 

     inevitably   shake   public   confidence   in   the   integrity 

     of the administration of justice if the decision is to 

     be   allowed   to   stand.   Such   cases   attract   the   full 

     force of Lord Hewart C.J.'s requirement that justice 

     must not only be done but must manifestly be seen 

     to be done. These cases arise where a person sitting 

     in   a   judicial   capacity   has   a   pecuniary   interest   in 

     the outcome of the proceedings. In such a case, as 

     Blackburn   J.   said   in  Reg.   v.   Rand   (1866)   L.R.   1 

     Q.B.   230,   232:   "any   direct   pecuniary   interest, 

     however   small,   in   the   subject   of   inquiry,   does 

     disqualify   a   person   from   acting   as   a   judge   in   the 

     matter."   The   principle   is   expressed   in   the   maxim 

     that nobody may be judge in his own cause (nemo 

     judex in sua causa)... In such a case, therefore, not 

     only is it irrelevant that there was in fact no bias on 

     the part of the tribunal, but there is no question of 

     investigating,   from   an   objective   point   of   view, 

     whether   there   was   any   real   likelihood   of   bias,   or 

     any reasonable suspicion of bias, on the facts of the 

     particular   case.   The   nature   of   the   interest   is   such 

     that   public   confidence   in   the   administration   of 

     justice requires that the decision should not stand"

applicable to review of its judgments. It has been held that the 



Supreme   Court   can   review   its   judgments   pronounced   or 



orders   made   by   it.     The   power   of   the   appellate   courts   to   re-

<p id="p_304">151. The cases establish that the power of appellate courts to 



re-open   and   review   their   orders   is   to   be   exercised   with   great 



caution.   The   power,   and   the   occasions   for   its   exercise   were 



considered   in  In Re   Transferred   Civil   Servants   (Ireland)  


Compensation (1929)   AC   242,   248-52;   and State   Rail  


Authority NSW v Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd (1982) HCA 


51   :   (1982)   150   CLR   29,   38-9,   45-6,   where   earlier   Privy 



Council cases are referred to. The principles were summarised 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                                      121</span>


in Smith  v  NSW   Bar   Association (1992)   176   CLR   252,   265 



where the High Court of Australia said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_154">      "The power is discretionary  and, although it exists 

      up   until   the   entry   of   judgment,   it   is   one   that   is 

      exercised   having   regard   to   the   public   interest   in 

      maintaining   the   finality   of   litigation.   Thus,   if 

      reasons for judgment have been given, the power is 

      only   exercised   if   there   is   some   matter   calling   for 

      review ... these considerations may tend against the 

      re-opening   of   a   case,   but   they   are   not   matters 

      which bear on the nature or the review ... once the 

      case is re-opened ... the power to review a judgment 

      ...   where   the   order   has   not   been   entered   will   not 

      ordinarily   be   exercised   to   permit   a   general   re-

      opening   ...   But   ...   once   a   matter   has   been   re-

      opened,   the   nature   and   extent   of   the   review   must 

      depend   on   the   error   or   omission   which   has   led   to 

      that step being taken."

      attributed solely to the neglect of the party seeking 

      the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not 

      to   provide   a   backdoor   method   by   which

appeal has power in truly exceptional circumstances to recall 



its  order   even  after   they   have   been  entered  in  order   to   avoid 



irremediable injustice.

to   irresistible   conclusion   that   though   the   judgments   of   the

done   in   extremely   exceptional   circumstances   where   there   is

advantage of his own wrong.
</p>
<p id="p_328">166. Unless courts disgorge all benefits that a party availed by 



obstruction or delays or non-compliance, there will always be 



incentive   for   non   compliance,   and   parties   are   ingenious 



enough to come up with all kinds of pleas and other tactics to 



achieve   their   end   because   they   know   that   in   the   end   the 



benefit will remain with them.

<p id="p_329">167. Whatever   benefits   a   person   has   had   or   could   have   had 



by not complying with the judgment must being disgorged and 



paid to the judgment creditor and not, allowed to be retained 



by   the   judgment-debtor.     This   is   the   bounden   duty   and 



obligation of the court.
</p>
<p id="p_330">168. In   fact,   it   has   to   be   looked   from   the   position   of   the 



creditor.     Unless   the   deprivation   by   reason   of   delay   is   fully 



restituted, the creditor as a beneficiary remains a loser to the 



extent of the un-restituted amount.

</p><p id="p_332">169.   Unjust   enrichment   has   been   defined   as:   "A   benefit 



obtained from another, not intended  as a  gift and not legally 



justifiable, for which the beneficiary must make restitution or 



recompense."     See  Black's   Law   Dictionary,   Eighth   Edition 



(Bryan A. Garner) at page 1573.
</p>
<p id="p_333">170. A   claim   for   unjust   enrichment   arises   where   there   has 



been an "unjust retention of a benefit to the loss of another, or 



the   retention   of   money   or   property   of   another   against   the 



fundamental   principles   of   justice   or   equity   and   good 



conscience."  
</p>
<p id="p_334">171. `Unjust enrichment' has been defined by the court as the 



unjust   retention   of   a   benefit   to   the   loss   of   another,   or   the 



retention   of   money   or   property   of   another   against   the 



fundamental   principles   of   justice   or   equity   and   good 



conscience. A person is enriched if he has received a benefit, 



and he is unjustly enriched if retention of the benefit would be 



unjust.   Unjust   enrichment   of   a   person   occurs   when   he   has

the   loss   of   another,   or   the   retention   of   money   or   property   of 



another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity 



and good conscience." A defendant may be liable "even when 



the   defendant   retaining   the   benefit   is   not   a   wrongdoer"   and 



"even   though   he   may   have   received   [it]   honestly   in   the   first 



instance." (Schock v. Nash, 732 A.2d 217, 232-33 (Delaware.

         that   is,   to   prevent   a   man   from   retaining   the 

         money of, or some benefit derived from another

         of their combined  effect. Nor is it necessary 

         to   canvass   the   niceties   of   the   old   forms   of 

         action.   Remedies   now   depend   on   the 

         substance of the right, not on whether they 

         can   be   fitted   into   a   particular   frame-work. 

         The   right   here   is   not   peculiar   to   equity   or 

         contract   or   tort,   but   falls   naturally   within 

         the   important   category   of   cases   where   the

</blockquote><p id="p_344">179.          Unjust   enrichment   is   basic   to   the   subject   of 



restitution,   and   is   indeed   approached   as   a   fundamental 



principle   thereof.   They   are   usually   linked   together,   and 



restitution   is   frequently   based   upon   the   theory   of   unjust 



enrichment.   However, although unjust enrichment is often 



referred   to   or   regarded   as   a   ground   for   restitution,   it   is 



perhaps   more   accurate   to   regard   it   as   a   prerequisite,   for 



usually   there   can   be   no   restitution   without   unjust 



enrichment. It is defined as the unjust retention of a benefit 



to the loss of another or the retention of money or property 



of   another   against   the   fundamental   principles   of   justice   or 



equity   and good  conscience.  A  person  is  enriched   if  he  has 



received a benefit, and he is unjustly enriched if retention of 



the benefit would be unjust.  Unjust enrichment of a person 



occurs when he has and retains money or benefits which in 



justice and equity belong to another.

</blockquote><p id="p_347">182.     The terms `unjust enrichment' and `restitution' are like 



the two shades of green - one leaning towards yellow and the 



other   towards   blue.     With   restitution,   so   long   as   the 



deprivation   of   the   other   has   not   been   fully   compensated   for, 



injustice   to   that   extent   remains.     Which   label   is   appropriate 



under which circumstances would depend on the facts of the 



particular case before the court.  The courts have wide powers 



to grant restitution, and more so where it relates to misuse or 



non-compliance with court orders.
</p>
<p id="p_348">183.     We   may   add   that   restitution   and   unjust   enrichment, 



along with an overlap, have to be viewed with reference to the

two stages, i.e., pre-suit and post-suit.   In the former case, it 



becomes   a   substantive   law   (or   common   law)   right   that   the 



court will consider; but in the latter case, when the parties are 



before   the   court   and   any  act/omission,   or  simply   passage   of 



time,   results   in   deprivation   of   one,   or   unjust   enrichment   of 



the   other,   the   jurisdiction   of   the   court   to   levelise   and   do 



justice is independent and must be readily wielded, otherwise 



it   will   be   allowing   the   Court's   own   process,   along   with   time 



delay, to do injustice.
</p>
<p id="p_349">184 .        For   this   second   stage   (post-suit),   the   need   for 



restitution   in   relation   to   court   proceedings,   gives   full 



jurisdiction   to   the   court,   to   pass   appropriate   orders   that 



levelise.  Only the court has to levelise and not go further into 



the   realm   of   penalty   which   will   be   a   separate   area   for 



consideration altogether.

what  the  ledger  account  in  the  nationalised   bank  on  a  clean 



load   would   have   shown  as   a   debit   balance   today   is   not   paid 



and   something   less   than   that   is   paid,   that   differential   or 



shortfall   is   what   there   has   been   :   (1)   failure   to   restitute;   (2) 



unfair   gain   by   the   non-complier;   and   (3)   provided   the

<p id="p_356">190. Unless this differential is paid, justice has not been done 



to   the   creditor.   It   only   encourages   non-compliance   and 



litigation. Even if no benefit had been retained or availed even

words,   it   is   this   is   not   only   disgorging   all   the   benefits   but 



making the creditor whole i.e. ordering restitution in full and 



not   dependent   on   what   he   might   have   made   or   benefitted   is 



what justice requires.

of   the   wording   of   Section   34   of   the   Code   of   Civil   Procedure 



which still proceeds on the basis of simple interest.  In fact, it 



is   this   difference   which   prompts   much   of   our   commercial

<p id="p_359">that to cause litigation and then to contest with obstructions

inherent powers in the court and the principles of justice and 



equity   are   each   sufficient   to   enable   an   order   directing

there can never be restitution.

       cases   where   Court   finds   that   using   the   Courts 

       as   a   tool,   a   litigant   has   perpetuated   illegalities 

       or   has   perpetuated   an   illegal   possession,   the 

       Court   must   impose   costs   on   such   litigants 

       which should be equal to the benefits derived by 

       the   litigant   and   harm   and   deprivation   suffered 

       by   the   rightful   person   so   as   to   check   the 

       frivolous   litigation   and   prevent   the   people   from 

       reaping a rich harvest of illegal acts through the 

       Court. One of  the aims of  every  judicial system 

       has   to   be   to   discourage   unjust   enrichment 

       using   Courts   as   a   tool.     The   costs   imposed   by 

       the Courts must in all cases should be the real

we   consider   it   necessary   to   observe   that   one   of   the   main 



reasons   for   over-flowing   of   court   dockets   is   the   frivolous 



litigation   in   which   the   Courts   are   engaged   by   the   litigants 



and   which   is   dragged   as   long   as   possible.     Even   if   these 



litigants ultimately loose the lis, they become the real victors 



and   have   the   last   laugh.     This   class   of   people   who 



perpetuate   illegal   acts   by   obtaining   stays   and   injunctions 



from the Courts must be made to pay the sufferer not only 



the entire illegal gains made by them as costs to the person 



deprived   of   his   right   and   also   must   be   burdened   with 



exemplary   costs.     Faith   of   people   in   judiciary   can   only   be 



sustained if the persons on the right side of the law do not 



feel   that   even   if   they   keep   fighting   for   justice   in   the   Court 



and   ultimately   win,   they   would   turn   out   to   be   a   fool   since 



winning a case after 20 or 30 years would make wrongdoer 



as   real   gainer,   who   had   reaped   the   benefits   for   all   those 



years.   Thus, it becomes the duty of the Courts to see that 



such   wrongdoers   are   discouraged  at   every  step   and   even   if 



they succeed in prolonging the litigation due to their money

obvious   wrong   doers,   use  one   after   another    tier   of  judicial

is always loaded in their favour, since even if they lose, the

      compound interest was available in respect of all 

      restitutionary   claims.     By   a   majority   it   was 

      decided   that,   since   the   jurisdiction   to   award

      interest   could   only   be   awarded   in   respect   of

      where the claim was for money had and received

      because   this   was   a   common   law   claim.     The 

      majority supported their conclusion by reference 

      to   a   number   of   different   arguments.           In 

      particular,   they   asserted   that,   since   Parliament 

      had decided in 1981 that simple interest should 

      be awarded on claims at common law, it was not 

      for   the   House   of   Lords   to   award   compound 

      interest   in   respect   of   such   claims.   <a href="/doc/106678696/" id="a_147">But   the

</blockquote><p id="p_381">In   two   very   strong   dissenting   judgments,   Lords 

Goff   and   Woolf   rejected  the   argument   of   the 

majority.   They asserted that, since the policy of 

the law of restitution was to remove benefits from 

the   defendant,   compound   interest   should   be 

available   in   respect   of   all   restitutionary   claims, 

regardless   of   whether   they   arise   at   law   or   in 

equity.   This argument can be illustrated by the 

following   example.     In   the   straightforward   case 

where the claimant pays money to the defendant 

by mistake and defendant is liable to repay that 

money,   the   liability   arises   from   the   moment   the 

money is received by the defendant, who has the 

use of it and so should pay the claimant for the 

value   of   that   benefit.     This   was   accepted   by   all 

the   judges   in   the   case.     The   difficulty   relates   to 

the   valuation   of   this   benefit.     If   the   defendant 

was   to   borrow   an   equivalent   amount   of   money 

from   a   financial   institution,   he   or   she   would   be 

liable   to   pay   compound   interest   to   that 

institution.   It   follows   that   the   defendant   has 

saved   that   amount   of   money   and   so   this   is   the 

value  of  the  benefit   which  the   defendant   should 

restore   to   the   claimant,   in   addition   to   the   value 

of the money which the defendant received in the 

first   place.     If   it   could   be   shown   that,   had   the 

defendant   borrowed   the   equivalent   amount   of 

money,   the   institution   would   only   have   paid 

simple   interest,   it   would   be   appropriate   for   the 

interest   awarded   to   the   claimant   to   be   simple 

rather   than   compound.     Usually,   however,   the 

interest awarded in commercial transactions will 

be compound interest."

      means   that  the   act   of   the   court   shall   prejudice   no 

      one, becomes applicable in such  a case.  In such  a 

      fact   situation   the   court   is   under   an   obligation   to 

      undo   the   wrong   done   to   a   party   by   the   act   of   the

      gained   by   a   party   invoking   the   jurisdiction   of   the 

      court   must   be   neutralised,   as   the   institution   of

observed   that   courts   should   be   careful   and   pass   an   order 



neutralizing   the   effect   of   all   consequential   orders   passed   in 



pursuance   of   the   interim   orders   passed   by   the   court.     Such

<p id="p_391">216.    In consonance  with  the  principle  of  equity,  justice  and 



good   conscience   judges   should   ensure   that   the   legal   process 



is   not   abused   by   the   litigants   in   any   manner.     The   court 



should   never   permit   a   litigant   to   perpetuate   illegality   by 



abusing the legal process.  It is the bounden duty of the court 



to ensure that dishonesty and any attempt to abuse the legal 



process must be effectively curbed and the court must ensure 



that   there   is   no   wrongful,   unauthorized   or   unjust   gain   for 



anyone by the abuse of the process of the court.   One way to 



curb   this   tendency   is   to   impose   realistic   costs,   which   the 



respondent   or  the   defendant   has   in  fact   incurred   in   order   to 



defend himself in the legal proceedings.   The courts would be 



fully justified even imposing punitive costs where legal process 



has   been   abused.   No   one   should   be   permitted   to   use   the 



judicial   process   for   earning   undeserved   gains   or   unjust 



profits.     The   court   must   effectively   discourage   fraudulent, 



unscrupulous and dishonest litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_392">217.  The  court's   constant  endeavour  must   be  to  ensure   that 



everyone   gets   just   and   fair   treatment.     The   court   while

rendering   justice   must   adopt   a   pragmatic   approach   and   in 



appropriate cases realistic costs and compensation be ordered 



in order to discourage dishonest litigation. The object and true 



meaning   of   the   concept   of   restitution   cannot   be   achieved   or 



accomplished   unless   the   courts   adopt   a   pragmatic   approach 



in dealing with the cases.

<p id="p_393">218.   This court in a very recent case  <a href="/doc/183635/" id="a_154">Ramrameshwari Devi

677   had   an   occasion   to   deal   with   similar   questions   of   law 



regarding imposition of realistic costs and restitution.       One 



of  us  (Bhandari,   J.)  was  the   author of  the  judgment.    It   was 



observed in that case as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_200">      "While   imposing   costs   we   have   to   take   into 

      consideration   pragmatic   realities   and   be   realistic 

      what   the   defendants   or   the   respondents   had   to 

      actually   incur   in   contesting   the   litigation   before 

      different courts.   We have to also broadly take into 

      consideration   the   prevalent   fee   structure   of   the 

      lawyers   and   other   miscellaneous   expenses   which 

      have   to   be   incurred   towards   drafting   and   filing   of 

      the   counter   affidavit,   miscellaneous   charges 

      towards typing, photocopying, court fee etc.



      The   other   factor   which   should   not   be   forgotten 

      while imposing costs is for how long the defendants 

      or   respondents   were   compelled   to   contest   and

      appellants   in   the   instant   case   have   harassed   the 

      respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally 

      frivolous and dishonest litigation in various courts. 

      The appellants have also wasted judicial time of the 

      various courts for the last 40 years."





</blockquote><p id="p_394">219.  We reiterate that the finality of the judgment of the Apex 



Court   has   great   sanctity   and   unless   there   are   extremely 



compelling or exceptional circumstances, the judgments of the 



Apex   Court   should   not   be   disturbed   particularly   in   a   case 



where   review   and   curative   petitions   have   already   been 



dismissed.  
</p>
<p id="p_395">220.   This   Court   has   consistently   taken   the   view   that   the 



judgments   delivered   by   this   Court   while   exercising   its 



jurisdiction   under   <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_155">Article   136</a>   of   the   Constitution   cannot   be 



reopened   in   a   writ   petition   filed   under   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_156">Article   32</a>   of   the 



Constitution.     In   view   of   this   legal   position,   how   can   a   final 



judgment   of   this   Court   be   reopened   by   merely   filing 



interlocutory   applications   where   all   possible   legal   remedies 



have been fully exhausted?  When we revert to the facts of this 



case,   it   becomes   abundantly   clear   that   this   Court   delivered 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">                                      157</span>


final   judgment   in   this   case   way   back   in   1996.     The   said 



judgment   has   not   been   permitted   to   acquire   finality   because 



the   respondent   Nos.   4   to   8   had   filed   multiple   interlocutory 



applications   and   has   ensured   non-compliance   of   the 



judgment of this Court.

<p id="p_396">221. On consideration of pleadings and relevant judgments of 



the various courts, following irresistible conclusion emerge:

<blockquote id="blockquote_201">      i)      The   judgment   of   the   Apex   Court   has   great

              compelling,         overriding         and         exceptional 

              circumstances,   the   judgment   of   the   Apex 

              Court   should   not be   disturbed  particularly   in 

              a   case   where   review   and   curative   petitions 

              have already been dismissed



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_202">      ii)     The exception to this general rule is where in

              disclose   the   connection   with   the   subject 

              matter   or   the   parties   giving   scope   of   an 

              apprehension   of   bias   and   the   judgment 

              adversely affected the petitioner.

              circumstances   incorporated   in   the   review   or 

              curative   petition   are   such   that   they   must 

              inevitably   shake   public   confidence   in   the 

              integrity of the administration of justice if the 

              judgment or order is allowed to stand.

</blockquote><p id="p_397">222.  These   categories  are  illustrative   and  not  exhaustive   but 



only   in   such   extremely   exceptional   circumstances   the   order 



can be recalled in order to avoid irremedial injustice.
</p>
<p id="p_398">223.   The   other   aspect   which   has   been   dealt   with   in   great 



details is to neutralize any unjust enrichment and undeserved 



gain   made   by   the   litigants.     While   adjudicating,   the   courts 



must keep the following principles in view.
</p>
<p id="p_399">      1. It is the bounden duty and obligation of the court 

         to   neutralize   any   unjust   enrichment   and 

         undeserved gain made by any party by invoking 

         the jurisdiction of the court.
</p>
<p id="p_400">      2. When   a   party   applies   and   gets   a   stay   or 

         injunction from the court, it is always at the risk 

         and responsibility of the party applying. An order 

         of stay cannot be presumed to be conferment of 

         additional right upon the litigating party.
</p>
<p id="p_401">      3. Unscrupulous litigants be prevented from taking 

         undue   advantage   by   invoking   jurisdiction   of   the 

         Court.
</p>
<p id="p_402">      4. A person in wrongful possession should not only 

         be   removed  from   that  place   as  early   as  possible 

         but be compelled to pay for wrongful use of that 

         premises   fine,   penalty   and   costs.     Any   leniency 

         would   seriously   affect   the   credibility   of   the 

         judicial system.
</p>
<p id="p_403">      5. No   litigant   can   derive   benefit   from   the   mere 

         pendency of a case in a court of law.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_160">                                        159</span>
<p id="p_404">       6. A party cannot be allowed to take any benefit of 

           his own wrongs.
</p>
<p id="p_405">       7. Litigation should not be permitted to turn  into a 

           fruitful   industry   so   that   the   unscrupulous 

           litigants   are   encouraged   to   invoke   the 

           jurisdiction of the court.
</p>
<p id="p_406">       8. The   institution   of   litigation   cannot   be   permitted 

           to   confer   any   advantage   on   a   party   by   delayed 

           action of courts.
</p>
<p id="p_407">224. It may be pertinent to mention that even after dismissal 



of   review   petition   and   of   the   curative   petition   on   18.7.2002, 



the applicants  (respondent  Nos. 4 to 8) have been  repeatedly 



filing   one   petition   or  the   other   in   order   to   keep   the   litigation 



alive.     It   is   indeed   astonishing   that   the   orders   of   this   court 



have   not   been   implemented   till   date.     The   applicants   have 



made all possible efforts to avoid compliance of the judgment 



of this Court.   This is a clear case of abuse of process of the 



court.

<p id="p_408">225. The Court in its order dated 04.11.1997 while accepting 



the   report   of   the   MOEF   directed   the   applicant   -   M/s

crores   towards   the   costs   of   remediation.     The   amount   which 



ought   to   have   been   deposited   way   back   in   1997   has   yet   not 



been deposited by keeping the litigation alive.

<p id="p_409">226.   We   have   carefully   considered   the   facts   and 



circumstances of this case.   We have also considered the law

applicant-industry   must   deposit   the   amount   as   directed   by 



this   Court   vide   order   dated   4.11.1997   with   compound 



interest. The applicant-industry has deliberately not complied 



with  the  orders of  this court since  4.11.1997.   Thousands of 



villagers   have   been   adversely   affected   because   no   effective

</p>
<p id="p_413">228.   The   applicant-industry   is   also   directed   to   pay   costs   of 



litigation.     Even   after   final   judgment   of   this   Court,   the 



litigation   has   been   kept   alive   for   almost   15   years.     The 



respondents have been compelled to defend this litigation for 



all   these   years.     Enormous   court's   time   has   been  wasted   for 



all these years. 
</p>
<p id="p_414">229.   On   consideration   of   the   totality   of   the   facts   and 



circumstances of this case, we direct the applicant-industry to 



pay   costs   of   Rs.10   lakhs   in   both   the   Interlocutory 



Applications.     The amount of costs would also be utilized for 



carrying   out   remedial   measure   in           village   Bichhri   and 



surrounding   areas   in   Udaipur   District   of   Rajasthan   on   the
