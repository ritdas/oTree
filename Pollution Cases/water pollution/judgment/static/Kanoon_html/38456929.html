<p id="p_6">2. The above-stated statement of law applies to the facts of the present

   case as under: -
</p>
<p id="p_7">   2.1)   This petition is mainly directed against the impugned order of

   the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board, Raipur (as well as

   the consequential order of the Municipal Corporation, Raipur), by

   which the slaughter house run by the Municipal Corporation has been

   directed to be closed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">   2.2)   The Municipal Corporation, Raipur has established slaughter

   house in the year 1962 under the provisions contained in Sections

   257 and 258 of the Chhattisgarh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 at

   Sanjay Nagar, Tikrapara, Raipur.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3. Mr. Kishore Bhaduri, learned counsel for the petitioner, would submit

   that the Municipal Corporation, Raipur, had established a slaughter

   house in the year 1962 and established a place for slaughter of

   animals for sale and accordingly, distributed license to meat sellers

   for sale of meat and others and since then, it is being used regularly,

   but suddenly in May, 2016, the Municipal Corporation has shut down

   the slaughter house without notice to any member or the petitioner

   Association and without showing any cause contending that in

   absence of permission from the Pollution Control Board, the slaughter

   house cannot be permitted to run and as such, abruptly and suddenly,

   closure of slaughter house by the respondent Board is in violation of

   their constitutional right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_2">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the
                                                       W.P.(C)No.118/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             Page 3 of 23</span>

  Constitution of India. Therefore, the impugned order passed by the

  respondent No.3 Board deserves to be quashed.

</p><p id="p_10">4. Mr. Pankaj Agrawal, learned counsel appearing for the Municipal

  Corporation, would submit that the Municipal Corporation established

  such a slaughter house in the year 1962 and no objection is required

  for continuance of slaughter house as it is duly and regularly

  maintained, and air pollution and water pollution are being controlled

  effectively. He would further submit that since it is a residential area,

  the Board has not granted any consent/permission under the relevant

  provisions under various Acts regulating water and air pollution,

  therefore, it has been closed. He would also point out that proposal

  for renewal has been rejected by order dated 21-7-2015 and

  alternative place has been selected at Village Sondongri and requisite

  land has been requisitioned from the Collector, Raipur which is under

  consideration and for establishment of plant, the expression of

  interest has already been floated and entire process of establishing

  will be completed expeditiously.
</p>
<p id="p_11">5. Mr. Arun Sao, learned Deputy Advocate General, on instructions from

  the Collector, Raipur, would submit that the land as requisitioned by

  the Municipal Corporation for establishment of setting up of slaughter

  house will be granted to the Corporation at Village Sondongri within a

  month from today by giving advance possession.

</p><p id="p_12">6. Mr. Sudhir Kumar Bajpai, learned counsel appearing for respondent

  No.3 - Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board, would submit

  that pursuant to the direction of the Supreme Court in the matter of

     Laxmi Narain Modi v. Union of India and others</a> 2, a State Level

     Monitoring Committee has been constituted for the purpose as

     assigned by the Supreme Court and the said multi-membered

     Committee on 18-9-2013 issued direction that slaughter houses which

     cannot be regularised and which are in densely populated area

     should be closed and they be shifted to some other place. He would

     also bring to the notice of the Court, the resolution dated 5-2-2016

     passed by the Committee and inspection reports dated 24-11-2012

     and 26-3-2014 by which the officers of respondent No.3 Board have

     made inspection of the slaughter house and found gross irregularities

     in regulating water and air pollution on the said slaughter house. He

     would further submit that no consent has been taken under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Sections

     24</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

     and the said slaughter house has not been licensed as required under

     Rule 3 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughter House)

     Rules, 2001. Finally, he would also submit that number of notices

     have been issued to the Municipal Corporation for running the

     slaughter house despite violating the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a> and

     the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a> and ultimately, finding no solution, the application of the

     Municipal Corporation has been rejected on 21-7-2015 and order for

     closure has been passed on 28-1-2016 and accordingly, the

     Municipal Corporation has closed the slaughter house. He would also

     submit that the Municipal Corporation has informed the Chhattisgarh

     Environment     Conservation    Board     that   at   Village   Sondongri,

2 (2014) 2 SCC 417
                                                           W.P.(C)No.118/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               Page 5 of 23</span>

   alternative slaughter house has been proposed and land has been

   requisitioned from the Collector and expression of interest has also

   been floated, as soon as the land allocation is made, slaughter house

   at the proposed land will be established and it will be made

   operational by granting necessary consent.

</p><p id="p_13">7. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered the rival

   submissions and gone through the record with utmost circumspection.

</p><p id="p_14">8. In order to consider the plea raised at the Bar, it would be appropriate

   to firstly notice Sections 257 and 258 of the Chhattisgarh Municipal

   Corporation Act, 1956 which deal with places for slaughter of animals

   for sale and disposal of dead animals, respectively.         Likewise, in

   exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/114520156/" id="a_14">Section

   38</a> of the Prevention of Cruelty to <a href="/doc/168423045/" id="a_15">Animals Act</a>, 1960, the Central

   Government has framed the rules known as the Prevention of Cruelty

   to Animals (Slaughter House) Rules, 2001. Rule 3 of the said Rules

   of 2001, which provides that animals not to be slaughtered except in

   recognised or licensed houses, states as under: -

</blockquote><p id="p_72">13. The aforesaid resolutions clearly state that if slaughterhouses are

   situated at densely populated area, they cannot be renewed, proposal

   should be obtained and new slaughterhouses be established at other

   appropriate place accordingly, and old slaughterhouses which are not

   liable to be regularised be closed. Not only this, again the committee

   met on 5-2-2016 and necessary directions in this regard have been

   issued. In the inspection reports dated 24-11-2012 and 26-3-2014, it

   has been noticed that without obtaining consent, the slaughterhouse

   at Sanjay Nagar, Tikrapara, Raipur is running in which slaughtering is

   being done manually and there is no procedure for disposal of

   polluted water and disposal of solid waste in accordance with the

   provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_25">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_26">Air Act</a>.              The application for

   renewal      has   already   been   rejected   on   21-7-2015   and   the

   slaughterhouse in question has also been directed to be closed on

   28-1-2016 on the basis of which the slaughterhouse run by the

   Municipal Corporation, of which the petitioner and its members are

   beneficiaries, has been directed to be closed.

</p><p id="p_73">14. Admittedly and undisputedly, no license has been granted at the

   present place under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughter

   House) Rules, 2001 and no consent of the Chhattisgarh Environment

   Conservation Board has been obtained by the Municipal Corporation

   under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_27">Sections 24</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_28">25</a> of the Water Act and

   <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_29">Sections 21</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_30">22</a> of the Air Act and as such, the slaughterhouse in

   question is running without permission under the Rules, 2001 as well

   as without consent under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_31">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_32">Air

   Act</a>. It is not in dispute that the said slaughterhouse was located in

   densely populated area which has been directed to be closed

   pursuant to the recommendations of the State level committee and as

   per the inspection reports dated 24-11-2012 and 26-3-2014.

   Therefore, the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board is

   justified in directing closure of slaughterhouse by the Municipal

   Corporation, Raipur, in absence of valid license and valid consent

   under the relevant rules and regulations to which the respondent -

   Municipal Corporation, Raipur has followed and complied the said

   direction.
</p>
<p id="p_74">15. Now, the question is what direction to be issued to the State and the

   Municipal Corporation for establishment of alternative slaughterhouse

   at Raipur.
</p><p id="p_75">                                                         W.P.(C)No.118/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                              Page 15 of 23</span>
</p><p id="p_76">16. At this stage, Mr. Bhaduri, learned counsel for the petitioner, would

   submit that even after closure of slaughterhouse, the Municipal

   Corporation is taking no steps to establish alternative slaughterhouse

   in place of closed slaughterhouse and therefore the petitioner and

   members of Matan Vyapari Sangh are deprived of their avocation to

   run and sell meat etc., and thereby they have been deprived of their

   right to livelihood which is a part of the constitutional right to life,

   which is violative of their fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_33">Article

   19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_77">17. At this stage, it would be appropriate to notice certain provisions

   contained in the Chhattisgarh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956.

   <a href="/doc/68540/" id="a_34">Section 5</a> (37) of the said Act defines "municipal slaughter-house". By

   <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_35">Section 66(m)</a>, it is made obligatory upon the Corporation to make

   adequate provision for construction, maintenance and regulation of

   slaughter-houses. By sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_36">Section 257</a>, the Corporation

   may and when required by the Government shall fix places for the

   slaughter of animals for sale, and may with the like approval grant

   and withdraw licenses for the use of such premises.

</p><p id="p_78">18. Thus, the Corporation has been vested with powers, wide in scope

   and ambit, enabling the definite fulfillment of its statutory obligations.

   Section 66 of the Chhattisgarh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956

   provides for obligatory duties of Council as distinguished with

   discretionary duties listed in <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_37">Section 67</a>.       The resume of these

   provisions leaves no manner of doubt that what has been complained

   of by the petitioner Association and what is expected to be performed

   by the Municipal Corporation is the establishment of slaughter-house
                                                             W.P.(C)No.118/2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                 Page 16 of 23</span>

     enabling the members of the petitioner Association for sale of meat

     etc.. Performance of statutory obligation by the Municipal Corporation

     is included in the citizens right to life and non-performance of

     statutory obligation by the Corporation violates the citizens right to

     life.

<p id="p_79">  19. In the matter of Francis Coralie v Union Territory of Delhi3, the

     Supreme Court has held as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">             "The right to life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_38">Article 21</a> of the Constitution

             means something much more than just physical survival.

     <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_40">Article 21</a> as embracing not only physical existence of life but the

     Ratlam v. Vardhichand6</a> in which the Supreme Court while

     highlighting   the   duties   of   the   Municipal   Council   statutorily

     contemplated, observed as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">           "The statutory setting being thus plain, the municipality
           cannot extricate itself from its responsibility. Its plea is
           not that the facts are wrong but that the law is not right
           because the municipal funds being insufficient, it cannot
           carry out the duties under<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_42"> S. 123</a> of the Act. This 'alibi'
           made us issue notice to the State which is now
           represented by counsel, Shri Gambhir, before us. The
           plea of the municipality that notwithstanding the public
           nuisance financial inability validly exonerates it from
           statutory liability has no judicial basis. The<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_43"> Criminal
           Procedure Code</a> operates against statutory bodies and
           others regardless of the cash in their coffers, even as
           human rights under Part III of the Constitution have to be
           respected by the State regardless of budgetary provision.
           Likewise,<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_44"> S. 123</a> of the Act has no saving clause when
           the municipal council is penniless.           Otherwise, a
           profligate statutory body or pachydermic governmental
           agency may legally defy duties under the law by urging in
           self-defence a self-created bankruptcy or prevented

<p id="p_84">  23. Their Lordships negativing the plea of the Municipal Council, the

     defence of paucity of funds, issued certain directions to make

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">           "We are sure that the State Government will make

     Bihar7</a>, the total ban upon slaughter of all categories of "animals of

     the species of bovine cattle" imposed by the State of Bihar was

     challenged.     The Supreme Court held that (i) a total ban on the

     slaughter of cows of all ages and calves of cows and of she-buffaloes,

     male and female was reasonable and valid; (ii) a total ban on the

     slaughter of she-buffaloes or breeding bulls or working bullocks (cattle

     as well as buffaloes), so long as they were capable of being used as

     milch or draught cattle, was also reasonable and valid; and (iii) a total

     ban on the slaughter of she-buffaloes, bulls and bullocks (cattle or

     buffalo) after they ceased to be capable of yielding milk or of breeding

     or working as draught animals was not in the interests of the general

     public and was invalid.

     others v. The Union of India and others</a> 8 held that the word

     "restriction" in Articles 19 (5) and 19 (6) of the Constitution includes

     cases of "prohibition" also; that where a restriction reaches the stage

     of total restraint of rights special care has to be taken by the Court to

     see that the test of reasonableness is satisfied by considering the

     question in the background of the facts and circumstances under

     which the order was made, taking into account the nature of the evil

     that was sought to be remedied by such law, the harm caused to

     individual citizens by the proposed remedy, the beneficial effect

     reasonably expected to result to the general public, and whether the

     restraint caused by the law was more than what was necessary in the

<p id="p_88">  26. In the matter of <a href="/doc/1849054/" id="a_48">Mohammed Faruk v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> and

     others9, the Supreme Court set aside the notification placing ban on

     slaughter of bulls and bullocks and held that the impugned notification

     directly infringes the fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed by

     <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_49">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and further held that the sentiments of a section of the

     people may be hurt by permitting slaughter of bulls and bullocks in

     premises maintained by a local authority. But a prohibition imposed

     on the exercise of a fundamental right to carry on an occupation,

     trade or business will not be regarded as reasonable, if it is imposed

     not in the interest of the general public, but merely to respect the

     susceptibilities and sentiments of a section of the people whose way

     of life, belief or thought is not the same as that of the claimant. The

     notification issued must, therefore, be declared ultra vires as

     infringing <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_50">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.

     that a law which prohibits the slaughter of bull, bullocks (cattle as well

     as buffalo), cow and calf in pursuance of directive of <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_52">Article 48</a> of the

     Constitution in order to conserve the sources of milk supply and

     draught cattle constitute reasonable restriction, but total ban on the

     slaughter of she buffaloes, bulls and bullocks, after they cease to be

     capable of yielding milk or of breeding or working as draught animals

     (say bulls and bullocks up to age of 16 years) cannot be supported as
