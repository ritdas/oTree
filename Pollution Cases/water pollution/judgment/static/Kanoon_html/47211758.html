         (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE J.B.PARDIWALA)

</p><p id="p_6">1.    By this writ-application, in the nature of a public interest
litigation, the petitioner, a municipal councilor of the Dhoraji Nagar
Palika has brought to our notice that the private respondents have
made unauthorized construction without any valid permission from
the Dhoraji Municipality and also without sanction of any revised
plans. According to the petitioner, the respondent no.6-Dhoraji
Municipality, owes a legal duty to enforce the rules and regulations
governing the building construction and also other provisions of law.
</p>
<p id="p_7">2.    The case made out by the petitioner may be summed up thus:
</p>
<p id="p_8">2.1   The respondent no.5, Dhoraji Area Development Authority, is
the authority for grant of permission for development within the limits
of the Dhoraji town. The authority has to act in consonance with the
provisions of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act,
1976 (for short "the Act of 1976"). The authority is obliged to ensure
that the laws relating to the building and zoning are scrupulously
followed by one and all. The revised development scheme of Dhoraji
of the year 1989 is applicable in case of such developmental
activities.
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.2   Although many illegal constructions have been made in the
Dhoraji town, yet the respondent nos.5, 6 and 7 have failed to take

any steps in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.3   The respondent nos.12 to 16 are the owners of the Unique
School of Science. Although permission was given to the respondent
nos.12 to 16 to put up construction upto the first floor, yet without
any permission or sanction of necessary plans have put up
construction of the second and third floor.
</p>
<p id="p_11">2.4   The respondent nos.8 to 11 although were accorded permission
to put up construction of ground plus three floors according to the
sanctioned plan on plot no.166, Sheet No.107, City Survey No.1602,
admeasuring 553.39 sq.mtrs. yet a fourth floor has been constructed
without any valid permission or sanction of the plans.
</p>
<p id="p_12">2.5   One Shri Dineshbhai Gordhanbhai Topiya and his associates
have constructed one unnamed building without any valid permission
from the respondent no.6, Dhoraji Nagar Palika.          Although the
petitioner had brought to the notice of the respondent nos.6 and 7
regarding the same by filing an application dated 19th July 2013 and
30th August 2013 respectively under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, yet
till date no steps have been taken for demolition of the same.

prayed for the following reliefs:

      issued by Nagarpalika. Copy of the receipt is annexed herewith

     Raja Chithi No.009597. I say that the plan was put up before
     Nagarpalika on 29.11.2012 and accordingly the construction
     was made. I say that completion certificate was made on
     27.6.2013. I say that thereafter further plan was put up for 4th
     floor as it was within the permissible limit and done by
     Nagarpalika. Copy of the plan is annexed herewith and marked
     Annexure-R2 to this reply.

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">     2.     I say that similar to the construction of the answering
     respondent, construction is granted where even permission for
     Ground plus 7th floor is granted namely Avantika Apartment,
     Akruti Apartment, Ankur Apartment, etc.              where such
     permissions were granted immediately and before the
     commencement of the construction of the answering
     respondent. I therefore say that as in fact the purpose is
     otherwise to file petition. I say that as in fact the construction
     is completed and the plan is put up with the Nagarpalika. I say
     that as otherwise also under the Act even after submissions of
     the application and permission was sought since no reply was
     given for a considerable long period in fact deem permission
     can very well be considered as in surrounding plots similar such
     permission is granted. I say that as the enquiry is also made by
     answering respondent time and again with respect to likelihood
     of calling of meeting of Nagarpalika initially on account of the
     election and thereafter for one or other reason, the meeting is
     not called for. I say that as in fact the construction of the
     school of the answering respondent is absolutely within the
     permissible limit and as per the plan. I therefore humbly urge
     this Hon'ble Court to suitably direct Nagarpalika so as to
     complete the formalities.

     required to hold the meeting consisting of Chief Officer,
     Dy.Collector, Town Planning officer, President of Nagarpalika
     and Chairman, Construction Department. I say that since the

      approached before this Hon'ble Court with clean hands and in
      fact has suppressed vital fact and on this ground alone the
      petition is liable to be dismissed. I say that as in fact the
      petitioner is involved in number of criminal activities and there
      are so many offences registered against him as the details
      made available from Dhoraji police station about 15 offences
      registered against the petitioner and all these aspects is
      suppressed before this Hon'ble court and sought for equitable
      relief. I say that as from the conduct of the petitioner it seems
      that reason is otherwise, the purpose is otherwise to file the
      petition under the Public Interest Litigation. I say that the
      answering respondent running educational institution in the
      name as Unique School of Science, Station Road, Dhoraji. I say
      that the school of the answering respondent has its own
      popularity in the surrounding villages, Talukas as well as in the
      District of Rajkot. I say that averment made in the petition
      particularly paragraph-4.1 against respondent No.12 to 16 and
      it was stated that the permission was granted for construction
      of one floor and thereafter further construction was made. I

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">      2.    I say that as in fact absolutely false misleading
      statements was made about continuation of construction
      inasmuch as the photograph at page 33 was older one and as
      in fact the plan was put up to the Nagarpalika in the month of
      June, 2013 and even necessary amount of construction fees is
      also paid.

      called for the meeting where all such applications made by
      respective persons are pending for passing resolution.
      However for one or other reason the meeting was not called by
      Nagarpalika. I say that as otherwise also the construction of
      the petitioner is within the permissible limit and as per the plan
      submitted to the Nagarpalika. At this stage it may be noted

falls for our consideration in this petition is whether the petitioner is
entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed for in this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_28">8.      Ordinarily, the court would allow litigation in public interest if it
is found :-
</p>
<p id="p_29">(i)     That the impugned action is violative of any of the rights

        enshrined in Part III of the Constitution of India or any other

        legal right and relief is sought for its enforcement;
</p>
<p id="p_30">(ii)    That the action complained of is palpably illegal or mala fide

        and affects the group of persons who are not in a position to

        protect their own interest on account of poverty, incapacity or

        ignorance;

        the breach of public duty or from violation of some provision of

        the Constitutional law;

<p id="p_39">9.      The picture that emerges from the materials on record is that
on 8th February 2012, the respondent nos.8 to 11 applied before the
Dhoraji Municipality for permission to construct a residential complex
consisting of ground plus three floors on the City Survey No.1602
situated at Dhoraji.       The Town Planning Committee of the Dhoraji
Nagar Palika vide resolution no.14 dated 15th September 2012
accorded permission in favour of the respondent nos.8 to 11 to put up
construction upto three floors i.e. ground plus three floors. It appears
that thereafter the respondent nos.8 to 11 applied to the Dhoraji
Nagar Palika on 15th March 2013 for permission to construct the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                   Page 11 of 26</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">       C/WPPIL/233/2013                                CAV JUDGMENT</span>



fourth floor. The said application, as on today, seems to be pending
with the Dhoraji Nagar Palika. However, before any decision could be
taken or without any permission being accorded the respondent nos.8
to 11 have already completed the construction of the fourth floor. It
necessarily implies that the construction of the fourth floor, as on
today, is without any valid permission or sanction of the plans for the
same. This position has not been disputed by Mr.Dagli, the learned
advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent nos.8 to 11.          The
only argument of Mr.Dagli is that the necessary application for
putting up construction of the fourth floor was submitted before the
Dhoraji Nagar Palika but since there was no reply or any decision
taken in that regard at the end of the Dhoraji Nagar Palika, his clients
completed the construction construing it as a deemed permission.
On the other hand, Mr.Joshi, the learned advocate appearing on
behalf of the Dhoraji Nagar Palika invited our attention to the fact
that on receipt of the necessary application from the respondent
nos.8 to 11 seeking permission to put up the construction of the
fourth floor, the Nagar Palika had asked the respondent nos.8 to 11 to
take care of few defects which were noticed in their application and
at the same time, the respondent nos.8 to 11 were also instructed not
to put up any construction on the strength of the application till the
Town Planning Committee would take any decision in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_40">10.   It appears that in spite of specific instructions from the Dhoraji
Nagar Palika, the respondent nos.8 to 11 proceeded and completed
the construction of the fourth floor without there being any sanction
of the plans or valid permission.
</p>
<p id="p_41">11.   We are not impressed by the submission of Mr.Dagli that his
clients proceeded to complete the construction of the fourth floor on
the premise that the permission was deemed to have been granted
since the municipal authorities failed to take any decision within the
stipulated period of time.    In our opinion, the entire argument of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                               Page 12 of 26</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">       C/WPPIL/233/2013                                              CAV JUDGMENT</span>



Mr.Dagli    based        on   the    concept         of   "deemed    permission"   is
misconceived for more than one reason. First, in the affidavit-in-reply
filed on behalf of the respondent nos.8 to 11, there is nothing to even
remotely indicate as to on which date the application seeking
permission with the necessary plans for the construction of the fourth
floor was before with Dhoraji Nagar Palika. Secondly, once the Nagar
Palika asked the respondent nos.8 to 11 to rectify their application as
some defects were noticed and assuming for the moment that such
rectification was undertaken by the respondent nos.8 to 11 yet they
were directed by the Nagar Palika not to proceed with the
construction till appropriate decision was taken by the committee. In
such circumstances, if the reliance is on <a href="/doc/1055120/" id="a_2">Section 29</a> (4) of the Act of
1976 then we are afraid it could not be said that there was a deemed
permission. There is one additional facet to this aspect of the matter.
The deemed permission means that a person is erecting a building
after the expiry of the statutory period within which the authorities
are obliged to take appropriate decision on the application must be
strictly in accordance with the rules, bylaws etc.                     The deemed
permission can be said to have been attracted in case where a person
has carried out construction in accordance with the existing rules,
bylaws and building regulations and not otherwise.                    The municipal
authorities have yet to take the decision whether it is permissible for
the respondent nos.8 to 11 to put up the construction of the fourth
floor on the building. In any view of the matter, it is not in dispute
that in spite of the directions from the municipal authorities not to
proceed with the construction the respondent nos.8 to 11 in flagrant
disregard to such directions completed the construction of the fourth
floor without any valid permission.

is reproduced as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      "Para 12. Shri Tapas Ray, learned counsel for the Municipal
      Corporation, urged the following contentions:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">      1.    That the plan sanctioned on April 27, 1985 for a eight
      storeyed building lapsed on 26th April, 1987 since no
      construction was made and completed within two years.
      Indeed, no construction was commenced by that date. It is true
      that on April 16, 1987, the respondents applied for renewal of
      the said plan but there was no provision in the Bengal
      Municipal Act for granting such renewal. Even assuming that
      such renewal could be granted and must be deemed to have
      been granted, such deemed renewal too expired on April 16,
      1989 or, at any rate, on April 26, 1989. Admittedly, no
      construction was made, much less completed, by the said date.
      In other words, the sanction of the said plan, both actual and
      deemed, lapsed by 26th of April, 1987 and 26th April, 1989
      respectively. No construction can be permitted on the basis of
      such plan after the said dates.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      2.    So far as the deemed sanction of the twelve-storeyed
      building applied for on August 24, 1987 is concerned, it cannot
      be deemed to have been sanctioned on the expiry of thirty
      days by virtue of Section 319 of the Bengal Municipal Act for
      the reason that no such permission could have been actually
      granted under the law then in force in the said area, having
      regard to the width of the road abutting the respondents' plot
      and other relevant circumstances. The Division Bench has itself
      recognized that the deemed permission cannot be inconsistent
      with the relevant rules and regulations. No deemed permission
      can be conceived of which is inconsistent with the relevant
      rules and regulations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      3.    The position today is that the building rules framed in the
      year, 1990 (with effect from December 1, 1990) are more
      stringent than the pre-existing rules and regulations. According
      to these rules the maximum height of a building in the
      respondents' plot cannot exceed eight metres."

<p id="p_43">12.1 Before the Apex Court in the case of Calcutta Municipal
Corporation (supra) the learned counsel relied on the observations
made by the High Court "that apart construction has actually taken
place on the basis of a plan that could have been sanctioned as the
law prevailing at that time in that event nothing could have been

done." The Apex Court pointed out that Section 319 of the Bengal
Municipal Act, 1932 expressly states that even in case of a deemed
permission the applicant cannot execute the work so as to
contravene any of the provisions of this Act or of Schedule VI or any
Rule or Bye-law applying thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_44">13.   The Apex Court in the case of M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
Radhey Shyam Sahu reported in 1999 (6) SCC 464 has pointed
out that the unauthorized construction should be demolished even
though the builder has invested considerable amount. The Apex Court
pointed as under in paragraph 73 (p. 529):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">      "This Court in numerous decisions has held that no
      consideration should be shown to the builder or any other
      person where construction is unauthorized. This dicta is now
      almost bordering the rule of law. Stress was laid by the
      appellant and the prospective allottees of the shops to
      exercise judicial discretion in moulding the relief. Such a
      discretion cannot be exercised which encourages illegality or
      perpetuates an illegality. Unauthorized construction, if it is
      illegal and cannot be compounded, has to be demolished.
      There is no way out. Judicial discretion cannot be guided by
      expediency. Courts are not free from statutory fetters. Justice
      is to be rendered in accordance with law. Judges are not
      entitled to exercise discretion wearing the robes of judicial
      discretion and pass orders based solely on their personal
      predilections and peculiar dispositions. Judicial discretion
      wherever it is required to be exercised has to be in accordance
      with law and set legal principles."

argument of deemed permission in connection with the provisions of

      provisions of sub-Section 5 of Section 45 of the M.R.T.P. Act,
      1966, the application submitted by them for seeking
      permission to develop their plot should be deemed to have
      been granted to them as the Planning Authority had failed to
      communicate its decision whether to grant or refuse
      permission within 60 days from the date of receipt of their
      application, cannot be upheld. The facts of the case would
      indicate that the matter of grant of permission was under
      active consideration of different authorities. The question
      whether the appellants were entitled to additional FSI as
      claimed by them was considered and contested by the
      respondents. Further, the proviso to Section 45(5) of the
      M.R.T.P. Act, 1966 makes it clear that the deeming provision
      would apply only if the permission applied for is strictly in
      conformity with relevant DC Regulations.      The competent

four decades the menace of illegal and unauthorized constructions of
buildings and other structures in different parts of the country had
acquired monstrous proportion. His Lordship held that the Supreme

development of the cities and either approved the orders passed by
the High Court or itself gave direction for demolition of illegal

Municipal Council, reported in (1974) 2 SCC 06, the Supreme
Court held that the municipal authorities owed a duty and obligation
under the statute to see that the residential area was not spoilt by
unauthorized construction. The Court observed that the scheme was
for the benefit of the residents of the locality and the municipality
acted in aid of the scheme. The rights of the residents in the area
were invaded by an illegal construction. The Court proceeded further
to observe that it had to be remembered that a scheme in a
residential area meant planned orderliness in accordance with the
requirements of the residents. If the scheme was nullified by arbitrary
acts in excess and derogation of the powers of the municipality, the
courts would quash orders passed by the municipalities in such cases.
The Court also proceeded further to observe that the Court enforces
the performance of statutory duty by public bodies as obligation to
rate payers who had a legal right to demand compliance by a local
authority with its duty to observe statutory rights alone.

Orissa, reported in (2004) 8 SCC 733, the Supreme Court noted
that large number of illegal and unauthorized constructions were
being raised in the city of Cuttack and made the following significant
observations:

<p id="p_49">      Serious threat is posed to ecology and environment and, at the
      same time, the infrastructure consisting of water supply,
      sewerage and traffic movement facilities suffer unbearable
      burden and are often thrown out of gear. Unwary purchasers in
      search of       roof over their heads and purchasing
      flats/apartments from builders, find themselves having fallen
      prey and become victims to the design or unscrupulous
      builders. The builder conveniently walks away having pocketed
      the money leaving behind the unfortunate occupants to face

the music in the event of unauthorized constructions being
detected or exposed and threatened with demolition. Though
the local authorities have the staff consisting of engineers and
inspectors whose duty is to keep a watch on building activities
and to promptly stop the illegal constructions or deviations
coming up, they often fail in discharging their duty. Either they
don't act or do not act promptly or do connive at such activities
apparently for illegitimate considerations. If such activities are
to stop, some constructions and non-compoundable deviations.
The unwary purchasers who shall be the suffers must be
adequately compensated by the builder. The arms of the law
must stretch to catch hold of such unscrupulous builders.....
</p>
<p id="p_50">In all developed and developing countries there is emphasis on
planned development of cities which is sought to be achieved
by zoning, planning and regulating building construction
activity. Such planning, though highly complex, is a matter
based on scientific research, study and experience leading to
rationalization of laws by way of legislative enactments and
rules and regulations framed thereunder. Zoning and planning
do result in hardship to individual property owners as their
freedom to use their property in the way they like, is subjected
to regulation and control. The private owners are to some
extent prevented from making the most profitable use of their
property. But for this reason alone the controlling regulations
cannot be termed as arbitrary or unreasonable. The private
interest stands subordinated to the public good. It can be
stated in a way that power to plan development of city and to
regulate the building activity therein flows from the police
power of the State. The exercise of such governmental power is
justified on account of it being reasonably necessary for the
public health, safety morals or general welfare are ecological
considerations, though an unnecessary or unreasonable
intermeddling with the private ownership of the property may
not be justified.
</p>
<p id="p_51">The municipal laws regulating the building construction activity
may provide for regulations as to floor area, the number of
floors, the extent of height rise and the nature of use of which
a built-up property may be subjected in any particular area.
The individuals as property owners have to pay some price for
securing peace, good order, dignity, protection and comfort
and safety of the community. Not only filth, stench and
unhealthy places have to be eliminated, but the layout helps in
achieving family values, youth values, seclusion and clean air
to make the locality a better place to live. Building regulations
also help in reduction or elimination of fire hazards, the
avoidance of traffic dangers and the lessening of prevention of
traffic congestion in the streets and roads. Zoning and building

      regulations are also legitimized from the point of view of the
      control of community development, the prevention of
      overcrowding of land, the furnishing of recreational facilities
      like pars and playgrounds and the availability of adequate
      water, sewerage and other governmental or utility services.
      Structural and lot area regulations authorize the municipal
      authorities to regulate and restrict the height, number of
      storeys and other structures; the percentage of a plot that may
      be occupied; the size of yards, courts and open spaces, the
      density of population; and the location and use of buildings and
      structures. All these have in our view and do achieve the large
      purpose of the public health, safety or general welfare So are
      front setback provisions, average alignments and structural
      alterations. Any violation of zoning and regulation laws takes
      the toll in terms of public welfare and convenience being
      sacrificed apart from the risk, inconvenience and hardship
      which is posed to the occupants of the building." (emphasis

      plan of the building is used for a purpose other than the one
      specified in the relevant statute or the master plan, etc; such
      constructions put unbearable burden on the public
      facilities/amenities like water, electricity, sewerage, etc, apart
      from creating chaos on the roads. The pollution caused due to
      traffic congestion affects the health of the road users. The
      pedestrians and people belonging to weaker sections of the
      society, who cannot afford the luxury of air -conditioned cars,
      are of the worst victims of pollution. They suffer from skin
      diseases of different types, asthma, allergies and even more
      dreaded diseases like cancer. It can only be a matter of
      imagination how much the Government has to spend on the
      treatment of such persons and also for controlling pollution and
      adverse impact on the environment due traffic congestion on
      the roads and chaotic conditions created due to illegal and
      unauthorized constructions. This Court has, from time to time,
      taken cognizance of buildings constructed in violation of
      municipal and other laws and emphasized that no compromise
      should be made with the town planning scheme and no relief
      should be given to the violator of the town planning scheme,
      etc; on the ground that he has spent substantial amount on
      construction of the buildings, etc.

      Unfortunately, despite repeated judgments by this Court and
      the High Courts, the builders and other affluent people
      engaged in the construction activities, who have, over the
      years shown scant respect for regulatory mechanism engaged
      in the municipal and other similar laws, as also the master
      plans, zonal development plans sanctioned plans, etc; have
      received encouragement and support from the State
      apparatus. As and when the Courts have passed orders or the
      officers of local and other bodies have taken action for ensuring
      rigorous compliance with laws relating to planned development
      of the cities and urban areas an issued directions for demolition
      of the illegal/unauthorized constructions in the name of
      compassion and hardship. Such actions have done irreparable
      harm to the concept of planned development of the cities and
      urban areas. It is high time that the executive and political
      apparatus of the State take serious view of the menace of
      illegal and unauthorized constructions and stop their support to
      the lobbies of affluent class of builders and others, else even
      the rural areas of the country will soon witness similar chaotic
      conditions." (emphasis supplied) "

while dealing with a matter of unauthorized construction, and the
dubious roles played by the builders in duping innocent buyers, made
the following observations, which are worth noting:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      "The conduct of the builder in the present case deserves to be
      noticed. He knew it fully well what was the permissible
      construction as per the sanctioned building plans and yet he
      not only constructed additional built-up area on each floor but
      also added and additional fifth floor on the building, and such a
      floor was totally unauthorized. In spite of the disputes and
      litigation pending he parted with his interest in the property
      and inducted occupants on all the floors, including the
      additional one. Probably he was under the impression that he
      would be able to either escape the clutches of the law or twist
      the arm of the law by some manipulation. This impression must
      prove to be wrong.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      In all developed and developing countries there is emphasis on
      planned development of cities which is sought to be achieved
      by zoning, planning and regulating building construction
      activity. Such planning, though highly complex, is a matter
      based on scientific research, study and experience leading to
      rationalization of laws by way of legislative enactments and
      rules and regulations framed thereunder. Zoning and planning
      do result in hardship to individual property owners as their
      freedom to use their property in the way they like, is subjected
      to regulation and control. The private owners are to some
      extent prevented from making the most profitable use of their
      property. But for this reason alone the controlling regulations
      cannot be termed as arbitrary or unreasonable. The private
      interest stands subordinated to the public good. It can be
      stated in a way that power to plan development of city and to
      regulate the building activity therein flows from the police
      power of the State. The exercise of such governmental power is
      justified on account of it being reasonably necessary for the
      public health, safety, morals or general welfare and ecological
      considerations ; though and unnecessary or unreasonable
      intermeddling with the private ownership of the property may
      not be justified.</blockquote>
<p id="p_54">     The municipal laws regulating the building construction activity
     may provide for regulations as to floor are, the number of
     floors, the extent of height rise and the nature of use to which a
     built up property may be subjected in any particular area. The
     individuals as property owners have to pay some price for
     securing peace, good order, good dignity, protection and
     comfort and safety of the community. Not only filth, stench and

unhealthy places have to be eliminated, but the layout helps in
achieving family values, youth values, seclusion and clean air
to make the locality a better place to live. Building regulations
also help in reduction or elimination of fire hazards, the
avoidance of traffic dangers and the lessening of prevention of
traffic congestion in the streets and roads. Zoning and building
regulations are also legitimized from the point of view of the
control or community development the prevention of
overcrowding of land, the furnishing of recreational facilities
like parks and playgrounds and the availability of adequate
water, sewerage and other governmental or utility services.
</p>
<p id="p_55">Structural and lot area regulations authorize the municipal
authorities to regulate and restrict the height, number of
storeys and other structures, the percentage of a plot that may
be occupied, the size of yards, courts and open spaces, the
density of population, and the location and use of buildings and
structures. All these have in our view and do achieve the larger
purpose of the public health, safety or general welfare. So are
front setback provisions, average alignments and structural
alterations. Any violation of zoning and regulation laws takes
the toll in terms of public welfare and conveniences being
sacrificed apart from the risk, inconvenience and hardship
which is posed to the occupants of building.
</p>
<p id="p_56">Though the municipal laws permit deviations from sanctioned
constructions being regularized by compounding but that is by
way of exception. Unfortunately the exception, with the lapse
of time and frequent exercise of the discretionary power
conferred by such exception, has become the rule. Only such
deviations deserve to be condoned as are bona fide or are
attributable to some misunderstanding or are such deviations
as where the benefit gained by demolition would be far less
than the disadvantage suffered. Other than these, deliberate
deviations do not deserve to be condoned and compounded.
Compounding of deviations ought to be kept at a bare
minimum. The cases of professional builders stand on a
different footing from an individual constructing his own
building. A professional builder is supposed to understand the
laws better and deviations by such builders can safely be
assumed to be deliberate and one with the intention of earning
profits and hence deserve to be dealt with sternly so as to act
as a deterrent for future. It is common knowledge that the
builders enter into underhand dealings. Be that as it may, the
State Government should think of levying heavy penalties on
such builders and therefrom develop a welfare fund which can
be utilized for compensating and rehabilitating such innocent or
unwary buyers who are displaced on account of demolition of

<p id="p_57">20.   The observations made by the Supreme Court in Indian
Council for Enviro-Legal Action Vs. Union of India, reported in
(1996) 5 SCC 281 with regard to infringement of law, are worth
noting.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "26. ...Enactment of a law, but tolerating its infringement, is
      worse than not enacting a law at all. The continued
      infringement of law, over a period of time, is made possible by
      adoption of such means which are best known to the violators
      of law. Continued tolerance of such violations of law not only
      renders legal provisions nugatory but such tolerance by the
      enforcement authorities encourages lawlessness and adoption
      of means which cannot, or ought not to, be tolerated in any
      civilized society. Law should not only be meant for the law-
      aiding but is meant to be obeyed by all for whom it has been
      enacted. A law is usually enacted because the legislature feels
      that is is necessary. It is with a view to protect and preserve
      the environment and save it for the future generations and to
      ensure good quality of life that Parliament enacted the anti-
      population laws, namely the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a> and the
      <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">These Act</a>s and Rules
      framed and notification issued thereunder contain provisions
      which prohibit and/or regulate certain activities with a view to
      protect and preserve the environment. When a law is enacted
      containing some provisions which prohibit certain types of
      activities, then, it is of utmost importance that such legal
      provisions are effectively enforced. If a law is enacted but is not
      being voluntarily obeyed, then, it has to be enforced.
      Otherwise, infringement of law, which is actively or passively
      condoned for personal gain, will be encouraged which will in
      turn lead to a lawless society. Violation of anti-pollution laws
      not only adversely affects the existing quality of life but the
      non-enforcement of the legal provisions often results in
      ecological imbalance and degradation of environment, the
      adverse effect of which will have to be borne by the future
      generations."

<p id="p_58">21.   In Dr.G.N. Khajuria and ors. Vs. Delhi Development
Authority and ors., reported in (1995) 5 SCC 762, the Supreme

      where unauthorized constructions are demolished on the force
      of the order of courts, the illegality is not taken care of fully
      inasmuch as the officers of the statutory body who had allowed
      the unauthorized construction to be made or make illegal
      allotments go scotfree. This should not, however, have
      happened for two reasons. First, it is the illegal action/order of
      the officer which lies at the root of the unlawful act of the
      citizen concerned, because of which the officer is more to be
      blamed than the recipient of the illegal benefit. It is thus
      imperative , according to us, that while undoing the mischief
      which would require the demolition of the unauthorized
      construction, the delinquent officer has also to be punished in
      accordance with law. This, however, seldom happens.
      Secondly, to take care of the injustice completely, the officer
      who had misused his power has also to be properly punished.
      Otherwise, what happens is that the officer, who made the hay
      when the sun shined, retains the hay, which tempts others to
      do the same. This really gives fillip to the commission of
      tainted acts, whereas the aim should be opposite."

<p id="p_59">22.   The above takes us to consider the case of unauthorized
construction put up by the respondent nos.12 to 16.           From the
materials on record, it appears that the respondent nos.12 to 16
initially constructed ground plus first floor without any permission
from the Dhoraji Nagar Palika. After completing the construction of
the ground plus first floor, they applied for regularization of such
construction.       It appears that the authority concerned granted
permission and approved the plans on 27th June 2013. Thereafter, the
respondent nos.12 to 16 applied on 20th July 2013 seeking permission
to construct the second and third floors with a revised plan. The said
application is pending before the Town Planning Committee of the
Dhoraji Nagar Palika for approval as on today.           However, the
respondent nos.12 to 16 proceeded with the construction of the
second and third floor without any valid permission.           In such
circumstances, the construction put up by the respondent nos.12 to
16 of the second and third floor has also to be termed as illegal and
unauthorized.

is not the owner of the unnamed building as alleged by the petitioner.
The respondent nos.19 to 22 against whom allegations have been
levelled by the petitioner had applied for the permission on 8th
February 2012 to construct a building consisting of ground plus four
floors on Survey Nos.1608 to 1611. The Town Planning Committee
vide its resolution No.1 (23) dated 15th July 2013 approved the same.
Pursuant to it, the Raja Chitthi No.009619 dated 20th July 2013 was
issued and the plans were also approved.         Thus, so far as the
respondent nos.19 to 22 are concerned they are not guilty in any
manner of putting up any illegal or unauthorized construction.
</p>
<p id="p_61">24.   By way of Civil Application No.12534 of 2013, the petitioner
impleaded the respondent no.18 as a party respondent.                The
respondent nos.17 and 18 had applied for the development
permission on 1st October 2009 and approval of plan for ground floor
plus seven floors in the name of Rameshwar Developers on City
Survey No.1005, 1006 and 1007, Sheet No.95 in the name of
Avantika-1 and Avantika-2.     The Town Planning Committee vide
resolution No.1 (25) dated 5th January 2010 approved the plan and
pursuant to the same Raja Chitthi No.009293 dated 30th January 2010
was issued. Thus, so far as construction of Avantika-1 and Avantika-2
are concerned, there does not appear to be any illegality and the
construction appears to have been carried out in accordance with the
plans and the permission was accorded by the Nagar Palika.
