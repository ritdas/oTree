14.02.2014

      Shri S.K.Garg, Advocate for the appellant.
      Shri P.K.Kaurav, Additional Advocate General for the
respondent no.2/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Shri R.N.Singh, Senior Advocate with Shri Saurabh Sunder,
Advocate for the respondent no.3.
</p><p id="p_2">      Shri V.S.Shroti, Senior Advocate with Shri Vikram Johri,
Advocate for the respondent no.4.
</p><p id="p_3">      Counsel for the petitioner requested for pass-over/keeping
back the matter. This request, however, has been vehemently
opposed by the counsel appearing for the private respondents on
the ground that the matter is pending for quite sometime and the
request for pass-over is, in fact, request for adjournment as the
petition would not reach for hearing once it is kept back due to
heavy Board.
</p><p id="p_4">      Since the request for pass-over is opposed, we decline the
said request made by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_5">      This Public Interest Litigation is filed to challenge the
appointment of the respondent no.3 as Chairman of M.P. State
Pollution Control Board. It is noticed that the respondent no.3
was initially appointed in the year 2009 after following due
selection process for a period of 3 years. Before expiry of the said
period the State Government decided to issue advertisement to fill
in the impending vacancy, which would take place after the
retirement of respondent no.3. However, before any further steps
could be taken on the basis of the said advertisement, the State
Government decided to invoke powers available under <a href="/doc/1291293/" id="a_1">section
5(7)</a> of the Water (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1974, which
permits giving extension of 3 years to the person in office and
                   Writ Appeal No.2347/2013

allow him to continue as Chairman of the Board for the extended
period.     Accordingly,    the   State   Government     after   due
deliberations, extended the period of Chairman of the respondent
no.3, which will now expire in the year 2015.
</p><p id="p_6">      As aforesaid, the initial appointment of the respondent no.3
was after following due selection process. The issue regarding
eligibility of the respondent no.3 has already been considered in
the said selection process. No challenge to the initial appointment
was made from any quarters. Similarly, the fact that the State
Government initially issued advertisement and then decided to
extend the tenure of existing Chairman for another three years
cannot be the basis to assume that the State Government has no
power to do so. It is not a case of want of jurisdiction of the State
Government which could have been the basis to question the
decision of the State Government. It is also not the case of the
petitioner that the performance of the respondent no.3 while he
was in office as Chairman was of such a nature that he did not
deserve extension on that count. General assertions have been
made in the writ petition that Port Folio Minister decided to bring
in his candidate by this backdoor method.         If the method of
extension is provided in law, we fail to understand as to how it will
be a backdoor method of re-nomination of the respondent no.3.
</p><p id="p_7">      In our opinion, there is no merit in this Public Interest
Litigation. Hence, the same is dismissed.
