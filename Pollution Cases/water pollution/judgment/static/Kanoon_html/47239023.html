<p id="p_1">(Judgment delivered by the Bench)



            This appeal has been filed by the appellant praying for setting aside the

Environmental    Clearance     in    order     dated        16.05.2012   in    Letter

No.SEIAA/TN/Ec/8(a)/120/F-455/2012 of the 4th respondent to convert the newly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           3</span>


constructed building complex namely the The Tamil Nadu New Legislative Assembly

Building (TNLA) into a Multi Specialty Super Hospital at Omandhurar Government

Estate.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">              2. The brief statement of the case brought forth by the appellant in the

appeal is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">       (i) When the 13th Legislative Assembly was formed in the year 2006, after the

General Elections were held, on 08.05.2006, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu

made an official announcement on 12.05.2007 that a new building complex to house

the Legislative Assembly, Legislative Council and Secretariat and other government

departments would be constructed at the Omanthurar Government Estate, Anna

Salai, Chennai-2, which is just about 2 km away from the Fort St.George premises

where the present State Secretariat is functioning and the reasons for the proposal

to build a new Secretariat included the severe space constraint at the Fort St.George

and the need to bring all the important arms of the Government - Legislative

Assembly, Legislative Council, Chief Minister's office, Secretariat and the

Government departments under one roof. This would help the Executives, but also

the public, and the lawyers which would also bring a big relief to the Government

servants and various officials.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">       (ii) The Assembly and the land on which the old Secretariat buildings stand at

the Fort St.George, Chennai-9 were under the control of the Indian Army, Ministry of

Defence and hence the Public Works Department had to approach the authorities of

the Union Ministry of Defence for every small changes and construction to be made

in Fort St.George premises. Moreover, the said building is declared as Heritage

Building and classified under Grade-I category. Hence no modification or alteration
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            4</span>


could be made. While the need for more space for administrative amenities kept

growing, the efforts that went into co-coordinating with the civic agencies,

government and the defence establishment was making it almost impossible for the

State Government to do what it wanted at the Fort St.George premises. From a

handful of the government departments, the state government machinery has now

grown like a banyan tree with very many departments and employing several

thousand employees. Even the multi storied Secretariat building and Namakkal

Kavignar Maligai constructed within the premises had outlived its utility and size long

ago. The government staff work in the dirty and most unhygienic atmosphere. The

public and lawyers who visit the old Secretariat had a bad experience when they

appear before the department secretaries as they had to wait for long hours in the

narrow passage where no seats were available due to space constraints. Thus one

has to undergo a horrible experience to attend a hearing before the department

secretaries who act as appellate authorities.. Hence, the search for an alternative

site to locate the Assembly-Secretariat complex is not new and it started in 1983 and

after 24 years of search, finally the government was able to locate at Omanthurar

Government Estate at Anna Salai in the year 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      (iii) Pursuant to the announcement made on 12.05.2007, the government

announced that it had decided to build a state- of- the art Assembly-cum-Secretariat

complex in the Omanthurar Government Estate premises, which is surrounded by

roads on all four sides, making it an ideal location.       The Government issued

G.O.Ms.No. 209, Public Department dated 04.07.2007 for construction of Assembly-

cum-Secretariat complex and international tender notification was floated on

05.07.2007 and as many as 25 models of the new Secretariat complex were

received from top architects till 25.07.2007. After affording personal hearing to these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          5</span>


architects/firms and discussions were held with them. Three architects were asked

to submit models and drawings on 24.10.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      (iv) An expert committee under the Chief Engineer (Buildings) Public Works

Department was appointed under G.O.Ms.No.69, Public Works (H1) Department

dated 05.011.2007 and the committee conducted an in-depth analysis of their

models and drawings. The committee selected GMP International of Germany for

rendering architectural services for designing the New Legislative Assembly

complex-cum- Secretariat buildings.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      (v) The Government constituted a committee of secretaries in G.O.Ms.No.

371, Public Works (H1) Department dated 10.12.2007 to advise the Chief Engineer

(Buildings) Public Works Department in the matter of space requirements and other

facilities to be provided to the New Legislative Assembly complex-cum- New

Secretariat building. On 26.03.2008, when a review meeting was held chaired by the

Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, it was decided to construct new

complex to accommodate all the secretariat departments. Accordingly the Architect

was asked to present schematic design for Blocks A and B. After deliberations by the

committee of secretaries, it was decided to construct Legislative complex-cum-

administrative office. The State Government signed an agreement with the company

on 15.02.2008 and the Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, Chennai

applied to Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA)           for according

approval for construction of Assembly building - Ground floor + 6 floors; Secretariat

buildings- Ground Floor+7 floors; Assembly building and Secretariat buildings-

connecting block- Ground Floor; Guest House- Ground Floor + 3 Floors; Rajaji Hall-

Ground Floor+2 Floors; Parking Block-Ground Floor+ 5 Floors+ parking at terrace;

S.Nos. 3171/7, 3171/A,3171/8 in Block No.59, Triplicane Village, Anna Salai,

Jagajeevanaram Road (Walajah Road), Swami Sivananda Salai (Adams Road),

Chennai.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">      (vi) In accordance with the Environmental Notification S.O.1533 dated

14.09.2006, the Superintending Engineer, Public Works Department applied for

Environmental Clearance on 30.09.2008 before the State Level Environmental

Impact Assessment Authority (for short SEIAA) and the proposal was appraised as

per the procedure of the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (for short SLEAC)

in the meeting held on 10th and 11th of October 2008. In the said application made for

the Environmental clearance before the SEIAA the project and activity were shown

as 'Legislative Assembly-cum-Secretariat Project' and had obtained specific

clearance for the construction of the above said project and activity. Therefore, as

the Environmental Clearance was given for a specific project and activity, based on

which the building was constructed and put into use and the respondents 1 to 3 are

prohibited from utlising the said building for any other purpose much less for a Multi

Super Specialty-cum-Hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">      (vii) After consultations with the various government departments and the

secretariat authorities the Government decided to construct a New Secretariat-cum-

Legislative Assembly complex in two blocks - Block A and Block B so as to

accommodate the needs of the aspirations of all the departments. Accordingly the

foundation stone to build the structures was laid at the Omanthurar Government

Estate on 12.06.2008 by the then Chief Minister.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">      (viii) The main building was constructed with two blocks. In Block A is the

Assembly complex with seven stories, Assembly hall in the ground floor and with 6
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            7</span>


floors has an area of 9,00,000 sq.ft and it comprises of Legislative Assembly hall,

Sepaker's office, Assembly library etc., and the cost of construction was estimated at

Rs. 623.99 crore and a sum of Rs. 479.50 crore was spent by the Government for

the construction of the same. In so far as Block B is concerned, the Secretariat

building (ground+six floors) commenced and as against the estimated cost of Rs.

279.56 crore, Rs.72.3 crore was spent. For Guest House, Kalaivanar Arangam,

Multilevel car parking etc.,Rs. 66.96 crore was spent and the total expenditure

incurred was Rs. 551.80 crore as against the estimated cost of the project of Rs.

1092 crore. The newly constructed New Secretariat-cum-Assembly complex is one

of the world class green buildings and the Housing and Urban Development

Department has granted approval by G.O.Ms.No.54 dated 08.03.2010 for the entire

buildings and the Public Works Department has issued stability certificate for the

complex. The civil works of the A block building was completed and the Legislative

complex was officially inaugurated by the Hon'ble Prime Minister on 13.03.2010.


</p><p id="p_20">       (ix) The last session in the old Assembly building at Fort St.George was held

on 11th January 2010 and thereafter about 4 sessions were held in the New

Legislative Assembly Hall at Government Omandhurar Estate. When there was

change of power in the State in the Assembly elections held in April 2011, the

present Chief Minister announced that she would not enter the New Secretariat or

the New Assembly complex and declared that all the Government offices be shifted

from the New Secretariat including the Legislative Assembly to the old Fort

St.George campus. The present Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu took an independent

decision to move the Secretariat back to the Fort St.George on the very first day i.e.,

on 16th May 2011 without any reason whatsoever. Based on the said decision,

stoppage was ordered for functioning of the new Legislative Assembly-cum-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            8</span>


Secretariat complex. Thus, the decision to shift the government departments and the

new Legislative Assembly from Omandhurar Government Estate back to Fort

St.George is due to partisan political reasons, even though there were no written

official explanations for such shifting.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">       (x) Aggrieved over the decision of the respondents in abandoning the new

Legislative Assembly-cum-Secretariat building, the appellant herein had filed

W.P.No.19314 of 2011 before the High Court, Madras and by the order dated

09.09.2011 the writ petition was adjudicated directing that representation of the

petitioner (appellant herein) dated 22.08.2011 should be looked into and appropriate

decision could be taken at the earliest.       When the said representation of the

appellant was pending consideration by the 1 st respondent, he proceeded with the

conversion and took steps to convert the newly constructed Secretariat-cum-

Assembly complex into Multi Super Specialty Hospital even without obtaining the

Environmental Clearance for such project or activity.     In fact, the 1 st respondent

invited tender through the Superintending Engineer, Public Works Department,

Construction    Circle,    TNLA     complex    through   tender   notice   No.8/2011-

2012/BCC/TNLA dated 06.01.2012. In the meanwhile, without giving any personal

hearing and even without considering the various issues raised by the appellant the

representation dated 22.08.2011 the 1st respondent rejected the same under Letter

No. 23564/Y12/2011-8 dated 08.12.2011. The appellant had filed a writ petition in

W.P.No. 30326 of 2011 and the High Court Madras passed an order of injunction

restraining the respondents from making any structural alterations in the building till

the disposal of the writ petition by an order dated20.01.2012.


</p><p id="p_23">       (xi) The appellant had sent a detailed objection dated 24.04.2012 to the

SEIAA viz., 4th respondent to consider his objections before taking any decision on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                           9</span>


the application, if any, submitted by the Government of Tamil Nadu seeking

Environmental Clearance for the conversion of the New Secretariat Building into a

Multi Super Specialty Hospital-cum-Medical College or any other purpose contrary to

the original purpose. However, the said objection was not considered by SEIAA.

The appellant sent a reminder to the authorities on 11.05.2012 wherein he has also

referred to the order passed by the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi dated

24.02.2012 in Appeal No.18 of 2011(T) wherein it held that for the grant of

Environmental Clearance for Category A projects, the jurisdiction lies with the

Central Government in MoEF and not with the Tamil Nadu State Environment Impact

Assessment Authority and ultimately held that the Environmental Clearance granted

by the SEIAA has no validity under law and was set aside on the reason that the

nearest point to the subject project therein is stated within 10 Km (i.e, 5.6 Km and

6.2 Km ) from Guindy National Park, Chennai. The present case is similar to the said

case and on that score itself the impugned Environmental Clearance is liable to be

set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">       (xii) In spite of sending detailed objection and reminders, the 4 th respondent

namely SEIAA has deliberately failed to consider his objection and has granted

Environmental       Clearance        on       16.05.2012      in      Letter      No.

SEIAA/TN/Ec/8(a)/120/F.455/2012 for the conversion of New Secretariat-cum-

Legislative Assembly Building into Multi Super Specialty Hospital and Medical

College. Challenging the said Environmental Clearance the appellant has filed this

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">       (xiii) Upon leave granted by the Tribunal to file additional grounds, the

appellant averred that the 5th respondent has not done any independent study or

called for any independent reports on the expert body and has not properly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                          10</span>


appraised the proposal to the 4th respondent as contemplated under the

Environmental Impact Assessment Notification and hastily and mechanically

forwarded to the 4th respondent on 11.05.2012. The project proponent deliberately

suppressed the factum of the tender notification for the value more than Rs.28 crore

to carry out the alternation and modification in the subject building and made an

application on 12.04.2012 as if there is no construction or alteration at all. The

statutory queries in Form I and the appendix enclosed along with the application and

the answers to the same disclose the mechanical approach with non-application of

mind without even meeting the required parameters for establishment of the Multi

Super Specialty Hospital. It has not addressed various issues relating the hospital

and appears to be like a mechanical approach in dealing with the application of the

2nd respondent.   The 5th respondent has not even seen as to how far there is

extraction of resources from the environment and the contribution of emissions and

waste and distribution to environment. The respondent Nos. 4 and 5 have not seen

the influence of hospital characteristics on the environment and blindly gone by the

figures given by the project proponent. The 5 th respondent has not studied about the

water and energy consumption without any independent mechanism and blindly

accepted the project proponent report.        The 4 th respondent has mechanically

scrutinized the recommendations of the 5th respondent and passed         11/2   page

minutes, out of which ½ page deals             with the granting of the impugned

Environmental Clearance in the meeting dated 16.05.2012. The project proponent

has not sought for any permission for construction, alteration or modification. But,

the 4th respondent issued clearance on 16.05.2012 permitting to go ahead with the

construction, which could be seen from the various clauses in the Environmental

Clearance dated 16.05.2012. A perusal of the minutes dated 16.05.2012 of the 4th

respondent and the impugned Environmental Clearance show contradiction as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                           11</span>


condition, Both the respondents 4 and 5 have not discharged the duties

contemplated in the EIA Notification and various other Acts and Rules governing the

same and mechanically proposed the application submitted by the project proponent

and wrongly issued the impugned Environmental Clearance.


</p><p id="p_28">              3. Per contra, the 1st respondent has, at the outset raising preliminary

objections to the very maintainability of the instant appeal, filed a counter reply for

him and on behalf of and 2nd and third respondent as well. The brief statement of

counter is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">       (i) The appellant has challenged the conversion of the Block A building in

Omandhurar Government Estate into a Multi Super Specialty Hospital in the Writ

Petition filed before the Madras High Court in W.P.No. 30326 of 2011 in which he

has raised grounds alleging purported violation of environmental laws, which are

identical with the grounds/issues sought to be raised in the instant appeal. The

perusal of the contents of the reply affidavit filed in the month of March 2012 filed by

the appellant in the said proceedings to the counter affidavit filed in the month of

February 2012 of the answering respondents when compared with the appeal filed

herein, particularly para 16 of the appeal (at page 10 compilation I) would show that

the same contentions as sought to be raised in the present appeal have been raised

verbatim even before the High Court. The appellant has sought to implead 4 th and 5th

respondents herein as party respondents to the said writ proceedings by affidavit

dated July 2012 on the grounds that these authorities granted the clearance for

conversion of the Block-A building in Omandhurar Government Estate into a Multi

Super Specialty Hospital and while doing so the affidavit dated July 2012 filed before

the Madras High Court, Madras seeking impeadment takes specific reference to

para 4 thereof to the filing of the instant appeal before this Tribunal. Moreover, when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                           12</span>


the Division Bench of the High Court was finally heard, elaborate arguments were

raised on behalf of the appellant in respect of the scope/EIA Notification of 1994 and

the purported bar to consider an application for conversion of a project under the

said notification. Though the judgment was reserved in the matter, the Division

Bench of the High Court delisted the case on 27.07.2012 and placed the matter

before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for posting the writ petitions before an appropriate

bench for hearing the matter afresh and thus the appellant is guilty of forum

shopping and multifariousness. The appellant is clearly attempting to try his chance

before different fora on same grounds to see if he is able to obtain favourable orders

if in any one or in both and that the submission urged by the appellant to justify the

interim prayer sought in the appeal are identical with the grounds raised before the

High Court in the writ proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">       (ii) The appellant has repeatedly filed proceedings challenging the well

considered decision of the State to convert the building in question into a Multi Super

Specialty Hospital and this is a clear reflection of complete lack of bonafides in the

conduct of the appellant, whose ulterior motive is to somehow stall the entire political

process, tainted by oblique motive and political considerations. The repeated attempt

of the petitioner to stall the project would be evident from the fact that the appellant

had filed an earlier writ petition in W.P.No. 19314 of 2011 before the High Court,

which had been disposed of by the order dated 09.09.2011, with a direction to

dispose of the representation made by him (as admitted in para 17 of the appeal).

This is in teeth of the fact that the Madras High Court had already rejected a

challenge to the conversion by dismissing a writ petition filed by another person in

W.P.No.12492 of 2011 vide orders dated 28.06.2011. Thus the present appeal is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                           13</span>


third legal proceedings initiated by the appellant that too by urging identical

questions/issues before two different fora.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">      (iii) The challenge made in the present appeal to the decision of the 4 th

respondent dated 16.05.2012 is ex-facie unsustainable since the 4th respondent,

being the designated authority constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest

under the notification, has applied its mind to the various relevant aspects and

granted the clearance and a cursory glance at the impugned order would show that

the authority has taken care to impose various terms and conditions for the

conversion. The contention that the Environment Impact Assessment ( for short EIA)

Notification prohibits construction prior to the grant of approval and therefore the

application could not have been entertained since the secretariat has already been

constructed under the original approval is wholly untenable. The consequence/effect

of the appellant's contention, if accepted, would be that any construction/structure

put up for a particular purpose would have to be completely demolished before

making an appeal for change of use and this is patently illogical and irrational. The

allied submission of the appellant that the EIA notification does not permit

modification is untenable as the notification read as a whole and the relevant

statutory provisions under which the notification has been issued, do not contain

either an express or an implied bar for conversion. The Environmental Clearance

given to the Block-A building in the Omandhurar Government Estate in 2008 is

subject to certain general conditions. One among the conditions is that in a case of

any change(s) in the scope of the project, a fresh appraisal by the State Level

Environment Impact Assessment Authority is to be done. That is what has now been

done by the SEIAA. The very same authority had granted the approval initially for

the construction of the Block A building in Omandhurar Government Estate in 2008,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                            14</span>


which the applicant is not questioning. The appellant has chosen to question the

clearance granted by the authority for conversion, inter alia on the tenuous plea that

the project site is within 8 Km from the Guindy National Park and on that basis has

sought to contend that the impugned clearance is liable to be set aside in view of the

purported bar imposed by this Tribunal in Appeal No.18 of 2011 for grant of

Environmental Clearance for Category A projects is wholly baseless in the light of

the specific clarification issued by the MoEF that the General Condition or the

Special Condition is not applicable to the projects categorized under item 8 of the

schedule of the notification. Para 2 read with para 4(iii) of the notification specifies

SEIAA will be the regulatory authority in respect of the projects under Category B.

The project on conversion of the building in question into Multi Super Specialty

Hospital is covered in 8(a) of the Schedule to the Notification and is in "B2" category.

It does not require public consultation as per para 7(i)III Stage (3)(d) and 3(e) "Public

Consultation" of EIA Notification 2006. The General Condition is not applicable to the

projects/activities mentioned under item 8 of the schedule of the EIA Notification

2006 and no condition has been stated under the column No.5 (condition if any) of

the schedule of the Notification for the project or activity listed in Item No.8 of the

above said schedule. If the said contention of the appellant was to be countenanced

then the clearance for the original project would itself be rendered to be liable to be

set aside so much for the tenability and the merits of the appellant's case.


</p><p id="p_35">       (iv) The writ petition filed by the appellant in W.P.No.30326 of 2012 before the

High Court of Madras is still pending and the policy decision of the Government of

Tamil Nadu is a reasoned and duly considered one, and as such, is in accordance

with law and at any rate, a policy decision cannot be challenged. The allegations are

politically malafide, draining the exchequer and causing public injury are all baseless
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                            15</span>


and only to project a false picture when such allegations cannot be gone into by this

Tribunal. The further allegation of violation of environmental laws is also denied. The

respondent No.4 has given the clearance after duly considering the requirements

and the recommendations of the respondent No.5 and the issue raised in this regard

is baseless.

<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">         (v) The appellant has stated the old history of the Fort St.George premises

and the details regarding housing of Legislature Assembly, Ministers' office and the

various departments of the secretariat. The reason that the proposal to build a

Block-A building in Omandhurar Government Estate included severe space

constraint at the Fort St.George and the need to bring all the important arms of the

Government under one roof is totally false, as after completion, majority of the

departments continued to work from Fort St.George only. There is no space

constraint at all for any of the Government departments or wings to continue

operating from Fort St.George and all the averments regarding necessity of a new

secretariat building due to space constraint are denied as false. All the departments

including Legislative Assembly Secretariat have been accommodated in the

Secretariat Buildings situated at Fort St.George and no complaint either from the

public or from the staff regarding insufficient accommodation or health hazard has

been reported so far.      Hence, there is no merit in the averment made by the

appellant. The appellant has mentioned about the cases filed in the High Court of

Madras related to the building in question, which were dismissed by the Madras High

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">         (vi) The Government have taken a policy decision by taking into consideration

all the relevant facts and the interest and welfare of the public. The policy decision is

neither arbitrary or illegal nor does it violate any Constitutional rights of any persons.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                          16</span>


The Block-A building in Omandhurar Government Estate, Chennai was inaugurated

in March 2010 without completing the works fully. Without completing the

construction, a few departments were hastily shifted to the new building in question

along with the offices of the Chief Minister and all Ministers. Only six departments

were shifted to that building and remaining departments continued to function from

the Secretariat at Fort St.George. Keeping the departments from the existing

Secretariat building at one place and shifting the offices of the Ministers and a few

departments alone to the building in question had caused unnecessary

administrative hardships and inconvenience to the public. Therefore, the

Government have decided to continue to function from the Secretariat at Fort

St.George. This point was mentioned in the Legislative Assembly by His Excellency

the Governor of Tamil Nadu on 03.06.2011 in his address, which was endorsed by

the legislature while passing the Motion of Thanks to the address of His Excellency

the Governor. Now, these departments have also been shifted back to Fort

St.George and all the departments are functioning at Fort St.George. The Legislative

Assembly has been conducting its sessions at the Fort St.George since May 2011.


</p><p id="p_40">      (vii) The change of policy was due to the departments already re-located in

the new building had been facing severe hardships and due to incomplete civil

works and inadequate infrastructure facilities including non-functional elevators.

These departments were also required to reach out to the advisory departments like

Finance, Law, and Personnel and Administrative Reforms which continued to be

functioning in the Fort St.George campus and as such, the departments in both the

buildings in question and the existing Secretariat complex were facing great

hardships in the day-to-day functioning of the Government machinery, causing

serious dislocation in the delivery system as well as untold suffering among the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                            17</span>


public. The location of the key departments like Home, Public in a separate building

was against the settled principle of co-ordination of logistics of Government and the

incomplete structure and ongoing civil works also posed safety and security

concerns. To remedy the problem and in larger public interest, it was necessary to

shift back the departments forthwith from the new Secretariat building to the Fort St.

George campus and orders were issued shifting the Government offices functioning

in the building in question at Omandhurar Government Estate, Chennai-2 to the Fort

St. George premises, Chennai-9. When the matter was placed before the Cabinet for

a decision which met on 19.08.2011, after detailed discussions decided:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (i)    To utilize Block-A of the newly constructed complex at Omandhurar

             Government Estate as a Multi Super Specialty Hospital.

</p><p id="p_42">      (viii) The appellant has narrated about the Writ Petition No.19314 of 2011 filed

by him before the Hon'ble High Court of Madras against the policy decision of the

Government of Tamil Nadu, which was subsequently dismissed by the High Court

with a direction to the respondents (Government) that the representation of the writ

petitioner dated 22.08.2011 shall be looked into and appropriate decision could be

taken at the earliest. With the above direction, the Writ Petition was closed by the

High Court. The direction of the Court was duly complied with by the Government by

sending a reply letter dated 08.12.2011.

High Court of Madras in W.P.No.30326 of 2011 and in the said writ petition, a

Division Bench of the High Court, Madras heard the counsel of both sides lastly from

17th to 19th of July 2012. After hearing the arguments of both sides, the Hon'ble

Division Bench reserved the judgment. The W.P.No. 30326 of 2011 came up on

27.07.2012 and the Division Bench had delisted and placed the matter before the

Hon'ble Chief Justice for posting the above said writ petition before the appropriate

Bench. As such the matter is pending adjudication and the appellant having raised

the same issue before the Hon'ble High Court ought not to have troubled this

Hon'ble Tribunal for repeat of the same proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">      (x) The earlier Environmental Clearance for the construction of the building

complex at Omandhurar Government Estate, Chennai was accorded by the State

Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SIEAA) vide letter dated

20.10.2008, wherein it has been clearly stated in Part-B General Conditions para 2

that "in the case of any change(s) in the scope of project, a fresh appraisal by the

SEIAA shall be obtained." The Government of Tamil Nadu have approached the

SEIAA, to obtain Environment Clearance. The SEIAA has granted Environmental

Clearance to the project proposal for change/modification of the Block-A building in

question into Multi Super Specialty Hospital (MSSH) in the Letter No.

</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">      (xi) The appellant has questioned the Authority's powers in issuing a revised

Environment Clearance for the same building. As already mentioned the SEIAA is a

duly constituted authority under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a> and has the

powers to issue or modify the Environment Clearance given by it. There are many

instances where such clearance is given. The State Environment Impact

</p><p id="p_51">          (xii) The Environmental Clearance given by the SEIAA is a statutory order

by a legally constituted body by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,

Government of India. The Environment Clearance given in 2008 to the building in

question, which is proposed to be converted into Multi Super Specialty Hospital is

subject to certain general conditions and one among the conditions is that in the

case of any change(s) in the scope of the project, a fresh appraisal by the SEIAA is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                            20</span>


to be done. That is what has now been done by the SEIAA. The applicant has

raised all these issues before the Hon'ble Madras High Court and as such cannot

reiterate on the same again before this Tribunal and the appellant is abusing the

process of law with vested interest and ulterior motive. The allegation made by the

appellant that only the Central Agency Authority has got power to give environmental

clearance and the State Agency doesn't have such competency to do so is

farfetched and without any basis. The allegation made by the appellant clearly shows

that the intention of the appellant is to somehow stall the coming of the Multi Super

Specialty Hospital which will be beneficial for the people especially the poor and

downtrodden.
</p>
<p id="p_52">          (xiii) As per the National Building Code, 2005, the building proposed to be

converted into Multi Super Specialty Hospital is categorized as Group D and

whereas the Hospitals are categorized as Group C1 with reference to fire and safety.

As the building in question has been constructed with higher factors of safety than

the hospital building in such aspects, the same can be converted as a hospital with

minimum modification and lesser cost. The norms fixed in the National Building

Code, 2005 for both the buildings are similar except for the variance in static water

storage capacity from 1 lakh litres to 1.5 litres. However, the static water storage

tank provided for the structure in question is for a total capacity of 8.02 lakh litres of

which two compartments of 2.42 lakh litres and 2.70 lakh litres are meant for fire

safety measures and the remaining 2.90 lakh litres for utility purposes. Therefore, the

fire safety measures as laid out in National Building Code 2005 have very much

been complied with. As regards the structural design, loads, forces and effects, the

building proposed to be converted into a Multi Super Specialty Hospital is designed

for an imposed load of 4 KN/Sq.m. The loading standards as per IS 875-(Part 2)

1987 (reaffirmed 2008), the imposed loads in respect of the building in question is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                            21</span>


3KN/Sq.m for office rooms and that for institutional buildings viz., Hospital buildings,

the standard imposed loading is 2KN/Sq.m in respect of wards and 3KN/Sq.m in

respect of X-ray rooms and operating rooms. The building in question, which is

proposed to be converted into Multi Super Specialty Hospital has been designed and

constructed for an imposed (Live) load of 4KN/Sq.m (inclusive of light partitions of

1KN/Sq.m), which is very much above than the required imposed load of the hospital

building as per the Bureau of Indian Standards.         As regard the pre-fabrication

systems lighting, air-conditioning, acoustic and sound insulation and noise control

etc., the existing provisions already available in the building in question can be used

for the proposed Multi Super Specialty Hospital also with minor alterations which are

feasible in the light of latest technological improvement and as such is not at all an

issue.
</p>
<p id="p_53">          (xiv) In the existing building there are 17 lifts, of which 2 are service/goods

lifts. It is proposed to modify the 14 passenger lifts into bed-cum- passenger lifts,

without any structural changes to the lift shaft conforming to IS 14665 of Bureau of

Indian Standards Specification.    As regards the water supply and drainage, and

sanitation, the conversion work involves only minimum modifications as per the

requirements conforming to the hospital building and technically feasible,          The

conversion proposal has been formulated taking into consideration of all the

requirements of a Multi Super Specialty Hospital in every minute detail, i.e, with

reference to the mandatory statutory provisions/regulations and as well as functional

requirements and the important modification works include provision of operation

theatres, ramps, medical gas lines, central service,          sterilization department,

conversion of passenger lifts into passenger cum bed lifts and additional toilets.

Therefore, the present construction, namely Block-A will be utilized without any

structural demolition/damage by adaption/modification as aforesaid. The needs of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                            22</span>


patients, medical personnel, paramedics and visitors have been taken care of while

proposing the modifications to the building for which Government have given

administrative sanction. The modified design takes into account the requirement of

sterility which will help to minimize infection in the operation theatres, post operative

wards, intensive care units, etc., The additional needs for patient amenities such as

lifts, toilets etc., as well as administrative requirements such as nursing stations will

also be provided as part of the modifications to the existing buildings.          These

modifications have been arrived at in consultation with the Experts Committee of

specialists, hospital administrators of various private and public hospitals in Chennai

by architectural wing of the Public Works Department which has much experience in

design and construction of large Government hospitals. Before the design was

made, a team of doctors and architects visited some of the best known institutes like

All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, Post Graduate Institute of

Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh and Sri Sathya Sai

Institute of Higher Medical Sciences in Puttaparthi to adopt the design of the present

building to modern standards of Super Specialty Hospital.           Many Government

hospitals which were constructed earlier have subsequently been provided with

central oxygen, central suction in the needy areas viz., all operation theatres, pre

and post operative wards, intensive care units etc., which show that it is feasible to

equip existing buildings with such facilities and the same has been proposed here.

</p><p id="p_54">          (xv) It is not correct to say that the needs of a Secretariat and the hospital

building are at complete variance with one another and a building designed for one

purpose cannot be modified to suit the purposes of the other.           Both office and

hospital buildings have some common requirements such as good ventilation,

lighting, ambience, fire extinguisher needs, lifts, toilets etc., Even when there are

additional requirements, architectural re-design/re-arrangement is feasible and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                            23</span>


possible. In this country, many buildings, which have been donated to Government,

have been converted as hospitals, which are functioning well with all facilities and

cater to all walks of patients.     In the private sector also, there are examples of

existing buildings successfully being converted as multi specialty hospitals.

Therefore, there is no difficulty in converting the buildings in the 'A" Block of

Omandhurar Government Estate as a Multi Super Specialty Hospital to cater to the

health needs of the poor public.
</p>
<p id="p_55">          (xvi) The Environment Impact Assessment Notification S.O.1533, dated

14th September 2006 has categorized the list of project activities, for which

Environmental Clearance (EC) is required, into 8 types of projects or activities.

Project or Activity items 1 to 7 apply to specific project activities like industrial

projects, infrastructure including environmental services like Industrial Estates, Ports,

Harbours, Highways, Common Effluent Treatment Plants, and Common Multiple

Solid Waste treatment facilities, service sectors like oil and gas transportation

pipelines and isolated storages for handling chemicals. The project or activity item

No.8 is only for Building/Construction/Area Development projects, irrespective of the

activities proposed in those structures/areas. Item No.8 (a) refers to building and

construction projects which are more than 20,000 sq.m but less than 1, 50,000 sq.m.

The environmental clearance is given based on the impact assessment of the actual

construction project irrespective of the nature of usage of the building.         These

projects include commercial buildings, educational institutions, housing construction,

hospitals and all such construction projects.        A reading of the Environmental

Clearance given for the building in question which is proposed to be converted in to

Multi Super Specialty Hospital will make it clear that the focus of the clearance is on

the actual construction during the construction phase and the use of the building

during the operation phase.        In as much as the construction of the building in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                            24</span>


question is already completed, the present proposal of the Government involves only

minor modifications relating additional facilities for water, biomedical waste disposal,

energy etc., The structure of the building is not being modified and as such, the

present modification is in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">       (xvii) One of the specific conditions given at the time of Environment

Clearance in October, 2008 by the SEIAA was that the consent to establish shall be

obtained from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and a copy shall be furnished

to the SEIAA, Tamil Nadu before taking up any construction activity at the site.

Subsequent to this, the TNPC Board gave consent to establish vide its proceedings

dated 10.11.2008 under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>s. Once the project proponent completes

the project, he has to apply to the TNPC Board for Consent to Operate. At the time

of giving such consent, the TNPC Board ensures that all the conditions stipulated at

the time of grant of Environment Clearance and Consent to Establish are properly

carried out by the project proponent. In this case, though the Consent to Establish

was given in 2008, no Consent to Operate was obtained for the building in question

to be used as the new Legislative Assembly Complex at the time when it was put

into operation in April 2010. For the present proposal to utilize the building as a Multi

Super Specialty Hospital-cum-Medical College, the suitable modifications in the

Environmental Clearance have been issued by the 4 th respondent after considering

all the aspects. There is no chaos or confusion as alleged by the appellant and he is

trying to confuse that the proposal is not for fresh construction or development of the

area but only for conversion of the existing building. The Environmental Clearance

dated 16.05.2012 has been given after fresh appraisal and clearance as per the laid

down procedure of the environment notification and in accordance with law. The

appellant has, admittedly, no issues when the 1 st environmental clearance was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                            25</span>


obtained from the same authority and suddenly after formation of the new

government, when fresh appraisal and clearance as per the provisions and in

accordance with law was obtained by the respondent, is raising the frivolous

objections on vague and baseless grounds. The appellant, knowing fully well that

the Hon'ble Madras High Court has rejected the prayer objecting to the shifting of the

Assembly from the building in question to the Fort St.George and to establish a Multi

Super Specialty Hospital, has come out with a novel method of once again agitating

the same issue in different forum. The appellant, all along has been raising frivolous

and vexatious objections and is somehow, bent upon to stall the progress and this

regular interference of the appellant is politically motivated. By this, the appellant is

preventing the coming up of a Multi Super Specialty Hospital and Modern Medical

College useful for the common man for whom the specialty hospital is out of reach.

This Government is striving for the upliftment of poor and downtrodden and the

common man have the best treatment for their ailments. The appellant has not

made out a prima facie case nor is the balance of convenience in favour of the

appellant. The present appeal is motivated, frivolous, vexatious and as such without

any merits. Ultimately the public interest is suffering because of the vested interest

of the appellant. The appeal has to be rejected in limine at the threshold as it is a

clearly an abuse of process of law.

Environmental Clearance from the concerned regulatory Authority (MoEF) for the

project falling under category A in the schedule and the SEIAA for the projects falling

under category B in the said schedule. The proponent, the Superintending Engineer,

PWD has made an application in the prescribed form to SEIAA for getting EC for the

project "Construction of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Complex in Chennai" at

Omandhurar Government Estate, Chennai on 30.09.2008.                 The proposal was

held on 10th, and 11th October, 2008 on the basis of the mandatory documents

enclosed with the application in Form I, Form I-A, conceptual plan and REIA report.

The SEAC, after due consideration of the relevant documents, has recommended to

SEIAA, Tamil Nadu for issuing EC to Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly project. The

proposal was considered by SEIAA, Tamil Nadu in its meeting held on 15.10.2008

category. It does not require public consultation as per para 7(i) as per para 7(i) III

Stage (3) (d) and 3(e) "Public Consultation" of EIA Notification 2006. The General

Condition is not applicable to the projects/activities mentioned under item 8 of the

schedule of the EIA Notification 2006 and no condition has been stated under the

column No.5 (condition if any) of the schedule of the Notification for the project or

condition is not applicable to the projects categorized under item No.8 of the

schedule of the notification and the projects in item No.8 are to be appraised at State

level by the SEIAA/SEAC. The SEAC and SEIAA constituted as per EIA Notification

dated 4.09.2006 are both responsible and competent for appraising the projects on

the basis of the possible impacts on the environment due to the project and the

mitigation measures proposed to be adopted to safeguard the environment. As such

the activity of changing/modifying the TNLA into MSHH is not covered under general

the light of the above, the proposal was appraised by the SLEA Committee in its

meeting held on 11.05.2012, on the basis of the mandatory documents enclosed

with the application and in consideration of the contents of the petitioner/advocates.

The SEAC, after due consideration of the relevant documents submitted by the

issued to the effect that the proponent, shall cause through the State Government

declaration of the Hospital area as "No Horn Zone" and provide necessary sign

boards preferably at vantage positions in all adjoining roads, in such a way that the

sign boards are visible both in day and night. The vehicles should be sparingly

operated that too at minimum speed inside the premises to avoid noise and dust

correct to state that the project proponent cannot change the nature or use of the

project having once obtained EC. Under EIA Notification such change of use is

permitted subject to obtaining a fresh EC. In such cases, the first EC would operate

in relation to the construction of the buildings etc., and the second EC would govern

the nature of use and change of use, if permitted. Hence he has prayed that the

</p><p id="p_74">       The respondents have followed the required formalities and the procedures

enunciated in law and only after careful consideration granted the Environmental

Clearance. The plot area and built up area for the Multi Super Specialty Hospital

remain the same as it was for the Legislative Assembly.         It is only the internal

partitions and modifications which are done to convert the floors suitable for

operating hospital. The PWD tender issued was only in respect of construction of

ramps and other modifications within the building The existing building is to be

converted as a Multi Super Specialty Hospital and as such there was no further

expansion or construction activity, apart from construction of ramp inside the building

for the purpose of moving handicapped and critical patients using wheel chairs and

stretchers.   All other items in the tender notification pertain to the internal

modification and conversion of each floor in the building for the usage of hospital

wards, operation theatres etc., The Form 1 has been filled carefully and in

accordance with the requirements and its relevancy.        The petitioner is trying to

interpret the details of the Form 1 to suit to his vested interest and misrepresenting.

All the respondents have carefully considered each and every aspect and the

Environmental Clearance issued is in accordance with law. The application has

been properly filled with all the required details and only after satisfying the same,

the authorities have proceeded to give Environmental Clearance on 16.05.2012.

The petitioner is trying to interpret the details given in the application to suit his

frivolous allegations. The material produced by the petitioner before this Tribunal in

type set V filed by him is in respect of the Environment Management for health care

facilities pertaining to Germany and is not applicable to our country. The Tribunal is

well aware that each place in terms of its own climatic and weather conditions has

respective methods of Environment Management.           The petitioner cannot go on

adducing fresh grounds as after thoughts and will have to restrict himself to what he

had objected to before the 4th and 5th respondent and what he has stated in his

appeal. Severe hardships and prejudice would be caused to the respondent if the

petitioner continues to abuse the process of law and as such, it is affecting the noble

cause of the Government for operationalizing Multi Super Specialty Hospital in

after fulfilment of all the required statutory norms.

appeal and the additional grounds put forth by the appellant herein and the counter

submitted by the respondents 1 to 3 and all other materials placed before the

Tribunal by both sides. The following points for determination have been set out for

arguments on these by the counsel for the appellant and the respondents after the

preliminary pleadings.

<p id="p_77">
Ii)     Whether this appeal is maintainable in view of the W.P. No. 30326 of

        Court of Madras;
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">(ii)    Whether the grant of environmental clearance by the Tamil Nadu

        Environmental Impact Assessment Authority is violative of law since the

        assessment for making such a grant lies with the Central Government,

        Ministry of Environment and Forests as alleged by the Appellant;


</p><p id="p_80">(iii)   Whether the environmental clearance applied and granted for the second

        time is against law since the Environmental Clearance was already

        granted for a different and specific project and also when the

        Environmental Notification 2006 does not permit any conversion from the

        original scope of the project or activity as alleged by the Appellant;

</p><p id="p_81">(iv)    Whether the grant of Environmental Clearance has to be set aside since it

        is based on the Impact Assessment given by the State Environmental

        Impact Assessment Authority which did not consider all the necessary

        environmental parameters for conversion of the Secretariat into Multi

        Super Specialty Hospital-cum-Medical College;

</p><p id="p_83">v)      Whether the Environmental Clearance given on 16.5.2012 in letter No.

        SEIAA/TN/EC/8(a)/ 120/F.455/2012 by the 4th Respondent is liable to be

        set aside on all or any of the grounds mentioned in the appeal.


        During the arguments the following additional points were raised:


</p><p id="p_84">(i)    Whether the appellant is an aggrieved person who can maintain the

       appeal under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_5">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010.

</p><p id="p_85">(ii)   Whether the appeal is not maintainable as it does not fall under any one of

       the grounds envisaged under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_6">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010.


</p><p id="p_86">             7. As could be seen above, the appellant has filed this appeal under

</p>
<p id="p_88">
</p><p id="p_89">       (i) After the General Elections to the Tamil Nadu Assembly held in the year

2006, the then Chief Minister made an official announcement that a new building

complex would be constructed at the Omandhurar Government Estate, Anna Salai,

Chennai to house the Legislative Assembly stating the reasons therefor. Following
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                          35</span>


the announcement in the year 2007, the State Government decided to build an

Assembly-cum-Secretariat complex in the said estate and the G.O.Ms.No.209,

Public Works Department, dated 04.07.2007 was issued to the effect. A tender

notification was floated and the tenders submitted were short listed. Three architects

were asked to submit their drawing and model. An expert committee conducted an

analysis and selected a company for rendering architectural services for designing

the New Legislative Assembly-cum-Secretariat building. Another committee of

Secretaries was constituted to advise the Chief Engineer (Buildings), Public Works

Department on space requirements and other facilities to be provided in the

proposed building. A scheme designed for Block A and Block B was approved.

After deliberations, it was decided to construct the Legislative Assembly-cum-

Administrative office. The State Government entered into an agreement with the

said company.      An application was made seeking approval of the Chennai

Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) for the construction of the Assembly

building. As per the Environmental Notification, 2006, the Superintending Engineer,

Public Works Department, applied for the Environmental Clearance to the State

Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).          The proposal was

procedurally appraised by the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SLEAC) and

the Environmental Clearance was issued by the said SEIAA, in which the

project/activity was shown as "Legislative Assembly-cum-Secretariat Project." With

the decision to construct two blocks, Block A and Block B, the construction process

started.   The construction of the A Block was completed and the B Block was

commenced. The Legislative Assembly was officially inaugurated by the Hon'ble

Prime Minister of India on 13.03.2010. Four Assembly Sessions were held in A

Block of the said complex. The 4th session was held in February 2011. In the

Assembly Elections held in the year 2011, AIADMK party came to power. Following

which were originally shifted from Fort St.George to New Assembly Complex were

transferred to Fort St.George complex.

W.P.No.19011 of 2011 before the High Court of Madras, wherein the High Court

made an order closing the writ petition since no further adjudication was necessary

except the representation of the appellant dated 22.08.2011 should be looked into

and appropriate decision be taken at the earliest. While the matter stood thus, the

Cabinet of the State Ministry decided to utilise the Block A of the newly constructed

complex as Multi Super Specialty Hospital and Block B for starting a new

Government Medical College. Pursuant to the same, an application along with Form

I A was submitted before the 5th respondent (SEIAA) herein on 12.04.2012 and after

appraisal, the minutes recorded in its meeting held on 11.05.2012 was sent to the 4 th

respondent (SEAC) on 12.05.2012. On receipt of the report of the appraisal, the 4 th

respondent issued the proceedings dated 16.05.2012 granting the Environmental

Clearance for the purpose of the Multi Super Specialty Hospital, which is the subject

matter under challenge in this appeal.

</p>
<p id="p_128">
</p><p id="p_129">               14. A combined reading of the preamble and also the above provisions

would indicate that a vast jurisdiction is vested on the Tribunal to decide the

environmental disputes in order to enforce the legal rights relating to environment

and give compensation for damages to persons and property and for matters

connected therewith and incidental thereto including conservation of natural

resources.
</p>
<p id="p_130">
</p><p id="p_131">               15. Advancing arguments on behalf of the respondents, the respective

learned Senior Counsel would contend that the appellant did not have any locus

standi to file the above appeal before the Tribunal, since he is not a person aggrieved

in the terms of the provisions of the NGT Act and there is no allegation in the appeal

that the appellant is representing a community at large apart from saying that he is a

public spirited person; that there is no allegation that the hospital if started

functioning, would affect the interest of the public at large or likely to be affected by

the environmental consequences, especially when the hospital has not commenced

its functions; that not only the appellant has not shown himself as an aggrieved
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                           43</span>


person, but also has no cause of action to file this appeal; that the appellant has not

shown any substantial question relating to the environment as envisaged under

Section 2(1)(m) of the NGT Act; that the appeal itself is another attempt of various

and repeated frivolous cases filed by the appellant to stall the hospital and in that

view, the appellant from the very beginning was objecting to any activity of the

present Government and that so long as the appellant is unable to show that he is an

aggrieved person, the appeal has got to be rejected as not maintainable.


</p><p id="p_132">             16. In answer to the above, the learned Senior Counsel for the

appellant pointing to Section 18(2)(e) of the NGT Act, would submit that any person

aggrieved including any representative body or organisation can file an appeal before

the Tribunal and hence it cannot be stated that only a person representing a

particular community, alone could file an appeal; that the right to have environmental

protection is a right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_44">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, since it

touches upon the right to life and under such circumstances, even a single citizen of

the country can agitate for his or her right under a prescribed due procedure of law;

that the State shall also protect the environment as per the directive principles of

State Policy <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_45">Article 48A</a> and hence it would be clear that when the requirements

made in the environmental laws are not complied with either by the State or by the

authorities constituted for the said purpose, any aggrieved person can approach the

forum available under the NGT Act; that in the instant case, the appellant from the

very inception has raised his objection before the respondents, which were neither

accepted nor even considered and thus, the appellant clearly falls within the meaning

of the person aggrieved and can well maintain the present appeal; that the appellant

is a bonafide litigant and he has been pursuing his remedy in the forums available

under law so as to get appropriate remedy; that he was a party to the process of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                           44</span>


proceedings in granting EC; that when his bonafide request to protect the

environment was negatived by the authority, quite natural, the appellant as an

aggrieved person has filed the present appeal; that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its

judgment dated 31.1.2013, clearly observed that the appellant is a public spirited

person and a practising advocate of the High Court of Madras; that his grievance

could be agitated before different forum and it can go on; that the judgment of the

Supreme Court would clearly indicate that the pending proceedings in Appeal

No.31/2012 before this Tribunal, can go on and thus, there cannot be any

impediment in dealing with the present appeal filed by the appellant as an aggrieved

person.
</p>
<p id="p_133">
</p><p id="p_134">             17. After considering the submissions made and looking into the

relevant Rules and provisions afore stated, the Tribunal is of the considered opinion

that the appellant can maintain an appeal as an aggrieved person.


</p><p id="p_135">             18. A reading of <a href="/doc/145971700/" id="a_46">Section 2(j)(i)</a> to (viii) would make it clear that an

individual, a Hindu undivided family, a company, a firm, an association of persons or

a body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, any trustees of a trust, a local

authority and every artificial juridical person, not falling within any of the preceding

sub-clauses would include person who can maintain an application/appeal under the

NGT Act. It is contended by the respondents' side that the persons so defined under

the above provisions as person should be either aggrieved or injured directly or

indirectly in order to make an application or an appeal. Hence a question would arise

whether in the environmental matters, a person in order to approach the Tribunal by

making an application or an appeal, should show himself as an aggrieved person. A

combined reading of the above provisions would make it abundantly clear that any

person whether he is a resident of that particular area or not or whether he is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                            45</span>


aggrieved and/or injured or not, can approach the Tribunal. We have to find out what

was the true intention and the motive of the appellant to prefer the appeal in

question.
</p>
<p id="p_136">
</p><p id="p_137">              19. It is not in controversy that the appellant is a practising lawyer in the

High Court of Madras and also a resident in the said place. From the records, it is

made out that even during the pendency of the application made before the Appraisal

Committee, he made his objections by way of representation and the same was

brought to the notice of the Division Bench of the Hon'ble High Court in

W.P.No.19314/2011, where there was a direction to the Committee to look into the

representation. Even after the grant of EC, the appellant made W.P.30326/2011

before the High Court of Madras and on the dismissal of the same, he preferred

S.L.P. before the Apex Court. The Apex Court in its order dated 31.1.2013 in Special

Leave to Appeal (Civil) Nos.5251 to 5256/2013 has observed as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">            "In the present case, we do not find such a ground

            available to the petitioner, who appears to be a public

            spirited citizen as well as an Advocate of the Madras High

            Court. In our view, the reliefs sought by the petitioner in

            the writ petition have to be pursued in some other forum

            where the subject matter of the complaints of the petitioner

            can be gone into."</blockquote><p id="p_138">
</p><p id="p_139">              20. In the matters of environmental cases, where great damage or

danger to environment and ecology is apprehended, any individual or persons or

body of individuals can agitate as to the correctness of the study of the environment

and ecology and the appraisal made by the granting authority. Mere assertion by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                           46</span>


respondents that the appellant is not an aggrieved person or injured person and

hence the appeal is not maintainable would not suffice unless the respondents are

able to demonstrate materials to doubt the bonafide or the credentials of the

appellant.   Thus, the only ground for treating an appeal or application as not

maintainable could be a matter which falls beyond the seven Acts as notified in

Schedule I of the NGT Act. If it is shown that the appeal is an outcome of malafide or

a vexatious litigation, the appeal can be rejected. Though not the appellant is able to

show that he is affected directly or indirectly at present, he himself has shown as an

interested person in the environment and ecology. According to the appellant, if the

project in question is launched, without taking proper precautions, it would cause

health hazardous and danger to society. The Tribunal has already taken its view that

the person aggrieved in environmental matters must be given a liberal interpretation

and it requires flexibility and hence in the considered opinion of the Tribunal, the

appellant is entitled to approach the Tribunal and the appeal is maintainable.


</p><p id="p_140">             21. Pointing to Section 16 of the NGT Act, learned Senior Counsel for

the respondents would vehemently urge that the appeal is not maintainable in view of

the provisions of NGT Act. Clause (h) of Section 16 of the NGT Act stipulates an

order granting environmental clearance in the area in which any industries,

operations or processes or class of industries, operations and processes shall not be

carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards under the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_47">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. As far as Clause (i) of Section 16 of NGT Act is

concerned, it is not applicable because it contemplates an appeal only against the

refusal to grant environmental clearance. Sections 14 and 15 of the NGT Act will not

be applicable to the present case, since the appellant cannot qualify his appeal under

the said provisions for the reason that there was no substantial question relating to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                           47</span>


environment which has arisen out the implementation of the enactments specified in

Schedule I of the Act. Equally <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_48">Section 15</a> will not also be applicable, as the appellant

is not entitled to any relief of compensation or any order under Section 15 of the NGT

Act and hence the appellant must be able to show that his appeal squarely lies under

<a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_49">Section 16(h)</a> of the Act. The appeal is not maintainable unless the appellant is able

to substantiate that the area where the subject complex is constructed, is a notified

area where such processes or activities shall not be carried out or can be carried out

with certain safeguards as per Environment (Protection) law. In the instant case, the

requirements of sub section (h) of Section 16 of the NGT Act have not been met.

The above provision under sub section (h) of Section 16 of NGT Act is a replica of

<a href="/doc/83271499/" id="a_50">Section 3(2)(v)</a> of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Rule 5 of the Environment

(Protection) Rules, 1986 prohibits location of industries and carrying on operations. It

also obliges the Government to impose prohibition only by way of notification. So far

as the location in question is concerned, no such notification has been issued and

hence the appellant cannot rest his appeal under <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_51">Section 16(h)</a> of the Act. The

statute does not provide for any appeal against the proceedings of the fourth

respondent dated 16.5.2012 granting Environmental Clearance. In the absence of

any provision of appeal for challenging the said proceedings, the appellant cannot

maintain the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_141">
</p><p id="p_142">             22. Placing reliance on the decisions of the Apex Court reported in

2010 (10) SCC 744 (paras 46 to 50 and 56 to 65); in 2010 (4) SCC 772 (paras 19,

27 and 29) and in 1973 (2) SCC 170 (para 31), learned Senior Counsel with vigour

and vehemence would submit that the appeal is a creature of the statute and the

appellant has no inherent right and the Tribunal with limited jurisdiction cannot go

beyond the procedure laid down by the statute for its functioning and if done, it would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                           48</span>


be acting without jurisdiction and hence the appeal has to be rejected as not

maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_143">
</p><p id="p_144">                23. Countering to the above contentions, learned Senior Counsel for

the appellant would submit that the appellant has to show that the appeal rests on

any one of the grounds envisaged under Section 16 of the NGT Act and in the instant

case, the appeal made by the appellant squarely falls under <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_52">Section 16(h)</a> of the Act.

<a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_53">Section 16(h)</a> deals with two parts (1) restricted areas and (2) shall be carried out

subject to certain safeguards under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_54">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. The

Central Government by its notification dated 14.9.2006, an elaborate one, notified

that any project or activity should be done in the manner in which it was stipulated in

that particular notification and hence <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_55">Section 16(h)</a> should be read along with the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_56">Environment (Protection) Act</a>. A bare reading of the said notification would reveal

that the restrictions envisaged in the said notification are applicable to all projects

and activities throughout India and hence it is equally applicable to the present

disputed area. It is not in doubt that the impugned EC falls within <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_57">Section 16(h)</a> of

the Act which is in respect of a prohibited area. Hence, the question whether the

disputed area is a restricted one or not does not arise. Rule 2(aa) of the Environment

(Protection) Rules, 1986, defines area which means area where hazardous

substances are handled. Admittedly, in the proposed project, handling of hazardous

substances is involved and hence it would automatically fall within the ambit of the

Acts and Rules. As far as the second part of <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_58">Section 16(h)</a> of the Act that the activity

should be carried out subject to certain safeguards under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_59">Environment

(Protection) Act</a> is concerned, it is the case of the appellant that Form I and Form IA

did not speak about the proper safety measures and they have not been adopted and

thus the appellant has a case and a grievance to put forth before the Tribunal.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                            49</span>


Hence it would be quite clear that the appeal made by the appellant squarely falls

under <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_60">Section 16(h)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_145">
</p><p id="p_146">                24. After considering the rival submissions made and also looking into

the relevant legal provisions, this Court is unable to agree with the contentions put

forth by the respondents. As rightly pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel for

the respondents, Sections 14 and 15 of NGT Act have no application to the present

factual position, though the appellant has mentioned those provisions in the appeal

grounds. As could be seen from the provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act, grant of

EC can be challenged only on either of the two grounds envisaged under <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_61">Section

16(h)</a> of the Act. While the challenge can be made against refusal to grant under

<a href="/doc/97889233/" id="a_62">Section 16(i)</a> of the Act, the grant of EC under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_63">Section 16</a> can be agitated in an

appeal firstly, if the environmental clearance is granted in the area in which

industries, operations and processes are prohibited and secondly, if the industries,

operations or processes, etc., shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards under

the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_64">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. As rightly pointed out by the learned Senior

Counsel for the appellant, Environmental Impact Assessment Notification dated

14.9.2006, an elaborate one, was issued in exercise of the powers conferred by sub

section (1) and Clause (v) of sub section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_65">Section 3</a> of the Environment

(Protection) Act, 1986 read with Clause (d) of sub rule (3) of Rule 5 of the

Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. It could be seen from the said Notification that

any project or activity should be done in the manner in which it is stipulated in that

notification.   Hence Section 16(h) of the NGT Act should be read along with

Environment (Protection) Rules as well as the said notification of 2006. Number of

restrictions are envisaged for different projects and activities. It is the case of the

appellant that the area in which the complex in question, is situated, is not fit for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                           50</span>


functioning of the Multi Super Specialty Hospital. Apart from that, according to Rule

2(aa) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, area means where the hazardous

substances are handled. Even Form I and Form IA put forth by the respondents for

EC would reveal that there is handling of hazardous substances which no doubt can

be carried out subject to certain safeguards under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_66">Environment (Protection) Act</a>. It is

pertinent to point out that Clause 15 of the impugned Environmental Clearance reads

that any appeal against environmental clearance shall lie with the National Green

Tribunal if preferred within 30 days as prescribed under Section 16 of the NGT Act. It

is evident that the authority which granted EC, has made it clear that appeal would lie

against the grant of EC before the Tribunal and hence it would not be proper on the

part of the respondents to state that appeal would not lie. All the above would clearly

indicate that the appeal made by the appellant would squarely fall within <a href="/doc/167697689/" id="a_67">Section

16(h)</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and hence the contentions put forth

by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondents that the appeal is not

maintainable since the appellant is not an aggrieved person and that the appeal does

not fall under any one of the grounds envisaged under <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_68">Section 16</a> of the Act have to

be rejected as devoid of merits.      Thus, the additional questions are answered

accordingly.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                     33. Addressing the Tribunal on the above questions, learned Senior

Counsel for the appellant would submit that it is not a fact in controversy that an

Environmental Clearance was applied for by the former State Government pursuant

to its decision and on appraisal of the report, Environmental Clearance was granted

by the very same authority for construction of a complex to house the Legislative

Assembly and the said Environmental Clearance is a valid one and the same is also

not challenged and while so, the Environmental Clearance applied for by the present
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                            57</span>


State Government and granted by the fourth respondent on the recommendation of

the fifth respondent is against law, since the EC granted originally to the former

Government was for a different and specific object and the Environmental Impact

Assessment Notification 2006 does not envisage EC for the second time and it does

not permit any conversion from the original scope of the project or activity. Pointing

to EIA Notification 2006, learned Senior Counsel would submit that the notification

sets out as to the restriction and prohibition on the new project or activities or on the

expansion or modernisation of the existing projects or activities based on their

potential environmental impacts as indicated in the Schedule of the notification. The

prior Environmental Clearance is contemplated before any construction or new

projects or activities or expansion or modernisation of the existing projects or

activities listed in the schedule are undertaken.     The notification has divided the

projects and activities into two categories, namely Category "A" and Category "B".

</blockquote><p id="p_181">The assessment authority either to grant the project or activity under Category "A" in

the case of Central Government, or to grant the project or activity under Category "B"

in the case of State Government, is independent. Even if the Central Government is

to undertake any project, it has to go before the authority for Environmental

Clearance as per the notification. The prior Environmental Clearance which would

mean and which is being used, is comprehensive for both building as well as

project/activity and hence the same cannot be allowed to be reissued or to be

amended or to be modified for a different project or activity as the change in project

was not at all contemplated or permitted in the EIA Notification. A reading of the

above notification makes it abundantly clear that a consideration of clearance by the

authority could be only for a vacant site before any construction work or preparation

of land by the project management is started for the project activity in cases of new

project.   Preamble to the notification makes it clear that the authority can give
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                            58</span>


environmental clearance for new project/activity relating to construction, which

includes the operation of a particular activity in the said building so constructed only

after the appraisal of SEAC at the State level and EAC at the Central level. Thus for

a new project, appraisal is possible only for vacant land and not for building. While

the entire notification contemplates a single comprehensive Environmental Clearance

for new projects or activities of construction and activities to be carried out during the

operational phase in the constructed building, it is not correct on the part of the

respondents to urge that an application for a fresh EC or amendment can be

entertained and it cannot but be a misconstruction of the notification. The notification

does not contemplate two separate Environmental Clearances separately for a

building and separately for the project or activity. Even in the guidelines, the Central

Government has clearly set out that there should be a site selection as the first step

in the process of obtaining Environmental Clearance.             In the case of prior

Environmental Clearance process, there is a concept of site location which is

mandatory and nowhere the clearance for a constructed building is contemplated.

While the notification contemplates change in the product mix, there is no provision

for change in product or activity after building is constructed or amendment for EC for

one project/activity and another after construction of building. Thus the notification

takes within itself the construction and operation of activity in the building so

constructed and hence even before beginning of a project or activity, appraisal is

made while there is a vacant site, applying various parameters which is the real

concept behind the authority which issued the notification. It is because of which,

prior site study is undertaken before venturing to such project or activity to see the

impact of the project or activity on the environment, habitats, water, land use, social

well being and developmental intensity. If the Environmental Notification does not

permit for a clearance after construction, the grant of the impugned second clearance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                            59</span>


dated 16.5.2012 after construction, was without jurisdiction and has to be set aside

as ab initio void. It is true that as claimed by the fourth respondent in their counter,

the Environmental Clearance dated 20.10.2008 has a Clause to the effect that in

case of any change(s) in the scope to approach a fresh appraisal by the SEAC shall

be obtained. If a meaningful interpretation is given, it would show that if there is a

change in the scope of the project before the construction is made, the proponent

can approach the authority and seek for a change in the project or activity and not

otherwise and this is because of which the Clause reads that a fresh appraisal by

SEAC shall be obtained. The EIA notification contemplates only for vacant site and

not otherwise. When EC was obtained and even before the construction is made, if

the project was sought to be abandoned due to any reason, only then, the proponent

can approach for another project or activity for fresh appraisal. A fresh appraisal can

be considered for any fresh project or activity in terms of EIA Notification only prior to

construction and the said interpretation would be within the scope of EIA Notification,

since that could be the real intention of Clause 2 of Part B conditions. In the instant

case, it is an admitted fact that on the date of Environmental Clearance, sought for by

the second respondent, there was already a constructed complex. The respondents

cannot take advantage of the Clause available in the earlier EC that they can come

for fresh appraisal, if there is any change of activity. Since there was already a

constructed complex, which was meant for a specific activity, the application for

second EC and the grant of the same are illegal and void. The interpretation made

by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondents on <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_69">Section 21</a> of the General

Clauses Act, was thoroughly incorrect and has no application to the present case,

since it is applicable to a case where a power is given under any Act or Regulation to

issue notification, orders, rules or by-laws. The fourth respondent being a regulatory

authority is a creature under the statute. It has no power to issue notifications,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                            60</span>


orders, rules or by-laws.    Thus, the issuance of the second EC by the fourth

respondent, while the first EC dated 20.10.2008 was valid and in force and available,

was without jurisdiction and void.
</p>
<p id="p_182">
</p><p id="p_183">              34. Stoutly opposing all the contentions put forth by the appellant's side,

learned Senior Counsel for the respondents would submit that the EC dated

20.10.2008 was issued in respect of the building complex for housing Legislative

Assembly and the construction was completed as per the EC. The present State

Government took a policy decision for the conversion of the said building for its

utilisation as Multi Super Specialty Hospital. An application along with a requisition

letter dated 12.4.2012 seeking revision of the earlier EC was made for amending and

modifying the conditions given in the EC dated 20.10.2008.              Accordingly, by

proceedings dated 16.5.2012, the respondents 4 and 5 after completing all the

required formalities and as per the procedure prescribed under law, modified and

altered the earlier EC conditions for the utility of the already constructed building as

multi super specialty hospital. The EIA Notification 2006 does not bar or prohibit any

conversion or change of utility of any building for which EC has been granted. It is

not correct to state that Environmental Notification 2006 does not permit any

conversion from the original scope of the project or activity as alleged by the

appellant, since there is no express bar or restraint either. Apart from that, EC can

be granted only for a building/project and not for an activity as contemplated in

Sl.No.8 of the Schedule to the EIA Notification 2006.        The activity of running a

Hospital or Assembly does not find a place in the Schedule to the EIA Notification

2006. The appellant has not challenged the EC dated 20.10.2008 and hence he

cannot challenge the proceedings dated 16.5.2012, since it is in continuation of the

earlier proceedings.   The EC proceedings dated 20.10.2008, was in respect of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                             61</span>


building project as contemplated in Sl.No.8(a) of the Schedule to EIA Notification and

the said building was complete and the construction phase has also attained finality.

The present proceedings under challenge pertain to the activity or usage which is

now permitted with certain modifications and amended conditions. Though the term

attached to it, might have been used as Environmental Clearance, but under no

circumstances, it can be construed as a second EC in law and it has to be read along

with EC dated 20.10.2008. When the EC dated 20.10.2008, was issued for housing

the Legislative Assembly, certain conditions were imposed and when the present

Government decided to change the activity and house a Multi Super Specialty

Hospital, the parameter and conditions required, were amended as per law. Hence

the contention of the appellant that if one clearance was there, then the other

clearance cannot be there was totally irrational and unreasonable as the earlier

clearance was in respect of the building and the present proceedings dated

16.5.2012, pertains to certain modified conditions in respect of the proposed change

in activity i.e., the use of the building as a Multi Super Specialty Hospital.


</p><p id="p_184">               35. Learned Senior Counsel took the Tribunal to the earlier proceedings

and the impugned proceedings and made a comparison of the same. He would

submit that the authorities only after the proper application of their mind modified the

earlier conditions to suit the proposed activity i.e., the change of utility.        The

modifications required were also only minor in nature.          It was an application for

amendment of modifications and conditions in relevance to the conversion of the

utilisation of the building and its impact on the environment and the same was

screened and appraised by the Appraisal Committee and considered by the

authorities.   Since they found that there were only minor modifications, the

parameters and conditions were modified as per the requirements of the utility of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                           62</span>


building for hospital, taking into consideration the impact it would have on the

environment. A considered reading of the proceedings dated 16.5.2012 as a whole,

would reveal that it was only in amendment of the conditions imposed earlier taking

into account the impact of the proposed activity/utility as hospital that would have on

the environment and thus the proceedings dated 16.5.2012, issued by the fourth

respondent to the second respondent is valid in law.
</p>
<p id="p_185">
</p><p id="p_186">              36. Admittedly, pursuant to the decision taken by the erstwhile State

Government to construct a complex consisting of Block "A" and Block "B" for

Legislative Assembly cum Secretariat Complex, they applied for Environmental

Clearance on 13.9.2008 and obtained EC dated 20.10.2008, for construction of the

said complex and the same was also granted after appraisal by the authorities. It is

an admitted position that pursuant thereto, "A" Block was completed at a cost of

approximately Rs.480 crore. It is also true that four Sessions of the Tamil Nadu

Legislative Assembly were held in that complex. The General Election 2011 brought

forth change in the Government and the present Government took a policy decision

for conversion of the said building into a Multi Super Specialty Hospital. It is not in

controversy that applications in Form 1 and Form 1-A were made. The same were

placed before the fifth respondent, the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee and

on its recommendations and report, the State Level Environmental Impact

Assessment Authority has issued proceedings dated 16.5.2012, which is the subject

matter of challenge in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_187">
</p><p id="p_188">              37. The Environmental Impact Assessment Notification 2006 makes it

mandatory the prior Environmental Clearance from the Central Government in the

Ministry of Environment and Forest for matters falling under Category "A" in the

Schedule and at the State level, State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                           63</span>


for matters falling under Category "B" in the Schedule before any construction work

or preparation of land by the project management except for securing the land is

started on the project or activity.     As per Clause 2 of the notification, prior

Environmental Clearance is required either under Category "A" or under Category "B"

for (i) all new projects or activities listed in the Schedule to this notification; (ii)

expansion and modernisation of the existing projects or activities listed in the

Schedule to the notification.... , and (iii) any change in product-mix in an existing

manufacturing unit included in Schedule beyond the specified range. Sub Clauses

</p><p id="p_189">(ii) and (iii) of the notification have no application to the present case, since sub

Clause (ii) is pertaining to the expansion and modernisation of the existing project or

activity and sub Clause (iii) is in respect of change in product-mix which is connected

to industry. Relying on Sub Clause (i) which reads all new projects or activities listed

in the Schedule to the notification, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant attacks

the proceedings of the fourth respondent dated 16.5.2012, as void since according to

him, it was a second Environmental Clearance applied for by the second respondent

and issued by the fourth respondent on the recommendation of the fifth respondent.

He would further add that in the case of a new project or activity, the application for

Environmental Clearance should be made before the construction is made in the site

and an inspection of the site by the authorities was mandatory and there could be

only one EC for both the construction and also the activity to be carried out in that

constructed building and in the instant case, the construction of "A" Block was

completed and the Environmental Clearance originally given, included the portion of

a particular activity in the said building so constructed and from the point of view of

the EC, it was a single comprehensive Environmental Clearance for the new project

and activities to be carried out. Attractive though the contentions put forth by the

learned Counsel for the appellant may be at the first instance, they do not stand the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                            64</span>


scrutiny of both law and the factual position in the instant case. The same cannot be

countenanced for more reasons than one.           Sub Clause (i) to Clause 2 of the

notification reads "all new projects or activities listed in the Schedule to the

notification".    It is not in controversy that the construction called "A" Block was

originally completed following the EC granted by the proceedings dated 20.10.2008.


</p><p id="p_190">                 38. Admittedly, the building and the construction projects fall under

Clause 8(a) of the Schedule annexed to the notification. A combined reading of sub

Clause (i) to Clause 2 and Clause 8(a) of the Schedule would make it clear that the

Environmental Clearance can be applied and granted only for a building/project and

not for an activity and hence the contention put forth by the learned Senior Counsel

for the appellant that the original Environmental Clearance which was applied for and

granted, was not only for a project/construction, but also for the Assembly activity

cannot be countenanced. Either the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification

2006 or any environmental law does not bar or prohibit the conversion or change of

utility of any building for which EC was already granted. The Schedule annexed to

EIA Notification 2006 does not speak about the activity in the building and

construction projects. If the case of the appellant that EC is for both building and

activity is accepted, then one cannot change his activity throughout, as the activity

may vary at a particular time. If there is any change in activity, it is for the authority

concerned to apply its mind and see that the building already constructed would be

suitable for the new activity on the point of environment. It is also pertinent to note

that the intention of the erstwhile Government was that the complex can be used for

any other purpose or activity, which is quite evident from the EC dated 20.10.2008,

giving liberty to the proponent to come for modification in case of change in activity.

Under such circumstances, there cannot be any impediment for change of the activity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                          65</span>


in the building and the construction project in respect of which EC was issued. It

remains to be stated that the appellant has not challenged or raised his little finger

against the EC dated 20.10.2008 in any one of the proceedings, and thus it remains

intact.
</p>
<p id="p_191">
</p><p id="p_192">             39. Assailing the proceedings of the fourth respondent dated 16.5.2012,

learned Senior Counsel for the appellant would submit that it was an Environmental

Clearance given for the second time and hence it is bad in law. This contention

cannot be accepted for more reasons than one. After taking a policy decision for

conversion of the building complex for using it as a Multi Super Specialty Hospital,

the second respondent sent a letter to SEIAA on 12.3.2012 which reads thus:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">          "....The Addendum to the existing REIA already submitted

          for Tamil Nadu New Legislative Assembly complex may

          please    be   appraised     and    necessary    Environmental

          Clearance for this new activity of Conversion of Block A

          building in Omandhurar Government Estate, Chennai- 2

          into Multi Super Specialty Hospital may please be accorded

          early."</blockquote><p id="p_193">
</p><p id="p_194">             40. Following the same, another communication was addressed on

12.4.2012 along with Form-1 and Form 1-A. The said letter reads:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">          ".... In this regard, a revised Addendum with Form-1,1A and

          Environmental Management plan are submitted for seeking

          revised Environmental Clearance for the above Multi Super

          Specialty Hospital project."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                            66</span><blockquote id="blockquote_26">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">              41. A reading of the above would indicate that the second respondent

has sought for revision of the earlier Environmental Clearance in respect of the new

activity of conversion of Block A building into multi super specialty hospital. So long

as the proceedings dated 20.10.2008, whereby EC was granted, continued to remain

in force and also attained finality, in respect of the building project as contemplated in

Sl.No.8 (a) of the Schedule to EIA Notification, the proceedings dated 16.5.2012,

seeking modification and amendment of the conditions originally imposed, cannot be

construed as a second clearance in law. Keeping the proceedings dated 20.10.2008

granting EC, aside, or giving up the same, the application of the second respondent

could not have been acted upon, which would be evident from the proceedings dated

16.5.2012 which pertains to the change in activity and utility of the building permitted

with certain modifications and amended conditions.</blockquote><p id="p_195">
</p><p id="p_196">              42. It is not in controversy that when EC dated 20.10.2008, was granted

for housing the Legislative Assembly, certain conditions were imposed taking into

consideration its impact on the environment. When the second respondent proposed

to change the activity and house a multi super specialty hospital, it applied for the

amendment in the parameters and conditions required for the new activity from the

environment point of view.     A comparison of the Environmental Clearance dated

20.10.2008, and the impugned proceedings dated 16.5.2012, would indicate that the

respective conditions varied from each other.        It is brought to the notice of the

Tribunal that in the earlier proceedings, the expression "construction and construction

phase" is used at various places, which did not find place in the later proceedings,

but refers only as alteration.    In Part A specific conditions, 24 conditions were

imposed in the construction phase of the Environmental Clearance dated

20.10.2008. But, they are found as 15 in the proceedings dated 16.5.2012. Insofar

as the other conditions in Part B, originally they were 9 in number and in the

impugned proceedings, they were increased to 15. The change in these conditions

would reflect the modifications and changes required in the Assembly building for its

utility as Multi Super Specialty Hospital and thus, it is quite evident that though it was

made in Form 1 and Form 1A, which was required for EC, it was only for amendment

and modification of the conditions and the impact it would have on the environment

and the same has been considered by the authorities. Form 1 reads thus:

second respondent and also the proceedings of the fourth respondent dated

16.5.2012 are the continuation of the earlier EC dated 20.10.2008. The application

was made by the second respondent in Form 1 and Form 1A, when no other format

is available for the purpose of amendment or modification of the conditions and

merely because the fourth respondent has termed it as Environmental Clearance, its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                              69</span>


proceedings dated 16.5.2012, cannot be construed as second Environmental

Clearance, but the continuation of the earlier EC dated 20.10.2008.


</p><p id="p_198">              44. QUESTION No.4:
</p>
<p id="p_199">
              Advancing the arguments on behalf of the appellant, the learned Senior

Counsel would submit that the Environmental Clearance dated 16.5.2012, has to be

set aside since it was based on the impact assessment given by SEIAA which did not

consider all the necessary environmental parameters for conversion of Secretariat

into Multi Super Specialty Hospital -cum- Medical College.            The EIA Notification

contemplates an application in the prescribed Form 1 and Supplementary Form 1A if

applicable, after the identification of the sites for the projects or activities for which EC

is sought for by the applicant.       The statutory format contains various statutory

queries, data, information, which are expected to be filled up and furnished by the

project proponents in Appendix-2. A specific Form 1A for construction projects listed

in Clause 8 of the Schedule and various requirements are given under different

heading 1 to 10 relating to environmental, social economic aspects, building

materials, energy, civil, environmental management etc.              Thus insofar as the

construction of building for a particular project is concerned, Appendix 2 makes it

clear that the project proponents are required to provide full information and whatever

necessary attach explanatory notes and management programme.                   The second

respondent has suppressed various material facts and has not given a true statement

for the proposed activity of conversion of Assembly building into that of a Multi Super

Specialty Hospital which includes demolition and construction. Thus there has been

a total distortion of truth in Form 1 and no true data/explanatory notes relating to the

construction phase which included demolition and reconstruction in or outside the

building and operational phase has been truly disclosed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                             70</span><p id="p_200">
</p><p id="p_201">              45. The learned Senior Counsel took the Tribunal to the information and

particulars furnished in Clauses 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 2.4, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1,

6.3, 7.1 and 8.1. According to him, all those particulars given therein constitute

suppression of various material facts and were not true statements and hence the

appraisal made on the basis of the same, cannot but be incorrect and it has got to be

set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_202">
</p><p id="p_203">              46. In answer to the above, it is contended by the learned Senior

Counsel for the respondents that there was no suppression of misrepresentation or

material facts in Form 1 application and there are no defects and mistakes and it is

nothing but false allegation.    The second respondent has stated all the relevant

information and the factual aspects and brought the same to the notice of the

respondents 4 and 5 for their appraisal. The contention of the appellant's side seems

to be only on the premise that it is a case of demolition and reconstruction, but that is

not so. The data in Column No.3 of Form 1, Appendix 1, found at page 1, makes it

very clear that the proposed project is a conversion of the Tamil Nadu New

Legislative Assembly Building into Multi Super Specialty Hospital in Omandurar

Estate, Chennai. The said conversion involves no alteration in the area and would

be same as the new TNLA building with the following area. It is also further added in

Sl.No.4 of Clause I that the conversion is with respect to the scope of the operation

and no area/structural changes are proposed. Sl.No.1.4 of Clause II Activity reads

that the project involves utilization of an existing newly built structure for TNLA where

all   necessary   pre-construction    investigations    have   been    carried   out   and

Environmental Clearance obtained.         Sl. No.1.5 reads that the project involves

utilization of an existing newly constructed building and no further construction

activities would take place and however, some minor modifications within the building
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                            71</span>


like change of room will be done in order to suit the hospital operations. Sl. No.1.6

reads that it is not applicable as no demolition works are envisaged. Thus from the

information furnished under different columns, it could be seen that no demolition or

construction was intended except some minor modification of the internal building

and hence the contention put forth by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant

that there were false information or misrepresentations cannot be countenanced.


</p><p id="p_204">              47. Much criticism was levelled by the appellant against the

respondents 4 and 5 authorities that there was thorough non-application of mind and

failure on their part to appraise the facts and information placed as required by the

statutory norms and rules and in that view also, the EC under challenge has got to be

set aside.    The second respondent was seeking EC for conversion of the

project/activity/operation i.e., from Assembly building to that of a multi super specialty

hospital. The Multi Super Specialty Hospital emanates various kinds of wastages like

biological waste, hazardous waste and radioactive waste. Since the details given by

the second respondent in the application submitted in Form 1 are false or misleading,

the SEAC appraisal cannot be correct, which has also resulted SEIAA clearance due

to non-application of mind.     The minutes of SEIAA dated 16.5.2012, does not

disclose anything about the construction.          However, in the clearance dated

16.5.2012, Part A Specific Conditions deal with construction phase. The applicant

has not given information regarding the handling of the hazardous substances and

consequent hazardous waste. The extent of the substance and waste to be handled

was not given in Form 1A or the explanatory note. Equally, the handling of radio-

active substances and the waste and the extent are not set out in the application in

Form 1A. Further, the handling of Hazardous substances from the construction phase

is also not set out. In this regard, the information given in Sl.Nos.3.1, 4.3 and 7.1 are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                           72</span>


all totally false and thus there is a deliberate suppression and withholding of factual

information about the handling of hazardous substances and materials and waste

generated during the construction phase and operation phase. When it is admitted

that hazardous waste are generated, the proponent should have set out as to how

those wastes could be handled and disposed of. But nothing was stated in that

regard. The management of mercury waste which is a hazardous one, is set out in

the Indian Public Health Standards Guidelines. The disposal and handling practice

should be in line with the requirement of Hazardous Waste Disposal Rules 2008, and

it cannot be mixed with the other biological and medical waste; but, it is not spelt out

in Form 1. So far as the radioactive substance and waste are concerned, nothing is

set out. The second respondent has not stated anything about the emission caused

due to anaesthetic gases, other emissions and emissions caused by hazardous

substances and waste and radioactive substances and waste. In their addendum,

the second respondent has stated about the demolition and construction works which

was to the tune of Rs.28 crore as per the tender notice dated 6.1.2012. But in Form

1, nothing is set out about the usage of water and generation of wastewater during

the construction phase. Hence Form 1 lacks entirely about the water utilised and

sewerage emanated during the construction phase. The Form does not set out water

consumed for running the canteen/restaurant in the hospital which is set out in the

plan. It is the case of the second respondent that 5000 persons will be utilising the

hospital, out of which 1000 will be outpatients, 500 beds with 1500 staff and 2000

visitors. Hence the canteen/restaurant usage should have been set out but not done

so. Even for the administration office shown in the plan, usage of water is not shown.

As per EIA Notification, a conceptual plan has to be submitted as set out in para 6 of

the notification, though there is a reference to the building plan to be submitted along

with Form 1. The cross-section of the building showing the rooms of the hospital was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                            73</span>


not submitted.     Hence the plan submitted by the second respondent is not in

accordance with the requirement of the notification. While the data and information

were false and incorrect, the fifth respondent has appraised the project with an undue

haste. The recommendation by the SEAC was made on 11.5.2012, and the EC was

issued on 16.5.2012, i.e., on the very day, when it was taken up for consideration.

The file did not contain the manner of appraisal and there is no indication of a

personal visit to the site and hence the EC has got to be set aside for furnishing false

and misleading information and misrepresentations on the part of the second

respondent and the non-application of mind on the part of the respondents 4 and 5 in

granting the EC.
</p>
<p id="p_205">
</p><p id="p_206">              48. Countering to the above contentions, learned Senior Counsel for

the respondents would submit that the appellant has not raised any ground in respect

of Form 1, 1A or Addendum either before the authorities or in the main appeal before

the Tribunal. The appellant at the time of arguments has filed additional grounds with

an attempt to build up a new case based on his own interpretations of the details

given in Form 1. The second respondent has not misrepresented or suppressed any

material fact in Form 1 application and has not filled the columns mechanically. The

application for modification was submitted on 12.4.2012, which was appraised by the

fifth respondent in its meeting on 11.5.2012 and thus it was in the hands of the fifth

respondent for a month for consideration.            Subsequently, the minutes dated

11.5.2012, was sent to the fourth respondent on 12.5.2012. They were received by

the fourth respondent on 14.5.2012 and the fourth respondent has issued the

proceedings dated 16.5.2012. Thus, the contention put forth by the appellant's side

that the fourth respondent has acted in haste and without any application of mind, is

factually incorrect, totally wrong and misleading.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                               74</span><p id="p_207">
</p><p id="p_208">                 49. As far as this contention is concerned, on perusal of the file

produced by the respondents at the time of hearing, it is quite evident that the

application was submitted by the second respondent to the fifth respondent on

12.4.2012 and it was pending in the hands of the fifth respondent for nearly one

month and minutes passed on 11.5.2012, was sent to the fourth respondent on

12.5.2012. The same was received on 14.5.2012 and the fourth respondent issued

the proceedings on 16.5.2012. Thus the matter was pending consideration in the

hands of the fourth respondent on three working days. In view of the same, no haste

either on the part of the fifth respondent or on the part of the fourth respondent could

be attributed.

there is no question of inspection of site that would arise and apart from that, the

inspection of site is not made mandatory under the notification. Along with Form 1A,

a plan has also been attached which would satisfy the filing of the conceptual plan as

required under the Rule.
</p>
<p id="p_211">
</p><p id="p_212">                 51. As regards the hazardous waste and other wastes, it is submitted

by the learned Senior Counsel for the second respondent that the biomedical waste

and hazardous waste will be handled as per the procedure enunciated in Bio Medical

Waste Management and Handling Rules, 1988 and the same is mentioned in Form

1A and no individual incinerator is proposed in the said building and it has proposed

to use the common incinerator which is located far away from the site, in

Kancheepuram District and hence, no question of emission or environmental

hazardous as put forth by the appellant, would arise and thus, there is no possibility

of air emission and all these parameters were followed and relevant compliance have

got to be done only after establishment of the hospital.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                              75</span><p id="p_213">

respondent that the argument put forth by the appellant's side regarding the traffic

that the second respondent cannot comply with the condition that no vehicles be

permitted within 100 meters of the hospital as the building is abutting Mount Road,

Wallajah Road and Sivananda Salai was baseless since the condition was amended

for creation of "no horn zone". According to him, the management of hazardous

waste, toxic substance, biomedical waste and the release of pollutions have all been

taken into consideration and required management plan has been detailed in Form 1

and 1A and under the environmental management plan.

Form 1A, the Tribunal is able to see that the appellant is able to point out some

mistakes in the data and particulars given in Form 1À and in certain defects in the

statement.     Unless and until deliberate concealment or submission of false or

misleading information or data, which is material to screening or scoping or appraisal

or decision on the application, is shown or noticed, the application and the appraisal

are not liable for rejection.

"B" Category project and activity, the proponent has to pass through the following

stages:-

though obtained modification and amendment of the conditions by the proceedings

dated 16.5.2012, has to necessarily apply for consent to operate. It is pertinent to

point out that the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority has

imposed conditions as evident from its proceedings dated 16.5.2012 which is under

challenge. The Pollution Control Board is the competent authority under The Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_70">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and The Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_71">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1984, to issue consent to operate and without satisfying

itself the required parameters for operating Multi Super Specialty Hospital, would not

give consent to operate. Merely for the technical non-compliance of procedure laid

down in EIA Notification, Environmental Clearance granted cannot be held illegal or

in breach of statutory provisions.   It has been held by the Bombay High Court in its

decision in <a href="/doc/1636380/" id="a_72">RAMBHAU PATIL V. MAHARASHTRA STATE ROAD</a> (2002 (1)

mentioning of the safeguards necessary for the said new project.              Thus the

application is only initiation of the entire process. It can only be a guide; but, it is

neither conclusive nor decisive on the project and cannot control the EC.           The

contents in Form 1 can only be one of the guiding factors, but they cannot bind either

of the Committees, Appraisal or Assessment.          The Appraisal Committee is an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                            78</span>


independent body consisting of experts from different fields and equally, the

Assessment Committee. They have to consider all available materials before taking

a decision to grant or to reject the request. They have to make an independent study

and decide the necessary parameters and safeguards for a given project. Thus the

EC is wisdom driven of the Members of the Committees and no doubt, it is not driven

by the data and particulars furnished by the proponent in the Forms alone. The

authority cannot base their decision on the application alone or the contents of the

Form.    After the application is made along with the safeguards stated by the

proponent in Form 1 and 1A, the Appraisal Authority at the time of appraisal, can add

number of safeguards necessary for the project. Even after the appraisal is placed

before the Assessment Authority, it can also include number of additional conditions

which would satisfy the ecological and environmental requirement.          All would be

clearly indicative of the fact that the application and even the appraisal report given

by the Appraisal Authority are only the stages and when it reaches the Assessment

Authority, it can add as many number of conditions required and thus in the entire

process, there are so many checks to satisfy the safeguards which the environment

would require. In the instant case, it is true that the appellant's side is able to point

out mistakes and even some deficiencies in the statement as to safeguards. From

the scrutiny of the entire materials on record, the Tribunal is of the considered opinion

that it cannot be stated that the Environmental Impact Assessment Authority suffered

from significant deficiencies or lack of information which resulted in recommendation

of the grant of the Environmental Appraisal Committee.

<p id="p_228">
</p><p id="p_229">              58. It is well settled that merely for technical non-compliance of the

quashed. It is pertinent to point out that it is not the case of the appellant that there is

any procedural violation in the present case and it is also not noticed by the Tribunal.

It is one thing to say that there is deficiency in the safeguards and another thing to

say that there is deficiency in the statement as to safeguards. What is all noticed in

the instant case is deficiency in the statement as to safeguards. The Tribunal is afraid

whether on the strength of those mistakes and deficiencies in making a statement of

the safeguards, the proceedings under challenge can be set aside as contended by

the appellant. But, at the same time, the Tribunal has to strike a balance between

the implementation of project, namely Multi Super Specialty Hospital, in public

interest, which would satisfy the medical need of the poverty stricken and

downtrodden and that too free of cost, on the one side and the environmental impact

that is likely to be caused by the functioning of the said hospital on the other. After

considering both, the Tribunal is of the considered opinion that it would suffice to

impose necessary conditions to be complied with by the proponent before

commissioning the hospital activities in order to satisfy the necessary parameters and

safeguards for running a Multi Super Special Hospital as we have done in the later

part of the judgment and it is also not necessary to quash the proceedings dated

16.5.2012 issued by the fourth respondent in favour of the second respondent which

would defeat a noble cause to serve public interest, that too in a case where no

grounds are made out by the appellant to set aside the same.

<p id="p_230">
</p><p id="p_231">              59. The contention of the appellant's side that the project, namely the

complex and its activity i.e., to run the New Assembly are coupled with each other

and inseparable and hence the said complex should not be used for any purpose

except for conduct of Assembly cannot be countenanced even for a moment in view

of the decision of the Division Bench of the High Court of Madras in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                             80</span>


W.P.No.19314/2011, whereby the request of the appellant for a writ of mandamus

directing the respondents 1 to 3 to resume the building maintenance and interior

works, continue the construction if any and complete the New Assembly cum

Secretariat Complex at Omanthurar Estate, was rejected and the same has become

final.   Apart from that, the proposal of the present Government to convert the

complex as Multi Super Specialty Hospital was upheld in W.P.No.30326/2011 etc., by

Division Bench of the High Court of Madras dated 24.1.2013. As pointed out by the

learned Judges of the High Court of Madras in the said WP, the proposed decision to

convert "A" Block building into multi super specialty hospital is per se in the interest of

the public and there is no Multi Super Specialty Hospital available in Chennai which

can be equated with AIEMS and the hospital will serve the medical need of the poor,

middle    classes   and   downtrodden     people    who    would    struggle   to   spend.

Subsequently, the said finding reached finality by SLP order dated 31.1.2013 made

by the Apex Court. The policies of the Government not to use the said complex for

the purpose of Legislative Assembly -cum- Secretariat and also to convert it into

Multi Super Specialty Hospital have been upheld by the Hon'ble High Court. In the

interest of public and also the poor and needy, there cannot be any impediment for

changing the utility of the building by converting it into Multi Super Specialty Hospital

with all medical facilities of high degree; but, at the same time, safeguard measures

which are required, have got to be undertaken before commissioning of the hospital.

three important and inter connected aspects that require special attention during the

operational phase of any health care facility, irrespective of its size and bed capacity.

This being so, the proposed Multi Super Specialty Hospital (MSSH) by its innate

characteristic and definition is to have a number of special Medicare units -

Neurology, Radiology, Cardiology, Cranio facial surgery, Organ transplantation and

Rehabilitation, to mention a few. Doubtless, Hygiene integrity, Infection control and

Environmental protection warrant special consideration in such a Multi Super

Specialty Hospital. Keeping these in mind, the modified Environmental Clearance

dated 16.05.2012 issued by the SEIAA has imposed a number of terms and

conditions to be strictly complied by the proponent during the operation of the Multi

   portion from the letter from the SEIAA indicating the amendment is extracted below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">       Extract from Lr.No. SEIAA/F.455/Amendment/2012 dated 29-09- 2012 of the State

       "The Proponent shall cause through the State Government declaration of the
       Hospital area as "No Horn Zone" and provide necessary sign boards preferably
       in vantage positions in all adjoining roads, in such a way that the sign boards

conditions listed above in the context of the proposed Multi Super Specialty Hospital in
question and its operation. In the opinion of the Tribunal all the conditions stipulated by the
SEIAA are very much necessary for the activity envisaged in the complex in question.
Therefore, The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the Authority that issues the "CONSENT
TO OPERATE" is directed to include all these conditions cited supra as "MANDATORY
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                               87</span>


CONDITIONS" to be strictly and fully complied by the proponent for getting the 'Consent to
Operate' from the Authority above, for the Multi Super Specialty Hospital in question.

The proposed Multi Super Specialty Hospital appears to be a venture to provide health and
Medicare facilities of International Standards with ultra modern diagnostic tools and
instrumentation. It is imperative therefore, not to overlook or omit any aspect of their impact
on the Environment while operating the Hospital. In fact, environmental safeguards should
play a pivotal role to compliment the noble objectives of the project. The hospital should take
proactive steps in protecting the environmental quality even as they provide super special
medical service to public. This approach would, in long run make the hospital a 'model'
worthy of emulation. Keeping all these and also the practices followed in many renowned
hospitals such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, in mind the Tribunal
is of the considered view that some more conditions are required to be stipulated for
operating the MSSH. Therefore,       the Authority above is further directed to include the
following conditions also as "MANDATORY CONDITIONS" to be strictly and fully complied
by the proponent for getting the 'Consent to Operate' from the Authority above, for the Multi
Super Specialty Hospital in question:

       "Battery operated" and not fuelled by petrol/diesel/gas.
</p><p id="p_296">   9. In addition to the above conditions, if the Authority above, based on its experience in
       monitoring similar healthcare facilities in the State desires to impose more conditions,
       it may do so, as per law.

In order to create and promote awareness on "Environmental Protection measures in

maintain informative KIOSKS at strategic points in the MSSH Complex in question.

We make it abundantly clear that there is nothing to compromise in the matters relating to
Ecology and Environment and therefore caution the Authority above to issue the "CONSENT
TO OPERATE" only after carrying out a detailed inspection of the MSSH after it is
established and fully satisfying itself of the complete compliance of all the terms and
conditions as stipulated above.
