<p id="p_1">        By means of this Appeal under Section 16(1) (h) of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green

Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 the Appellant has challenged order dated 24th July, 2012

rendered by Pollution Control Appellate Authority (PCAA) of West Bengal

(W.B.), upholding order dated 27th March, 2012 passed by Sr. Environmental

Engineer &amp; In-charge (Operation &amp; Execution Cell) of West Bengal Pollution

Control Board (in short, WBPCB). The WBPCB by order dated 27.03.2012

gave certain directions to the Appellant (M/s DVC Emta Coal Mines Ltd.). The

Appellant is aggrieved by the direction to deposit of Rs. 10 lakh towards

pollution cost for non-compliance of the environmental norms on account of

dumping overburden generated from mining activity, in the nearby area, i.e. to

construct a temporary barrier in the Hingla River, a tributary of river Ajoy.

Challenge to other directions is waived by the Appellant during course of the

hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.      The Appellant was issued Consent to Establish (NOC),vide order dated

09.09.2011 for an open-cast coal mine at Khagra-Joydev Block in District


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                Page 2 of 13</span>
 Birbhum by WBPCB on certain conditions. The project has not yet been

granted the "Consent to Operate" . Therefore, the mining operation has not

yet been started. Ajoy River passes from nearby place of the open-cast coal

mine site . There is a Tributary of said river known as "Hingla" River. Before

onset of dry season of the year 2012 some of the villagers of Joplai and

Palashdanga under Loba Gram Panchayat submitted a mass petition to the

Village Pradhan, informing that the residents of village had urged the

Appellant to construct a temporary dam of 2 feet height in "Hingla" River in

order to make available the river water for agriculture and other purpose

during the dry season.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    In the course of State Legislative Assembly Session, Hon'ble MLA of

the Constituency raised a question pertaining to blockage of the natural flow

of river Ajoy by dumping of overburden by the private sector collieries on the

river bed. The WBPCB conducted enquiry in this context. The WB PCB

found that the natural flow of river Ajoy was obstructed and diverted due to

dumping of over-burden over a part of "Hingla" River i.e. the tributary thereof.

The local irrigation department intervened in the matter and got partially

removed the barriers.       The Sr. Environmental Engineer &amp; In-charge

(Operation &amp; Execution Cell) of the WB PCB thereafter gave direction to the

Appellant vide communication dated 27.03.2012, holding the Appellant

responsible for pollution due to dumping of over-burden and obstructing the

natural flow of water in the river and hence directed him to deposit cost of Rs.

10 lakh as pollution cost on account of non-compliance of the environmental

norms. Feeling aggrieved thereby, the Appellant preferred        appeal no. A-

05/2012 before the Pollution Control Appellate Authority (for short, P.C.A.A.)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               Page 3 of 13</span>
 (W.B.) challenging the impugned order dated 27.3.2012 issued by WB PCB.

The appeal was dismissed by the P.C.A.A. (WB) vide the impugned order.

Hence the present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    The Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the mining

operation has not yet been started and therefore there could not be any

violation of the conditions enumerated in the letter dated 09.09.2011 of

consent to establish. He further submits that the inspection report was not

made available to him by the WB PCB. Thus the Appellant was deprived of

opportunity to show as to how the inspection report was incorrect and

improper. The communication dated 27.03.2012 issued by the WB PCB and

the impugned order of the Appellate Authority are in clear violation of

principles of natural justice. He submits that both the authorities failed to

establish that overburden of the mining material was generated by the

Appellant. He submits that the local villagers used to erect small "bunds" to

hold water in a small patch of 'Hingla' River for their use in dry season so as

to meet their domestic requirements. They, as usual, had raised such "bunds"

and obstructed the natural flow of the river during the lean water-flow period.

He submits that the authorities of the WBPCB had failed to restrain the local

inhabitants from making the 'bunds' and in order to cover up such inaction the

liability has been fastened on the Appellant. He submits that the Appellant is

not proved to be polluter and as such, is not liable to pay the pollution cost.

Consequently, he urged to allow the Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.    The Appellant raised several grounds in the Appeal Memo regarding

the nature of directions dated 27.03.2012 issued by the WB Pollution Control

Board through the Sr. Environmental Engineer &amp; In-charge (Operation &amp;

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              Page 4 of 13</span>
 Execution Cell).   During the course of the arguments, Mr. Kallol Basu,

Advocate appearing for the Appellant made a statement that he has no

objection to other directions shown at serial nos. 1 to 4 in the said

communication. He restricted his argument only to the extent of the direction

no. 5 whereby the Appellant has been directed to pay Rs. 10 lakh as pollution

cost.   He submits that the Appellant shall comply with the other four (4)

directions shown at serial nos.1 to 4 of the communication dated 27.03.2012

issued by the Sr. Environmental Engineer &amp; In-charge (Operation &amp; Execution

Cell) of West Bengal Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.      The   Learned   Counsel    for       the   Respondent   supported   the

communication dated 27.03.2012 issued by the WB PCB as well as the

impugned order. He submits that the representatives of the Appellant were

called upon to participate in the enquiry and an enquiry was held in the

presence of the representatives of the Appellant and minutes of the hearing

dated 17.02.2012, were drawn in accordance with the discussions. The fact

that the natural flow of the river was obstructed by raising temporary barrier

on account of overburden extracted from the site of the proposed open-cast

coal mine was not disputed during the course of the meeting.                The

representatives of the Appellant had not denied that the dumping was done by

using the waste material generated due to land development activity at the

site of the proposed mine of the Appellant.          The representatives of the

Appellant were heard during the course of the discussions in the meeting

dated 17.02.2012 and as such the WB PCB did not violate principles of

natural justice. He submits that the Appellant's purported story of dumping

the overburden generated from the mining site by some villagers was found to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              Page 5 of 13</span>
 be untenable because the Appellant never gave any such report nor filed FIR

for so called removal of the waste material from the site of the mine. He

submits that the Appellant failed to adduce any evidence in support of such

removal of the material from the site of the proposed mine by use of force and

gave no details to identity so called persons who have done such act. He

further submits that the Appellant failed to raise any ground before the first

Appellate Authority in the context of quantum of the pollution cost which is

directed to be paid under the directions issued by the concerned authority of

the WB PCB. He submits that the Memorandum of Appeal filed before the

Pollution Control Appellate Authority (P.C.A.A.) (W.B.) does not contain any

specific ground as regards the quantification of the pollution cost. He submits

that the Appellate Authority has not committed any irregularity or illegality in

passing of the impugned order. He urged, therefore, to dismiss the Appeal.


</p><p id="p_12">7.      Before we proceed to consider merits of the matter, let it be noted that

we entertained doubt whether the Appeal can be straightway admitted or it

being in the nature of second Appeal, it may not be admitted at all unless it is

demonstrated that it involves "substantial question of law" and satisfies the

parameters of Section 100 of C.P. Code. No such objection is, however,

raised by the Respondents. The Counsel for the Appellant pointed out that

the directions issued vide communication dated 27.03.2012 cannot be

equated with "Decree" of the Civil Court. The term "Decree" is defined under

<a href="/doc/146113629/" id="a_2">Section 2</a> (2) of the C.P. Code. <a href="/doc/146113629/" id="a_3">Section 2</a> (2) reads as follows:


</p><p id="p_13">        " 2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject

or context, -
</p>
<p id="p_14">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   Page 6 of 13</span>
 (1).   Xxxxxxxxxxx


(2).   "Decree" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as
regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with
regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either
preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the
determination of any question within <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_4">section 144</a>, but shall not include -
</p><p id="p_15">(a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or
</p><p id="p_16">(b) any order of dismissal for default."
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">8.     The plain reading of the above provision would make it amply clear that

the decree is an outcome of formal expression of adjudication of lis between

the parties. The directions issued by the WB Pollution Control Board cannot

be treated as 'Decree'.       For, the WB Pollution Control Board           gave the

directions on the basis of inspection report and on the basis of finding that the

Appellant did not abide itself by certain conditions laid down in the NOC

issued vide Memo No. 539-2N-246/2006(E) dated 09.09.2011.There was no

trial as such. The delegated authority of WB Pollution Control Board did not

raise specific issues and gave specific findings on such issues, by recording

of evidence, or holding trial. In other words, the delegated authority of the WB

Pollution Control Board did not have "trappings of a court".

</p><p id="p_19">9.     Apart from the nature of order passed by the delegated authority of the

WB Pollution Control Board, it is pertinent to note that the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_5">National Green

Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 specifically provides for an Appeal under <a href="/doc/181767243/" id="a_6">Section 16(a)</a>

against an order or decision of the Appellate Authority under <a href="/doc/106221633/" id="a_7">Section 28</a>, so

also, <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_8">Section 33</a> A      of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (for short, <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Pollution Act</a>) to the National Green Tribunal. Thus, the

National Green Tribunal has appellate powers against such orders passed by



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  Page 7 of 13</span>
 the State Pollution Control Board or Appellate Authority. It may be mentioned

here that <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_11">Section 28</a> (1) provides for an Appeal against order made by the

State Pollution Control Board under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_13">Section 26</a> and <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_14">Section 27</a> of

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.               However, it

appears that directions were given by the (WB) Pollution Control Board in the

exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_16">Section 33</a> (A) of the Water Pollution Act. It would

be useful to refer Section 33 (B) of the Water Pollution Act. It reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "33B. Appeal to National Green Tribunal. - Any person aggrieved by, -

         may file an appeal to the National Green Tribunal established under <a href="/doc/50331181/" id="a_23">section 3</a>

         of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, in accordance with the provisions of

         that act."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">10.      It is necessary to examine whether the delegated authority of the WB

Pollution Control Board had the power to direct payment of Rs. 10 lakh as

pollution costs. What appears from the record is that the villagers urged the

Appellant to construct a temporary dam in the midst of the river "Hingla" so

that in the dry season water can be made available for agriculture and other

purposes. It appears that the Appellant raised barrier of 2 feet height in the

river as per the request of the villagers of Joplai and Palashdanga under Loba

Gram Panchayat. There is no serious dispute about the fact that inspection

was carried out by the competent authority. The relevant inspection report is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   Page 8 of 13</span>
 placed on record.    It was found that the natural flow of the river "Hingla"

diminished due to construction of a temporary dam by dumping over-burden

on the main course of the flow. An enquiry conducted by the local authority

showed that the over-burden was obtained from the mining activities of the

Appellant. The Appellant did not file any report with the Police regarding

illegal removal of the soil/over-burden from the site of open-cast coal mine.

The Appellant did not give any information to the police as to who had taken

away the soil for construction of the temporary dam. The representatives of

the Appellant were present when minutes of the hearing, held on 17.02.2012,

were drawn. Perusal of the said minutes reveal that the representatives of

the Appellant failed to give any tangible evidence in support of their claim that

the soil extracted from the open-cast coal mine site was forcibly taken away

by the local villagers. As stated before, representation made by the local

villagers to the Gram Pradhan of Loba Gram Panchayat also reveals that the

barrier was constructed by the Appellant. The minutes of the meeting dated

17.02.2012 further show that it was decided to impose penalty on the

Appellant for recovery of pollution cost for its "indifferent attitude" in the

matter. It was decided that the amount of pollution costs may be determined

by the competent authority. It is in accordance with such decision taken in the

meeting dated 17.02.2012 that the Sr. Environmental Engineer &amp; In-charge

(Operation &amp; Execution Cell) who appears to be a delegated authority of WB

Pollution Control Board, issued the directions dated 27.03.2012.


</p><p id="p_21">11.    Now, the most important legal issue involved in the appeal is :




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               Page 9 of 13</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">               (i) Whether the WB Pollution Control Board is competent to give

        direction for recovery of such pollution cost in exercise of the powers

        available in <a href="/doc/161532715/" id="a_24">Section 33</a> and <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_25">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water Pollution Act ?


</blockquote><p id="p_22">12.     It may be pointed out here    that no such question was raised by the

advocate for the Appellant. We were rather surprised to take note of the fact

that the Advocate for the Appellant failed to argue that the WB Pollution

Control Board had no competency to give direction for recovery of the

pollution cost (Rs. 10 lakh) . We are also dismayed to note that the counsel

for the respondent did not pinpoint as to how the WB Pollution Control Board

was or is competent to direct the Appellant to deposit pollution cost of Rs. 10

lakh.
</p>
<p id="p_23">13.     Perusal of <a href="/doc/161532715/" id="a_26">Section 33</a> and <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_27">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water Pollution Act

clearly shows that the Board is required to file an application to the concerned

Magistrate for injunction or for removal of any matter from stream or well and

in case it is not removed by the person concerned, then to take action under

sub-section 4 of Section 33. We did not find any kind of power available to

the Pollution Control Board to give direction for recovery of the pollution cost.

</p><p id="p_24">14.     <a href="/doc/10484767/" id="a_28">In Splendor Landbase Ltd. vs. Delhi Pollution Control</a> committee,

reported in 173(2010) Delhi Law Times-52 , Hon'ble Delhi High Court had

an occasion to interpret <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_29">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water Pollution Act. Relying

upon judgment of the Apex Court in the case of M/s. Khemka &amp; Co.

(Agencies) private limited vs. State of Maharashtra (1975) 2 SCC 22, the

Hon'ble Delhi High Court observed :
</p>

        unless there is a specific power in the Statute enabling the authority to

       do so, it cannot levy penalties or damages with reference to the general

       power under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_30">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act or <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_31">Section 33A</a> of Water Act."

       guarantees and making the grant of consent to establish under the

       <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_32">Water Act</a> and consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_33">Air Act</a> conditional upon

       payment of such penalties and furnishing of such bank guarantees, are

       entirely without the authority of law and require to be set aside."

</blockquote><p id="p_25">15.    Let it be noted that <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_34">Section 25</a> of the Water Pollution Act empowers the

Board to impose conditions on the industrial units which may apply for

consent to operate. There are penal provisions which make a person liable

for punishment when it is found that conditions set-out under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_35">Section 25</a> or

<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_36">Section 26</a> of the Water Pollution Act are not complied with. The powers

available under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_37">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water Pollution Act are circumscribed by

the other provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_38">Water Pollution Act</a>.          Moreover, the competent

authority is required to follow the procedure enumerated in the Water

(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1975. Rule 34 envisages the

manner in which such directions are required to be issued by the competent

authority. Significantly, Rule 34(3) categorically provides that a copy of the

proposed direction shall be given to the person against whom the same are

required to be issued. It will be beneficial to reproduce <a href="/doc/1730116/" id="a_39">Section 34(3)</a> for

ready reference.

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">
</blockquote><p id="p_28">16.   There is nothing on record to show that proposed directions were

communicated to the Appellant as required in the manner stated above.

Needless to say there is non-compliance of Rule 34(3) of the Water

(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1975.              For this reason, the

impugned direction issued by the WB Pollution Control Board is bad in law

since it has been issued without having any legal authority. We are of the

opinion that the Pollution Control Appellate Authority (P.C.A.A.) (WB) failed to

take into account this important legal flaw while passing the impugned order

dated 24.07.2012. The Appellate Authority committed error while holding the

Appellant vicariously liable and to uphold the direction to pay pollution cost.

We are of the opinion that the WB Pollution Control Board may not issue

consent to operate the unit unless the other conditions enumerated at serial

nos. 1 to 4 in the directions issued by the WB Pollution Control Board are

complied with by the Appellant. The grant of consent to operate or to refuse

the same if certain conditions are not complied with by the Appellant, is within

the discretion of the Board (WB PCB).

Beverages Pvt. Ltd. vs. WB Pollution Control Board examined identical

question of law and held that the Board has no power to direct recovery of

pollution cost. Considering the reasons discussed above, we have no

hesitation in holding that the WB Pollution Control Board committed patent

error while directing the Appellant to pay pollution cost of Rs. 10 lakh and the

Appellate Authority also erred in confirming such order. Hence the Appeal will

have to be allowed.
