in both the said criminal revisions for decision.

</p><p id="p_6">      2.    Invoking <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, while in

C.R.R. No. 3197 of 2005 the petitioners have approached this Court for quashing

of the Complaint Case No. C-773 of 2004, similarly in C.R.R. No. 20 of 2006 they

have approached for quashing of the Complaint Case No. C-649 of 2004. Both

the aforesaid complaint cases are pending before the Learned Additional Chief

Judicial Magistrate, Barrackpore. While the first impugned complaint relates to

the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/68227301/" id="a_2">Section 63</a> of the Standards of Weights and

<a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_3">Measures Act</a>, 1976 and under <a href="/doc/174952200/" id="a_4">Sections 51</a> and <a href="/doc/84638435/" id="a_5">61</a> of the Standards of Weights

and Measures, <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_6">(Enforcement) Act</a>, 1985 for alleged violation of <a href="/doc/82899074/" id="a_7">Section 39</a> of the

Standards of Weights and <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_8">Measures Act</a>, 1976 read with Rule 26 of Standards of

Weights and Measures, (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977.            The second

complaint relates to the alleged offences punishable under <a href="/doc/68227301/" id="a_9">Section 63</a> of The

Standards of Weights and <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_10">Measures Act</a>, 1976 and under <a href="/doc/174952200/" id="a_11">Section 51</a> of the

Standards of Weights and Measures, <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_12">(Enforcement) Act</a> 1985, read with <a href="/doc/155802620/" id="a_13">Section

74</a> of The Standards of Weights and <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_14">Measures Act</a> 1976 and <a href="/doc/41402991/" id="a_15">Section 62</a> of The

Standards of Weights and Measures, <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_16">(Enforcement) Act</a> 1985, and alleged

violation of Rules 2 (r) 4, 6, 8, 9 and 23 of the Standards of Weights and

Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rules 1977 read with <a href="/doc/177744463/" id="a_17">Section 33</a> of The

Standards of Weights and Measures, <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_18">(Enforcement) Act</a>, 1985.

</p><p id="p_7">            The principal ground on which the quashing has been sought for is

this that there is no requisite averment in the complaints in terms of <a href="/doc/155802620/" id="a_19">Section 74</a>

of The Standards of Weights and <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_20">Measures Act</a>, 1976 and <a href="/doc/41402991/" id="a_21">Section 62</a> of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            3</span>
</p><p id="p_8">      3.     Besides above the grounds on which the quashing has been sought

for are as follows;
</p>
<p id="p_9">             (a)      The petitioner no. 1 during his tenure as Chairman of Indian

Oil Corporation was nominated by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas

Commission, Government of India and was involved in dealing with the policy

matters of Indian Oil Corporation Limited and was in no way connected with the

running of day to day affairs of the petitioners' company at any point of time.

</p><p id="p_10">             (b)      The petitioner no. 2 being the General Manager (West Bengal)

of Indian Oil Corporation Limited was also similarly involved in dealing with the

policy matters, but was in no way concerned with the running of the day to day

affairs of the Indian Oil Corporation at no point of time.

</p><p id="p_11">             (c)      Accepting the allegations as it is and to be true no offence as

alleged or at all has been made out.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             (d)      The allegations are patently absurd and inherently improbable.

</p><p id="p_13">             (e)      If there is any violation for the same the distributor is

responsible through whom retail sales are affected over which the petitioners

have no control.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             (f)      No materials has been placed before the Learned Court below

to show that the petitioners were actually involved in running the day to day

affairs of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited.

</p><p id="p_15">             (g)      It appears from the allegations made in the complaint that

offence has been committed by the M/s. Freedom Services, the distributorship

concern.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           4</span><p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">             (h)     There was no averment in the petition of complaint that the

petitioners were in-charge and responsible for running, the day to day business

of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_18">             (i)     The Learned Magistrate most arbitrarily and mechanically

issued the process and set the criminal law into motion.

</p><p id="p_19">             (j)     There is no effectual foundation that the accused company

Indian Oil Corporation Limited has actually made, manufactured, packed and

sealed or caused to be packed or distributed, delivered or offered, exposed for

sale the seized articles.
</p>
<p id="p_20">             (k)     The proceeding has been launched out of utter mala fide.

</p><p id="p_21">      4.     The Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners in support of his

contention relied on an unreported decision of this Hon'ble High Court relating to

C.R.R. No. 2528 of 2005 in the case of M.S. Ramchandran &amp; Anr. Vs. Sri Sandip

Meta &amp; Anr.        He has also relied on the following decisions, viz., (i) S.M.S.

Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla &amp; Anr., reported in 2005 SCC (Cri) 1975,

</p><p id="p_22">(ii) <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_23">K.K. Ahuja Vs. V.K. Vora &amp; Anr</a>., reported in JT 2009 (8) SC 691.

</p><p id="p_23">             Whereas the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State

vehemently opposed the prayer for quashing and submitted when it is an

admitted position the petitioner no. 2 is the General Manager of the Company

even in absence of requisite averment in terms of <a href="/doc/155802620/" id="a_24">Section 74</a> of the Standards of

Weights and <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_25">Measures Act</a>, 1976 and <a href="/doc/41402991/" id="a_26">Section 62</a> of the Standards of Weights and

Measures, <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_27">(Enforcement) Act</a>, 1985, being the General Manager he is very much

liable to be prosecuted in connection with the aforesaid complaint case.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          5</span>
</p><p id="p_24">      5.    Before adverting to the rival contentions of the parties, I am of the

opinion, it would be apposite to refer to the aforesaid decisions of the Hon'ble

High Court in which the Apex Court dealt with the question of quashing of

complaint on the score of absence of imputing vicarious liability on the officers of

the company. In the case of S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla &amp; Anr.

(supra), a three Judges Bench of the Apex Court dealt with two issues;

</p><p id="p_25">            (a)   Whether for the purposes of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_28">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable

Instruments Act, 1881, it is sufficient if the substance of the allegation read as a

whole fulfil the requirements of the said section and it is not necessary to

specifically state in the complaint that the person accused was in charge of, or

responsible for, the conduct of the business of the company.

</p><p id="p_26">            (b)   Whether a director of a company would be deemed to be in

charge of, and responsible to, the company for conduct of the business of the

company and, therefore, deemed to be guilty of the offence unless he proves to

the contrary.
</p>
<p id="p_27">            (c)   Even if it is held that specific averments are necessary,

whether in the absence of such averments the signatory of the cheque and or the

managing directors or joint managing director who admittedly would be in charge

of the company and responsible to the company for conduct of its business could

be proceeded against.
</p>
<p id="p_28">............................... and held as follows;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "In view of the above discussion, our answers to the questions
                  posed in the reference are as under :
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        6</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 (a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under
                 <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_29">Section 141</a> that at the time the offence was committed, the
                 person accused was in charge of, and responsible for the
                 conduct of business of the company. This averment is an
                 essential requirement of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_30">Section 141</a> and has to be made in a
                 complaint. Without this averment being made in a complaint,
                 the requirements of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_31">Section 141</a> cannot be said to be satisfied.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 (b) The answer to the question posed in sub-part (b) has to be
                 in the negative. Merely being a director of a company is not
                 sufficient to make the person liable under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_32">Section 141</a> of the
                 Act. A director in a company cannot be deemed to be in
                 charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its
                 business. The requirement of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_33">Section 141</a> is that the person
                 sought to be made liable should be in charge of and
                 responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at
                 the relevant time. This has to be averred as a fact as there is
                 no deemed liability of a director in such cases.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 (c) The answer to Question (c) has to be in the affirmative. The
                 question notes that the managing director or joint managing
                 director would be admittedly in charge of the company and
                 responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.</blockquote><p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">                 When that is so, holders of such positions in a company
                 become liable under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_34">Section 141</a> of the Act. By virtue of the
                 office they hold as managing director or joint managing
                 director, these persons are in charge of and responsible for the
                 conduct of business of the company. Therefore, they get
                 covered under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_35">Section 141</a>. So far as the signatory of a cheque
                 which is dishonoured is concerned, he is clearly responsible
                 for the incriminating act and will be covered under sub-section
                 (2) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_36">Section 141</a>.    (para 19)

           In the case of <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_37">K.K. Ahuja Vs. V.K. Vora &amp; Anr</a>. (supra), the Apex

Court dealt with the question, as to who can be said to be the persons in charge

and to be persons "in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the

business of the company" as referred in <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_38">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable

Instruments Act, 1881 and held as follows;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 "The words "every person who, at the time of the offence was
                 committed, was in charge of, and was responsible for the
                 conduct of the business of the company" occurs not only in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                        7</span>
<a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_39">section 141</a> (1) of the Act but in several enactments dealing
with offences by companies, to mention a few - <a href="/doc/1417100/" id="a_40">Section 278B</a>
of the Income Tax Act, 1961, <a href="/doc/1893901/" id="a_41">Section 22C</a> of Minimum Wages
Act, 1948, <a href="/doc/259762/" id="a_42">Section 86A</a> of the Employees State Insurance Act,

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_49">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. But neither <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_50">section 141</a> (1) of
the Act, nor the pari materia provisions in other enactments
give any indication as to who are the persons responsible to
the company, for the conduct of the business of the company.
</blockquote><p id="p_31">Therefore, we will have to fall back upon the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_51">Companies Act</a>, 1956 which is the law relating to and
regulating companies. <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_52">Section 291</a> of the said Act provides
that subject to the provisions of the Act, the Board of Directors
of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such powers, and
to do all such acts and things, as the company is authorized to
exercise and do. A company though a legal entity can act only
through its Board of Directors. The settled position is that a
Managing Director is prima facie in charge of and responsible
for the company's business and affairs and can be prosecuted
for offences by the company. But insofar as other directors are
concerned, they can be prosecuted only if they were in charge
of and responsible for the conduct of the company's business.
A combined reading of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_53">Section 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1202543/" id="a_54">291</a> of Companies Act,
1956 with the definitions in clauses (24), (26), (30), (31), (45) of
<a href="/doc/322670/" id="a_55">section 2</a> of that Act would show that the following persons are
considered to be the persons who are responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company:

</p><p id="p_32">(a) the managing director/s;
</p>
<p id="p_33">(b) the whole-time director/s;
</p>
<p id="p_34">(c) the manager;
</p>
<p id="p_35">(d) the secretary;
</p>
<p id="p_36">(e) any person in accordance with whose directions or
instructions the Board of directors of the company is
accustomed to act;
</p>
<p id="p_37">(f) any person charged by the Board with the responsibility of
complying with that provision (and who has given his consent
in that behalf to the Board); and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                       8</span>
</p><p id="p_38">(g) where any company does not have any of the officers
specified in clauses (a) to (c), any director or directors who may
be specified by the Board in this behalf or where no director is
so specified, all the directors.
</p>
<p id="p_39"><a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_56">Section 141</a> uses the words "was in charge of, and was
responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of
the company". It is evident that a person who can be made
vicariously liable under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_57">Section 141</a> is a
person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of
the business of the company and in addition is also in charge
of the business of the company. There may be many directors
and secretaries who are not in charge of the business of the
company at all. The meaning of the words "person in charge of
the business of the company" was considered by this Court in
<a href="/doc/50504/" id="a_58">Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.N. Mehta</a> [1971 (3) SCC 189] followed
in <a href="/doc/443284/" id="a_59">State of Karnataka v. Pratap Chand</a> [1981 (2) SCC 335] and
Katta Sujatha v. Fertiliser &amp; Chemicals Travancore Ltd. (JT
2002 (10) SC 134 : 2002 (7) SCC 655]. This Court held that
the words refer to a person who is in overall control of the day
to day business of the company. This Court pointed out that a
person may be a director and thus belongs to the group of
persons making the policy followed by the company, but yet
may not be in charge of the business of the company; that a
person may be a Manager who is in charge of the business but
may not be in overall charge of the business; and that a person
may be an officer who may be in charge of only some part of
the business.     (para 15)

Therefore, if a person does not meet the first requirement, that
is being a person who is responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company, neither the question
of his meeting the second requirement (being a person in
charge of the business of the company), nor the question of
such person being liable under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_60">section 141</a>
does not arise. To put it differently, to be vicariously liable
under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_61">Section 141</a>, a person should fulfill the
'legal requirement' of being a person in law (under the statute
governing companies) responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company and also fulfill the
'factual requirement' of being a person in charge of the
business of the company.     (para 16)

Therefore, the averment in a complaint that an accused is a
director and that he is in charge of and is responsible to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                        9</span>


                 company for the conduct of the business of the company, duly
                 affirmed in the sworn statement, may be sufficient for the
                 purpose of issuing summons to him. But if the accused is not
                 one of the persons who falls under the category of persons who
                 are responsible to the company for the conduct of the business
                 of the company (listed in para 14 above), then merely by
                 stating that 'he was In charge of the business of the company'
                 or by stating that 'he was in charge of the day to day
                 management of the company' or by stating that he was in
                 charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct
                 of the business of the company', he cannot be made vicariously
                 liable under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_62">section 141</a> (1) of the Act. (para 17)

                 It should, however, be kept in view that even an officer who
                 was not in charge of and was responsible to the company for
                 the conduct of the business of the company can be made liable
                 under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_63">Section 141</a>. For making a person
                 liable under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_64">Section 141</a> (2), the mechanical repetition of the
                 requirements under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_65">Section 141</a> (1) will be of no assistance,
                 but there should be necessary averments in the complaint as
                 to how and in what manner the accused was guilty of consent
                 and connivance or negligence and therefore, responsible under
                 sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_66">section 141</a> of the Act. (para 18)

                 Another aspect that requires to be noticed is that only a
                 Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer can be made
                 liable under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_67">section 141</a>. But under sub-
                 section (1) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_68">section 141</a>, it is theoretically possible to make
                 even a person who is not a director or officer, liable, as for
                 example, a person falling under category (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_69">section 5</a>
                 of the Companies Act, 1956. When in SMS Pharma (1), this
                 Court observed that 'conversely, a person not holding any
                 office or designation in a company may be liable if he satisfied
                 the requirement of being in charge of and responsible for
                 conduct of the business of the company', this Court obviously
                 had in mind, persons described in clauses (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_70">section
                 5</a> of the Companies Act. Be that as it may. (para 19)

.......... and finally summarized the position in Paragraph 20;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 The position under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_71">section 141</a> of the Act can be summarized
                 thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                 (i) If the accused is the Managing Director or a Joint Managing
                 Director, it is not necessary to make an averment in the
                 complaint that he is in charge of, and is responsible to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                         10</span>


                  company, for the conduct of the business of the company. It is
                  sufficient if an averment is made that the accused was the
                  Managing Director or Joint Managing director at the relevant
                  time. This is because the prefix 'Managing' to the word
                  'Director' makes it clear that they were in charge of and are
                  responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of
                  the company.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                  (ii) In the case of a director or an officer of the company who
                  signed the cheque on behalf of the company, there is no need
                  to make a specific averment that he was in charge of and was
                  responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of
                  the company or make any specific allegation about consent,
                  connivance or negligence. The very fact that the dishonoured
                  cheque was signed by him on behalf of the company, would
                  give rise to responsibility under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_72">Section 141</a>.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                  (iii) In the case of a Director, Secretary or Manager (as defined

                  in clause (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_75">Section 5</a> of Companies Act, an averment

                  company is necessary to bring the case under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_76">section 141</a> (1).
                  No further averment would be necessary in the complaint,

                  made liable under <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_77">Section 141</a> (2) by making necessary
                  averments relating to consent and connivance or negligence, in

            In this connection this Court feels that it would be relevant to also

refer another decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Municipal

Corporation of Delhi Vs. Ram Kishan Rohatgi &amp; Ors., reported in 1983 SCC (Cri)

115, wherein the Apex Court held as follows;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                      11</span><p id="p_43">


"Before going to the complainant, we might state that it is
common ground that the complaint clearly contains the
allegations regarding the visit of the Inspector to the shop of
respondent No. 6 (Madan Lal) and that the sample taken by
him, which was sent to the Public Analyst, was manufactured
by Upper Ganges Sugar Mills, Darayaganj, Delhi, having its
registered office at Calcutta and that the Public Analyst found
the samples to be adulterated. There is no dispute regarding
these facts. The only point on which the controversy centers is
as to whether or not on the allegations, the Manager as also
the other respondents 1 to 5 committed any offence. The main
clause of the complaint which is the subject matter of the
dispute is clause No. 5 which may be extracted thus :"

"5. That the accused No. 3 is the Manager, of accused No. 2
and accused Nos. 4 to 7 are the Directors of accused No. 2 and
as such they were in charge of and responsible for the conduct
of business of accused No. 2 at the time of sampling."    (Para
</p><p id="p_44">12)

"According to this clause, accused No. 3 (Ramkishan) who is
respondent no. 1 in this appeal and accused Nos. 4-7 who are
respondent Nos. 2 to 4, were the Directors of the company,
respondent No. 5. So far as the Manager, respondent No. 1, is
concerned it was not and could not be reasonably argued that
no case is made out against him because from the very nature
of his duties, it is manifest that he must be in the knowledge
about the affairs of the sale and manufacture of the disputed
sample. It was, however, contended that there is no allegation
whatsoever against the Directors, respondent Nos. 2 to 4.
(Para 13)
"Reliance has been placed on the words 'as such' in order to
argue that because the complaint does not attribute any
criminal responsibility to accused Nos. 4 to 7 except that they
were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the
business of the company. It is true that there is no clear
averment of the fact that the Directors were really in charge of
the manufacture and responsible for the conduct of business
but the words 'as such' indicate that the complaint has merely
presumed that the Directors of the company must be guilty
because they are holding a particular office. This argument
found favour with the High Court which quashed the
proceedings against the Directors as also against the Manager,
respondent No. 1." (Para 14)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                         12</span>


                  "So far as the Manager is concerned, we are satisfied that from
                  the very nature of his duties it can be safely inferred that he
                  would undoubtedly be vicariously liable for the offence;
                  vicarious liability being an incident of an offence under the Act.
                  So far as the Directors are concerned, there is not even a
                  whisper nor a shred of evidence nor anything to show, apart
                  from the presumption drawn by the complainant, that there is
                  any act committed by the Directors from which a reasonable
                  inference can be drawn that they could also be vicariously
                  liable. In these circumstances, therefore, we find ourselves in
                  complete agreement with the argument of the High Court that
                  no case against the Directors (accused Nos. 4 to 7) has been
                  made out ex facie on the allegations made in the complaint
                  and the proceedings against them were rightly quashed." "
                  (Para 15)

                  "We, however, do not agree that even accused No. 3,
                  respondent No. 1, who is Manager of the Company and
                  therefore directly in charge of its affairs, could fall in the same
                  category as the Directors. Hence, we would set aside that part
                  of the judgement of the High Court which quashes the
                  proceedings against the Manager, respondent No. 1 (Ram
                  Kishan Rohtagi)." (Para 16)

</p><p id="p_45">      6.    So far as the grounds on which the petitioners sought for quashing

of the case, viz., the petitioner no. 2 being the General Manager was only involved

in dealing with policy matters and no way involved in running the day to day

affairs of the company and it is the distributor through whom the retail sales are

affected are responsible for such violation over whom the petitioner had no

control are pure question of facts are essentially their defence and as such the

same cannot be taken into consideration to decide the question whether on the

basis of the same the complaint can be quashed or not.

</p><p id="p_46">      7.    However, having gone through the petition of complaint, I find in

both the cases in the cause title the petitioner nos. 1 and 2 have been described
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                          13</span>


as the Chairman and the General Manager, whereas in the body of the complaint

only averment was to the effect so far as they are concerned are as follows;

</p><p id="p_47">            That the persons accused nos. 3 and 6 committing these offences are

companies so every persons including accused nos. 4, 5 and 7 as well as the

companies themselves are liable to be proceeded against as per <a href="/doc/155802620/" id="a_80">Section 74</a> of The

Standards of Weights and <a href="/doc/1932429/" id="a_81">Measures Act</a>, 1976 and <a href="/doc/41402991/" id="a_82">Section 62</a> of the Standards of

Weights and Measures, <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_83">(Enforcement) Act</a>, 1985. In the petition of complaint in

first case the petitioner no. 1 has been described as accused no. 3 and the

petitioner no. 2 as accused no. 4, while in the second case the petitioner no. 1

has been described as accused no. 5 and the petitioner no. 2 as accused no. 4.

</p><p id="p_48">      8.    Having gone through the impugned complaint I have no doubt the

requisite averment so far as the petitioner no. 1 M.S. Ramchandran is concerned

is clearly absent, as such the aforesaid two complaint cases so far as petitioner

no. 1 is concerned is not at all tenable and liable to be quashed. So far as the

petitioner no. 2 is concerned not only in the petition of complaint he has been

described as the General Manager of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited, but also

in this criminal revision moved before this Court at his behest the petitioner no.

2 has described himself as the General Manager, West Bengal of Indian Oil

Corporation Limited. Therefore, it is the admitted case of the petitioner that he is

the General Manager, West Bengal of Indian Oil Corporation Limited. He being

the General Manager of the company by very nature of his duty it can always be

prima facie inferred that being the General Manager he is in charge and

responsible to the accused company for carrying on its day to day business.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                           14</span>


Therefore, there is a prima facie case so far as the petitioner no. 2 is concerned

that he is vicariously liable for the offences committed by the accused company of

which he is the General Manager. Hence, even in absence of requisite averment

in the petition of complaints, the question of quashing of the case against him

does not at all arise. In the result, while both the criminal revisions so far as the

petitioner no. 1 is concerned succeeds and the criminal case against him stands

quashed, but both the aforesaid criminal revisions so far as the petitioner no. 2 is

concerned stands dismissed for the reasons stated hereinabove.

</p><p id="p_49">            In view of disposal of the main criminal revisional applications, the

application for extension of interim order being CRAN No. 16 of 2010 and CRAN

No. 17 of 2010 become infructuous and accordingly stands disposed of.
