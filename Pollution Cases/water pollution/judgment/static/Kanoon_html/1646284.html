HEADNOTE:
     The  petitioner filed a writ petition in this court  by
way   of  public  interest  litigation	alleging  that	 the
respondents, West Bokaro Collieries and Tata Iron and  Steel
Company	  (TISCO)  were	 polluting  the	 river	 Bokaro	  by
discharging  surplus waste in the form of  sludge/slurry  as
effluent  from their washeries into river making  the  river
water  unfit  for drinking and irrigation  purposes  thereby
causing risk to the health of the people; the State of Bihar
and  the State Pollution Control Board have failed  to	take
appropriate  steps  for	 prevention  of	 the  pollution	 and
instead	 the State of Bihar has granted leases on payment of
royalty	  to  various  persons	for  collection	 of  slurry.
Accordingly  the  petitioner prayed for	 directions  to	 the
respondents   to  take	immediate  steps   prohibiting	 the
pollution  of  the river and to take  legal  action  against
TISCO under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of  Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974.  The petitioner also claimed interim relief	from
this   Court  that  he	should	be  permitted	to   collect
sludge/slurry flowing out of washeries of the respondents.
						       6
     The  respondents  contested the  petition	denying	 the
petitioner's  allegations.   Bihar  State  Pollution   Board
asserted  that	directions have been issued  to	 the  Bokaro
Collieries to take effective steps for improving the quality
of  the	 effluent going into the river Bokaro and  that	 the
TISCO Company has been granted permission to discharge their
effluents from their outlets in accordance with <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_5">sections  25</a>
and <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_6">26</a> of the 1974 Act.	 On behalf of TISCO and	 the  Bokaro
Collieries  it was contended that all effective	 steps	have
been  taken to prevent the pollution and they have  complied
with the instructions of the State Pollution Board.
     By an order dated 13.12.1990, this Court dismissed	 the
writ petition with costs.
     Giving  reasons  for dismissal of	the  petition,	this
Court,
     HELD: 1. <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_7">Article 32</a> is designed for the enforcement  of
Fundamental  Rights  of	 a citizen by the  Apex	 Court.	  It
provides  for  an  extra-ordinary remedy  to  safeguard	 the
fundamental  rights  of	 a  citizen.  Right  to	 life  is  a
fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_8">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and it
includes the right of enjoyment of pollution free water	 and
air  for full enjoyment of life.  If anything  endangers  or
impairs	 that  quality	of life in  derogation	of  laws,  a
citizen	 has  right to have recourse to <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_9">Article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution  for  removing the pollution of  water  or	 air
which may be detrimental to the quality of life.  A petition
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_10">Article	32</a>  for	 the  prevention  of  pollution	  is
maintainable at the instance of affected persons or even  by
a  group of social workers or journalists.  But recourse  to
proceeding  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_11">Article 32</a> of the Constitution  should  be
taken  by person genuinely interested in the  protection  of
society	 on  behalf  of	 the  community.   Public   interest
litigation cannot be invoked by a person or body of  persons
to  satisfy his or its personal grudge and enmity.  If	such
petitions  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_12">Article 32</a> are entertained it would  amount
to  abuse of process of the Court, preventing speedy  remedy
to  other  genuine  petitioners from  this  Court.  Personal
interest  cannot  be enforced through the  process  of	this
Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_13">Article 32</a> of the Constitution in the garb of  a
public	interest  litigation.	Public	interest  litigation
contemplates legal proceeding for vindication or enforcement
of  fundamental	 rights of a group of persons  or  community
which  are not able to enforce their fundamental  rights  on
account of their incapacity, poverty or ignorance of law.  A
person invoking the jurisdiction of this Curt under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_14">Article
32</a>  must  approach  this Court for the	vindication  of	 the
fundamental  rights  of	 affected persons and  not  for	 the
purpose of vindication of his personal grudge or enmity.  It
is duty of this Court to
						       7
discourage such	 petitions and to ensure that the  course of
justice	 is  not  obstructed  or  polluted  by	unscrupulous
litigants  by  invoking the extra-ordinary  jurisdiction  of
this   Court  for  personal matters under the  garb  of	 the
public interest litigation. [13C-H; 14A]

     2.	  The  present	petition  is  not  filed  in  public
interest   instead  the	 petition  has	been  made  by	 the
petitioner  in his own interest.  Infact there is  intrinsic
evidence in the petition itself that the primary purpose  of
filing	this  petition is not to serve any  public  interest
instead	 it  is in self-interest.  The petitioner  has	been
purchasing slurry from the respondents for the last  several
years.	With  the passage of time he wanted  more  and	more
slurry	but the Company refused to accept his  request.	  He
removed the Company's slurry in an  unauthorised manner	 for
which  criminal	 cases	are  pending  against  him  and	 his
brother.   Since  the  respondent company  refused  to	sell
additional  slurry  he	entertained  a	grudge	against	 the
company	 and  in order to feed fat his	personal  grudge  he
resorted   to  several	proceedings  against   the   company
including  the	present	 one.  The prayer  for	the  interim
relief	made  by  the  petitioner  i.e.	 permitting  him  to
arrest/collect sludge/slurry flowing out of the washeries of
the respondents with a direction to the State of Bihar,	 its
officers  and other authorities for not preventing him	from
collecting the sludge/slurry and transporting the same	also
collecting   the  sludge/slurry and  transporting  the	same
clearly	 indicates that he is interested in  collecting	 the
slurry	and  transporting the same for the purposes  of	 his
business.  Therefore, there is no good reason to accept	 the
petitioner's allegation that  the water of the river  Bokaro
is being polluted by the discharge of sludge or slurry	into
it  form  the washeries of the respondent-company.   On	 the
other  hand  it	 is  evident  from  records that  the  State
Pollution  Control Board has taken effective steps to  check
the pollution. [14B;12F-G]

</p><p id="p_5">     This  petition is under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_20">Article 32</a> of the	Constitution
by  Subhash  Kumar  for the issue of  a	 writ  or  direction
directing the director of Collieries, West Bokaro Collieries
at Ghatotand, District Hazaribagh in the State of Bihar	 and
the  Tata from &amp; Steel Co. Ltd. to stop forthwith  discharge
of  slurry/sludge  from its washeries at  Ghatotand  in	 the
District of Hazaribagh into Bokaro river.  This petition  is
by  way	 of public interest litigation	for  preventing	 the
pollution  of the Bokaro river water from the  sludge/slurry
discharged  form the washeries of the Tata Iron &amp;  Steel Co.
Ltd.   The  petitioner has alleged that the  Parliament	 has
enacted the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974  (hereinafter referred to as `the Act')  providing	 for
the  prevention	 and  control of water	 pollution  and	 the
maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of water, for	 the
establishment  of  Board for the prevention and	 control  of
water pollution.  Under the provisions of the Act the  State
Pollution  Control Board constituted to carry out  functions
prescribed  under  <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_22">Section 17</a> of the Act which	among  other
things provide that the Board shall inspect sewage or  trade
effluents  and plants for the treatment of sewage and  trade
effluents and to review plans, specifications or other	data
set up for the treatment of water and to lay down  standards
to  be complied with by the persons while causing  discharge
of  sewage or sullage.	<a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_23">Section 24</a> of the Act provides	that
no  person  shall knowingly cause or permit  any  poisonous,
noxious	 or  polluting matter to enter into  any  stream  or
well,  which  may  lead	 to  a	substantial  aggravation  of
pollution.   The petitioner has asserted that Tata Iron	 and
Steel Co-respondent No.5 carries on mining operation in coal
mines/washeries in the town of Jamshedpur.  These coal mines
and  collieries are known as West Bokaro Collieries and	 the
Collieries have two coal washeries where the coal after	 its
extraction from the mines is brought and broken into  graded
pieces and there-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">						       9</span>
<p id="p_6">after  it is processed for the purpose of reducing  its	 ash
contents.  A chemical process is carried out which is  known
as  `froth  floatation	process'.  Under  this	process	 the
graded	coal  is mixed with diesel oil, pine  oil  and	many
other chemical ingredients and thereafter it is washed	with
the lacs of gallons of water.  The end water is washed	coal
with  reduced  quantity of ash content fit for	high  graded
metallurgical  process	for the purposes of  manufacture  of
steel.	In the process of washing large quantity of water is
discharged through pipes which carry the discharged water to
storage ponds constructed for the purpose of retaining	 the
slurry.	 Along with the discharged water, small particles of
coal  are carried away to the pond where the coal  particles
settle	down  on the surface of the pond, and  the  same  is
collected after the pond is de-watered.	 The coal  particles
which  are  carried away by the water is called	 the  slurry
which is ash free, it contains fine quality of coal which is
used as fuel.
</p><p id="p_7">     The  petitioner has alleged that the surplus  waste  in
the form of sludge/slurry is discharged as an effluent	from
the washeries into the Bokaro river which gets deposited  in
the  bed  of  the river and it also  gets  settled  on	land
including the petitioner's land bearing Plot No.170.  He was
further	 alleged  that	the  sludge  or	 slurry	 which	gets
deposited on the agricultural land, is absorbed by the	land
leaving	 on the top a fine carbonaceous product or  film  on
the soil, which adversely affects the fertility of the land.
The petitioner has further alleged that the effluent in	 the
shape  of  slurry is flown into the Bokaro  river  which  is
carried	 out  by  the  river water  to	the  distant  places
polluting  the	river water as a result of which  the  river
water  is  not fit for drinking purposes nor it is  fit	 for
irrigation purposes.  The continuous discharge of slurry  in
heavy  quantity	 by  the  Tata Iron &amp;  Steel  Co.  from	 its
washeries posing risks to the health of people living in the
surrounding  areas  and as a result of	such  discharge	 the
problem	 of  pure  drinking water  has	became	acute.	 The
petitioner   has   asserted   that   inspite   of    several
representations,  the  State of Bihar  and  State  Pollution
Control	 Board	have failed to take any action	against	 the
Company	 instead  they have permitted the pollution  of	 the
river water.  He has further averred that the State of Bihar
instead	 of taking any action against the Company  has	been
granting  leases on payment of royalty to   various  persons
for the collection  of slurry.	He has, accordingly, claimed
relief	for  issue of direction	 directing  the	 respondents
which  include	the  State of  Bihar,  the  Bihar  Pollution
Control	 Board, Union of India and Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co.  to
take  immediate	 steps prohibiting the pollution  of  Bokaro
river  water  from the discharge of slurry into	 the  Bokaro
river and to take further action under provisions of the Act
against the Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">						       10</span>
<p id="p_8">     The   respondents	have  contested	 the  petition	 and
counter-affidavits   have  been	 filed	on  behalf  of	 the
respondent  Nos. 2, 4 and 5-State of Bihar, State  Pollution
Board,	Directors  of Collieries and Tata Iron &amp;  Steel	 Co.
Ltd.   In  the	counter-affidavits filed on  behalf  of	 the
respondents,  the  petitioner's	 main  allegation  that	 the
sludge/slurry  is  being discharged into  the  river  Bokaro
causing	 pollution  to the water and the land and  that	 the
Bihar  State Pollution Board has not taken steps to  prevent
the  same  is  denied.	In the	counter-affidavit  filed  on
behalf	of  the Bihar State Pollution Board it	is  asserted
that  the  Tata	 Iron &amp; Steel Co.  operates  open  case	 and
underground  mining.  The Company in accordance to  <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_24">Sections
25</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_25">26</a> of the Water (Prevention Control  of  Pollution)
Act,  1974 applied for sanction from the Board of  discharge
their  effluent	 from  their  outlets.	 The  Board   before
granting  sanction analysed their effluent which  was  being
watched constantly and monitored to see that the  discharges
does  not  affect  the water quality  of  the  Bokaro  river
adversely.   In	 order to prevent the  pollution  the  Board
issued direction to the Director  of the Collieries to	take
effective  steps for improving the quality of  the  effluent
going  into  the Bokaro river.	The  State  Pollution  Board
imposed	 conditions requiring the Company to  construct	 two
settling  tanks for settlement of solids and  rewashing	 the
same.	 The  Board directed for the regular  samples  being
taken	and  tested  for  suspended  solids  and   for	 the
communication of the results of the tests to the Board	each
month.	 The State Board has asserted that the	Company	 has
constructed  four  ponds ensuring more storing	capacity  of
effluent.   The	 Pollution  Board has  been  monitoring	 the
effluent.   It is further stated that on the receipt of	 the
notice of the instant writ petition the Board carried out an
inspection  of the settling tanks regarding the treatment of
the  effluent  from the washeries on 20th  June,  1988.	  On
inspection it was found that all the four settling tanks had
already been completed and work for further strengthening of
the  embankment of the tanks was in progress, and there	 was
no  discharge  of  effluent from the  washeries	 into  river
Bokaro	 except that there was negligible seepage  from	 the
embankment.  It is further stated that the Board  considered
all the aspects and for further improvement it directed	 the
management  of	the  collieries for removal  of	 the  settle
slurry	from  the tanks.  The Board has	 directed  that	 the
washeries shall perform desludging of the settling tanks  at
regular intervals to achieve the proper	 required  retention
time  for the separation of solids and to achieve  discharge
of  effluents within the standards prescribed by the  Board.
It is further asserted that at present there is no discharge
from  any of the tanks of the Bokaro river and there  is  no
question  of pollution of the river water of  affecting	 the
fertility  of land. In their affidavits files on  behalf  of
the respondent-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">						     11</span>
<p id="p_9">Nos. 4 and 5, they have also denied the allegations made  in
the  petition.	They have asserted that the effective  steps
have  been taken to prevent the flow of the water  discharge
from the washeries into the river Bokaro.  it is stated that
infact	river Bokaro remains dry during 9 months in  a	year
and  the  question  of pollution of water  by  discharge  of
slurry	into  the  river  does	not  arise.   However,	 the
management of the washeries have constructed from  different
ponds to store the slurry.  The slurry which settles in	 the
pounds	is collected for sale.	The slurry  contains  highly
carbonaceous  materials and it is considered  very  valuable
for  the purpose of fuel as the ash contents are almost	 nil
in  the coal particles found in the slurry.  Since,  it	 has
high  market value, the Company would not like it to  go  in
the  river water.  The Company has taken effective steps  to
ascertain  that	 no  slurry escapes from its  ponds  at	 the
slurry	is highly valuable.  The Company has been  following
the  directions issued by the State Pollution Control  Board
constituted under the 1974 Act.
</p><p id="p_10">     On	 the facts as appearing from the pleadings  and	 the
specific averments contained in the counter-affidavit  filed
on  behalf  of the State Pollution Control Board  of  Bihar,
prima  facie  we do not find any good reason to	 accept	 the
petitioner's  allegation that the water of the river  Bokaro
is being polluted by the discharged of sludge or slurry into
it  from  the washeries of the respondent-company.   On	 the
other  hand we find that the State Pollution  Control  Board
has taken effective steps to check the pollution.  We do not
consider  it necessary to delve into greater detail  as	 the
present	 petition  does	 not appear to have  been  filed  in
public	interest instead the petition has been made  by	 the
petitioner in his own interest.
</p><p id="p_11">     On	 a perusal of the counter-affidavit filed on  behalf
of  the	 respondent  Nos.  4  and  5  it  appears  that	 the
petitioner  has	 been purchasing slurry from  the respondent
Nos.  4 and 5 for the last several years.  With the  passage
of time he wanted more and more slurry, but the	 respondent-
company refused to accept his request.	The petitioner is an
influential businessman, he had obtained a licence for	coal
trading, he tried to put pressure through various sources on
the  respondent-company for supplying him more	quantity  of
slurry	but  when  the Company refused	to  succumb  to	 the
pressure, he started harassing the Company.  He removed	 the
Company's  slurry  in  an unauthorised manner  for  which  a
Criminal Case No., 173 of 1987 under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_26">Sections 379</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_27">411</a> of
the  Indian Penal Code read with <a href="/doc/361626/" id="a_28">Section 7</a> of the  Essential
Commodities  Act was registered against the  petitioner	 and
Pradip	Kumar his brother at Police Station Mandu, which  is
pending before-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">						  12</span>
<p id="p_12">the Sub-Judge, Hazaribagh.  One Shri Jugal Kishore  Jayaswal
also filed a criminal complaint under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_29">Section 379</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_30">411</a> of
the IPC against the petitioner and his brother Pradip  Kumar
in   the   Court  of  Judicial	Magistrate,   First   Class,
Hazaribagh,  which  is	also pending  before  the  Court  of
Judicial  Magistrate, 2nd Class Hazaribagh.  The  petitioner
initiated several proceedings before the High Court of Patna
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a> of the constitution for permitting him  to
collect slurry from the Raiyati land.  These petitions	were
dismissed on the ground of existence of dispute relating  to
the title of the land.	The petitioner filed a writ petition
C.W.J.C.  No.  887 of 199o in the High Court  of  Patna	 for
taking	action against the Deputy  Commissioner,  Hazaribagh
for  implementing the Full Bench judgment of the Patna	High
Court  in  Kundori Labours Cooperative Society Ltd.  &amp;	etc.
etc. v. State of Bihar &amp; Ors., AIR 1986 Patna 242 wherein it
was  held  that	 the slurry was	 neither  coal	nor  mineral
instead it was an industrial waste of coal mine, not subject
to  the provisions of the Mines and Mineral (Regulation	 and
<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_32">Development)  Act</a>,  1957.  Consequently	 the  collection  of
slurry which escaped from the washeries could be settled  by
the  State Government with any person without obtaining	 the
sanction of the Central Government.  The petitioner has been
contending  before the High Court that the slurry which	 was
discharged from washeries did not belong to the Company	 and
he was entitled to collect the same.  Since the	 respondent-
company prevented the petitioner from collecting slurry from
its  land and as it further refused to sell  any  additional
quantity  of slurry to him, he	entertained  grudge  against
the  respondent-company.  In order to  feed fat his personal
grudge	he  has	  taken	 several  proceedings  against	 the
respondent-company including the present proceedings.  These
facts are quite apparent from the pleadings of	the  parties
and the documents placed before the Court.  Infact,there  is
intrinsic  evidence in the petition itself that the  primary
purpose of filling this petition is  not to serve any public
interest  instead it is in self-interest as would  be  clear
from  the prayer made by the petitioner in the interim	stay
application.  The petitioner claim interim relief from	this
Court permitting him to arrest/collect sludge/slurry flowing
out   of the washeries of the respondent Nos. 4 and   5	 and
with   a direction to the State of Bihar, its officers	 and
other  authorities  for not preventing him  from  collecting
the sludge/slurry and transporting the same.  The prayer for
the interim relief made by the petitioner clearly  indicates
that  he   is  interested  in  collecting  the	slurry	 and
transporting the same for the purposes of his business.	  As
already	 state a Full Bench of the  Patna High	Court	held
that   the  slurry was not coal and the	 provisions  of	 the
Mines  and    Mineral (Regulation  and	 <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_33">Development)	Act</a>,
1957  were not applicable, the State Government was tree  to
settle the same-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">						       13</span>
<p id="p_13">and   the Tata Steel &amp; Iron  Co. had no	 right	to   collect
the   slurry   which  escaped  from  its   washeries.	 The
respondent-company  filed  an  appeal	before	this  Court.
During	  the	pendency  of  the   aforesaid  appeal,	 the
petitioner   filed   the  present  petition.	The   appeal
preferred  by  the Tata Iron &amp; Steel  Co.  Ltd.	 and  Bharat
Coking	Coal Ltd. was	allowed by this	 Court and  judgment
of  Patna  High Court was set aside.  The judgment  of	this
Court  is  reported in Judgments today Vol. 3  1990  SC	 533
wherein it  has been  held that the slurry/coal deposited on
any and continues to be coal and the State Government has no
authority  in  law  to deal with the  same  and	 the  slurry

provides  for  an extraordinary procedure to  safeguard	 the
Fundamental  Rights  of	 a  citizen.  Right  to	 live  is  a
fundamental  right under Art 21 of the Constitution  and  it
includes the right of enjoyment of pollution free water	 and
air  for  full enjoyment of life. If anything  endangers  or
impairs	 that  quality	of life in  derogation	of  laws,  a
citizen	 has  right  to	 have recourse to  Art,	 32  of	 the
Constitution  for  removing the pollution  of water  or	 air
which may be detrimental to the quality of life.  A petition
under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_35">Art.   32</a>  for	the  prevention	 of   pollution	  is
maintainable at the instance of affected persons or even  by
a  group of social workers or journalists.  But recourse  to
preceeding under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_36">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution should be taken
by  a  person  genuinely interested  in	 the  protection  of
society	 on  behalf  of	 the  community.   Public   interest
litigation  cannot be invoked by a person or body or  person
to  satisfy his or its personal grudge and enmity.  if	such
petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_37">Article 32</a>, are entertained it would  amount
to  abuse of process of the Court, preventing speedy  remedy
to  other  genuine  petitioner from  this  Court.   Personal
interest  cannot  be enforced through the  process  of	this
Court  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_38">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution in the garb  of  a
public	interest  litigation.  Public  interest	  litigation
contemplates legal proceeding for vindication or enforcement
of  fundamental	 rights of a group of persons  or  community
which  are not able to enforce their fundamental  rights  on
account of their incapacity, poverty or ignorance of law.  A
person invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_39">Art. 32</a>
must  approach	this  Court  for  the  vindication  of	 the
fundamental  rights  of	 affected persons and  not  for	 the
purpose of vindication of his personal grudge or enmity.  It
is  duty of this Court to discourage such petitions  and  to
ensure	that  the  course of justice is	 not  obstructed  or
polluted   by	unscrupulous  litigants	 by   invoking	 the
extraordinary  jurisdiction  of	 this  Court  for   personal
matters under the garb-
