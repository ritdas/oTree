<p id="p_1">      Ext.P6 consent to operate issued to the 9th respondent by

the Environmental Engineer, District Office, Kerala State Pollution

Control Board, Kalpetta, Wayanad under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">section 25</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">section 21</a> of

challenge in this writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India wherein the petitioner also prays for a writ in

the nature of mandamus directing the 12th respondent (Senior

Environmental Engineer, State Pollution Control Board, Kozhikode)

to consider Ext.P11 representation filed by him and pass

appropriate orders thereon after affording him an opportunity of

being heard.

limitation prescribed for filing an appeal is thirty days.       The

appellate authority is also empowered to entertain the appeal

after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if the appellate

authority is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by

sufficient cause from filing the appeal in time. Under <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_10">section 33B</a>

of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

established under <a href="/doc/50331181/" id="a_14">section 3</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,

2010.    Such being the situation I am of the opinion that the

petitioner should invoke the appellate remedy available to him

instead of seeking the intervention of this Court.

The Dy.Director, Mining &amp; Geology, 2006 (1) KLJ 401, which

was a case arising under the Minor Mineral Concession Rules,

1967, held that when the statute provides remedies by way of

appeal and second appeal followed by a review there is no

justification in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India. The same is the situation in the

case on hand where the petitioner has two remedies by way of

appeal, one before the appellate authority and a further appeal

before the National Green Tribunal. Such being the situation, I

am of the opinion that the petitioner should invoke the appellate

remedies available to him instead of seeking the intervention of

this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_4">      I accordingly decline jurisdiction and dismiss the writ

petition, leaving open the contentions of both sides and without
