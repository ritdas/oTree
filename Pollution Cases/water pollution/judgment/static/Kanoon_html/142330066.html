</pre>
<p id="p_1">       1.      The Applicants have filed the present application under
       Section 14 and 15 of NGT Act 2010 against the Respondent No 5
       i.e. the Cement Plant of M/s Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd.,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">(J) Appln. No.64/2012                                                       6</span>
        alleging that it is being operated in contraventions of the
       provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a> 1986, Air
       (Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution) Act</a> 1981 and Water
       (Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Pollution) Act</a> 1974. The Applicants
       claim to be agriculturists and have their own lands near
       Respondent No.5 Company. It is the case of the applicants that
       Respondent No 5 has not provided proper facilities for disposal of
       liquid and solid wastes, proper drainage system for disposal of
       poisonous chemical and water dust/ powder containment
       System in its cement plant and repeatedly, it is noticed that the
       pollution is spread away in the nearby areas of the cement
       company which has destroyed valuable crops, trees, vegetables,
       wells and agriculture lands of the agriculturists.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2        The applicants submit that on the night of 1st May, 2011,
       an accident took place in the cement plant of Respondent No 5
       company due to which poisonous dust and powder spread over
       the nearby areas. The said accident was so severe that poisonous
       gas, cement dust had spread over the nearby area and destroyed
       all the agricultural products grown in the nearby vicinity of the
       cement company. The chemicals used in the cement company
       were also spread over in the nearby areas and agriculture lands
       of the farmers and hence most of the agricultural products,
       trees, grains and standing crops burnt away in the said
       accidental emissions from Respondent No 5 industry.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3       The applicants have claimed to have made various
       representations to several authorities as well as local MLA with a
       request to enquire into the matter and send the team of expert

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(J) Appln. No.64/2012                                                   7</span>
        officers in connection with accident which took place in the
       cement plant of Respondent No 5, to verify its adverse effects and
       verify the losses occurred by the agriculturists and to pay
       compensation while taking suitable remedial measures. The
       Applicants further submit that the Forest and Environment
       Department vide letters dated 10/05/2011 and 13/05/2011
       informed that their application was forwarded to Gujarat
       Pollution Control Board (GPCB).
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4      The applicants further state that in view of the several
       requests and representations, Respondent No 2 i.e. GPCB
       investigated the place in question only on 27/05/2011 and
       carried out the investigations. The Applicants came to know that
       the Respondent No 5 company has paid compensation to some of
       the agriculturists by causing discrimination. They again made
       representations to the authorities praying that the poisonous
       dust had spread over up to approximately 5 Km radius from the
       Cement Plant and therefore, compensation should be paid to all
       the farmers in that area. The Applicants further requested the
       authorities vide letter dated 16/07/2011 along with the copy of
       complaint dated 14/07/2011 to carry out the necessary visits,
       inspection and survey in order to take appropriate action for
       compensation to the agriculturists. The applicants further
       submit that the Respondent Nos.1 &amp; 2 i.e. GPCB vide letter
       dated 18/07/2011 directed the Respondent No 3 i.e. Collector to
       take appropriate action as per the law. The applicants further
       submit that in view of the several representations and requests
       made by the MLA, Respondent No 1 i.e. GPCB vide letter dated
       12/08/2011 informed that the payment of the compensation to
       be made to the affected persons does not fall within the

 jurisdiction of the Board. The Respondent No 4 that is District
Agriculture Officer also vide their letter dated 18/09/2011
informed that the issue regarding payment of compensation does
not fall within its jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5      The Applicants further submit that the Respondent No 5
carried out a survey of the damages to the agriculture due to
accident      occurred    on   1/05/2011   and   selectively   paid
compensation based on the findings of the report that 40 % loss
has been suffered by the farmers. The Applicants further submit
that similar accident and leakage of poisonous gases again
happened on 16/07/2011. The Applicants therefore, prayed that
in spite of several requests and number of representations made
to the several authorities, the Respondent No 5 did not bother to
pay any compensation to all the farmers affected by the pollution
caused in the above accidents. The Respondent authorities also
did not take any action against the said company either for
causing serious pollution or for non-payment of compensation to
the affected farmers. Hence they have filed this application. The
applicants have prayed for following directions :
</p>

    with regard to damage/loss suffered by the applicants in
    respect of pollution done in the agricultural lands and

       Ambient Air Quality Monitoring. The Respondent No.5 further
       submits that though the stack emission standards are stipulated
       as 100 mg/Nm3, they have installed glass bag house as main air
       pollution control equipment in a main kiln stack, which helps in
       achieving emission levels well below 30mg/Nm3. The Respondent
       No.5 further submitted that vide their letter dated 07/05/2011,
       they had informed the Regional Officer of GPCB, Respondent No

       chopped of the material jammed in it. Hence the operation of the
       plant was again stopped on 01/05/2011 at 12:30 AM for further

       quantity of the raw material powder got accumulated at the floor
       of the cyclones No 6, approximately 100 mts high from the
       ground level, resulting in the material being spread out in
       fraction of time, due to high wind speed around the area. The

       The affidavit of the CPCB along with the report has been placed

       has raised several areas of concern particularly, the ground
       water pollution which has been linked to the leachate from
       improper storage of the chemical Gypsum in the industry. The
       concentration of the metals (Copper, Iron, Zinc, Magnesium and
       Lead) for selective wells including the applicants wells, are within
       permissible limit, though the concentration of the above metals
       are observed to be more at the farms than those of the referral
       farms. The report also highlights various discrepancies and
       mention that the Gypsum storage is not proper. The Central
       Pollution Control Board further observed that the part of the
       pipeline provided for transferring surface runoff leachate to day
       tank is under ground and could not be traced. Central Pollution
       Control Board has further reported -observation of deposition of
       dust on mango trees/banana trees. One of the important aspect
       of the Central Pollution Control Board report is that the industry

       its source, chemical composition and its impact on concentration
       of the air emissions from the stacks have not been detailed in the

       of excessive air pollution from the cement plant of Respondent

        No 5 company on 1st May 2011 due to which, certain quantity of
       industrial waste dust was dispersed around nearby areas of the
       Respondent No 5 company. It is admitted fact that such
       accidental release happened from a height of about 100 metres
       and therefore, the area of dispersion of the dust need to be
       considered in view of such a height and also the prevailing wind
       tunnel and other Meteorological conditions. It is submitted by
       the Respondent No 5 Company that the said dust was of the
       chemicals containing CaCO3 (Calcium carbonate) and therefore,
       it is a non-hazardous material. The Respondent no 5 industry
       has further submitted the data related to wind direction and
       speed prevailing at the time of accident on 1st May, 2011,
       collected by IMD and has further projected an area, in the
       prevailing wind direction at the time of the accident, which is
       extended up to 3 kilometres in the down wind direction. Though,
       such exercise was expected from the technical experts from the
       Pollution Control Board who are mandated to implement the AIR
       (P and CP) Act 1981, the same has not been submitted or
       separately obtained by the       GPCB. The     state   government
       departments including revenue and agriculture department have
       not conducted any survey or inspections related to effect of
       excessive dust emissions as a result of incident dated 1/5/2011
       on the nearby agriculture, and have carried out inspections only
       in August 2011, in response to complaints regarding another
       incident in July 2011. And therefore, based on records placed
       before the Tribunal, at present, we do not find any reason for
       dis-allowing such projection of impact zone assessment made by
       the industry related to the incident of 1st May 2011. However, the
       claim of the industry that it is non-hazardous material that got

        dispersed needs a closer examination, in view of the fact that
       industry is using various types of hazardous wastes as AFR and
       also using chemical gypsum in its manufacturing process. There
       is no data or chemical analysis of the emissions for the dust
       powder, done by either company or Pollution Control Board.

       ground water which is attributed to the use of chemical sludge
       and also the AFR. It is also admitted that there are certain losses
       to the agriculturists in the vicinity due to the excessive emissions
       from the industrial operations of Respondent no 5 industry,
       resulting from the accident of the 1st May, 2011. The Expert
       Committee appointed by the Respondent No 5 industry itself has
       concluded with a technical criteria to assess the loss caused to
       each field affected due to the dust. Therefore, the claim of the
       industry that the dust which has been dispersed is non-
       hazardous and had not resulted into any damage is technically
       not correct and cannot be agreed upon. However, at this present
       stage, the Tribunal is restricting itself to agreeing with the
       findings that the quantifiable adverse impacts of the dust
       emissions related to 1st May 2011 are within a specific area,
       extending up to 3 kilometres distance in the downwind
       directions. The agricultural farms of the Applicants in present
       applications are said to be more than five (5) kilometres away
       from the industry. Though, there are certain claims and
       photographs of dust accumulated on various agricultural plants

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">(J)Appln.No.64/2012                                                     21</span>
        in applicants farms, in the absence of technical data like its
       composition and also, non-availability of records and reports
       substantiating the fact that this dust is a fall out of the
       industrial emissions of the Respondent No 5, the Tribunal is not
       inclined to accept any claim for compensation payable to the
       applicants and therefore the answer to issue 2, referred above is
       recorded as "NEGATIVE."
</p>
<p id="p_20">       18.    It is an admitted fact that there was an accident resulting
       in excessive       dust emission   from    the   industrial   plant   of
       Respondent No 5 on 1st May, 2011 and the industry claims to
       have           informed   the      State         Pollution     Control
       Board on 7th May, 2011. However, as per the record, there was
       some technical problem in the industrial operations of the
       Respondent Industry, right from the 28th April, 2011 which has
       finally resulted into excessive dust emissions on 1st May, 2011.
       The then Regional Officer, State Pollution Control Board paid
       visit to the industry only on 27th of May and that too with
       reference to the complaint and representations made by the
       applicants and other people which were received by his office
       through the Collector's Office and this has been clearly
       mentioned in his visit report duly acknowledged by the
       Respondents. When the Tribunal posed this query to the
       Respondent No 5, it has been submitted that the said letter has
       been submitted to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board Head
       Office at Gandhinagar on 7th May, 2011. There is no document
       which is placed on record to prove that such letter has been
       delivered to the Regional Officer at Gandhinagar except a courier
       delivery challen dated 10/5/11, which is without seal. Even if, it
       is considered as delivered, it cannot be accepted that a major

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">(J)Appln.No.64/2012                                                          22</span>
         industry of the scale of Respondent No 5 can deem it
       appropriate not to inform such accidental stoppage of the
       industry to the concerned Local Pollution Control Board officials
       immediately, either through phone, email, fax in this era of
       speedy communication. And this is more particularly relevant
       when the industry is aware that its excessive dust emissions
       must have caused damages to the agriculture in the surrounding
       and therefore, it had itself formed a panel of experts to evaluate
       such damages immediately on 1st May, 2011. Even under the
       various environmental regulations, it is mandatory for the
       industry to inform the regulators as well as local administration
       about any accident which is results into damage and pollution.
       Therefore, the Tribunal records that the industry has erred in
       not informing the authorities immediately about the accident,
       the resultant air pollution, and its adverse impacts. This
       amounts to derliction in legal duty.

<p id="p_21">       19.    The Respondent No 1 i.e. GPCB is a special statutory
       organisation constituted under the provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a> and
       <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>, which is mandated to take various steps to prevent and
       control the Water and Air Pollution in the State of Gujarat. The
       Applicants have raised various issues related to inadequate
       provision of air pollution control systems, non-operation of
       pollution control systems and also damages due to excessive
       pollution caused due to industry. It may be noted that there is
       no detailed response filed by the Respondents No 1 and 2 on
       various points raised by the applicants.    As mentioned above,
       only on specific instances pointed out by the Tribunal, the then
       Regional Officer has filed limited response defending his actions
       done while investigating the above accidents. We fail to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">(J)Appln.No.64/2012                                                   23</span>
        understand why such detailed response has not been filed by the
       GPCB, and the concerned officer has been left alone to defending
       his actions. It is strange that even after the query by this
       Tribunal about legality of such directive, no response is filed by
       the GPCB, implying that the GPCB officer was duly empowered
       to give the directive that the matter for compensation claimed
       may be settled by the Respondent No 5 Company with the
       claimants by mutual agreement. This is very surprising way of
       dealing        with   claims       put   forth   without    conducting    any
       independent enquiry by the authority.
</p>
<p id="p_22">       20.             The then Regional Officer, GPCB has filed a detailed
       Report of CPCB which was placed before the Hon'ble High Court
       of Gujarat in the special Civil Application 7125/2010 which
       shows various inadequacies in the pollution control systems of
       the    respondent       No     5    Company.     Further,    based   on   the
       investigations carried out by the then Regional Officer of State
       Pollution Control Board, GPCB itself had issued proposed
       directions under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Section 31-A</a> of Air Act on 11th July, 2011. All
       such notices, visit Reports and directions have not been
       presented before this Tribunal along with its follow up actions, if
       any, and therefore, we are constrained to record that actions of
       the GPCB in the instant matter are not proper, scientific and as
       per law. The GPCB, as a technical organisation specially created
       under the statute was expected to help this Tribunal with a
       scientific data on the nature of emissions, chemical composition
       of such emissions, assessment of area where the dust could be
       dispersed, considering the local meteorological conditions and
       also, adequacy of air pollution control system. However, there is
       no information or documents which have been placed on record

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">(J)Appln.No.64/2012                                                               24</span>
        by the GPCB in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       21.            It is also an admitted fact that the Regional Officer of
       the Pollution Control Board during his visit to the industry on
       27th May, 2011 has instructed the industry to give compensation
       on mutual understanding basis to the affected farmers as per
       actual damage caused and to inform the GPCB.                   When the
       Tribunal questioned the legality of this directive, the concerned
       officer attended the Tribunal and also, submitted a response
       defending his actions. He has submitted that there is a clause in
       the consent issued by the Board about payment of compensation
       and also, submitted a copy of such consent of some other
       industry on record. The relevant clause is reproduced hereafter:-
</p>
<p id="p_24">          "If is established by any competent authority that the
             damage is caused due to their industrial activities to any
             person or his property. In that case they are obliged to pay
             the   compensation    as    determined     by    the   competent
             authority".
</p>
<p id="p_25">     He has further mentioned the practice followed by the GPCB,
       though no such policy or guidelines have been placed on record.
       The officer has mentioned about the District level compensation
       committee constituted under the specific High Court order under
       the Chairmanship of District magistrate where the Regional
       Officer, GPCB is Member Secretary, though such order or
       constitution of Committee is not placed on record. It is clear from
       the wordings of the consent and also, the fact that there is a
       committee       to   consider    compensation.    In    fact   this   itself
       demonstrates that the concerned officer is not individually

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">(J)Appln.No.64/2012                                                             25</span>
 authorised to order or issue directions for mutual settlement of
compensation. Hence, the defence put forward by the officer is
not acceptable. We hold, therefore, that the directions given by
Regional Officer, GPCB to the respondent industry to mutually
settle the compensation, are bad in law and not within
jurisdiction of GPCB, and can be termed as a covert attempt to
subvert the        legal process.   The    Tribunal     therefore   directs
Chairman GPCB to take suitable action against the concerned
officer and separately issue suitable instructions to all officers of
the Board. A compliance report shall be submitted to Tribunal
within 6 months.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      On the specific query from the Tribunal, the industry has
submitted the online stack emissions monitoring results for April
and May 2011 on daily basis. The Tribunal note that as per the
information submitted by the industry, the emission values for
the kiln dust for the month of May, 2011 range from 0 to 2.02
mg/Nm3 against GPCB permissible limits of 100 mg/Nm 3. The
data submitted by the industry needs a critical review and
examination and if the industry is able to achieve such low
emissions, GPCB may think it appropriate to make the
standards      more     realistic   by    prescribing    relevant    lower
concentrations. Though, we have our own reservations on such
low reported values which needs to be reviewed for the analyser
installation, analyser calibration and also the data sanctity
aspects, yet we direct the GPCB as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_27">   1) To investigate why detailed response has not been filed in
      the Tribunal along with all the technical information and
      take necessary action, if required, against concerned
      officials.

<p id="p_28">           2) Carry out investigations to assess the compliance status
              of industry, adequacy of the air pollution control

              composition of the dust emissions.
</p><p id="p_29">          3) Review the efficacy and accuracy of the continuous
              emission and ambient air monitoring systems at the
              industry.
</p><p id="p_30">              We direct the Member Secretary of the GPCB to submit the
       compliance report on above aspects in next three months.
</p>
<p id="p_31">       22.            We have duly considered written statement received
       by post, sent on behalf of the Applicants. However, once it is
       found that there is no tangible material to hold that the crops of
       the Applicants were impacted due to accidents in question, it is
       difficult to consider the arguments, particularly based upon
       environmental      principles   enumerated     in    the   submission.
       However, this will not come in the way of the Collector or any
       other authority to consider claims of the applicants, if any, in
       case the independent enquiry substantiates any part of the claim
       on the basis of the proof given by them or as a result of the
       enquiry made by the authority. It is an admitted fact that the
       Respondent 5 industry had formed a Committee of experts to
       assist the damages due to emission of the dust during the
       incident occurred on 1st May 2011 and accordingly identified the
       agriculturists, where damage of agriculture has been reported.
       Further the industry has predicted the impacts zone based on
       the emission data as well as meteorological data which is

        extended up to 3 kilometres from the industry in the down wind
       direction. We therefore, deem it proper to direct the Collector and
       District Magistrate to verify whether all the agriculturists in the
       said impact zone have been duly compensated as per the
       formula derived by the Expert Committee formed by the
       Respondent No 5 industry. In case, he observes that some
       farmers have not been compensated he shall ensure that the
       appropriate compensation is released by the industry and
       received by the respective farmers. A compliance report in this
       behalf shall be submitted within three months.

       disposed off. We deem it proper to impose exemplary cost of Rs.
       1 lakh on Respondent Nos.1 and 2 together for non-filing of
       adequate response and not assisting the Tribunal for proper and
       effective adjudication of the matter and also, of Rs. (five) 5 lakhs
       on Respondent no 5 for not immediately informing about the
