</pre>
<p id="p_1">                Petitioner herein is the second accused in Crime No.347 of 2018

of Pudukkadu Police Station for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_1">sections 269</a>, <a href="/doc/1374604/" id="a_2">277</a>

and <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_3">278</a> of the Indian Penal Code and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">section 43</a> of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.       The allegation of the prosecution is that, lorry of the petitioner

herein was used for dumping human faeces into the Manali river. According

to the petitioner herein, in fact, he has leased out the vehicle to one Shaiju

on 10.04.2018 evidenced by Annexure-I agreement. According to him, he is

not in control and management of the affairs of the vehicle at present. So

criminal liability cannot be cast on him, it was contended.

</p><p id="p_3">       3.       The above contention is a matter of investigation. It was

contended by the learned Public Prosecutor that the petitioner herein is

involved in an earlier crime on identical allegation. It seems that the vehicle

has been seized by the police. Having considered this, I do not feel that,

custodial interrogation of the petitioner herein is absolutely essential.

However, he has to co-operate with the investigation.            Accordingly, pre-

arrest bail application of the petitioner herein is allowed as follows.

</p><p id="p_4">                   (i)   Petitioner shall appear before the investigation
              officer within ten days from today and shall undergo
              interrogation. Thereafter, if he is proposed to be arrested,
 B.A.7277/18
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             3</span>


              he shall be released on bail on executing a bond for a sum of
              Rs.40,000/- (Rupees forty thousand only) with two sureties
              for the like sum each.
</p><p id="p_5">                    (ii)    He shall appear before the investigating officer
              as and when called for.
</p><p id="p_6">                    (iii)    He shall co-operate with the investigation,
              which includes, production of any document relating to the
              above vehicle including the original of Annexure-1, if called
              for by the investigating officer in the course of investigation.
</p><p id="p_7">                    (iv)    He shall not threaten, coerce or intimidate the
              defacto complainant or the witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
