  manganese ore quarry and its Beneficiation Plant situated at villages Bharveli, Hirapur,
  Manegaon, Manjhara, Ablajiri and Tawejiri, Tahsil, District Balaghat have been

  initiate action under <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_8">section 19</a> of the 1986 Act. PCB, therefore, issued a letter dated
  13.4.2009 and 07.11.2009 to the Regional Officer, Jabalpur to initiate action against

  be 9376 Metric Ton (MT) in the year 2007-08; 86997 MT in 2008-09 and 7300 MT in
   April, 2009. It is stated that before the Beneficiation Plant has been established and
  became operational, an environmental clearance ought to have been obtained by MOIL,
  as per the requirement of notification dated 14.9.2006. But, no such clearance/sanction
  has been obtained.
</p><p id="p_5">        4. On 22.3.2009, the Department of Environment and Forest, New Delhi given

                                  ad



  issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Steel and subsequent thereto he joined at

                        M




  MOIL before 15.6.2010. It is contended that as per the complaint by the PCB offence
  has been committed from 07.1.2008 to 22.3.2009, therefore, the petitioner No.1 was not
                     of




  the Director of the company and hence, he cannot be held responsible for the acts prior
  to 15.6.2010. It is further claimed that the production capacity of the plant was 3 lacs
              rt




  Ton Per Annum (TPA) of manganese ore. The production is shown in the plant for the
       ou




  years 2007-09 to be below 3 lacs ton, even after the establishment of Beneficiation

  Company was not the Incharge of the operation of day to day business of MOIL,
H




  Balaghat, therefore, the petitioner No.1 cannot be held responsible for the so called
  offence. In this regard, learned senior counsel has placed reliance on the decision in the
  cases of <a href="/doc/460470/" id="a_11">Anita Malhotra vs. Apparel Export Promotion Council and others</a>, (2012) 1
  SCC 520.
</p><p id="p_10">        8.      On behalf of the petitioner No.2 to 5 request is made to quash the Criminal
  Case No.339/2010 registered before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Balaghat on the
  ground that the complaint is lodged by the incompetent authority as there is no order
  authorizing the Regional Officer of the PCB to file the complaint under <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_12">section 19</a> of the
  1986 Act. The contents of the complaint dehors the request of the Central Government
  made vide letter dated 23.3.2009 inasmuch as the request made for launching the
  prosecution for enhancement in production capacity in the Beneficiation Plant without
  environment clearance of the production of the Beneficiation Plant and not for
   enhancement of the production capacity. The complaint, therefore, has travelled beyond
  the mandate of the letter dated 23.3.2009, wherein the Ministry of Environment
  Protection and Forest had directed the State Government to take action against the
  defaulting unit.The petitioner No.1 not a party of the defaulting unit.The production
  capacity for the Balaghat mines had the environment clearance since 1994. Therefore,
  the Act of 1986 is culled out. Environmental clearance has been granted to the mines of
  MOIL at Balaghat and the sanction for enhancement production capacity of 3 MTPA to
  5 MTPA has been accorded by the Ministry of Environment and Forest. Therefore, the
  complaint against the petitioners is high-handedness and cavalier behaviour on the part
  of the respondents. It is also argued that the notification dated 27.1.1994 makes it
  axiomatic that the environment clearance would be required for expansion or




                                                                   sh
  modernization of any activity, if the pollution load exceeds the existing one or new
  project listed in Schedule-I of the notification. Hence, the environmental clearance




                                                            e
  would have been required only for expansion or modernizatoin of activity. This is not




                                                         ad
  the case in the instant factual matrix. The MOIL has been carrying out its production


                                                   Pr
  with 3 lac MTPA capacity and expansion or modernization has been done with prior
  environment clearance. Hence, there is no violation of the notification dated 27.1.1994
                                          a
  or circular dated 13.10.2006. In this background the complaint tantamount to abuse of

  process of law and deserves to be quashed in limine.

  Appraisal of Mining Project constituted under the Environment Impact Assessment

  reported to be under construction for which work had started prior to the EIA

  also argued that in the Summary Record of 23rd meeting of the Expert Appraisal
  Committee for Environmental Appraisal of Mining Project constituted under the EIA

  Notification, 2006 dated 19.1.2009 it has been held that with regard to MOIL of

  Balaghat Manganese Ore Project, Bharveli based on the presentation made and

  discussion held the Committee recommended the project for environmental clearance
  both for the manganese mine and beneficiation plant of 0.5 million TPA capacity. It is

  further argued that the PCB under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a>, 1974 has given the environmental
  clearance for 3 lac MTPA vide letters dated 24.10.2006 and 18.8.2008. Hence, the total
  production including the beneficiation plant has not exceeded the production capacity,
  therefore, it would not be appropriate to hold that the petitioners have committed any
  offence.
</p><p id="p_12">        10.      On behalf of the respondent it is contended that the MOIL established a
  new plant i.e. Beneficiation Plant and commissioned the same without obtaining the
  environmental clearance from the Government of India under the Environment Impact
  Assessment Notification dated 14.09.2006 and without obtaining the consent of PCB
  under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_14">sections 25</a> of the Water Act, 1974 and <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_15">section 21</a> of the Air Act, 1981. It is also
  submitted that the Environment Clearance under the Notification dated 14.9.2006 issued
  by the Government of India is mandatory, to obtain the consent of PCB. It is mandatory
   to follow the conditions imposed therein. The company applied for environmental
  clearance on 08.12.2006 for enhancement of production of manganese ore and for
  setting up of beneficiation plant. The company established its Beneficiation Plant and
  commissioned the same on 07.1.2008. On 23.3.2009 the Government of India has
  granted environment clearance to the company and the Government of India has also
  informed the State Government about the illegalities committed by the company and
  with regard to violation of notification, therefore, directed to initiate action under
  <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_16">section 19</a> of 1986 Act. On 19.5.2009, the petitioners wrote to the PCB furnishing
  information on production of minerals from the mines including production from
  Beneficiation Plant. The petitioners as officers at the time of offence were incharge and
  are responsible to the company for conduct of the business. Hence are liable for the




                                                                     sh
  offence committed. The Beneficiation plant was commissioned on 07.1.2008 without
  obtaining the environment clearance from the Government of India as required under




                                                              e
  the EIA Notification dated 14.9.2006. This continued commission of offence by




                                                           ad
  operation from 07.1.2008 till date 23.3.2009 on which the environmental clearance was


                                                     Pr
  granted. The petitioners produced minerals without obtaining the environmental
  clearance or consent of the PCB. Hence, are liable for the same. Therefore, prima facie
                                           a
  offence is made out against the petitioners as offered in the complaint.

  irregularity can be cured at a later stage also. In his concluding remarks during

  of interference under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_18">section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is very limited. The
  Court has to exercise its jurisdiction sparingly and when there is prima facie case against
