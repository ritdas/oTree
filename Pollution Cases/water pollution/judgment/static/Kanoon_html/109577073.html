</p><p id="p_7">1.             The Delhi Development Authority issued an advertisement on

its website on 20.03.2006 announcing DDA‟s first public-private

participation project involving auction of prime residential land at Tehkhand

in South Delhi. As per the said announcement, the new initiative to involve

the private sector in Delhi‟s development was taken to meet the new

challenges of an ever evolving capital city and its growing housing needs.

By virtue of the said announcement, the DDA invited private parties for the

development of the composite project area of 14.3 hectares of prime land at

Tehkhand in South Delhi for building 750 premium residential flats to be

 sold by private real estate development on free sale basis, with a maximum

FAR of 80000 sq. metres and maximum ground coverage of 15000 sq.

metres. As regards the location of the project area, it was mentioned that

Tehkhand is located in the heart of South Delhi next to Kalkaji Extension

near the sprawling commercial complex of Nehru Place and Okhla

Industrial Estate. The private real estate companies were free to develop,

construct and market these 750 high quality homes in a self contained

community with facilities like school, community centre, neighbourhood

convenience store and other spaces as per the DDA norms.


</p><p id="p_8">2.             In addition to the above, the developer would have to construct

3500 re-settlement houses for the economically weaker sections of society,

of 26 sq. metres each (super area) as per the DDA‟s specification with

facilities like schools, neighbourhood playground, park community hall,

health centre, convenience store etc. It was also stipulated that all re-

settlement houses and the developed common facilities would be handed

over to the DDA for allotment. The said project was to be allotted through

auction to be held on 26.04.2006 at 10:30 am at the DDA Auction Hall,

Vikas Sadan, New Delhi.

<p id="p_12">By virtue of clause 2(i) of the said terms and conditions, the intending

bidders were required to deposit a sum of Rs 1 crore with the officer

conducting the auction immediately on entering the auction hall, as a

condition to participate in the auction. As per Clause 2(vi) of the said

general terms and conditions, it was stipulated that the person whose bid is

accepted by the officer conducting the auction, shall be required to pay at

the fall of hammer, that is, latest by 4:00 pm on the day of auction, a sum

equivalent to 25% of the bid offered as earnest money deposit. Clause 4 of

the terms and conditions of the auction provided that the allotment-cum-

demand letter would be issued by the DDA to the highest bidder after

acceptance of the bid by the authority and the highest bidder would be

required to deposit the balance 75% amount of the bid offered for the

project within 90 days of the issuance of the allotment-cum-demand letter.

Clause 5 of the terms and conditions of the auction stipulated that the

possession of the project area excluding approximately 4 hectares on which

there is a JJ cluster, would be given after payment of the balance 75% of the

bid and the execution of the developmental agreement.

</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">5.             Amongst others, the petitioner made a bid at the said auction

held on 26.04.2006. The petitioner‟s bid of Rs 450.10 crores was the

highest and as per the condition of the auction, the petitioner deposited a

sum of Rs 111.52 crores representing 25% of the bid amount by way of

earnest money deposit on that date itself. This was, of course, in addition to

the sum of Rs 1 crore already deposited for the purposes of participating in

the auction. Thereafter, the DDA issued a demand-cum-allotment letter

dated 15.06.2006 in favour of the petitioner. It is relevant to note that the

nature of property in the demand-cum-allotment letter was shown to be

"residential". The balance amount of Rs 3,37,50,75,016/- was required to

be paid by the petitioner.         The same was paid by the petitioner on

11.09.2006. Consequently, the petitioner had paid the entire bid amount of

Rs 450.01 crores to DDA by 11.09.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">6.             On 05.09.2007, the petitioner and the DDA entered into the

development agreement. By a letter dated 06.11.2006, the DDA, in view of

the fact that the balance 75% had also been paid by the petitioner, issued a

no objection certificate in favour of the petitioner for submission of building

plans in respect of the Tehkhand project to the building department of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC 10647/09                                                          Page No.4 of 29</span>
 DDA. Possession of an area of 11.70 hectares had also been handed over to

the petitioner, leaving out an area of approximately 2.60 hectares which was

covered by a JJ Cluster, on 04.12.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">7.             On 21.11.2007, the DDA issued a letter to the petitioner that the

work was to be completed within a period of three years, that is, up to

04.09.2010 and that the possession had been handed over on 04.12.2006 but

the work had not been started and it appeared that the petitioner would be

unable to complete the work on time and, therefore, a show cause notice

was given to the petitioner as to why a penalty of 0.5 % of the bid amount

should not be imposed on the petitioner in terms of clause 57 of the

agreement. By a letter dated 27.03.2008, the petitioner informed the DDA

that although the DDA had permitted the petitioner to establish the site

infrastructure facilities including the construction of a sample flat for the

economically weaker sections, the Forest Department had raised objections

to the petitioner carrying out any work on the ground that the said area falls

within the ridge area and consequently all activities had to be suspended.

The petitioner indicated that because of the said suspension of work, it was

incurring huge losses on account of idle manpower and equipment.


</p><p id="p_20">8.             Again, a letter was written on 15.04.2008 by the petitioner to the

DDA indicating that the land clearance documents had not yet been passed

on to the petitioner by the DDA so as to enable the petitioner to proceed

with the establishment of site infrastructural facilities and also to ensure

timely completion of the project. A further letter was written on 22.04.2008



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WPC 10647/09                                                         Page No.5 of 29</span>
 to the Vice Chairman, DDA, informing him that during the past several

weeks officials from the Forest Department had been visiting the project site

and had cautioned the petitioner‟s representatives not to carry out any

activity thereon as the same was a prohibited area. Consequently, it was

requested that the matter be taken up with the Forest Department and the

DDA should issue a letter in favour of the petitioner permitting the

petitioner to continue the development activities at the project site.


</p><p id="p_21">9.             By a letter dated 28.04.2008 addressed to the Secretary

(Environment)-cum-Chairman, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the

DDA referred to the meeting the said Secretary had with the Vice Chairman,

DDA on 08.04.2008 when the issue of land use of Tehkhand housing

project being developed by the DDA on public-private partnership was

discussed. As per the said letter, the matter had been examined in detail by

the DDA and it was confirmed that as per the Delhi Master Plan (MPD-

2021), the site under reference was designated under "residential" use

complying with the gazette notification dated 08.01.2002 in respect of land

measuring 12.4 hectares and gazette notification dated 23.02.2006 for 3.6

       "Ridge" has been defined in the Master Plan for Delhi

       North of Mehrauli Badarpur Road and east of Tughlakabad
       Fort (copy of relevant portions of MPD 2001 are enclosed for
       ready reference). The project site at Tehkhand, is thus clearly a
       part of Ridge, as described in MPD 2001. This fact has also
       been ascertained by a field visit myself with the officers of
       Forest Department. In view of the provisions contained in the
       MPD 2001 and orders passed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court in

Chairman, DDA, New Delhi requesting that the "ridge demarcation report",

as required by the DPCC, be provided to the petitioner in order to enable the

petitioner to submit the same to the DPCC. Shortly thereafter, the petitioner

also sent a letter to the DPCC on 10.02.2009, indicating that the approach of

the DPCC was apparently of jeopardizing the prestigious flagship public-

private partnership endeavour of the DDA inasmuch as the issue of the

 project land falling within the ridge, already stood clarified and settled by

the DDA as per the letter dated 17.10.2008 addressed to the Secretary

(Environment)-cum-Chairman, DPCC. The petitioner also stated in the said

letter that the issue had time and again been clarified by the DDA.

However, it seemed that the DPCC was bent on ensuring that the JJ dwellers

rehabilitation project undertaken by the Delhi Government is derailed for

reasons best known to them. The petitioner, once again, requested the

DPCC to issue the "consent to establish" under the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>s for

the project at the earliest so that construction activity could be commenced

without any further delay.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">17.            In reply to the petitioner‟s request for supply of the "ridge

demarcation report", the DDA sent a letter dated 10.02.2009 to the

petitioner, stating that the reply dated 17.10.2008 earlier sent to the

Secretary-cum-Chairman, DPCC clarified all the issues. The petitioner,

being frustrated in its endeavour to obtain the "consent to establish" from

the DPCC and the clearance to go ahead with the project, sent a letter to the

Vice Chairman, DDA on 18.02.2009 indicating that the project had been

floated at least three years ago and it had been represented by the DDA that

the land measuring 14.3 hectares was residential in nature. The petitioner

had responded to the said notice for auction and was the highest bidder in

the said auction at Rs 450.01 crores. The petitioner had also, as mentioned

above, paid the entire sum of Rs 450.01 crores. Yet, the petitioner was not

able to go ahead with the project because of the dispute with regard to the

land use of the project land. The DDA had throughout represented the

 project land to be residential in nature but the same had been challenged and

rejected by the Secretary (Environment)-cum-Chairman, DPCC by asserting

the same to be falling within the ridge area and, therefore, entailing that no

construction could be carried out thereon. Despite repeated requests, the

petitioner had not been able to obtain the consent from the DPCC under the

Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>s for the said project. It was further pointed out that the

petitioner had been made to run from pillar to post to obtain various other

clearances, permissions, consents. It was further stated that the DDA, as the

owner of the project land, had not only failed to get the title of the project

land cleared inasmuch as the nature of the land being residential or part of

the ridge still remains an issue in limbo, with the Environment Department,

Government of NCT of Delhi claiming it to be a „ridge‟. The petitioner

thereby called upon the DDA to ensure that all the necessary permissions

specifically linked with the land use be obtained within 15 days from the

date of the said letter and the other obligations pertaining to clearance of the

project land rendering it suitable for development of the prestigious project

be fulfilled, failing which the petitioner would be left with no other option

but to initiate legal action against the DDA and also claim damages.


</p><p id="p_37">18.            On 24.02.2009, the DDA, once again, wrote to the Secretary

(Environment)-cum-Chairman, DPCC, Delhi that the clarification on the

land use had already been furnished by virtue of the DDA‟s letter dated

17.10.2008 and that in the light of the contents of the said letter, it was clear

that the land in question was not part of the ridge land and had been legally

converted from recreational use (District Park) to residential. Consequently,

 it was requested that the "consent to establish" under the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water

present writ petition, inter alia, seeking the setting aside of the tender/

15.06.2006 and sought a declaration that the project was incapable of

 procedure laid down in the Delhi Development Act, 1957, had been

changed from recreational use (District Park) to residential vide

notifications dated 08.01.2002 and 23.02.2006. It was stated that at that

point of time, no suggestions/ objections were received in respect of the

land use from any department of Government of NCT of Delhi, including

the Forest Department or by the DPCC. No objections were received either

at the time of preparation of MPD-2001/ preparation of zonal plan of zone

„F‟ or while processing the change of land use of the land at Tehkhand.


</p><p id="p_42">21.            It was further stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the DDA

that zonal plan for zone „F‟ was prepared under the provisions of MPD-

2001 which were notified for inviting objections/ suggestions on 15.01.1994

and in response to this notification, 72 objections / suggestions were

received, which were considered by the authority in its meeting held on

09.06.1997 and thereafter, the plan document was approved on 15.06.1998

by the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. It was further

stated that as per MPD-2001, the area of the ridge was recognized as 7777

hectares and in the land use plan of MPD-2001 such ridge was identified.

Therefore, at that time, the boundary of the ridge had been delineated. It

was further denied that the DDA at the time of the tendering process had

wrongfully or intentionally misrepresented the land use of the land of the

proposed project. This is so because the land use of the area in question

was residential as per the said notifications modifying the Master Plan. In

paragraph 25 of the said affidavit, it has been stated that the land use of the

project land was residential and the said area was never identified as the

Management Board (created under orders of the Supreme Court) in respect

of the said land nor was there any objection or reference received from the

DPCC. It was stated that the DDA had initiated the project based on the

notification issued by the Government regarding change of land use from

recreational use to residential use. It was further stated in the affidavit that

as per MPD-2021 the ridge demarcation exercise was to be taken up by the

Government of NCT of Delhi and till such time the provisions of MPD-

2001 were to continue. Consequently, the stand taken by the DDA is that

the project land was not part of the ridge and the land use for the same was

residential. The further stand of the DDA is that it had not made any

misrepresentation with regard to the land use of the project land and,

therefore, there is no reason for it to scrap the tender/ auction.


</p><p id="p_43">22.            The counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the Department of

Forests (respondent No.4) reveals that during the month of March, 2008, a

complaint had been received in the Environment and Forest Department that

trees were being felled by developers at the project site. On inspection, it

was found by the Forest Department officials that the site was

morphologically part of the Delhi ridge and was contiguous to the extension

of the Aravalis extending up to and beyond the remnants of Tughlakabad

and Adilabad Forts. Consequently, the DDA was advised to proceed further

with the project only after obtaining approval of the competent authority for

use of land in the ridge for the project. The said affidavit then goes on to

refer to the Supreme Court directions in WP(C) 4677/1985 with regard to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">WPC 10647/09                                                         Page No.16 of 29</span>
 preservation of the ridge. A reference was also made to the provisions of

MPD-2001 and particularly to the observations therein that no further

infringement of the ridge is to be permitted and that it should be maintained

in its pristine glory. Paragraph 9.2.2 of the said Master Plan deals with

regional park and the same is as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "The Aravali Range in the NCT of Delhi comprises of the
       rocky outcrop stretching from the University in the North to the

       continuum as various intervening stretches have, over a period
       of time, been brought under urbanization-for example the
       Central Ridge area was planned as an integral part of New
       Delhi as the Capital in the early part of the twentieth century.

 also pointed out in paragraph 11 of the said affidavit that certain features

have been identified as being relevant for classifying any area as being part

of the ridge. One of the relevant features was to consider whether the land

in question was recorded as „gair mumkin pahar‟ in the revenue record. It

is further stated in the counter-affidavit that the project site is situated in

Khasra Nos. 444 and 445, village Tehkhand and is shown as „gair mumkin

pahar‟ in the revenue record and, therefore, the said area would be within

the morphological ridge as per the geological survey of India map. The

affidavit further clarifies that the area in question is not part of a notified

forest and is outside the „regional park‟ as per existing land use plan

contained in MPD-2021. It is further stated in the said affidavit as under:-

       construction activity in the area. DDA has contested this

 27.10.2009 felt that it would be appropriate to be informed about the

decision taken by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of

India and Mr Chandhiok, the learned Additional Solicitor General, who was

present in Court, had sought time to take instructions in this regard. On

05.11.2009, Mr Chandhiok submitted that some more time be given to him

to receive final instructions. Two weeks further time was granted. On that

date, that is, on 05.11.2009, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

petitioner submitted that they had a proposal whereby the principal amount

of approximately 450 crores be returned to the petitioner upon them giving

an undertaking that in case the permissions are obtained by the DDA and

there is clearance to construct, they would return the money within two

weeks. This Court had directed that the concrete proposal containing all the

details be submitted to the Vice Chairman, DDA within two days and that

the response of the DDA in respect of the proposal be placed before Court.

As noted in the order dated 25.11.2009, the concrete proposal had been

submitted by the petitioner to the Vice Chairman, DDA on 06.11.2009 and

that even a personal hearing had been granted but no response had been

received from the DDA till then.         As recorded in our order dated

04.12.2009, the learned counsel for the DDA informed that after the

meeting of the representative of the petitioner with the Vice Chairman,

DDA and after the proposal submitted by the petitioner was considered, a

letter has been issued by the Vice Chairman, DDA to the petitioner on

01.12.2009, which is self-explanatory. Thereafter, as no further instructions

were received from the Union of India, the matter was heard.

<p id="p_47">25.            Coming back to the counter-affidavits filed by the respondents,

we are left to consider the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent

No. 2 (DPCC). The stand taken is that the project area falls in Khasra

Nos. 444 and 445 of village Tehkhand which, according to the DPCC, falls

within the ridge area as informed by the Forest Department, Government of

NCT of Delhi on the ground that the land is „gair mumkin pahar‟ and is

within the morphological ridge as per geological survey of India map. The

said affidavit also refers to a meeting held at Raj Niwas on 20.05.2009

between the officers of DDA, Government of NCT of Delhi and the

Lieutenant Governor wherein the Forest Department pointed out that the

entire project falls in Khasra Nos. 444 and 445 of village Tehkhand and is

within the ridge area and the revenue records also indicate the Khasra Nos.

444 and 445 as „gair mumkin pahar‟. It was also mentioned that the land



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">WPC 10647/09                                                      Page No.21 of 29</span>
 being part of the ridge came within the Supreme Court judgment relating to

the ridge and hence any construction would be in violation of the Supreme

Court‟s order on the subject. The affidavit further goes on to state that

having considered the stand of the DPCC and the DDA, the Lieutenant

Governor directed the DDA to verify from records the status of land in

Khasra Nos. 444 and 445 observing that if the land falls within the ridge, it

would be best to abandon the project in view of the Supreme Court‟s

judgment on the subject. Finally, it was stated in the said affidavit that the

DPCC would consider the project only after clarification from the DDA and

the Forest Department.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">26.            The foregoing demonstrates the controversy between the parties.

The petitioner‟s stand is that it had made the bid for the project and had paid

the entire amount of Rs 450.01 crores on the clear understanding that the

project site was residential. This understanding, according to the petitioner,

was based on the representation made by the DDA as the detailed facts

referred to above would reveal. In fact, the DDA has maintained and

continues to maintain its stand that the project site is not within the ridge

area and the land use of the same has been clearly shown as residential.

According to the DDA, the land in question was earlier earmarked for

recreational (District Park) purposes.      However, that was subsequently

altered by the two notifications dated 08.01.2002 and 26.02.2006 by

carrying out modifications in the Master Plan (MPD-2001). The stand of

the DDA is also this that the land use of any particular area is to be

determined under the Master Plan and the authority which does such


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">WPC 10647/09                                                      Page No.22 of 29</span>
 determination is the DDA and not any other authority, such as the DPCC.

The clear stand of the DDA is that the DPCC has no right or business to

raise any objection with regard to the land use and that is solely within the

domain and powers of the DDA. The stand of the DDA is, however, not

accepted either by the DPCC or the Department of Forests, Government of

NCT of Delhi. In fact, both the DPCC and the Department of Forests

(respondents 2 and 4 herein) along with the Government of NCT of Delhi

(respondent No.3) have taken a unified stand that the land in question falls

within the ridge and more so because the Department of Forests has found

the said land to be part of Khasra Nos. 444 and 445 of village Tehkhand

which, in the revenue record, has been shown as „gair mumkin pahar‟.

Thus, according to the said respondents, no construction activity can be

carried out in the land in question inasmuch as, according to them, it falls

within the ridge area. Consequently, the DPCC has refrained from issuing

the "consent to establish" under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>s, which was a

requirement and a condition of the clearance given by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests, Government of India.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">27.            It is in this backdrop that the petitioner felt that there is virtually

no chance of the project going ahead in view of the stalemate between the

DDA and the various governmental departments. It is on the basis of this

situation that the petitioner has sought the setting aside of the tender /

auction as also the allotment letter dated 15.06.2006 in its favour and has

sought the return of the money paid by it along with interest thereon.

in Delhi? If the land use is to be determined by the DDA through the

publication of the Master Plan, then the question arises as to whether the

DPCC or the Department of Forests can object to a particular land use? We

find that the Delhi Development Authority has been constituted under

Section 3 of the Delhi Development Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as the

„said Act‟). <a href="/doc/760991/" id="a_9">Section 6</a> sets out the objects of the DDA and they have been

specified to be the promotion and securing of development of Delhi

according to plan. For this purpose the DDA has been given the power to

acquire, hold, manage and dispose of land and other property, to carry out

building, engineering, mining and other operations, to execute works in

connection with supply of water and electricity, disposal of sewage and

other services and amenities and generally to do anything necessary or

expedient for the purposes of such development and for the purposes of

incidental thereto.

</p><p id="p_54">29.            <a href="/doc/1533428/" id="a_10">Section 7</a> of the said Act requires the DDA to carry out a civic

survey and prepare a master plan for Delhi. The master plan, by virtue of

<a href="/doc/1533428/" id="a_11">Section 7(2)</a> of the said Act, is to define the various zones in which Delhi

may be divided for the purposes of development and indicate the manner in

which the land in each zone is proposed to be used and the stages by which

any such development shall be carried out. The master plan is to serve as a

basic pattern of framework within which the zonal development plans of

various zones are to be prepared. <a href="/doc/119227/" id="a_12">Section 8</a> provides for the preparation of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">WPC 10647/09                                                        Page No.24 of 29</span>
 zonal development plans. <a href="/doc/119227/" id="a_13">Section 8(2)</a>, inter alia, stipulates that a zonal

development plan may contain a site plan and use plan for the development

of the zone and show the approximate locations and extents of land uses

proposed in the zone. The elaborate procedure to be followed in the

preparation and approval of plans is given in <a href="/doc/1387816/" id="a_14">Section 10</a> of the said Act.

<a href="/doc/546828/" id="a_15">Section 11A</a> provides for the modifications to the master plan and the zonal

development plan. <a href="/doc/546828/" id="a_16">Section 11A(3)</a> specifically provides that before making

any modifications to the plan, the DDA or, as the case may be, the Central

Government shall publish a notice in such form and manner as may be

prescribed by rules made in this behalf inviting objections and suggestions

from any person with respect to the proposed modifications before such date

as may be specified in the notice and shall consider all objections and

suggestions that may be received by the DDA or the Central Government, as

the case may be. Furthermore, sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/546828/" id="a_17">Section 11A</a> stipulates that

every modification made under the provisions of this section shall be

published in such manner as the DDA or the Central Government, as the

case may be, may specify and the modifications shall come into operation

either on the date of the publication or on such other date as the DDA or the

Central Government may fix. Sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/546828/" id="a_18">Section 11A</a> stipulates that

if any question arises as to whether the modifications proposed to be made

by the DDA are modifications which affect important alterations in the

character of the plan or whether they relate to the extent of land uses or the

standards of population density, the question shall be referred to the Central

Government whose decision thereon shall be final. <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_19">Section 14</a> stipulates



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">WPC 10647/09                                                     Page No.25 of 29</span>
 that after the coming into operation of any of the plans into the zone, no

person shall use or permit to be used any land or building in that zone

otherwise than in conformity with such plan.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">30.            From these provisions, it is clear that the making of the master

plan and the zonal plans goes through an elaborate procedure. Even the

modification carried out to any of these plans has to go through a series of

steps which include the inviting of objections and the consideration thereof.

From these provisions it is clear that the stand taken by the DDA that once

the master plan shows the land in question as earmarked for a particular use

then no other authority can challenge the same. The master plan and the

zonal plans are prepared by the DDA and they have a statutory flavour.

Once the DDA has gone through the formalities required under law in

preparing the master plan and/ or the zonal plans and/ or in carrying out any

modifications therein, the land use of a particular area would stand

determined as per the said plans. The stand of the DDA throughout has

been that the land in question has been earmarked for residential use and,

therefore, it is clearly outside the ridge area.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">31.            We may also observe that when the Ministry of Environment and

Forests, Government of India, gave its environmental clearance in terms of

the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, one of the

conditions was that the petitioner should obtain the "consent to establish"

from the DPCC under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_20">Air Act</a>s. The DPCC‟s role was,

therefore, confined to examining the grant or non-grant of the „consent to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">WPC 10647/09                                                      Page No.26 of 29</span>
 establish‟ within the four corners of the said Acts. Instead of doing so, the

DPCC, as indeed the Department of Forests, NCT of Delhi, have brought up

the controversy as to whether the land in question falls within the ridge area

or not. We may also point out that the Supreme Court directions with

regard to maintaining the ridge relate only to those areas which have been

clearly identified as part of the ridge. When the land owning agency as also

the authority which prepares the master plan clearly and categorically states

that the land in question does not fall within the ridge area and the land use

is residential, we fail to see as to how the DPCC or the Department of

Forests, NCT of Delhi can raise any objection on this account. In fact, the

Department of Forests (respondent No.4) had clearly stated in their affidavit

that the project land does not fall within a regional park and is also not a

notified forest. That being the case, it would not be open to the Department

of Forests (respondent No.4) to go on to say that the project site falls within

the ridge area.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">32.            Therefore, we are of the view that the stand taken by the DDA

that the land use of the project site is residential stands established. It

cannot be said that the DDA misled the petitioner when it represented that

the project site was to be used for residential purposes. Consequently, at

this stage, the petitioner cannot claim that the tender/ auction be set aside

and the project be abandoned and the money paid by it be returned to the

petitioner along with interest thereon. However, at the same time, we feel

that the petitioner would be wronged if no directions are given to the

respondents 2, 3 and 4 to, stick to their brief and consider the case of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">WPC 10647/09                                                      Page No.27 of 29</span>
 petitioner from the standpoint of granting or not granting the "consent to

establish". While the DPCC has to consider this aspect of the matter, it

should do so by considering the parameters under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a>s

alone and should not trespass into areas which are within the domain and

control of the DDA.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">33.            Consequently, we feel that although the petitioner would not be

entitled as of now, to the prayer of setting aside the tender/ auction as also

the letter of allotment and to the return of money paid by the petitioner to

the DDA, the petitioner would be entitled to a direction, though not

specifically asked for in this petition, to the DPCC to examine the

application of the petitioner for grant of "consent to establish" from the

standpoint of the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_22">Air Act</a>s alone within two months from the date

of this judgment. We also feel that it would be just and fair that in case such

consent is not given by the DPCC and the project cannot be carried any

further, the petitioner would be entitled to return of the entire sum paid by it

to the DDA inasmuch as the project would stand frustrated and would be

incapable of performance. The petitioner would be entitled to the return of

the said sums along with interest at the rate of 6% per annum till realization,

in such eventuality. We are making this direction because we feel that the

State or any statutory body cannot appropriate any citizen‟s money without

reason. The whole object of the petitioner making the bid and paying the

said amount was to go ahead with the project. When the project itself

cannot be gone ahead with, for no fault on the part of the petitioner, there is

absolutely no reason as to why a statutory body, such as the DDA, could be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">WPC 10647/09                                                       Page No.28 of 29</span>
 permitted to retain the amount of money paid by the petitioner. That would

virtually amount to extortion by a statutory body and such a thing would

clearly be onerous, arbitrary and unreasonable. The state or any statutory

body performing public functions are not expected to „deprive‟ individuals

or businesses of their money without authority of law.

    With the aforesaid directions, the writ petition stands disposed of.
