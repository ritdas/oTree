                      and fallacious stand before the NGT that Kazhuveli lands do not come under

                      the Category of Water areas / Wetlands / Marshlands and hence do not

                      enjoy any protection against re-classification, alienation or transfers for

                      alternate uses. The above contention raised by the Respondents would

                      amount to a clear case of contempt of the orders of this Court as well as

                      the Hon'ble Apex court. It was the submission of the Petitioner that the

                      Respondents have submitted before the NGT that only those portions of the

                      Pallikkaranai Marshlands, which had been transferred to the Forest

                      department, shall be entitled to protection and that all the lands lying

                      adjacent to the Buckingham Canal and classified as 'Kazhuveli lands’ are

                      marshland areas by an order dated 18.11.2016 in Crl.O.P.No.4413 of 2013

                      and sought details of existing constructions for issuing further directions in

                      the matter. It was also pointed out that despite such an order, the

                      Government had passed the above impugned Orders, which are liable to be

                      quashed, being void and un-enforceable. The Petitioner further stated that

                      the Respondents have admitted in their Counter Affidavits before the

                      Tribunal that the above lands are lying 10 feet below the ground level and

                      need to be filled up with earth / rubbish to construct the proposed

                      buildings. Therefore, it was conceded by the Government itself that the

                      said lands are nothing but Wetlands / Marshlands acting as a buffer area

                      between the Buckingham Canal and the nearby residential areas during

                      heavy rains/floods. It was the case of the Petitioner that the Respondents

                      had also admitted in their Counter Affidavits before the NGT that the above

                      area remains under water for 4 to 5 months in a year, which is typical of the

                      nature of Wetlands that perform the dual roles of acting as a buffer area to

                      store excess water during rains / floods and recharging of wells and ponds in

                      the neighbourhood and enhancement of ground water levels. It was further

                      case of the Petitioner that the total area of Marshlands in Pallikaranai area

                      had struck to less than 10% of what it was about 40 years ago, which had

                      resulted in more quantity of Water, flowing into the Buckingham Canal

                      during rains than what it used to be earlier. Thus, it was stated that it is

                      marshlands are protected from further extinction by preventing any kind of

                      transfers / alternate usage, which would destroy the basic nature and use

                      of such water bodies and cause floods. It was further stated that he had

                      submitted a Representation to the Respondents on 31.03.2017, seeking to

                      revoke the above cited two G.Os. and to take necessary steps to restore and

                      maintain the whole extent of 24.93.0. Hectors of the above Kazhuveli Lands

                      Respondents to stop all activities in the Marsh land and Canal Kaluveli in

                      areas in question, had approached this Court. The very same issue raised

                      herein was appraised before the NGT and the same was elaborately dealt

                      with by the NGT. Subsequently, the NGR, by order dated 02.08.2017, held

                      that the disputed land in S.No.707 is neither a water body nor a backwater

                      nor a Marsh land, by further holding that the 7 acres of land transferred to

                      the 5th Respondent Transport Department vide G.O.Ms.No.25 is for the

                      public purpose and construction. It was further held by the NGT that it was

                      not necessary to restrain the State for utilizing the land for the construction

                      of the structures for the 5th Respondent transport department. Insofar as

                      the remaining land in S.No.707, it was observed by the NGT that the same

                      could be put to use after obtaining the opinion of the Tamil Nadu Wet Lands

                      Regulatory Authority to the effect that any proposed construction therein

                      conducted to ensure that no trees, ancient symbols, costly buildings, etc

                      are located. Thereafter, it was decided to transfer the said land for public

                      utility and the Government also accepted the recommendations of the

                      regarding usage of these lands by the Departments is covered by the order

                      expeditious justice and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in several other

                      judgments observed that findings of the expert bodies in technical matters

                      need not be interfered with. The further stand taken was that the lands

                      transferred to the Departments are not directly connected to the sea or

                      reported Judgement dated 07.05.2015 of Four Member Full Bench of the

                      National Green Tribunal Bench, New Delhi in Application No.222 of 2014,

                      has vehemently contended that when the maintainability of simultaneous

                      proceedings under NGT Act and Writ Petition, came for consideration, it

                      was held as under:

                             genesis of the respective proceedings that they are entirely
                             distinct and different in their scope and relief. The issues
                             before the Tribunal would essentially relate to environment,
                             ecology and its restoration and have to be essentially a civil
                             proceeding. While the proceedings before the High Court
                             relate to entirely different issues i.e. the acquisition of land,
                             its allotment and its transfer to third party. Thus, the issues in
                             both the proceedings are neither substantially nor materially
                             identical. Both jurisdictions have to operate in different

                             taken by the Respondent does not satisfy the basic ingredients
                             to attract the application of res judicata or constructive res

                      at the extreme end of the S. No. 707 , subject to the conditions prescribed

                      therein, leaving aside the determination of the nature of the lands to the

                      of the proceedings before the NGT, which also took note of the factum of

                      had refrained from expressing any view or issuing any direction to the

                      claim of Res-judicata is highly unsustainable.Above all, the NGT cannot

                      which come under the ambit of Public Trust Doctrine. The contention of the

                      Petitioner was that the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate

                      Change has notified the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules,

                      2017, replacing the Wetlands Rules, 2010 and has prescribed various powers

                      and functions of the State Level Wetland Authority under Sub-rule No.7,

                      such as identification, demarcation, notification and preparation of a brief

                      document for each of the Wetland identified for notification within a period

                      of one year from the date of publication of the Rules. Hence, any future

                      activities on the disputed wet lands shall be subject to the provisions of the

                      newly notified Wetland Rules, 2017 only. A careful reading of the findings of

                      the NGT, especially Paragraph Nos.46 r/w Para No.28 would transpire that

                      though the subject lands may be wetlands, they were not notified wetlands

                      under the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010 and

                      therefore, no protection can be claimed under the said Rule. By relying

                      upon those few lines, it was argued by the Learned Counsel for the

                      Petitioner that the NGT did not completely agree with the averments raised

                      by the Respondents therein that the lands are neither water bodies nor

                      backwater nor Marsh land, as it had stated that those lands were not

                      notified under the Wetland Rules, 2017 and it was not known as to whether

                      the disputed lands are among the 2,01,503 wetlands, subjected to the

                          doctrine. Under the Roman Law these resources were either
                          owned by no one (Res Nullious) or by every one in common
                          (Res Communious). Under the English common law, however,
                          the Sovereign could own these resources but the ownership
                          was limited in nature, the Crown could not grant these

                          that were suitable for these uses were deemed to be held in

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                     "The source of modern public trust law is
                              found in a concept that received much attention in
                              Roman and English law - the nature of property rights
                              in rivers, the sea, and the seashore. That history has
                              been given considerable attention in the legal
                              literature, need not be repeated in detail here. But
                              two points should be emphasized. First, certain
                              interests, such as navigation and fishing, were sought
                              to be preserved for the benefit of the public,
                              accordingly, property used for the those purposes
                              was distinguished from general public property which
                              the sovereign could routinely grant to private
                              owners. Second, while it was understood that in
                              certain common properties - such as the seashore,
                              highways, and running water - "perpetual use was
                              dedicated to the public," it has never been clear
                              whether the public had an enforceable right to
                              prevent infringement of those interests. Although the
                              state apparently did protect public uses, no evidence
                              is available that public rights could be legally
                              asserted against a recalcitrant government."</blockquote><p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">                                 17. The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the
                          principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters and the
                          forests have such a great importance to the people as a whole

                            that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of
                            private ownership. The said resources being a gift of nature.
                            They should be made freely available to everyone irrespective
                            of the status in life. The doctrine enjoins upon the
                            Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the
                            general public rather than to permit then- use for private

                      decided on 28.07.2010, wherein it has been held as under:

                            the term 'Marsh' means, 'an area of low-lying land which is
                            flooded in wet seasons or at high tide, and typically remains
                            waterlogged at all times. In Geography, a 'marsh', or 'morass', is
                            a type of wetland that is subject to frequent or continuous
                            flood, typically the water is shallow and features grasses,

                            clearing the encroachers in the area, no prudent man could say
                            that the land continues to be a marshy one, since it will be
                            unfit for human habitation. It is also within the knowledge of

                            the possibility of sea water flowing to the land in question is
                            completely ruled out. Further more, no cultivation could be

                      in question fall within unobjectionable category and are, therefore, suitable

                      for assignment and since the land was below road level by few feet, there

                      was water stagnation during certain months, which alone is not a critereia

                      same again before this Court and she prayed that since the above

                      Governments in respect of delegation of notification of wetlands.

                      Therefore, it was argued that Ministry of Environment and Forests / R9 has

                      no concern with the present issue on hand and it is for the State

                      and 12.72.00 Hectors of land in S.No.707/3 to the Sixth Respondent by

                      manner, will be prejudicial to the Public Interest, inasmuch as those lands

                      are the main source for storages of excess water during rains, being

                      released from Pallikkaranai Marsh lands into the Buckingham Canal through

                      “Thoraipakkam-Okkiam-Madav”. According to him, on account of such

                      fauna and living creatures and any attempt of conversion of lands will, not

                      preservation and protection of ecologically sensitive areas, such as

                      that the rain water is getting stagnated in those lands occassionally, had

                      decided to transfer the Kazhuveli lands for the use of public by other

                      departments. The other plea raised was that the Writ Petition is not at all

                      maintainable on the principle of res judicata, as the Writ Petitioner, having

                      not achieved his object in other Forum, namely, the NGT, has invoked the

                          predominantly be a matter fit to be decided by the
                          judiciary, as judiciary alone would be possessed of
                          expertise in this field and secondly the constitutional
                          and legal protection afforded to the citizen would
                          become illusory, if it were left to the executive to
                          determine the legality of its own action. The
                          Constitution has, therefore, created an independent
                          machinery i.e. judiciary to resolve disputes, which is
                          vested with the power of judicial review to determine
                          the legality of the legislative and executive actions and
                          to ensure compliance with the requirements of law on
                          the part of the executive and other authorities. This
                          function is discharged by the judiciary by exercising the
                          power of judicial review which is a most potent weapon
                          in the hands of the judiciary for maintenance of the rule
                          of law. The power of judicial review is an integral part
                          of our constitutional system and without it, there will
                          be no government of laws and the rule of law would
                          become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                          The judicial review, therefore, is a basic and essential
                          feature of the Constitution and it cannot be abrogated
                          without affecting the basic structure of the
                          Constitution. The basic and essential feature of judicial
                          review cannot be dispensed with but it would be within
                          the competence of Parliament to amend the
                          Constitution and to provide alternative institutional
                          mechanism or arrangement for judicial [pic]review,
                          provided it is no less efficacious than the High Court. It
                          must, therefore, be read as implicit in the
                          constitutional scheme that the law excluding the
                          jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227
                          permissible under it, must not leave a void but it must
                          set up another effective institutional mechanism or
                          authority and vest the power of judicial review in it
                          which must be equally effective and efficacious in
                          exercising the power of judicial review. The tribunal set
                          up under the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_33">Administrative Tribunals Act</a>, 1985 was

                          311 in quite a large number of cases. Therefore, the
                          personnel manning the administrative tribunal in their
                          determinations not only require judicial approach but

                              of constitutional and administrative law. The efficacy of
                              the administrative tribunal and the legal input would
                              undeniably be more important and sacrificing the legal
                              input and not giving it sufficient weightage would
                              definitely impair the efficacy and effectiveness of the
                              Administrative Tribunal. Therefore, it was held that an
                              appropriate rule should be made to recruit the
                              members; and to consult the Chief Justice of India in
                              recommending appointment of the Chairman, Vice-
                              Chairman and Members of the Tribunal and to constitute
                              a committee presided over by Judge of the Supreme
                              Court to recruit the members for appointment. <a href="/doc/1738908/" id="a_34">In M.B.

                              to the Judges of the High Court, this Court held that
                              they are not on a par with the judges but a separate
                              mechanism created for their appointment pursuant

                              meant by this Court in Sampath Kumar case ratio is that
                              the tribunals when exercise the power and functions,

                              meant that the tribunals are substitutes of the High
                              Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the

                          Section 29 of the NGT Act (supra). Thus, a conjoint reading of

</p>
<p id="p_104">                          93. Before moving on to other aspects, we may summarise our
                          conclusions on the jurisdictional powers of these Tribunals. The
                          Tribunals are competent to hear matters where the vires of
                          statutory provisions are questioned. However, in discharging this
                          duty, they cannot act as substitutes for the High Courts and the
                          Supreme Court which have, under our constitutional set-up, been
                          specifically entrusted with such an obligation. Their function in
                          this respect is only supplementary and all such decisions of the
                          Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of
                          the respective High Courts. The Tribunals will consequently also
                          have the power to test the vires of subordinate legislations and
                          rules. However, this power of the Tribunals will be subject to one
                          important exception. The Tribunals shall not entertain any
                          question regarding the vires of their parent statutes following the

                          settled principle that a Tribunal which is a creature of an Act
                          cannot declare that very Act to be unconstitutional. In such cases
                          alone, the High Court concerned may be approached directly. All
                          other decisions of these Tribunals, rendered in cases that they
                          are specifically empowered to adjudicate upon by virtue of their
                          parent statutes, will also be subject to scrutiny before a Division
                          Bench of their respective High Courts. We may add that the
                          Tribunals will, however, continue to act as the only courts of first
                          instance in respect of the areas of law for which they have been
                          constituted. By this, we mean that it will not be open for litigants
                          to directly approach the High Courts even in cases where they
                          question the vires of statutory legislations (except, as mentioned,
                          where the legislation which creates the particular Tribunal is
                          challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
                          concerned.

                          that the Tribunal has powers of judicial review akin to that of a

                          jurisdiction that was, in the felicitous language of
                          Gajendragadkar, C.J., in Re: Special Reference, (1965) 1 SCR 413,
                          made in the following words:
</p><p id="p_113">                          We ought to make it clear that we are dealing with the question
                          of jurisdiction and are not concerned with the propriety or
                          reasonableness of the exercise of such jurisdiction. Besides, in
                          the case of a superior Court of Record, it is for the court to
                          consider whether any matter falls within its jurisdiction or not.
                          Unlike a Court of limited jurisdiction, the superior Court is
                          entitled to determine for itself questions about its own
                          jurisdiction. "Prima facie", says Halsbury, "no matter is deemed to
                          be beyond the jurisdiction of a superior court unless it is
                          expressly shown to be so, while nothing is within the jurisdiction

                      is right in issuing the impugned orders for transfer of Kazhuveli Lands for

                      the public use by way of construction of huge buildings on it. A scrutiny of

                      the counter filed by the Third Respondent itself reveals that there are

                      chances of stagnation of rain water during rainy season and therefore, it

                      can be presumed that such wetlands undoubtedly play a vital role in the

                      hydrological cycle on account of its wide ranging ecosystem services, like

                      water supply and purification, water assimilation, buffering extreme events

                      of floods, etc. The nature cannot be predicted and it is beyond human

                      knowledge and wisdom and it cannot be said that the wetlands will always

                      remain as dry lands without water. It is the stand of the Government that

                      the Kazhuveli lands in question are proposed to be used for public use by

                      way of setting up a transport office and tourism place and it is astonishing

                      to note that during rainy season, especially when the building constructed

                      thereon was surrounded by water, how can the Public make use of the

                                                          Written by Thiruvalluvar, a Historical Poet
                      The Literal meaning of the above Poem is that wherever it whirls, the work

                      must follow the farmer. Thus, despite hardships, farming is the best. It is

                      pertinent to mention that there is a separate chapter called 'Farming' with

                      Kural 1031 to 1040 to illustrate the importance of agriculture. In Kural 11 to

                      20 ('Van Sirappu' - The Blessing of Rain), the Poet has emphasised the

                      importance Rain.

                      if the Government itself converts the paddy lands into sky touching

                      buildings (like fence eating crops), where will the farmers go for doing

                      agricultural work?. Though People practice different religions in our

                      country, the feel of hungriness unites all [(in other words in Tamil grp

                      te;jhy; gj;Jk; gwf;Fk; (if the hungry comes, the power will fly)] and

                      they all depend on the farmers irrespective of creed, caste and religion.

                      Bharathi suggested by way of a Poem that the excess water from the Bengal

                      Region may be used to irrigate (and cultivate) the other areas of our

                      country and insisted upon the need to link Rivers and said poem has been

                      composed in a song form in the Movie "Kappalottiya Thamizhan". Actually,

                      we do not require any excess water to be brought from the Bangal Region, if

                      we properly store it in the Wetlands, instead of letting it run to the Ocean.
