 M/s Dex Agro Sweetners (Private) Limited
                                      .............Petitioner

                                    Versus

 Uttarakhand Environment Protection &amp; Pollution Control
 Board
                                     .......Respondent

Present:- Mr. Vipul Sharma, Advocate for the petitioner.
           Mr. Shiv Pandey, Advocate for the respondent.

 Hon'ble Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. (Oral)
</pre><p id="p_1">                   Admittedly, an inspection of the petitioner's
 factory was carried out and thereafter a report was
 submitted to the effect that the petitioner's factory does
 not    have     the    Effluent     Treatment        Plant     in    working
 condition. Subsequently, the Uttarakhand Environment
 Protection and Pollution Control Board passed an order
 dated     6.4.2018       under      <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section      33-A</a>     of   the    Water
 (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 directing
 closure of the petitioner's factory. Being aggrieved, the
 petitioner has preferred the present writ petition before
 this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_2"> 2.                Although, the order dated 06.04.2018 is
 appellable under <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_3">Section 33-B</a> of the Water (Prevention
 and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, but the ground raised
 by the petitioner before this Court is that sub-rule (3) of
 Rule 34 of the Rules framed under the Act, provides that
 before issuing any direction under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33-A</a> of the
 Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, at least 15
 days' prior notice shall be given to the person concerned.
 Admittedly, it has not been done in the present case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>
<p id="p_3">3.           Learned counsel for the respondent relied
upon sub-rule (6) of Rule 34 which provides that in case
where the Board is of the opinion that there is likelihood
of imminent danger to the environment, this notice may be
dispensed with but with the reasons to be recorded in
writing for dispensing with such notice. However, in the
impugned order no such reason or finding is given, as
contemplated under sub-rule (6) of Rule 34 of the Water
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1975.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.           Considering that since the respondent has
closed the factory of the petitioner without providing an
opportunity of hearing and since Rule 34 has not been
complied with and presently the petitioner's factory is
lying closed, let a post-decisional hearing be given to the
petitioner by the respondent.         The    petitioner   shall
apprise all relevant facts to the respondent and thereafter
the Uttarakhand Environment Protection &amp; Pollution
Control Board shall take fresh decision and pass the order
afresh under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_7">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. In case, the respondent
Board comes to the conclusion that the factory is actually
polluting the environment, closure order, as contemplated
under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_9">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, shall be passed. Since the order
has to be passed afresh, the Board is directed to consider
all the relevant parameters as well as pleas of the
petitioner and then pass a speaking and reasoned order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           With directions/observations as above, the
writ petition stands disposed of.
</p>
