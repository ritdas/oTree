     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY

                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">VIKRAMAJIT SEN, C.J. (Oral) :
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The Government has by Notification dated 18.09.2012

appointed Dr.Ayi Vaman N.Acharya, as Chairman, Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board, for a period of three years from

the date of his taking over charge.    This is stated to be in

accordance with <a href="/doc/874572/" id="a_1">Section 4(2)(a)</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     3</span><p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">        2. During the hearing of this petition, interim order

came to be passed on 04.09.2012, principally because of the

fact that adhoc appointment had been made vide Notification

dated     01.09.2012,        whereby    Sri.R.Sridharan,    Principal

Secretary, Forest, Environment and Ecology Department had

been given additional charge of the Chairman, Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board, with effect from 04.09.2012

until further orders.        Although several grounds had been

raised,   interim    order    was   passed   principally   on   adhoc

appointment.        With the Notification dated 18.09.2012, the

nomination is to be for a period of three years from the date

of taking over charge.        It is in these circumstances that we

are persuaded to recall the interim order dated 04.09.2012.


</p><p id="p_5">        3. In these circumstances, the Writ Petition is disposed

of reserving liberty to the petitioner to assail the said

nomination on any ground that they may find relevant.

</p><p id="p_6">        Ordered accordingly.
