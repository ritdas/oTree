                            ORDER/JUDGMENT


PRESENT:
Hon'ble Dr. Justice P. Jyothimani (Judicial Member)
Hon'ble Dr. Ajay A. Deshpande (Expert Member)




                                     2
         Delivered in the open court by the Hon'ble Justice P.Jyothimani, JM

1.    Both the Applications No. 07/2013 and 10/2013 were transferred from the

Hon'ble Principal Bench to this Tribunal which in turn were originally filed as

Writ Petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur. As

the issues involved in both the cases are common, both the applications are taken

together for passing a common order. For the sake of convenience, we take up the

Application no. 10/2013 at the first instance.

2.    Application No. 10/2013

The applicant herein M/s Cox India Ltd. is a private Company registered under the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> and started with an object of carrying on a distillery unit originally

with a capacity of 9 lakh unit per year, for rectified spirit (country liquor) and that

was started in the year 1995. It was at that time, the applicant company was

permitted to run the unit with the capacity of 3 KL per day on molasses based

manufacturing of liquor. Later, it was in the year 2006 or in the later part of 2005,

the applicant has submitted an application for additional grant of 8 KL per day as

expansion, with the respondent namely the State Pollution Control Board and

originally an order was passed by the State Pollution Control Board on 24.01.2006

giving consent to establish for distillery unit on grain basis with 8KL per day. The

grievance of the applicant in the above application is that the Pollution Control

Board which has granted its consent on 24.01.2006, has unilaterally and in an

arbitrary manner cancelled the same by the impugned order dated 07.12.2006 and

that order has been challenged in the said application contending inter alia that the

order, suffers from the      violation of principles of natural justice, since, no

opportunity was given before the impugned order of cancellation was made, that

the order cannot be passed under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_2">Section 33</a> (A) of Water Act, 1974 and that the

Pollution Control Board Authority having already decided              as seen in the

                                          3
 communication dated 18.08.2006 that the grain based distillery unit is certainly

less pollutant as compared to the molasses based unit and therefore the impugned

order is contradictory in nature. It is seen that, originally the applicant Company

was allowed to run the distillery unit for producing 3 KL per day on molasses basis

and it was while running the same they have made the aforesaid application for

the purpose of expansion to have the additional capacity of 8 KL on grain based

distillery. According to the applicant, the impugned order passed by the State

Pollution Control Board refers to certain communication of the Central Pollution

Control Board dated 18.08.2006 wherein and according to the State Control Board,

it amounts to a direction and therefore, based on the said directions they have taken

action under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_3">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 and passed the impugned order withdrawing the permission to establish

already granted to the applicant and according to the applicant, the communication

of the Central Pollution Control Board cannot be treated as a direction given as per

statue and at the most, it can be taken as a letter which has no statutory value and

Central Pollution Control Board's letter cannot be the ground for the State

Pollution Control Board to act and pass the impugned order.


3.    Application No. 07/2013

      The other application No.07/2013 has been filed by an applicant namely

Balram Raikwar which was originally filed by way of Writ Petition before the

Hon'ble High Court of M.P. seeking for a mandamus against the State Pollution

Control Board to take appropriate legal action against the Respondent no. 4, M/s

Cox India Ltd., who is the applicant in application no. 10/2013 and also to take

action against the Regional Officer of MPPCB, Sagar, who has filed false report.

The contention raised in the said application are also similar to that of the project

proponent in the other case, but opposing the original clearance given to the

                                         4
 applicant in application no. 10 of 2013. The applicant has chosen to state that the

distillery unit namely the project proponent has been given 67.5 acres of land by

Govt. of M.P. by way of exchange, on condition that, the Company shall establish

the Pollution Control mechanism and also, make plantation of trees all over the

land to make it a green area which would minimise pollution, likely to be caused

by the project, in order to protect the people living in the area. It is also stated that

even though the condition imposed was that the project proponent should plant

3000 trees, there are no such trees available at all and the project proponent has

defied the condition under the pretext that 600 trees have died due to draught and

therefore there is a factual false statement made by the project proponent. It was

on those averments, the petition has been filed for the prayer as stated above.


4.    The State Pollution Control Board as well as the Central Pollution Control

Board have filed their response. In the reply filed by the State Pollution Control

Board before the High Court which has been pending from 2006 onwards, the

State Board has stated that installation of grain based distillery unit is equally

pollutant in its nature. It is also denied that prior notice was not given before

passing the impugned order. It is seen that in the reply affidavit filed by one of the

officer namely the Regional Officer of MPPCB Mr.A.K. Mishra, dated

23.07.2011, who is stated to be no more, it is also reiterated that pollution load of

the grain based distillery is equal to the molasses based distillery and therefore,

both of them are pollutant industries. In the reply filed by the MPPCB, ever since

the date of filing of application by the applicant by way W.P. and also, from the

date of transfer to this Tribunal, till date, there is no averment made by any officer

of the MPPCB about the real existing situation of the project run by the

proponent.

5.    Learned Counsel appearing for the Central Pollution Control Board would

categorically submit that the communication of the official of the Central
                                           5
 Pollution Control Board stated in the impugned order of the State Pollution

Control Board dated 04.05.2006 is not statutory in nature and            the Learned

Counsel also brought to the notice of this Tribunal that even under the said

communication, the CPCB has never directed the State Pollution Control Board to

withdraw expansion proposal and therefore, that letter cannot be the basis for the

State Pollution Control Board to act and pass the impugned order . We certainly

appreciate the frank stand taken by the Learned Counsel appearing for the Central

Pollution Control Board. On a reading of said letter dated 18.08.2006 which is the

basis for the State Pollution Control Board to pass the impugned order it shows in

clear terms, that the distillery may not be allowed to enhance the capacity even if

shifted to grain based and the capacity increase may be considered only after

satisfactory treatment and utilization of effluent is achieved. For the purpose of

understanding the said letter dated 18.08.2006 of CPCB and also, to appreciate as

to whether it can be treated as direction given as per the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a>, it is

appropriate to extract the contents of the said letter which is as follows:

     "This has reference to your letter, dated 04.05.2006 and 30.06.2006 on the

     above subject. It is to inform you that we have monitored one of the grain

     based distillery and results indicates that the pollution load generated is

     comparable to that of a molasses based distillery. Central Board is likely to

     take monitoring of few other grain based distillery. In case, grain based

     distilleries are operative in your State, please provide us the name and

     address of such units so as to take up detailed monitoring.

     In view of the above, the distilleries may not be allowed to enhance the

     production capacity even if shifted to grain based. The capacity increase

     may be considered only after satisfactory treatment and utilization of

     effluent is achieved."



                                          6
 6.    According to the Learned Counsel appearing for the Central Pollution

Control Board, it is true that the Central Pollution Control Board has not taken any

steps so far, as to study whether, the grain based distillery is a more pollutant

industry than the molasses based. However, according to the Learned Counsel the

study is still going on. We deprecate the slackening attitude shown by the CPCB

in this regard as the distillery units in particular are highly pollutant industries and

are covered under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_6">Central Act</a>ion Plan. It was expected of CPCB to complete such

proposed study, more so when, they have given suggestions for not allowing the

expansions to MPPCB vide the above referred letter dated 18.08.2006.

7.    Be that as it may, as it is rightly pointed out by Learned Counsel of CPCB

that by no stretch of imagination the said letter 18.08.2006 can be considered as

statutory in character so that it can be treated as binding on the State Pollution

Control Board.

8.    The Learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the State Pollution

Control Board would submit that it is true that under the impugned order of

withdrawal of permission to establish additional facility, there is no mention about

any show cause notice having been issued to the project proponent before passing

the impugned order. However, according to him, there was a show cause notice

issued to the project proponent on 12.10.2006 asking the project proponent to

submit his objection. Unfortunately, the Learned Additional Advocate General is

unable to produce any record to show that such notice has been served on the

project proponent. Law is well settled, that unless the communication of such

notice is made, it cannot be said to be the compliance of the principles of natural

justice and so we are unable to agree with the contention of the Learned Counsel

that any notice has been given before passing the impugned order of withdrawal.

Further, there is no reference of any such show cause notice in the impugned order

as admitted by the Learned Addl. Advocate General.

                                           7
 9.    There is a reference in the impugned order dated 24.01.2006 which is letter

No. 1025 and it is only permission to establish the additional facility of grain based

distillery in the existing plant for the purpose of increasing capacity of 8 KL per

day. However, there is another reference of letter dated 24.01.2006 bearing letter

No. 1027. Even though the copy of the said letter has not been produced before

this Tribunal, it may be the consent to renewal for the period from 01.11.2005 to

31.10.2006 already granted for the existing consented capacity of rectified spirit, as

elicited in the impugned order itself. A reading of the said letter No. 1025 dated

24.01.2006 shows that the permission is not without any conditions. There are

various conditions imposed. It is the case of SPCB, as per the Learned Addl.

Advocate General, that the project proponent has not at all complied with any of

the conditions and therefore even if it is assumed that no notice is given before

withdrawing the permission of the project proponent for additional capacity, it

cannot as a matter of right claim that it should be entitled for an order of consent to

operate in respect of the additional capacity. According to him, consent to operate

is not a matter of right unless the project proponent complies with all the

conditions of consent to establish. We are in total agreement with the contention

raised by the Learned Addl. Advocate General. In fact, in the said letter imposing

condition, the State Pollution Control Board has also stated that the industry shall

also be liable to comply with all directions given by the CPCB and Ministry of

Environment and Forest. But the question is that in such event, when the project

proponent has not even complied with the conditions for the additional facilities,

where is the need for the State Pollution Control Board under the impugned order

to withdraw the consent to establish additional facilities for grain based distillation,

on the basis of the letter of the CPCB dated 18.08.2006 and without even giving

prior notice.



                                           8
 10.   The Learned Counsel appearing for the project proponent on the other hand

raised various legal issues namely:

         i.   The impugned order is liable to be set aside on the ground of violation

              of the principles of natural justice.

        ii.   The impugned order cannot be issued under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_7">Section 33(A)</a> of the

              Water Act.

       iii.   The State Pollution Control Board, having taken a decision, as seen in

              the communication of its Member Secretary dated 07.01.2011 that

              grain based industry is less pollutant, has chosen to take a

              contradictory stand under the impugned order.

       iv.    In any event, the communication of CPCB dated 18.08.2006 cannot

              be treated as a direction binding on the State Board.

11.    We have heard the Learned Counsel appearing for all the parties including

the Learned Addl. Advocate General appearing for the SPCB, Learned Counsel

appearing for CPCB apart from the Learned Counsel appearing for the project

proponent and the State Government and referred to various papers and

communications filed and given our anxious thought to the issues involved.

12.   The first point which has to be considered is as to whether the impugned

order dated 09.12.2006 suffers from the violation of the principles of natural

justice. The principles of natural justice was originally called under English Law

as natural law. This concept of natural law has been debated for a long time in the

legal parlour as to whether it can be equated or should be treated more than man

made law.     In the Indian context, the question as to whether the term "the

procedure established by law" as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_8">Article 21</a> of the Constitution

of India and "due process of law" used in American Constitution are one and the

same. The term "law" is used in both the terms and therefore, according to one

school of thinking it was felt that both are one and the same. If the same is

                                            9
 accepted, by using the word 'procedure established by law' the Government can

pass any law by following the procedure but taking away the valuable rights of

citizen and that will not be subjected to judicial review.


13.   It was considered in one of the earliest judgment of Constitutional Bench of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India immediately on its commencement, namely

<a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_9">A.K.Gopalan vs. State of Madras</a>, reported in A.I.R (Volume 37) 1950 SC 27. The

first Chief Justice of the Independent India, Hon'ble Justice Kania presiding over

the said Constitution Bench consisting of eminent legal luminaries namely,

Hon'ble Justice Fazl Ali, Hon'ble Justice Patanjali Shastri, Hon'ble Justice

Mahajan, Hon'ble Justice B.K.Mokherjea and Hon'ble Justice S.R.Das, by

majority of 06 judges out of 07 including the Hon'ble Chief Justice, it was held

that the court has to go strictly as per the wordings of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21.</a> When a

contention was raised that the freedom conferred under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_11">Article 19</a> and right to life

conferred under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_12">Article 21</a> are mutually connected to each other, rejecting the

contention it was held that, the said Articles act independent and the freedom given

under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_13">Article 19</a> can never be read together with the right to live granted under

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and they operate in different fields. It was

held that as long as there was a valid law of preventive detention passed by the

Government of India, no citizen can claim his right other than the said law by

invoking the fundamental right of freedom conferred under <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_15">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the

Constitution of India. It was Hon'ble Justice Fazl Ali who has given a contra

judgment who held that the right conferred under the said <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Article 21</a>, has to be read

alongwith freedom conferred under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_17">Article 19</a> which are forming part of the same

part III of the Constitution of India conferring Fundamental Right.

14.   The contra view taken by the Hon'ble Justice Fazl Ali especially in respect

of the principles of natural justice, which was not accepted by majority at that time,


                                          10
 has become a well established law recognized worldwide which is an apt instance

of March of law. It was the contention of Shri M.K.Nambyar, who was in fact

instrumental for bringing the word "procedure established by law" from Japanese

constitution, even if the procedure established by law is followed, the principles of

natural justice being an inherent law of nature contemplates that a person detained

must be informed of the reason for such detention. As stated above, the said

contention was rejected by the majority judges of the Supreme Court in that case.

Holding that the principles of natural justice which are nowhere defined in any law

cannot be accepted as a valid principle of law, Hon'ble Justice Kania, Chief

Justice has observed as follows:

      "Para 18. No extrinsic aid is needed to interpret the words of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_18">Art.21</a>, which

      in my opinion, are not ambiguous. Normally read, and without thinking of

      other Constitutions, the expression "procedure established by law" must

      mean procedure prescribed by the law of the State. If the Indian Constitution

      wanted to preserve to every person the protection given by the due process

      clause of the American Constitution there was nothing to prevent the

      Assembly from adopting the phrase or if they wanted to limit the same to

      procedure only, to adopt that expression with only the word 'procedure'

      pre-fixed by 'law'. However, the correct question is what is the right given

      by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Art.21?</a> The only right is that no person shall be deprived of his life or

      liberty except according to procedure established by law. One may like that

      right to cover a larger area, but to give such a right is not the function of the

      Court; it is the function of the Constitution. To read the word 'law' as

      meaning rules of natural justice will land one in difficulties because the

      rules of natural justice, as regards procedure, are nowhere defined and in

      my opinion the constitution cannot be read as laying down a vague

      standard. ................................................................. The word 'law' as used

                                                 11
       in this part has different shades of meaning but in no other Article it appears

      to bear the indefinite meaning of natural justice. (Emphasis supplied)

15.   Again, brushing aside the contention that the intention of the debators of the

Constituent Assembly to be taken into consideration to infer the principles of

natural justice under the "procedure established by law", Hon'ble Justice Patanjali

Shastri observed as follows:

      " 107. Mr. Nambiar urged that the word "law in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> should be
      understood, not in the sense of an enactment but as signifying the immutable
      and universal principles of natural justice - the jus natural of the civil law -
      and that the expression "procedure established by law" meant the same
      thing as that famous phrase "due process of law" in the American
      Constitution in its procedural aspect. Numerous American decisions were
      cited to show that the phrase implied the basic requirements of, (1) an
      objective and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possible to
      conform, (2) notice to the party of the accusation against him, (3) a
      reasonable opportunity for him to established his innocence, and (4) an
      impartial tribunal capable of giving an unbiased judgment. Mr. Nambiar
      conceded that these requirements might have to be modified or adapted to
      suit the nature of the particular proceeding and the object it had in view, as
      for instance, in a case of preventive detention, previous notice, which might
      result in the person concerned going underground might be dispensed with.
      Learned counsel insisted that these requirements, being the very core of the
      principles of natural justice which transcended all State-made laws, must be
      substantially                                                complied                                            with
      ..............................................................................................................

<p id="p_1">      108.There can be no doubt that the people of India have, in exercise of their
      sovereign will as expressed in the Preamble, adopted the democratic ideal
      which assures to the citizen the dignity of the individual and other cherished
      human values as a means to the full evolution and expression of his
      personality, and in delegating to the legislature, the executive and the
      judiciary their respective powers in the Constitution, reserved to themselves
      certain fundamental rights, so-called, I apprehend, because they have been
      retained by the people and made paramount to the delegated powers, as in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                             12</span>
       the American model. Madison (who played a prominent part in framing the
      first Amendment of American Constitution) pointing out the distinction, due
      to historical reasons, between the American and the British ways of securing
      "the great and essential rights of the people", observed "Here they are
      secured not by laws paramount to prerogative but by Constitutions
      paramount to laws": Report on the Virginia Resolutions, quoted in Near v.
      Minnesota, 288 U.S. 697. This has been translated into positive law in part
      III of the Indian Constitution, and I agree that         in construing these
      provisions the high purpose and spirit of the Preamble as well as the
      constitutional significance of a Declaration of Fundamental Rights should
      be borne in mind. This, however, is not to say that the language of the
      provisions should be stretched to square with this or that constitutional
      theory in disregard of the cardinal rule of interpretation of any enactment,
      constitutional or other, that its spirit, no less than its intendment should be
      collected primarily from the natural meaning of the words used.

      "109. Giving full effect to these principles, however, I am unable to agree
      that the term "Law" in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Article 21</a> means the immutable and universal
      principles of natural justice. "Procedure established by law" must be taken
      to refer to a procedure which has a statutory origin, for no procedure is
      known or can be said to have been established by such vague and uncertain
      concepts as " the immutable and universal principles of natural justice". In
      my opinion, 'law' in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_22">Article 21</a> means 'positive or State-made law'."
      (Emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_2">16.   However, as we stated earlier in the dissenting opinion of Hon'ble Justice

Fazl Ali, while accepting the principles of natural justice as forming part of law,

His Lordship has observed that-

      where there are well known principles with no vagueness about them, which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         13</span>
       all systems of law have respected and recognized, they cannot be discarded

      merely because they are in the ultimate analysis found to be based on

      natural justice. That the expression 'natural justice' is not unknown to our

      law is apparent from the fact that the Privy Council has in many criminal

      appeals from this country laid down that it shall exercise its power of

      interference with the course of criminal justice in this country when there

      has been a breach of principles of natural justice or departure from the

      requirements of justice."

<p id="p_3">17.   As stated above, it is the minority view of the Hon'ble Justice Fazl Ali that

has become the well recognized law by the subsequent judicial pronouncements to

the effect that the natural justice is so basic that even if a statutory law fails to state

in so many words about, its presence shall be inferred. At the risk of repetition we

reiterate our firm stand that it is a unique instance of March of law and also to

show the word "law" is not a static concept, but a moving and living substance.

Supreme Court in R.C.Cooper Vs. Union of India 1970 (1) SCC 248 speaking for

the majority, has specifically over ruled the view expressed by the majority in

A.K.Gopalan's case in para 55 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "55. We have found it necessary to examine the rationale of the two lines

      of authority and determine whether there is anything in the Constitution

      which justifies this apparently inconsistent development of the law. In our

      judgment, the assumption in A.K.Gopalan's case (supra) that certain

      articles in the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters and in

      determining whether there is infringement of the individual's guaranteed

      rights, the object and the form of the State action alone need be considered,

      and effect of the laws on fundamental rights of the individuals in general

      will be ignored cannot be accepted as correct. We hold that the validity of

       "law" which authorises deprivation of property and "a law" which

      authorises compulsory acquisition of property for a public purpose must be

      adjudged by the application of the same tests. A citizen may claim in an

      appropriate case that the law authorising compulsory acquisition of

      property imposes fetters upon his right to hold property which are not

      reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public.           It is

      immaterial that the scope for such challenge may be attenuated because of

      the nature of the law of acquisition which providing as it does not

      expropriation of property of the individual for public purpose may be

      presumed to impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general

      public."

<p id="p_5">19.   Thus, it was in R.C.Cooper case, the view expressed in the first judgment

against the natural justice was overruled by a larger bench of Supreme Court

consisting of 11 judges. It was ultimately in Mrs. Menaka Gandhi Vs. Union of

India reported in 1978 (1) SCC 248, the constitutional bench presided over by the

Hon'ble Chief Justice M.H.Beg has taken the view that the principles of natural

justice is so basic that even in the absence of any specific provision about giving

reasonable opportunity, the extent of natural justice has to be implied in all statute

and the relevant portion is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "221. It is well established that even where there is no specific provision in

      a stature or rules made thereunder for showing cause against action

      proposed to be taken against an individual, which affects the rights of that

      individual, the duty to give reasonable opportunity to be heard will be

      implied from the nature of the function to be performed by the authority

      which has the power to take punitive or damaging action. The principle was

      laid down by this Court in the State of Orissa Vs. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei in

      the following words:

      passed is entitled to a hearing applies alike to judicial tribunals and bodies

      of person invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil

      consequences. It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitutional set-up

      that every citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the

      State or its officers. Duty to act judicially would, therefore arise from the

      very nature of the function intended to be performed: it need not be shown to

      be superadded. It there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of

      a person, duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power. If

      the essentials of justice be ignored and an order to the prejudice of a person

      is made, the order is a nullity. That is a basic concept of the rule of law and

      importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any

      particular case.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      222. In England, the rule was thus expressed by Byles, J. in Cooper v.

      Wandsworth Board of Works

             The laws of God and man both give the party an opportunity to make

      his defence, if he has any. I remember to have heard it observed by a very

      learned man, upon such an occasion, that even God himself did not pass

      sentence upon Adam before he was called upon to make his defence,

      "Adam" (says God), where art thou? Hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof

      I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?" And the same question was

      put to Eve also."

<p id="p_6">20.   Therefore, by virtue of march of law as per the law enunciated by the

Hon'ble Apex Court, the latest principle in natural justice is very clear that giving

opportunity to the person before taking away his right which is already conferred

to him is not merely natural justice but fundamental in nature which is inherent. It

goes back to the early English Author who made century ago that the principles

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         16</span>
 natural justice which was called the natural law is the law of God as reiterated by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. Tulsiram Patel 1985 in 3 SCC

</p><p id="p_7">398. The Hon'ble Apex Court has elicited Blackstone's view which is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "78. This law of nature, being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God

      himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all

      the globe in all countries, and at all times : no human laws are of any

      validity, if contrary to this ; and such of them as are valid derive all their

      force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original."

      83    Some judges have been faced with the contention as Maugham, L.J.,

      was in Errington v. Minister of Health that "the principles of natural justice

      are vague and difficult to ascertain". Referring to such contentions Lord

      Reid said in Ridge v. Balwin :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "In modern times opinions have sometimes been expressed to the effect that

      natural justice is so vague as to be practically meaningless. But I would

      regard these as a tainted by the perennial fallacy that because something

      cannot be cut and dried or nicely weighed or measured therefore it does not

      exist. The idea of negligence is equally insusceptible of exact definition, but

      what a reasonable man would regard as fair procedure in particular

      circumstances and what he would regard as negligence in particular

      circumstances are equally capable of serving as tests in law, and natural

      justice as it has been interpreted in the courts is much more definite than

      that. It appears to me that one reason why the authorities on natural justice

      have been found difficult to reconcile is that insufficient attention has been

      paid to the great difference between various kinds of cases in which it has

      been sought to apply the principle. (emphasis supplied).

</blockquote><p id="p_8"> 21.    It was in that judgment, the Supreme Court has made historical study about

the entire concept of natural justice from the beginning till the date of the judgment

including views of Acadamics. The view taken in RC Cooper and other various

cases are of course on the aspect of service laws.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">22.    The principles as to how the concept of natural justice has undergone a great

change ever since the date of commencement of Supreme Court till date has been

reiterated in the latest judgment in <a href="/doc/1086058/" id="a_23">Canara Bank Vs. V.K.Awasthi</a>, (2005) 6 SCC

321 wherein the Supreme Court has made the following statement which is

pertinent to be extracted :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "14. Concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in

      recent years.    Rules of natural justice are not rules embodied always

      expressly in a statute or in rules framed thereunder. They may be implied

      from the nature of the duty to be performed under a statute. What particular

      rule of natural justice should be implied and what its context should be in a

      given case must depend to a great extent on the fact and circumstances of that

      case, the framework of the stature under which the enquiry is held. The old

      distinction between a judicial act and an administrative act has withered

      away. Even an administrative order which involves civil consequences must

      be consistent" encompasses infraction of not merely property or personal

      rights but of civil liberties, material deprivations and non-pecuniary

      damages. In its wide umbrella comes everything that affects a citizen in his

      civil life.</blockquote><p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      15.      Natural justice has been variously defined by different Judges. A few

      instances will suffice. In Drew Vs. Drew and Leburn (Macq at p.8) Lord

      Cranworth defined it as "universal justice". In James Dunber Smith vs.

      R.(AC at p. 623) Sir Robert P. Collier, speaking for the Judicial Committee of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                          18</span>
 the privy Council, used the phrase "the requirements of substantial justice",

while in Arthur John Spackman vs. Plumstead Dist. Board of Works (AC at p.

</p><p id="p_13">240), the Earl of Selbourne, S.C. preferred the phrase "the substantial

requirement of justice." In Vionet vs. Barrett (LJJRD at p. 41), Lord Esher,

M.R. defined natural justice as the "the natural sense of what is right and

wrong". While, however, deciding Hopkins Vs. Smethwick Local Board of

Health Lord Fasher, M.R. instead of using the definition given earlier by him

in Vionet case chose to define natural justice as " fundamental justice" In

Ridge Vs. Baldwin (QB at p. 578), Harman, L.J., in the Court of appeal

countered natural justice with "fair play in action", a phrase favoured by

Bhagwati, J.in Maneka Gandhi Vs. Union of India. In HK (an infant), In re

(QB at p. 530) , Lord Parker, C.J., preferred to describe natural justice as "a

duty to act fairly". In Fairmount Investments Ltd. Vs. Secy of State for

Environment Lord Russell of Willoman somewhat picturesquely described

natural justice as "a fair crack of the whip" while Geoffrey Lane, L.J. in <a href="/doc/861688/" id="a_24">R, v.

Secy of State of Home Affairs</a>, ex p Hosenball preferred the homely phrase

"common fairness".
</p>
<p id="p_14">16.    How then have the principles of natural justice been interpreted in the

courts and within what limits are they to be confined? Over the years by a

process of judicial interpretation two rules have been evolved as representing

the principles of natural justice in judicial process, including therein quasi-

judicial and administrative process. They constitute the basic elements of a

fair hearing, having their roots in the innate sense of man for fair play and

justice which is not the preserve of any particular race or country but is

shared in common by all men. The first rule is "nemo judex in causa sua" or

"nemo debet esse judex in propria causa sua" as stated in (1605) 12 Co. Rep.

114 that is, "no man shall be judge in his own cause". Coke used the form

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    19</span>
       "aliquis non debet esse judex in proprio causa, quia non protest esse judex et

      pars" (Co. Litt. 1418), that is, "no man ought to be a judge in his own case,

      because he cannot act as judge and at the same time be a party

      ......................................................."


</p><p id="p_15">23.     The long journey of case laws on this principle has again been reiterated by

the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi in M/s Sesa

Goa Ltd., Sesa Ghar and Another V/s State of Goa and others in Application No.

49 of 2009. Hon'ble Shri Justice Swatanter Kumar, Hon'ble Chairperson of the

NGT, presiding the 05 Member Bench in which one of us is a party (Justice

P.Jyothimani), in His own unique style giving the entire historic events of natural

justice has come to a conclusion that whether administrative or quasi judicial act,

when it intends to take away the right which has been vested upon any person

without opportunity, such act cannot stand the test of law. Therefore, by applying

the above principles to the facts of the present case that admittedly when consent to

establish was given to the project proponent on 24.01.2006 which was abruptly

withdrawn on 07.12.2006 without even given notice to him is totally opposed to

the principles of Natural justice. Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the

impugned order passed by the State Pollution Control Board withdrawing the

consent cannot stand the scrutiny of law and it is liable to be set aside on that

ground alone.
</p>
<p id="p_16">24.     Now coming to the other issue that the order has been passed under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_25">Section

33(A)</a> of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) 1974, the said Section

empowers the Central Government to give certain directions. This power has been

given to the Central Pollution Control Board by amendment which has come into

effect on 29.09.1998. The said Section reads as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">       "[33A. Power to give directions. - Nothwithstanding anything contained in
      any other law, but subject to the provisions of this Act, and to any directions

       that the Central Government may give in this behalf, a Board may, in the
      exercise of its power and performance of its functions under this Act, issue
      any directions in writing to any person, officer or authority, and such person,
      officer or authority shall be bound to comply with such, directions.
       "Explanation. - For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that the

         process; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      (b)     The stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity, water or any other
         service.]

</blockquote><p id="p_17">25.    A close reading of the said Section makes it abundantly clear that the power

conferred under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_26">Section 33(A)</a> are for the purpose of giving direction for better

performance of an industry and to avoid pollution and it cannot be made applicable

for the purpose of revoking or withdrawing a permission already granted. If at all,

there is any power available to the State Pollution Control Board under the Act, it

is <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_27">Section 27</a>, wherein there is a power given for the purpose of withdrawal of the

consent. However we are aware that merely because wrong provision is quoted in

any order, that itself would not vitiate the order. We are referring to the same only

to reiterate that the purpose of any direction under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_28">Section 33(A)</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_29">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 is to enable the SPCB to issue

periodic direction for the purpose of maintaining pollution standards so to as to

give effect to the avowed object of the said <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_30">Water Act</a> as well as <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_31">Air Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_18">26.    There is one other aspect which is very apparent on the face of record. On a

reference to the affidavit filed on behalf of the State Pollution Control Board, we

are totally shocked to find out the attitude of the SPCB. One of the very senior

officers of SPCB who was holding post of Regional Officer Shri A.K.Mishra has

filed an affidavit even before the Hon'ble MP High Court on 27.11.2011 which

nowhere states anything about the very sad condition of the unit of the project

proponent which has been found out by this Tribunal from a report of the Expert

Committee constituted in which the project proponent himself has participated. In

the said affidavit or subsequently, the officer has chosen not to state anything about
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                         21</span>
 the condition of the unit even in respect of the original consent to operate given for

establishment of distillery with 3 KL per day. He has only chosen to state that both

molasses based and grain based distillery are pollutant industry. On the other hand

one of the responsible officer of SPCB namely the Member Secretary, SPCB in his

clarification letter regarding applicability of EIA notification to the project in

question, in his letter dated 07.01.2011 in no uncertain terms has stated that the

pollution caused by the molasses based distillery is more pollutant than the

pollution which may be caused by grain based industry. It is relevant to extract the

entire clarification given by Shri R.K.Jain, the Member Secretary, MPSPCB dated

07.01.2011.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">      " This reference to the proposal of M/s Cox India Ltd., Nowgaon,Distt.

      Chhatarpur, MP engaged manufacturing of rectified spirit (3kl/d) on

      molasses based distillation since, 1995. The unit was granted permission to

      establish under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_32">Section 25</a> of Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_33">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

      1981 for grain based distillation (8 kl/d) based on no increase in pollution

      load vide Board's letter dated 24.01.2006 (copy enclosed). The pollution

      generation from molasses based distillery was considered as 2.5 times

      compared to grain based distiller."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">27.   There is no reason for us to differ from the view of Shri R.K.Jain. Thus,

consequently one has to come to a conclusion as a necessary corollary, that the

SPCB through its previous Regional Officers has been giving wrong information

both to the High Court as well as to this Tribunal or suppressed the real situation

about the unit. If only the Regional Officer has given the correct information about

the industry which is in a very bad shape, there would have been an opportunity to

the project proponent to correct itself or closure order could have been passed at

the earliest stage which would have certainly prevented pollution in the area.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                         22</span>
 Therefore, we are of the view that it is not only the project proponent which can be

treated as a pollutant but also the official who has prevented the court as well as

the Tribunal from taking an appropriate action to prevent pollution and the

department is also to be held equally responsible.
</p>
<p id="p_20">28.   Taking into consideration, the entire issue which has been considered above,

we have constituted a committee consisting of Shri R.S.Kori, Zonal Officer,

CPCB, Bhopal and Shri Manoj Kumar Mandrai, Executive Engineer, MPPCB,

Bhopal and Shri V.S.Rai, Regional Officer, MPPCB, Sagar to inspect the project

proponent's factory to find out and give reply for the two questions raised : (a) as

to whether plantation of 3000 trees are sufficient to meet the environmental

protection norms and as to whether sufficient space and infrastructure is available

for the same; (b) whether the scheme proposed by the project proponent for the

purpose of treatment of the discharge of the effluent is acceptable and what is the

present status of the treatment plant and nature of pollution being caused.

proponent has participated through its representatives Shri J.C.Agrawal, MD M/s

Cox India Ltd., Shri Rajeev Mittal, Manager M/s Cox India Ltd. And Shri Satwant

Singh, Plant Incharge M/s Cox India Ltd. While answering the first question, the

committee has ultimately found that plantation of 3000 trees on 8.541 acres would

not be sufficient to meet environmental protection norms. In fact the committee

has also pointed out that there is no sign of earlier plantation of 3000 trees

observed at the time of inspection. While answering the second point about

effluent treatment plant, the committee has gone in detail about the various

material facts supported by various photographs and documents and has come to a

conclusion that the existing ETP was not functional. The observation made in this

regard, which is relevant is extracted as follows:

<p id="p_24">31.   When the Tribunal asked the opinion of the Zonal Officer, CPCB, to give

suggestion for the development of the system, the Zonal Officer of CPCB in his

report has specifically stated that "the industry should redesign the ETP according

to quantity of effluent generation to achieve the prescribed norms and to maintain

zero liquid condition as given by MPPCB. In case the industry needs to redesign

and modify the existing ETP, then the industry may examine the suitability of

adopting emerging technologies.
</p>
<p id="p_25">32.   All these factors show that not only the SPCB has failed to give the exact

position but also made us to form a conclusion that the project proponent has

complied with the conditions. Even though, we have no hesitation to set aside the

impugned order for the reasons stated above, ultimately it is for MPPCB to decide

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                        25</span>
 about the proposal given by the project proponent for extension by giving due

opportunity to the project proponent.
</p>
<p id="p_26">33.   In so far, it relates to the right of the project proponent to continue with the

existing 3 KL per day on molasses basis for which the permission was legally

granted and even though the period of licence has expired on 31.12.2012 and

project proponent has made an application for renewal for which the MPPCB has

not taken any decision so far action and therefore, it should be taken that licence

will continue till such time and final decision is taken. Be that as it may, it is

always open to the SPCB to take any decision based on fresh inspection. But it

remains a fact that the project proponent is certainly entitled to run the existing 3

KL per day on molasses basis but the question is as to whether he should be

allowed to run in this situation as stated in the joint report or unless and until the

project proponent comply with certain conditions. We are of the view that the

minimum requirement of plantation of 3000 trees must be done by the project

proponent so as to enable it to run 3 KL per day on molasses basis and that should

be done within the time specified by us.        It is now seen that in respect of

conducting 8 KL per day on grain basis, the requirement of land by the project

proponent is much more. We make it clear that it is for MPPCB to decide the said

requirement at the appropriate time. However, in the existing land, we are of the

view that on the polluter pay principle, the project proponent should be directed to

plant sufficient number of trees.
</p>
<p id="p_27">34.   For all the abovesaid reasons we pass the following orders:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">             (1) Application No. 10 of 2013, M/s Cox India Ltd. stands allowed

                and the impugned order passed by the MPPCB dated 07.12.2006

                stands set aside.</blockquote><p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">             (2) It would be open to MPPCB to give proper notice to the project

                proponent and after hearing him and giving him sufficient

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                         26</span>
    opportunity including the opportunity to remove the defects and

   comply with various conditions, the MPPCB shall pass appropriate

   order regarding the proposal of the project proponent for extension.

   We make it clear that the MPPCB which has by its conduct

   through its officer has caused huge loss shall not repeat the same.

   We refrain from passing any further orders in this regard as we are

   informed that the concerned officer who has filed the affidavit is

   no more.
</p>
<p id="p_30">(3) We make it clear that by setting aside the impugned order we are

   not permitting the project proponent to go ahead with the proposed

   expansion. The decision about consent to operate shall be made by

   MPPCB which shall be considered as stated above by giving

   opportunity to the project proponent and passing appropriate orders

   in accordance with law including the EIA 2006 notification.

(4) We accept the Joint Inspection Report made by the committee as

   per the direction of this Tribunal. Taking note of the spirit of the

   report and as an interim measure before the SPCB take any

   decision regarding the continuation of the project proponent to run

   either 3 KL per day on molasses basis or for expansion of 8 KL per

   day on grain basis, we hereby direct the project proponent to plant

   minimum 3000 trees of each having 3 feet length and maintain the

   same for 3 years so as to make the trees self sustainable and that

   shall be done within 3 months' from today failing which the

   project proponent shall pay an amount of Rs. 5 lakhs as a

   compensation and that amount shall be kept by the State

   Government in a separate account as "Environmental Protection

   Fund" which shall be maintained by the Chief Secretary of State of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                           27</span>
                  MP alongwith Principal Secretary, Housing and Environment and

                 Zonal Officer of CPCB and it will be open to this committee to

                 spend this amount for environmental protection in the State as and

                 when required accordingly and report the same to the registry of

                 this Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_31">              (5) The contention of Shri Sachin K.Verma, Learned Counsel

                 appearing for the State of MP that the government is always

                 anxious to implement the directions of the Tribunal especially

                 relating to the environmental protection and his undertaking that

                 any direction given by the Tribunal will be implemented is

                 recorded.
</p>
<p id="p_32">35.     While parting with, we are compelled to observe that it is high time that

M.P.P.C.B., which has got more responsibility than any other State Pollution

Control Boards as the state is covered with a large extent of forest area, water

resources in the form numerous lakes and other natural resources, shall take urgent

steps to meet the increasing challenges of environmental protection and

degradation with the improved understanding of the subject and framing of new

regulations, as per the mandate given to it under various provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_36">Water

Act</a>,1974, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_37">Air Act</a> 1981 and various Rules under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_38">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

1986.
</p>
<p id="p_33">36.     We find it relevant to refer, in particular, <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_39">Section 17</a> of Water Act,1974 &amp;

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_40">Air Act</a>, 1981 wherein the role of SPCB has been defined as multi faceted one,

including, enforcement and compliance, environmental monitoring, information

dissemination, environmental awareness and environmental advocacy.            It is

needless to say that all these functions require strong Research and Development

support in environment science and technology. We find it, therefore, necessary to

observe that MPPCB shall form a separate research wing with adequate manpower

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                         28</span>
 and budget support, where all such essential activities are carried out internally or

by associating with leading education and research institutes. It is needless to say

that technical and scientifically sound information generated through such efforts

will improve the environmental governance of MPPCB and make it ready to face

increasing challenges of environmental degradation and protection in effective and

efficient manner. We hope that the MPPCB will take it in correct spirit and do the

needful for the purpose.
