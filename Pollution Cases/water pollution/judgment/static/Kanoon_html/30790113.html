<p id="p_7">5. Counsel for the petitioner submits as under:-
</p><p id="p_8">   a. Vide letter dated 16.01.1975, 10.00 acres of land was made available to the
      Department of Animal Husbandry, Government of Bihar in Adityapur
      Industrial Area, by Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority
      (hereinafter referred to as 'AIADA') for setting up a unit for processing and
      supply of milk and milk products to the urban population of Jamshedpur.
      Thereafter on 16.01.1975, physical possession of the property was handed
      over to the authorised representative of Animal Husbandry Department,
      Government of Bihar.
</p><p id="p_9">   b. Subsequently, the property was handed over to the petitioner who is a multi
      state co-operative society having its activities in the State of Jharkhand and
      Bihar and is an organization of farmers who are producing milk and milk
      products in the brand name 'SUDHA'.
</p><p id="p_10">   c. He further submits that earlier in the year 1984, processing capacity of the
      unit was 25,000 litres of milk per day which was subsequently increased to
      1,00,000 litres of milk per day some times in the year 1991. As on date, the
      processing capacity of the unit of the petitioner is 1,30,000 litres of milk per
      day.
</p><p id="p_11">   d. Vide letter dated 12.05.2001 issued by AIADA , interalia , an allegation was
      made against the petitioner that about three acres of land is unutilised and
      there are certain dues which are pending against the petitioner.
      Subsequently, vide letter dated 25.07.2001 again some more alleged dues
      were included.
</p><p id="p_12">   e. Pursuant to the aforesaid two letters, vide letter dated 31.07.2001 issued by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>

     the petitioner, the dues were sought to be cleared and certain disputes were
     raised in connection with the calculation of interest portion.
f.   Thereafter vide letter dated 10.01.2002 issued by AIADA , an allegation was
     made that about two acres of land remained unutilised by the petitioner and
     show cause was issued as to why the unutilised land be not cancelled and
     possession be taken over by the AIADA.The said letter also projected certain
     dues against the petitioner which the petitioner cleared vide cheque dated
     21.01.2002.
</p><p id="p_13">g. Pursuant to this letter of 10.01.2002, the petitioner responded vide letter
     dated 17.01.2002/21.01.2002 mentioning that the unit of the petitioner is a
     growing unit and the then processing capacity was 1,00,000 litres of milk per
     day and they     had a proposal of increasing the processing capacity to
     1,50,000 litres of milk per day with the growing demand of milk and
     accordingly it was contended that there was no additional land which is
     available with the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_14">h. However, the Managing Director, AIADA vide impugned order as
     contained in memo no. 1331 dated 10.10.2002 found that the total area of one
     acres of land was unutilised and the petitioner has engaged itself in
     plantation of trees and treating this land of one acres of land as unutilised,
     allotment of land to the extent of one acre out of 10 acres of land was
     cancelled.
</p><p id="p_15">i. Counsel for the petitioner submits that the said authority while passing the
     impugned order dated 10.10.2002 has not taken into consideration the stand
     taken by the petitioner in reply dated 17.01.2002/21.01.2002 and no personal
     hearing was also granted to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_16">j.   After passing of the impugned order dated 10.10.2002, the petitioner filed
     representation before the Managing Director, AIADA vide letter dated
     21.10.2002 and raised his grievance. But since final order was already passed,
     the petitioner filed appeal before the Industries        Department, State of
     Jharkhand vide letter dated 31.10.2002 wherein it was clearly mentioned that
     different areas were mentioned in different letters issued by AIADA. In one
     letter it was mentioned that three acres of land is unutilised and in other
     letter, it was mentioned that two acres of land is unutilised. Ultimately it was
     mentioned in the impugned order that only one acre of land was unutilised,
     on the basis of which it was contended that remaining portion of the land of
     10 acres barring one acre was fully utilised.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>
<p id="p_17">k. The Appellate Authority vide order dated 10.03.2005 directed the petitioner
     to bring on record the proposed expansion plan which is duly approved by
     the competent authority, such that a decision may be taken in connection
     with the actual requirement of land by the petitioner.
l.   Pursuant to this order dated 10.03.2005, Managing Director of the petitioner
     vide letter dated 05.04.2005 filed his response by enclosing the lay out plan
     and also by bringing on record the proposed plan for expansion of the
     processing capacity from 1,00,000 litres of milk per day to 1,50,000 litres of
     milk per day. However, it was also mentioned in the said letter dated
     05.04.2005 that as the Managing Committee of the petitioner was non
     functional, therefore, the proposed expansion plan could not be placed
     before the Managing Committee for approval. The petitioner through its
     Chief Manager of Jamshedpur Dairy Unit, namely, Mr. A.K. Kulkarni also
     filed an affidavit before the Appellate Authority, bringing on record the
     proposed plan for expansion.
</p><p id="p_18">m. Counsel for the petitioner further submits that in the meantime, the
     cancelled plan of one acre of land was allocated to the respondent no. 4 and
     possession of the same was sought to be given, but there was no physical
     handing over of the cancelled land of one acre to the respondent no. 4 due
     to interim order passed by this court vide order dated 28.06.2005 in the
     instant writ petition.
</p><p id="p_19">n. Counsel submits that the Appellate Authority decided the case by order
     dated 21.04.2005 wherein the said authority arbitrarily recorded that an area
     of 2.5 acres remained unutilised out of 10 acres and committed error of
     record and further the said authority upheld the order passed by the
     Managing Director, AIADA, regarding cancellation of one acre of land. In
     the said order, it was mentioned that the activity of the petitioner is in the
     public interest and therefore the land will be allocated to the petitioner in
     future on priority basis as and when such occasion arises.
o. Counsel for the petitioner further submits that requirement of the milk is
     increasing day by day and as per expansion programme of the petitioner's
     unit, present processing capacity of the milk in the unit of the petitioner has
     increased to 1,30,000 litres per day.
</p><p id="p_20">p. He further submit that under the provisions of Pollution Control laws,
     'Consent to Operate' has been granted to the petitioner vide order dated
     14.10.2009. One of the terms and conditions of the said order as mentioned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span>

     in Clause-10 reads as under:-
</p><p id="p_21">              "That, he(they) shall submit the environmental statement every
        year by 30th September and shall harvest all rainwater precipitating in
        the premises and do three tier tree plantation as air barrier."
q.      Counsel for the petitioner submits that plantation of trees is an integral
     part of the industrial activity as the 'Consent to Operate' mandates that the
     trees are to be planted. He further submits that out of 10 acres of land, 9 acres
     have already been utilised and on one acre of land admittedly trees were
     planted. This is apparent from the impugned order dated 10.10.2002 itself
     and therefore it cannot be said that the said land stood unutilised. It is
     reiterated that in order to comply with the various provisions of Pollution
     Laws some area has to be utilised in the industrial unit for the purpose of
     plantation of trees. He further submits that while passing the impugned
     order of cancellation of one acre of land vide order dated 10.10.2002, the
     Managing Director , AIADA did not taken into consideration the stand of
     the petitioner regarding the then proposed expansion plan and immediate
     future requirement of the land.
</p><p id="p_22">r. He further submits that if the cancellation order of one acre of land is
     sustained, then it will be difficult for the petitioner to comply with the terms
     and conditions of pollution laws so far as requirement of plantation of trees
     are concerned. It may lead to serious consequences under the Pollution
     Laws. He further submits that it is not necessary under the law that inch by
     inch of land has to be utilised for the purpose of industrial unit only, but the
     plot has to be utilised as a whole for the industrial purpose which includes
     compliance of various laws including Pollution Laws which mandates
     plantation of trees as per the consent order issued by the pollution control
     department itself.
</p><p id="p_23">s. Counsel for the petitioner also submits that so far as private respondent is
     concerned, property in question was never handed over to the private
     respondent and AIADA has filed a specific affidavit in this regard that in lieu
     of the plot of land involved in this case , the respondent no. 4 has been
     handed over another plot of two acres. Accordingly, he submits that no
     prejudice will be caused to the private respondents herein if the order of
     cancellation of one acre of land is set aside by this Court. He submits that so
     far as cancellation order passed in connection with the plot involved in this
     case and allocated by the respondent no. 4, i.e. one acre of land, is concerned
     , the same has not been challenged by them.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>
<p id="p_24">6. Counsel for the private respondent, on the other hand, submits that although
  they have not disputed the fact which has been mentioned in the supplementary
  counter affidavit filed by AIADA regarding allocation of two acres of land in
  lieu of the portion of land one acre of land involved in this case, but he submits
  that he has raised objection and is following up the matter with the respondents
  in AIADA. Accordingly he submits that respondent no. 4 is still interested in the
  property, however he could not dispute the fact that the possession of the
  property was never handed over to the private respondents.
</p><p id="p_25">7. Counsel appearing for the AIADA submits that AIADA is a distinct legal entity
  but has not been made party respondent in this case. Rather, the Managing
  Director of AIADA has been made party and accordingly on this technical
  ground, the writ petition is fit to be dismissed. He submits that any order which
  may be passed relates to the property belonging to the AIADA .
</p><p id="p_26">8. On merits, he submits that the impugned order dated 10.10.2002 was passed on
  the ground that one acre of land remained unutilised in which the plantation
  was made by the petitioner and accordingly the impugned order was rightly
  passed. He further submits that subsequent development regarding expansion
  of the petitioner cannot be taken into consideration and the impugned order has
  to be judged on the basis of status which was on 10.10.2002.
</p><p id="p_27">9. However, he could not demonstrate the consideration of the reply filed by the
  petitioner pursuant to the show cause notice which was filed by the petitioner
  vide letter dated 17.01.2002 wherein the petitioner had clearly mentioned its
  proposed plan of increasing the capacity from processing 1,00,000 litres of milk
  per day to 1,50,000 litres of milk per day and It was contended by the petitioner
  that the petitioner is not holding any extra land.
</p><p id="p_28">10. He further submits that before the Appellate Authority also, although the
  petitioner was asked to bring on record the approved expansion plan, but the
  same was not brought on record and instead the plan of expansion which was
  brought on record was not duly approved therefore the appellate authority has
  rightly not considered the expansion programme of the petitioner and passed
  the impugned order dated 21.04.2005 with clear cut finding that as and when
  there is requirement of land to the petitioner the same will be provided to the
  petitioner on priority basis. On the point that the appellate authority has
  recorded that 2.5 acres of land remained unutilised, he submits that same
  appears to be an error of record. He submits that it appears from the impugned
  order passed by the Managing Director dated 10.10.2002 that it was only one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      7</span>

   acre of land in which trees were planted which remained unutilised and rest of
   the property was utilised by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_29">11. On the point of requirement of plantation of trees for the purposes of consent
   under Pollution Control laws, counsel for the respondent submits that the
   'Consent to Operate' which has been provided to the petitioner in which specific
   terms and condition has been given that there is requirement of plantation of
   trees, the same cannot be taken into consideration. But at the same time he
   could not dispute the fact that if the terms and conditions under             which
   'Consent to Operate' has been provided to the unit of the petitioner under the
   pollution control orders are not satisfied , the unit of the petitioner may itself be
   closed down, and serious consequences will follow on account of violation of
   pollution laws. He has referred to paragraph nos. 11,17 and 19 of the counter
   affidavit to submit that there is no clear cut expansion programme of the
   petitioner and therefore the impugned order was rightly passed not only by the
   Managing Director of AIADA but also by the appellate authority and he
   submits that the same do not call for any interference by this court.
</p><p id="p_30">12. After hearing counsel for the parties and after considering the materials
   available on record, this court is inclined to allow this writ petition and set
   aside the impugned order as contained in memo no. 1331 dated 10.10.2002
   passed by the Managing Director, AIADA as well as the appellate order dated
   21.04.2005 on account of following facts and reasons:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 i.   So far as the objection regarding maintainability of the writ
                      petition on account of AIADA having being not made party
                      respondent in its individual capacity is concerned , this court
                      finds that    no such plea was ever taken in the counter
                      affidavit filed on behalf of the Managing Director of AIADA
                      whose order is under challenge and who has been made
                      party respondent no 3 in this writ petition. Moreover this
                      court finds that Managing Director of AIADA is representing
                      AIADA itself and the impugned order has been passed by the
                      respondent no 3 in the capacity of Managing Director of
                      AIADA and not in his individual capacity. The interest of
                      AIADA is being taken care of by the Respondent no 3 and
                      accordingly this court is of the considered view that AIADA
                      is being represented through its Managing Director who is
                      respondent no 3 in this case. Accordingly this technical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                     8</span>

      objection raised by the counsel for the Respondent no 3 is
      hereby rejected.
</blockquote><p id="p_31">ii.   From the record of the case it appears that admittedly 10
      acres of land was allocated and handed over to the petitioner,
      out of which one acre of land in which plantation was done
      by the petitioner was treated as unutilised and was cancelled
      by the impugned order dated 10.10.2002.       Admittedly, the
      petitioner had filed his show cause reply vide letter dated
      17.01.2002, wherein the petitioner had clearly mentioned that
      capacity of the petitioner for production has to be increased
      from the then 1,00,000 litre per day to 1,50,000 litre per day
      and it was contended that it cannot be said that the petitioner
      was having additional land or more than required land. This
      show cause reply of the petitioner was not considered by the
      Managing Director, AIADA as is apparent from the
      impugned order dated 10.10.2002. The appellate authority
      vide order dated 10.03.2005 had directed the petitioner to
      submit the approved plan for expansion and pursuant to
      which Managing Director of the petitioner had submitted the
      details of the plan and had clearly mentioned that on account
      of the fact that the then Board of Director of the petitioner
      was non-functional, therefore expansion plan could not be
      placed before the said authority. Thus it appears that the
      stand of the petitioner which was taken before the Managing
      Director of AIADA was under active consideration of the
      appellate authority, but , the Appellate Authority while
      passing the impugned order has over looked the fact that, the
      then Board of Director of the petitioner was non-functional,
      therefore expansion plan could not be placed before the said
      authority. Further the appellate authority    has passed the
      impugned order under the impression that out of 10 acres of
      land, 2.5 acres of land was unutilised (although as per the
      impugned order dated 10.10.2002 passed by the Managing
      Director, AIADA, the unutilised portion of land was only 1
      acre out of 10 acres)   and in this background the appellate
      authority upheld the cancellation of one acre of land. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                         9</span>

       undisputed fact that in the mean time the capacity of the
       petitioner for processing of milk has increased from 1,00,000
       litres per day to 1,30,000 litres per day.
</p><p id="p_32">iii.   So far as the stand of the respondent that developments
       subsequent to passing of the impugned order dated
       10.10.2002 passed by the Managing Director , AIADA should
       not be considered while examining the legality and validity
       of the said order is concerned , this court finds that such
       stand is fit to be rejected. This is because of the reason that on
       the one hand the show cause reply filed by the petitioner
       before the Managing Director, AIADA was not considered
       by the said authority while passing the impugned order
       dated 10.10.2002 and further the appellate authority himself
       was actively considering the aspect of the matter as to
       whether the petitioner has any plan for expansion or not.
       Moreover it is an admitted fact that in the mean time the
       capacity of the petitioner for processing of milk has increased
       from 1,00,000 litres per day to 1,30,000 litres per day. As
       discussed later in this judgement, this court further finds that
       even as per pollution control laws , plantation of trees is
       required to be done and admittedly there is plantation of
       trees on the cancelled area of one acre and the reason for
       cancellation is that on this portion of land trees have been
       planted .
</p><p id="p_33">iv.    The petitioner has specifically mentioned in para 30E and
       para 30F of amended writ petition as under:-
</p><p id="p_34">       " 30E. That the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board has been
       issuing consent to operate order on regular basis. One such order dated
       14.10.2009 is being brought on record under which the petitioner is
       required to comply with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>, 1981, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water
       Act</a>, 1974 as also the EP Act, 1986. Several other rules are also to be
       followed. It has also been made mandatory for the petitioner to harvest all
       rain water and to do three tier tree planation as air barrier. The petitioner
       on annual basis is submitting renewal fees and application for issuing
       consent to operate order which is being renewed thereafter as no rejection
       order has been passed.
</p><p id="p_35">       "30F. That the respondents have committed gross illegality in cancelling
       the alleged unutilised 1 acre of land knowing fully well that the petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                       10</span>

      should have been allowed to continue with the allotment as expansion
      was always in pipeline and the petitioner was also required to comply
      with the provisions of various environmental laws as laid down in the
      consent to operate order issued from time to time.
</p><p id="p_36">v.    The respondent Adityapur Industrial Area Development
      Authority has taken a specific stand in paragraph no. 18 of
      their affidavit dated 23.06.2005 which reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             " 18. That the Adityapur Industrial Area Development
             Authority has a composite plan of developing greenery for
             ecology and environmental purposes and a unit cannot be
             permitted to keep a substantive portion of a Development
             land with all infrastructure non utilised and idle on the
             excuse of developing greenery."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">vi.   During the course of the argument the respondents could not
      dispute the fact that unit of the petitioner cannot run without
      clearance from the Pollution Control Board as per the terms
      and conditions of the 'Consent to Operate'. Therefore this
      court finds that the petitioner was under an obligation in
      connection with rain water harvesting as well as rainwater
      precipitating in the premises and do three tier tree plantation
      as air barrier which has been specifically mentioned in the
      consent to operate as issued by the pollution control
      department. This court finds that plantation of trees is sine-
      qua-non for the purpose of operation of the petitioner's unit
      and in absence of that, clearance from Pollution Control
      Board will itself stand withdrawn and will also lead to other
      consequences under the Pollution Control laws. From the
      record and from the arguments advanced on behalf of the
      parties it appears that apart from one acre of land, rest of land
      has already been utilised by the petitioner and the petitioner
      is under a legal obligation to undergo plantation of trees. The
      stand taken by the respondent AIADA in the counter
      affidavit as quoted above that they have a composite plan for
      developing      greenery      for   environmental    purpose    and
      therefore the land cannot remain unutilised in the name of
      developing greenery, is hereby rejected. This court finds that
      the consent to operate having been given to the petitioner by
      the pollution control board in individual capacity, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                        11</span>

                          obligation under the said consent to operate has to be
                          discharged by the petitioner failing which the consequences
                          shall follow. Accordingly the petitioner is under legal
                          obligation to plant trees as per the terms of the consent order
                          issued by the pollution control board. In that view of the
                          matter, the very fact that plantation has been done in one acre
                          of land , it cannot be said to be unutilised as plantation of
                          trees is required for the purpose of operation of the unit in
                          conformity with the pollution control laws.
