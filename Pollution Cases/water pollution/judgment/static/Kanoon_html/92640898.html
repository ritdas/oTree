INTRODUCTION
1. There is hardly any Act on the Indian Statute Book N?" "0' 'im-

which is so complicated, so illogical in, its arrangement, and

' in some respects so obscure as the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">Indian Income--tax Act</a>, to the Law

1922. Courts and commentatprs have commented on the Commission.
illogical arrangement of the provisions of the Act. It has
been repeatedly pointed out=that the amendments made
from time to time to the Act, directed as they frequently
are at stopping an' exit through the net of taxation freshly
disclosed, are too often framed without sufficient regard to
the basic scheme upon which the Act originally rested. Pro-
visions dealing with the same topic or subject-matter are
scattered through the various Chapters of the Act, and only
a thorough knowledge of thewhole Act would enable any
one to ﬁnd out all the provisions bearing on a certain point.
Added to the illogicality of the arra ernent are two other
defects, inaccuracy in the use of Ian j e and a degree of
obscurity which make it difﬂpult to --e a glimpse of the
real intention of the legislature. As: Lord Wrenbur said
(with reference to the corr¢spond'j' \Act of the nited
Kingdom), "No reliance can be placl$:upon an assumption
of accuracy in the use of language in these Acts".'

2. The hopeless 'confusion into which the Income-tax
law has fallen is mainly due: to pre nitate and continuous (
tinkering with the Act by the legisla e. The amendments e
to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">Income-tax Act</a> havegbeen sq; short-sighted and so 
short-lived as to rob the 1a of tha modicum of stability f
which is essential to its h hy gr Before the provi- 
sions of the Act can be suﬂiqiently ariﬁed by the judicial 4
process,-new prqvisions are substituged in their place. In M

tax Act so as to make its visions More intelligible with-
out aﬁecting its basic tax ctural }The task is difﬁcult,
and, as the Codiﬁcation C t in England said, "to '
expect from us a codiﬁcat n of e law of income-tax ;
which the layman could y read-iatid understand was an
vain hope, which only the  could cherish".' It '

is perhaps possible to makethe provisions of the Act more
logical and clearer without affecting the tax structure; but
it is certainly not possible to make the Act simpler without
encroaching upon at least the fringe and verge of the tax
structure. However, we have made an attempt to arrange
the provisions of the Act in a more logical manner and also
to make them simpler and clearer. We have also codiﬁed
some of the principles well established by decisions but
not contained in the provisions of the present Act.

' 4. In November, 1956, we issued a press communique
and invited suggestions in this behalf. We received sugges-
tions from various individuals and bodies. We have con-
sidered these suggestions in redrafting the Act.

Scheme of 5. As the ﬁrst step in the simpliﬁcation of the Act,

simP1iﬁca- we have made a fairly logical rearrangement and re--group-

"°"- ing of the sections of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_5">Income-tax Act</a>. Each chapter
deals with a particular topic.

6. The next step was simpliﬁcation of the language of
the Act. This was done by splitting up the present sec-
tions, which run into several pages, into independent sec-
tions. Wherever possible, provisos were removed and were
converted into independent provisions of the Act. '

7. As our terms of reference implied the "restriction
that the tax structure should not be altered, no major
change affecting the substance of the law has been made
in the substantive provisions.

8. We, however, felt that a few minor changes in the
substantive parts and a few major changes in the present
procedural provisions would make for simpliﬁcation. These
changes have been made and will be indicated in the appro~
priate places. -

 9. We would like to say at the outset that there can
essential to be no real simpliﬁcation of the Income-tax law without a
make forsirn- simpliﬁcation of the tax structure. As this was beyond
p1iﬁcaﬁ°n- the purview of our work, our task of simpliﬁcation has
been greatly hampered. ~ A

10. We have examined the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_6">Income-tax Act</a>s of other
countries to study the scheme of arrangement -of the sec-
tions and the manner in which analogous provisions have
been drafted in those Acts. We have derived considerable
help from them. We wish the Indian Legislature would

statutes.

simplify the tax structure of this country on the lines ad- _

opted by some other progressive countries. a

.- .- 11. We may also add that in framing our proposals we
have not been unmindful of the recent taxing statutes
enacted in India, such as the <a href="/doc/988436/" id="a_7">Estate Duty Act</a>, the Wealth
.<a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_8">Tax Act</a>, the Expenditure Tax Act and the <a href="/doc/641852/" id="a_9">Gift Tax Act</a>.

We have examined these statutes, and where we thought _

'desirable, drawn upon the provisions of these statutes gin
framing our proposals. A « - . ' . -- 2



3.

12. We now proceed to indicate the lines on which Char(1lg«;uPt°-
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">The Act</a> has been redrafted and the important changes ﬁg' "1 'h°
effected by us. » '

13. The changes made by us fall into two catego-
ries : _ '
(1) changes of substance, and
(2) changes of form.

Changes of substance are discussed in the succeeding'
paragraphs; while changes of form or improvements in .
drafting will be explained in "Notes on clauses".

There are certain changes which have not been embo- (gcoommcn.

Vdied in the draft clauses in Appendix I, but which we dations not

regard as desirable. Our recommendations as to such :mb°S1é'?d Ii"
changes will be found either in the discussion in the body ppm "' )'
'of this Report or in the notes to the relevant clause in

"Notes on clauses", or, in the list of recommendations an-

inexed to this part of the Report. '

14. As in the present Act, the preliminary Chapter Chap," 1'

contains only two sections. One is ' the section head- Preliminauy.
ed 'Short title, extent and commencement' and the other
is the section containing deﬁnitions.

Several new deﬁnitions were found necessary and New d,ﬁ,,;_
have been inserted. Of these, .the following deserve notice---- tions.

A deﬁnition of assessment ;has been -added to make it «A,,,..m._m-,
clear that "assessment" includes reassessment. '

. This expression has been used by' decisions of courts "Assignment
and is well-understood as meaning thf ﬁnancial year for -
which the assessment is being ade at .-the rates prescribed

-by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_11">Finance Act</a> of the yea, concerned. A deﬁnition of
'assessment year' has therefore'been inserted in the Act.

These are two new deﬁnitions which were found neces- "Average of
sary. In respect of several incomes which are included in £3" e_Tu..
the total income, abatement of the tax is given at the "A m,'
average rate of income-tax. ' The present Act provides a of 2 Super
complicated process for the computation' of the abatement.'1'aX"-

in <a href="/doc/938899/" id="a_12">section 17</a>, where the method of working the average

' rate of income-tax is referred to. 'It was found convenient

to give deﬁnitions of these two exprqssions and to refer
'to' them in the appropriate sections instead of repeating a
long clause every time.

The basis of charge, under '-the Act varies according as §§',',':.'2"°'§;nd

a person is a resident of India or a 'non-resident. The ex- uR¢.ad¢m»_--

A deﬁnition of 'tax' has been introduced. Under this
deﬁnition, 'tax' means both income-tax and super-tax charge-
able under the provisions of this Act. The definition will
make it clear that where income-tax is referred to in any
provision of the Act only income-tax is meant, and where
super-tax is referred to in any provision of the Act, only
super-tax is meant. Where 'tax' is referred to, both income-
tax and super-tax are meant.

15. The deﬁnition of "assesses" has been ampliﬁed so
as to include all the various classes of persons who may
become liable for assessment or payment of tax or other
sum.' -

Item (iii) of existing <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_13">section 2(4A)</a>, which excludes,
from the deﬁnition of "capital asset", land from which the
income derived is agricultural income has been redlrafted
by substituting the words "agricultural land in India'';. Land
lying fallow and yielding no income should, it is felt, be
excluded from this deﬁnition. Hence this change. '

The deﬁnition of "income" has been ampliﬁed so as to
include proﬁts and gains. This will obviate the necessity
of repeating the lengthy expression "income, profits and
actticable.
only the expression "income" has been used in t e substan-
tive sections. 1

16. The substantive provisions of the Act rela g to
one topic or subject matter we at present spread a over
the Act. This has naturall led to considerable di culty
in ascertaining a person's lia 'i1ity under the Act. For ,%exam-
ple, <a href="/doc/1627329/" id="a_14">section 42</a> which' deemsjcertain incomes to acciue or
arise in India is separated from <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_15">section 4</a> which d_ea with
the charge to tax of,incomes accruing or arising in India.
Similarly, while most incomes excluded from the to '
come are dealt with in <a href="/doc/1493165/" id="a_16">section 4(3)</a> of the Act, the e are
some provisions pertaining to exclusion in other
e.g. <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_17">sections 14(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/1226169/" id="a_18">25(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1226169/" id="a_19">25(4)</a> etc. We have, the efore,
in grouping the sections in various Chapters, taken dare to
see that all the provisions pertaining to a particular subject
or topic are placed in the same Chapter. 

  
 

17. The substantive provisions are at present co ained
mainly in Chapters I, III and.;IZX in the existing Act. hap-
ter III deals with several subjects. It deals with th bass
of charge, the compdtation df total income under rious
heads, the rebates on; life insiirance premia and othe mat-
ters and the provisions pertaining to salaries, wag and
other matters. In the' draft (if 'the Act which we havp pre-
pared, the substantive provisions pertaining to income-tax
and super-tax have been classiﬁed and grouped in eleven
Chapters which deal with the following subjects : '

The notes to clause

(i) Basis of charge. (Chapter II)
(ii) Incomes which do not form part of the total in-
come. (Chapter III)
(iii) Computation of total income. (Chapter IV)

(iv) Incomes of other persons, included in the assessee's

(viii) Double taxation relief. (Chapter EX)
(ix) Provisions against avoidance of tax. (Chapter X)
(x) Super--tax. (Chapter XI)
(xi) Determination of tax in certain special cases.
(Chapter XII).
18. All the provisions which concem the charge of Chapter I
income-tax have been brought (together. in this Chapter. 3181895 Chat
The deﬁnition of 'previous year' is one of the essential 3°'

criteria for the basis of charge and has been included in
this Chapter. - - .

The .basis of charge has been expressed more generally
than in the present Act, by referrin tovevery "person" in

' the charging section.' This is in fcon omiity with the laws

of other countries'.

'[9. In the present Act the scope of total income is
given sometimes in relation to the nature of income and
sometimes in relation to the residence qf,the assessee. To
avoid any confusion, the scope of total in e of residents.
and non-residents has been put in two iﬁerent sub-sec-
tions.' .

20. Several provisions of the _.Act refdrto income which
is "deemed" to accrue in India, is de ed to be received
in the previous year. We have b ought 5these provisions
together and placed them in pr ' 'ty , ;each other'.

21. At present, there is no provisioniwhich determines Residence.
the residence of an artiﬁcial juridical rson. A new sub-
clause' has therefore been i,ntrod ced in" ;section relating

to '_Residence' roviding that pe ns 0 than those for

22. The present Act (<a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_22">section 4</a>) speaks. of three cafe-
gories of persons:

(i) Persons who are resident in India;

(ii) Persons who are not ordinarily resident in India;
and .

(iii) Persons who are not resident in Endia.

-So fay as the second category is concezjned, certain incmznee
rnenmoned in <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_23">section 4</a> aocrumg outsxde India are not to

be included in their total incomes. This category is also
of importance for the purpose of certain transactions men~
tioned in <a href="/doc/1627329/" id="a_24">sections 42(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_25">44D</a> but is of nae importance
for any other purpose. The Taxation Enquiry Commission'
considered the question whether the category of "not
ordinarily resident persons" should be continued for the
purpose of assessment, and expressed the View that there
was no justiﬁcation for continuing the exemptions given
to this category of cases any longer. We are in entire agree-
ment with the View expressed by the Taxation Enquiry
Commission. Our primary recommendation is. therefore,
that this category shoulé. beﬂabelished. If, however, the
Government wishes to continue the exemptions, we would.
prefer to put, in Chapter III the items which are to be
exchxcied from the total incc-me in the case of persons not
ordinarily resident'. We would also mention the oﬁher lia-
bilities of persons not ordinarily resident at the appropriate

place. We have not. therefore, referred to persons" 'ot ordi-- --

narily resident' in the section "Scope of tot5a1_ ' come".
We would like the basis cf charge ta be determined oniy
with reference to «me question, namely, whether the per-
son is resicient. in India or not resident in Inciia.

The deﬁnition ef "ordinary residence" in setfon 1&amp;3
is couched in a negative form, with the result '{ at the
section is ambiguous in its import. The View take by the
Madras and Travancore-Cochin High Ceurts' is t at resi-
dence in India for less than nine years -out of the preceding
ten wears is suiﬁcient to make: the assesses "not ariiinarily
resident". whereaethe View taken by the Bombay High
Court' is that in order to claim the status of "nut ordi-
narily residen " the requisite conditiorris that the 'assessee
should he non~resident in India in nine out of the ten years
immediately preceding the relevant acceuntmg year. Under
the Madras Vi€W non-residence in one of the saidnine
years would make the assessee "not ordinariiy resident",
even if he has been resident in the remaining ei years.
Under the Bombay View ndtzeresidence in each of 2 nine
years is required befare the assessee can be regard as "not
ordinarily residen ". We understand that the Centr Board

of Revenue. has approved of the Madras view in some cases
where the question arose for its consideration. If, contrary

_ to our recommendation, the concept of ordinary residence

is retained, it would be advisable to redraft the deﬁnition
of "ordinary residence" so as to make it clear which of

{the two conflicting views -is the one intended by the Legis-
ature.

'We would like to draw the attention. of the Govern-
ment to two provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_26">Income-tax Act</a> which deserve
to be deleted. The ﬁrst is <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_27">section 4(1)(b)(iii)</a>, taxing an
assessee in respect of the remittances by him into India
out of the income of past years (i;e., years prior to the rele-
vant accounting year). Such a provision has only the eﬁect
of preventing capital being brought intothis country at a
time when the country badly needs capital. It is true that
the effect of this provision has been to a large extent
counteracted down by the fourth and ﬁfth provisos' to
<a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_28">section 4(1)</a>, which were inserted by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_29">Indian Income-tax
(Amendment) Act</a>, 1953; but there is no reason why any tax
on remittances out of past year's proﬁtsshould be levied

-even in a modiﬁed form. ' To tax the aggregate of the

proﬁts of the past twenty years as the proﬁts of the year in
which they are remitted into India is unjustiﬁable on rin-
ciple, apart from the fact that, as noted above, it resu ts in
capital being kept out of the country. ' '

Another provision which we regard as still less sup-
portable is <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_30">section 4(1)</a>, Explanation 4, Which rriakes an
assessee liable to tax if he moves his past profits from one
part of India into another, that is, from the erstwhile merged
territories or'Part B States, into another/part of the coun-
try. India is one country and it is wrong' on principle to
tax, the movement of money from one part of the country
to another. Besides, a fairly long period has already elaps-
ed since the integration of the former native States into
the Republic of India, and it would be anachronistic to re-
tain any longer provisions which were appropriate at a
time when the political map of India was different from
what it is today.

We recommend that these two provisions, namely, sec-
tion 4(1)(b)(iii) and <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_31">section 4(1)</a>,'Explanation 4, should be
deleted. (We have not, however, given eﬁect to this recom-
mendation in the draft clauses in Appendix I, since this
would affect the tax structure). '

23. The exemptions in the Act are of several kinds. Chnptg III'

Some incomes are not liable tozinclusi in the total in- I"°°m Whi'~ '

com;e. Some incomes are liable'to incl sion in the total gm dp.m":}

this distinction should be brou ht out prominently by income. '
grouping together provisions pe aining to these two cate-
gories separately and putting them in diﬂerent Chapters.
Incomes which under the provisions of- the Act, are not

. to be included in the total income have been put together,

24. A few of the exemptions notiﬁed under <a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_33">section 60</a>,
under which the income is to be excluded from the total
income, have been mentioned here', as it was felt that
such important notiﬁcations should be prominently brought
to the notice of the tax-payer, e.g., income of a University
or other educational institution, scholarships and others.

The exemptions have, wherever possible, been classiﬁ-
ed into well-deﬁned categories e.g., non-residents, foreign
residents, interest and others.

25. The provision in existing section 4(1) 2nd Proviso,
for incomes accruing outside India which are to be exclud-
ed from the total income of a person who is not ordinarily
resident, has been retained in the draft proposed'by us.
If the Government accepts our primary recommendation",
this provision' would have to be omitted.

The provision in <a href="/doc/1493165/" id="a_34">section 4(3)</a> (xiv), relatingcto the
exclusion of remuneration received by employees of foreign

enterprises, is sought to be conﬁned to foreigners, since ,

there is no reason why the exemption should be enjoyed
by Indian citizens'. .

The provision in <a href="/doc/1493165/" id="a_35">section 4(3)</a> (xiva), relating to salary
received by certain foreign technicians. is sought to be
slightly widened so as to cover salary received for work
done before the actual commencement of business'.'

26. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1493165/" id="a_36">section 4(3)</a> (i) and (ii) (income
of religious and charitable trusts) have been the si1bject-
matter of interpretation by" various courts. It app¢ars to
us that the'intention of the legislature is not clea from
the present language of the Act. It also appears to that
the distinction between a trust and an institution as not
been borne in mind in drafting <a href="/doc/1413095/" id="a_37">section 4(3)(i)</a>. An stitu-
tion is something different from a trust. A trust jis not
necessarily an institution'. %

27. In our opiniqn' the intention of the legisla re in
framing <a href="/doc/1413095/" id="a_38">section 4(3)(i)</a> was ;to exempt three catego 'es of
income :-- - g

28. It appearsto us that in View of the decision of the
Supreme Court' it will be diﬂizult to exclude "business"
from "property" which is the subject of a trust. But, it is
also clear to our minds that income from business should
b exempted only if the conditions mentioned in proviso
(:3 are fulﬁlled. We have, thefefore, redrafted <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_42">section 4</a>
(3)(i) to make this position clear': '

29. We are of the opinion that the legislature intended
also to exempt the income from a business carried on by
a reli ious or charitable institution, if the conditions men- «
-tione in proviso (b) are satisﬁed. As the exemption of
the income from a business carried on on behalf of a
religious or charitable "institution" is not covered by the
category of income from business held 2 under "trust", we
have provided',.for' the exemption of such income of a
religious or charitable institution,

31. In the present Act the expression "tax shall not.
be payable" has been used, even in respect of deductions-.
in computing the income under each head. The language
has been criticised and has occasioned some confusion. In,
the scheme adopted by us deduction have been s arate-
1y listed and the expression _"tax shall not be pay ble." is
not used in regard to deductions'. -

<a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_45">Section 8</a> provides that the tax should be payable in,
respect of interest "receivable" by assessee. As the word_
"receivable" has been interpreted by courts as meaning' _
"received", we have adopted this interpretation and re-.
drafted the section accordingly". '

32. The income assessable under <a href="/doc/1369261/" id="a_46">section 9</a> is more
appropriately described as "Income from house property";
we have adopted this phraseology. '

33. <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_47">Section 10</a>, which pertains to income from business
covers about fourteen printed pages of the Income Tax;
Manual. The section is divided into thirteen sub-sections,
and sub-section (2) has about ﬁfteen clauses and a large.
number of provisos. In the absence of any marginal notes:
appended to the sub-section and the clauses, it has been
found very diﬂicult to ﬁnd out whether any particular
deduction is admissible in the case of business income or-
not, or to trace a provision relating to any particular topic.
We have, _therefore, divided the provisions pertaining to
business, profession or 'vocation into a number of sections._
The important changes are mentioned below'. I

34. One provision which has caused a good deal of'
hardship in practice is that regarding bad debts. The allow-I
ance for a bad debt under <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_48">section 10(2)(xi)</a> is conditional
upon the Income-tax Officer, ﬁnding that the amount had
become bad in the relevant accounting year, and tliis has.
been found to bear hardly oprthe assessee in manyicases.
An assessee may write off and claim a debt as a ba debt
in a particular year, honestly thinking that it had come
bad in that year; the Income,-tax Ofﬁcer may disall the.
claim on the ground that the claim was premature d it
really become bad in a subsequent year; on appea, the
appellate authorities -may uphold the disallowance but on
the ground that the ;debt hadi actually become badgin an
earlier year. By thetime the claim is ﬁnally rejec ed, it
may be too late for the a essee to claim the ba debt
in any earlier or late!) year. 0: make the allowance pend
upon the chance of the as ,§ee's view as to the y at in
which the debt became 'bad? coinciding with the part».
ment's view of the matter, and to put the assessee ' peril
of completely losing the ' ht to the allowance ' the
absence 'of such coincidence, Ts not a very satisfacto , basis-T

of allowance. We have therefore proposed an express pro-
vision' in the Act that if a bad debt  disallowed as being
claimed too late, the assess ent fora" the year in which,
according to the Income-tax ﬁicer, the debt became bad

can be reopened and the allowance niay _be given for that
year wherever possible. . I '

We have also proposed a provision' to meet the con-
verse case of a bad debt being claimed prematurely.

35. We have also enumerated in a separate section the
topics covered by these sections'. '

36. The proposed arrangement will make it conveni-
ent to ﬁnd the provision pertaining to a deduction or a
charge easily. "'

37. The provisions pertaining to. insurance business
have been placed in a Schedule, as at present.

38. Two changes that we have made in <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_49">section 10</a> (2)
(vib), relating to development; rebate,imay be pointed out
here'. In the first place, we Have sli 1§1y altered the pro-
vision so as to allow the rebate in pect of the year in
which the machinery or plant :is ﬁrst gait to use by the as-
sessee, if the' machinery or plant is 0' used in the year
of acquisition. Under the existing ovision, the deduc-
tion is allowed only in the year of at pisition or installa-
tion, and the position regarding casglgwhere the machi-
nery or plant is not "used" in the yéar of acquisition or
installation is doubtful. This; has now been made clear.
In the second place, We have omitted sub-sections (2B)
and (2C) of <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_50">section 10</a>, relat' g to d psits or proﬁts by
companies. The proposed 0 ission ﬂ sub-sections (2B)
and (2C) of section has beer: made 11 view of the fact
that these sub-sections are nd; beingtienforced at present.
The omission is relevant also; for the}. 'urposes of clauses
(vi), (via) and (vii) of sub-section (2)  <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_51">section 10</a>.

39. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_52">Section 12B</a> has beenicriticisefii as containing the

uni
largest number of provisos. ;It has iavso been criticised gs' .

on the ground that it is difficult to kngw, from the present
language of the section, the deduction a person is entitled
to on account of the cost of the asse S; We have felt it
necessary to coin an expressi , viz, " tatutory cost"? for
this purpose. We have made rovisi or the determina-
tion of the statutory cost se ately 'Iﬁ respect of depre-
ciable and non-depreciable' ssets'. gProvision has also
been made for determining the statutory cost in relation
to the mode of acquisition of the assets :by the assessee by

   
 

purchase, inheritance and other methods.

3:32:32? 40. The provisions pertaining to the computation of
3' income from other sources have now been put after the

provisions pertaining to the computation of all other _

incomes including capital gains. The section is thus a resi-
duary section for computing the income from all sources
for which no provision has been made earlier.

We would like to draw the attention of the Govern-
ment to the fact that the present system of taxing divi-
dends creates a good deal oftdiﬂiculty. At present, com-
panies are taxed at a very heavy rate under the annual
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_53">Finance Act</a> but <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_54">section 18</a> (5) and 49B (1) of the Income-
tax Act treat income-tax paid by companies as paid on
behalf of. the shareholders and allow the shareholders
credit for the income-tax paid by the company. The'tax
to be so credited to the shareholder has to be arrived at
after an elaborate computation under the process known
as "grossing up" of dividends. _This process, dealt with
in <a href="/doc/1509588/" id="a_55">section 16(2)</a> of the Income-tax Act, is a complex one.
Moreover, difficult questions often arise in practice as to
whether dividends are declared out of the taxable proﬁts
of the companies or not, since money has no ear-mark and
it is not easy in practice to identify the fund out of which
a dividend has been declared. This difficulty has been
accentuated after the substitution of the present rule 14 of
the Income-tax rules prescribing the new form of certiﬁ-
cate to be furnished by the company to the s arehdlder
along with the dividend warrant. It would in e theglaw
much simpler and easier to administer if at least public
companies are taxed at a very low rate and the share-
holders are taxed at the normal rates without any credit
being given to them for the tax paid by the co"mpa' 'es.
We have not made any changes 'on this point in the igaft

clauses in Appendix I, since  such change would a ect '
e

the tax structure; but w eel that the Government
should consider the simpliﬁcation of the law on this point.
The notes to the relevant draft clause may also be perused
in this connection. '

ma] ;ncom.,_ language of <a href="/doc/1509588/" id="a_57">section 16(1)</a> (c) lmds to some_ confusion. {The

provisions pertaining to settlement of income and tr' us-

fer of property have therefore been separately dealt W" h.

Chapter VI 42. The method of computation of the total incgme,
Aggregation the method of computing the loss and the right to c rry
of Income forward such loss to later years all pertain to the conipu-
andm °*7°' tation of total income after the income under each head
§f"1';§fe'S'"a'd has been separately computed. All these provisions have,
' therefore, been grouped together in this Chapter. '

Under <a href="/doc/47944/" id="a_58">section 24</a> as it stands at present, a loss urider
a head other than cap tal_ga s _is set oﬁ also again: a
loss under the head " apital ains". Since the rateT of

l



13

tax in the case of capital gains is lower than the rate for
other heads, this provision for the compulsory set off of
other losses against capital gains is unfair to the assessee.
The beneﬁt which he derives from the set off is smaller
than what he would have derived if. the loss were set off
against other income. We have, therefore altered the pro-
vision' by'barring the set off of a loss under any head
(other than capital gains) against income under capital
gains, so that for the purposes of set off. capital gains now
becomes a completely independent category.

43. The second proviso to section» 24(1) does not bring
out clearly the intention of the legislature. We have now
put the proviso in the form of an independent section" so
as to leave no doubt as to its meaning. The provisions
pertaining to set off and carry forward of the losses of
registered and unregistered ﬁrms in the assessment of the
ﬁrms and their partners have also been put in separate
sections'. -

44. It is now well settled by a series of decisions' that
a cash credit whose nature and source have not been ex-
plained is to be treated as.the income of the year in which
it occurs. There are similar decisions' regarding invest-

ments whose nature and source areinot explained. These- 1

decisions have been codiﬁed in two sections' of this

Chapter.

45. As stated at the outset. the present Act does not
make a clear distinction between the three categories of
exemptions:

(i) Incomes which do not formipart of the total in-
come and are altogether excluded from compu-
tation;

1 (ii) Incomes which form part ofjthe total income, but
which are exempt from tax:

(iii) Expenditure incurred by an assessee, on which
an abatement is given.

The present Act uses the words,"the tax shall not be
payable" in respect of all the three dategories; e.g.----

(a) Any sum received by a member of [a Hindu Undivi-
ded Family as a member of such family--S. 14(1).

(b) The taxed share of ti partner of an Unregistered
Firm--S. 14(2) (a).

(c) Payments made to effect insurance on the life of
the assessee or on the life of a wife or husband
of the assessee----S. 15(1).

' 46. It would be inappropriate to use the same language
in respect of the three categories. We consider that
the expression "tax shall not be payable by an
assessee" is inaccurate in respect of expenditure in-
curred by the assessee, as such expenditure is not part of
his "income". We have, therefore, separated these three
categories and put them into three different Chapters'.
We have already dealt with the ﬁrst category in the
Chapter" in which all the exclusions from total income
have been gathered together. The incomes which are in-
cluded in the total income but exempt from income-tax
have been gathered together in this Chapter. The pro-
visions of the Act which allow a rebate in respect of expen-
diture incurred by the assessee, e.g., <a href="/doc/885027/" id="a_59">sections 15(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_60">15B</a>.
etc., have been grouped together in the Chapter' headed
"Rebates and reliefs". '

47. In respect of several of the incomes referred to in
the Chapter under discussion the exemption is con ' d
to income-tax and is not applicable to super-tax. To av id
confusion, the expression "income-tax shall not be pa ab e"
has been used in this Chapter. 1 e exemptions app ica le
to super-tax have been speciﬁcally mentioned, in the Chap-
ter relating to Super-tax . 3

48. In view of the present gﬁtlaeme of taxation (under
the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_61">Finance Act</a>, 1958) under W 'dh no deduction is a1l¢.$v1'-
ed for earned income, we consi er it unnecessary to c -
tinue <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_62">section 15A</a> in the Act. e have therefore omit d
the latter part of section '15A, leaving it to the Govemm t
to omit its earlier part also. i

49. We have discussed above? the unsuitability of t e
present language in regard to algfitement of tax on exp --
diture by the assessee. We hav, made the necessary v_r-
bal changes. '

50. This Chapter provides for a deduction, from t e
income-tax payable on. the tot income, of an amo
equal to the income-tax calcula ,d at the average rate if
income-tax on the amounts on which the assessee is
titled to a rebate, for example, life insurance premia,
contributions, to Provident Fund. The language of t is

 
 

Chapter has been borrowed from the U. .K. and Ceyl 11

Acts'.

We have slightly widened' the provision in secti 11

avoidance of tax by means of transactions with non-resi- P*°'.'i-°*i°" .
dents and by dealings in securities-cum-dividends and in 3f:;:c"°f";'a";'
other ways. We have also dealt in this Chapter with the '
provision pertaining to avoidance of tax in the hands of
a resident principal.

53. As regards transactions in securities the present
law (<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_65">section 44JF</a>) deems the interest to accrue de die in
diem. As a tax avoidance provision it would be very ap-
propriate to tax the interest wholly in the hands of the
person transferring the securities before the due date of
maturity. We have altered,the provision' accordingly.

54. The provisions pertaining to super-tax, are contain- Chapter XI
ed in Chapter IX of the Act. There are a few other pro- SuP&lt;=r-tIX-
visions not included in that Chapter which pertain to super- '
tax, e.g., <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_66">section 23A</a> which provides for the levy of addi-
tional super-tax in the case of certam companies. All the-
provisions relating to super-tax have been brought toge-

ther in this Chapter. In regard to super-tax, the basic pro-

vision that the total income for per-tax shall be the
same as the total income for income- asx has been retained',
but the provisions which exclude certain incomes from
computation of the total income have been made into se-
parate sections'. C

In connection with <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_67">section 23A</a>, we may draw atten-
tion to the latest pronounqement of the Privy Council'.
on an identical provision of a foreign statute. It decides
that if having regard to the smallness of proﬁts or past
losses or any other relevant factor' or circumstances the
payment of a dividend or a large dividend than that declar-
ed would be unreasonable, no order should be passed un-
der <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_68">section 23A</a>. We have not made any change in the
existing section on . this point; but we think that the
Income-tax Officer should ndt pass  order under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_69">section
23A</a> where the declaration of a dividend or a larger divi-
dend would be unreasonable on aotoilmt of current busi-
ness requirements. .

We may also draw the gattenti A to the inconsistency
inherent in the present provisions L lating to tax on dis-
tributed and undistributed proﬁts.' <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_70">Section 23A</a> of the
Income-tax Act taxes undistzributed iproﬁts, while the pro-
vision usually inserted in the annual <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_71">Finance Act</a> has the
effect of increasing the tax on excessive distribution of

proﬁts. This inconsistency' must be removed. A detailed

change in the existing section on this point; but we re-

te .

-55. We have placed under a separate group provisions

_ relating to rebate on super-tax on, certain types of expen-

diture or reliefs in respect of certain incomes as-in the
case of newly established industrial undertakings'. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_73">The
Act</a> is not clear as to whether certain incomes exempted
from super-tax are to be included in the total incomes for
purposes of rate or are to be excluded altogether; for
example, the exemption [in <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_74">section 14(3)</a>] in respect of co-
operative societies. In our draft we have borne in mind
the distinction between an item which is excluded from
the total income" and an item on which only a relief is
applicable at the average rate of super-tax'.

to. The topics dealt with,here include the computation
of tax for income comprising exempt incomes, liability in
respect of compensation payable, the rate of income-tax
and super-tax applicable to non-residents, the mode of
computation of income-tax_ on capital gains, and to on.
We have made it clear' that in the case of compe ' tion
payable to and received by a registered ﬁrm, the ial
mode of computation mentioned in the Act applies to the
partners. The position is not clear in the Act. '

57. In respect of capital gains the provisions of the
present Act are not easily intelligible, and we have there-
fore clariﬁed the position by expressing the computation
of tax on capital gains in the form of a mathematical for-
mula'. ? '

58. The provisions pertaining to income-tax au hori-
ties and procedure are at present contained mai y in

pertain to the powers of Income-tax authorities. We have.
therefore, grouped all these sections in this Chapter.

The present classiﬁcation of these provisions is not
very happy. We have. therefore. classiﬁed the provisigns
pertaining to Income~tax authorities as under:

(a) Appointment and control,

(b) Jurisdiction.

(c) Powers, and _

(cl) Disclosure of information. '

Supreme Court in a recent case' by providing that the as-
sessee should be given an opportunity, wherever possible,:
of being heard before a caseis transferred from one Income-'
tax authority to another. . -

There is at present no provision in the Act as to the
Incorne--tax authority who should take proceedings where'
there has been a transfer of the case from one Income,-tax
authority to another. A doubt has been expressed as to;
which Commissioner is to exercise jurisdiction when a'
case has been transferred from an Income--tax Officer under
the jurisdiction of one Commissioner to an Income-tax'
Oﬂicer under the jurisdiction of another Commissioner.
We have provided speciﬁcally for such cases by inserting
a new section on the subject'. The new provision will also

meet cases of transfer of a c$e from one Income-tax Offi-
cer to another. A few minor changes made in the various
sections have been indicated in the Notes on clauses.

An important addtion to the provision relating to dis-
closure in <a href="/doc/1030207/" id="a_85">section 54</a> (3) is the new provision' enabling the
Income-tax Officer to disclose the substance of the parti-
culars on which he relies (for the purpose of an assess-
ment) to the assessee with-out. of course. disclosing the
name of the person to whom the particulars pertain. This
is intended to give eﬁect to the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Dhakeshwari Cotton Mills Ltd}. f.One
other provision added to this section' enables the Incpme-
tax authority to disclose the facts necessar for the (pur-
pose of enabling an officer of the Central overnment to
levy or realise any tax imposed by it.

A provision has also been added' authorising the. dis-
closure to civil courts of certain documents (like balance-
sheets, proﬁt and loss accounts etc.) prepared by comp' ies
under 'the Companies 'Act, or documents of which c pies
can be obtained under the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_86">Registration Act</a>. As no of
these are private documents, there is no harm in permi ting
their disclosure _in cases where the documents are relevant
in a proceeding before a civil court. Similarly, we haveialso
added a provision' authorising the disclosure of ace nts
ﬁled by the assessee before an Income-tax authority hen
the accounts are required by acjivil court for the pur ses
of proceedings to which the assessee is a party. We do not
see any reason why the mere fact that the accounts': are
lying with the Income-tax authorities should debar their
production in court. - g

One important change which we have made conce ing
<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_87">section 5</a> may also be;noticed.2 $ection 5(8) provides hat
ofﬁcers and persons entployed n' the execution of the Act
shall observe the orders, inst tions and directions is ued
by the Central Board of Revenue. 

As some of the or ers and -instructions affect asse es
in general, we have a ded a provision' to the effect hat
orders and instructions of a general nature should be

published.

We have also added a clause providing for the re m
of documents producediby an assessee before any Inc e-
tax authority'. V '

ing to the Appellate Tribunal haive been omitted from this
Chapter.

62. The provisions pertaining to procedure for assess- Chapter xw
ment have been gathered together in this Chapter. Procedure

for assess-

The Chapter has been divided into sections so as to "'°'"'

bring out clearly and prominently the various stages of an
assessment. The principal chan es made by us in respect
of these provisions are given bepow :-

(1) The date by which the voluntary return is to be
ﬁled has been ﬁxed as the 30th day of June'. \

(2) A primary obligation to make a return of income
has been imposed without the necessity of a general notice
as under the existing <a href="/doc/1623255/" id="a_88">section 22(1)</a>.

(3) The provisi-on has been 'extended to representative
assessees, e.g., agents of non-residents, trustees' and others.

(4) The person who is to sign the return is mentioned
at present in a footnote to the iorm of return of income.
We consider that this provision is so important that it
should be embodied as a part of the Act itself. We have, ac-
cordingly, added a section on the subject.' We have
made special provisions for the signing of returns in the
ease of mentally incapacitated persons, minors and persons

absent from India.

(5) The criteria for making a "best judgment assess-
ment" have been speciﬁcally mentioned.'

(6) The provisions which are now contained in <a href="/doc/354318/" id="a_89">section
13</a> have been transferred to this Chapter. The provision
has been so drafted' as to avoid any cqnﬂict between sec-
tions 13 and 23. It has been made clear that <a href="/doc/354318/" id="a_90">section 13</a>
applies only where the accounts are correct and complete.
<a href="/doc/1218766/" id="a_91">Section 23(4)</a> will apply to cases where the accounts pro-
duced are not correct or are not compldte.

(7) <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_92">The Act</a>--<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_93">section 34(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/716811/" id="a_94">1-</a>'st Proviso, (ii) enables with
the permission of the Central Board of Revenue, the re-
opening of assessments without limit of time in cases where
the aggregate income which has} éscapeg assessment is over
Rs. 1,00,000. We consider that in most: of the cases there
should be some ﬁnality as to an assess ent after the lapse
of. a certain period of time. While pro _ ting the interests

the proceedings can be re-opened without limit of time, we
have provided' for a limit of 16 years in all other cases
which are now covered by section' 34(1)(a) lst proviso, clause
_(ii). We would. further recommend that even where the
income escaping assessment in a particular year is over
Rs. 50,000, there should be no re-opening of the assessment
after the lapse of 16 years from the end of the assessment
year concerned. This last recommendation has not been
embodied in Appendix I.

(8) In the case of Parashar vs. Vasantsen Dwarkadas,'
the Bombay High Court held that the provisions of <a href="/doc/68933/" id="a_95">section
34(3)</a> are invalid to the extent to which they allow the
assessment of a person other than the assessee to be re-
opened without limit of time. We have now provided' that
the person whose alleged income is included in the assess-
ment of the assessee, should be given an opportunity of
being heard, before the assessment is completed. This will
cure the invalidity of the provision.

(9) At present there is no time-limit for the completion

.of an assessment made under <a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_96">section 34(1)(a)</a>. We think

that the proceedings for such assessments should not go on

indeﬁnitely. We have accordingly provided' for it time-

limit of four years for the completion of the assessment.

The time limit will run from the end ofthe assessment year
in which the notice under <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_97">section 34</a> is issued.

Similarly, we have provided' a time--limit of four years
in a case where a notice is issued under <a href="/doc/555776/" id="a_98">section 28(3)</a> read
with <a href="/doc/555776/" id="a_99">section 28(l)(c)</a> (i.e., notice for the imposition of a
penalty where the assessee has concealed the particulars of
his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars).
Under <a href="/doc/68933/" id="a_100">section 34(3)</a> there is no time-limit for the comple«
tion of such assessments.

(10) <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_101">Section 35</a> has been split into two sections. The
rectiﬁcation of mistakes, strictly so called, is putlin one
section. Several rectiﬁcations which are permitted Kinder
<a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_102">section 35</a> are deemed to be mistakes apparent on the face
of the record. All such deeming provisions have been
gathered together in another section. A ~

<p id="p_10">64. The principal changes made in respect of these pro- ,

visions are as under :--
</p>
<p id="p_11">(i) The provision relating to legal representatives has
been made more elaborate' so as to cover all possible situa-
</p>
<p id="p_12">, tions.
</p>
<p id="p_13">(ii) A new expression has been coined', namely "repre-
sentative assessee", to cover all cases where a person is
made responsible in an assessment for the income of ano-
ther person under <a href="/doc/1486104/" id="a_103">sections 40</a>, <a href="/doc/1543897/" id="a_104">41</a> or 42 (as trustee, guardian,
Administrator-General, Court of Wards, receiver, agent of
non-resident and otherwise). This scheme has been adopted
from the South African Act.' The adoption of this scheme
has made for a considerable simpliﬁcation in drafting.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(iii) A new provision' has been inserted to make the
representative assessee personally liable where he disposes
of or parts with the assets in his possession after the tax
has become payable.
</p>
<p id="p_15"><a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_105">Under the Act</a>, a person liable as a representative
assessee (particularly a guardian, trustee, or manager) can
be assessed either under the special provisions applicable
in such cases (<a href="/doc/1486104/" id="a_106">sections 40</a>, <a href="/doc/1543897/" id="a_107">41</a> and otherwise) or under the
normal charging provision in <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_108">section 3</a>. We feel, however,
that such persons should not be chargeable under <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_109">section 3</a>
when there are special provisions applicable to them. We
have. accordingly, added a provision' for the purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_16">The position regarding the rate of tax applicable to
income received by a trustee in cases where the shares of
the beneﬁciaries are unknown or where the income is not
received on behalf of a particular beneﬁciary, has been
slightly amended' so as to provide that the tax on such
income in the hands of the trustee and» otherwise will be
at the rate applicable to an association ;o_f persons; a provi-
sion has, however, been added to the affect that where the
income is actually received by the beneﬁciary, the Income-
tax Officer has the discretion to tax at the rate applicable

maximum rate (in cases where the beneﬁciary has other
income) is not fair. The sheer accident that a beneﬁciary
has income from other sources, should not be a ground for
taxing him at the maximum rate. .
</p>
<p id="p_23">(iv) There is at present no provision in the Act for the
assessment of executors. We have inserted a new provision'
for the assessment of executors, based on the corresponding
pr-ovision of the Ceylon Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">(V) The provisions of <a href="/doc/192301/" id="a_113">section 25A</a>, it is now well settled,
apply only to cases of total partition of the family. There
is no provision in the Act as to the enquiries to be made
and the procedure to be adopted in the case of partial parti-
tion of a Hindu undivided family. We think that some
provision on the subject isdesirable. We have therefore
ampliﬁed the section so as to cover cases of partial partition
of Hindu undivided families.'

</p><p id="p_25">(vi) It has been made clear' that the rate at which a
State Government is to pay the tax on its tax free securities
should be laid down by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_114">Finance Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_26">65. All the provisions of the Act applicable to ﬁrms have
been gathered together in this Chapter. This will: enable

T to the partners' and others to ascertain the law from one

Chapter instead of searching for provisions dispersed all
over the Act. .
</p>
<p id="p_27">The principal changes made in this Chapter are given

. below :
</p>
<p id="p_28">(1) The provisions contained at present in thi Rules,
regarding the regisﬁation aild cancellation of regist ation of
ﬁrms, have been incorporated in the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_29">(2) The provision for fresh application for_ reg stration
every year has been delejged, as it entails hard hip. A
declaration that there has been no change in the onstitu-
tion of the ﬁrm will suffice.' i

ment of partnership of ﬁrm C does not itself specify the in-
dividual shares of the partners, but merely mentions the
constituent ﬁrms as the partners. In such cases, the shares
of the partners in ﬁrm C, we feel, should be ascertained
with the help of the instruments of partnership relating to
ﬁrms A and B. We have, therefore, proposed a change in
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_115">section 26A</a>, so that in considering the application for regis-
tration, the Income-tax Officer will be required to have
regard to the instruments of partnership of the connected
ﬁrms also.
</p>
<p id="p_35">-
</p>
<p id="p_36">(5) A clause enumerating all other provisions rele-
vant to ﬁrms has been added.
</p>
<p id="p_37">The provision for registration of firms (<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_116">section 26A</a> and
the rules made thereunder) has worked great hardship in
practice. Practical experience of the working of the Act
shows that the department is astute to find technical defects
on the strength of which registration may be refused. Such
refusal can obviously work enormous hardship, since the
result of such refusal would be that tax would be attracted
at a much higher rate in most cas 's than if the income were
apportioned among the various p tners and taxed separate-
ly in their hands. The reports qt income-ltax cases afford
many illustrations of how even égenuineii firms have been
refused registration merely because of some technical defect.
We have tried to alleviate the hardship by liberalising the
provisions to some extent, as indicated a ' ve. But we feel
that if the provision for registration is at ' ll to_ be retained,
there should be a complete change in th' approach of the
income-tax authorities, and the }provisio§=should not be
administered in a hyper-technical' spiri , as is done at
present. If the law is not admihisteredéi in a liberal and
reasonable spirit, the old adage '-'the letlier ki1leth" would
fully apply.
</p>
<p id="p_38">ernment to another provision rdating  iﬁrms which we tion of regis-
feel is totally unjust. We are referring t <a href="/doc/1218766/" id="a_117">section 23(5)(a)(i)</a> ""4 5-
of the Act, which provides for the levy 0 tax on registered :

in the case of a registered ﬁrm so far as income-tax is
concerned, (though not as regards super-tax), and only par-
tial relief against such double taxation is afforded by
<a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_120">section 14(2)(aa)</a>.
</p><p id="p_45">without precedent, so far as we have been able to gather,
in the history of income~tax legislation, either in this coun-
try or in the othercountries whose laws we have examined.
To assess a ﬁrm in respect of its proﬁts and to assess the
individual partners again in respect of their shares of the
ﬁrm's proﬁts is virtually double assessment on the same
individuals in respect of the same income. This type of
legislation cannot be supported on any considerations of
justice or fairness or any sound principle of taxation. It
would work as a dangerous precedent. We appreciate that
it,is a matter of legislative policy how high the incidence
of taxation should be; but there is no reason why' resort
should be had to pure and simple double taxation on the
same individuals, in respect of the same income under the
same Act, as a mode of raising the revenue. As alteration
in the tax structure is not within the scope of our prdposals,
we have not made any change on this point in the draft
clause in Appendix I.- But we strongly recommend that
this provision [the system of taxing a registered ﬁrm under
<a href="/doc/1218766/" id="a_121">section 23(5)(a)(i)</a> read with the annual <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_122">Finance Act</a>] should
be abolished.
</p>
<p id="p_46">66. We felt that it would be useful to enumerate in
one place all the provisions of the Act which pertain to
companies. The provisions themselves have been putin the
relevant places, e.g., residence has been put in the Chap-
ter on 'Basis of charge', the additional super-tax payable
by a company has been put in the Chapter on super-tax. and
so on. But all the provisions of the Act which pertain to
the assessment of companies have been listed here, fof easy
reference. .

of tax are contained at present in Chapters IV a d VI.

</p>
<p id="p_49">68. The principal changes made in this Chapter are
as under :-- 9

</p><p id="p_50">(i) Some doubt was felt .;as to whether the provisions
pertaining to deduction. at source or advance payment of

made it clear by adding suitable provisions' that there is
a "charge" for deduction of tax, and advance payment of
tax etc.

We have also made 'changes' in the 'rate of interest in
connection with advance tax and the date from which the
interest is to run, so asto secure uniformity. The notes on
the relevant clauses indicates in detail 'the changes made
in this respect.
</p>
<p id="p_54">(ii) In regard to the provisions for recovery of tax.
the principal change made is that the provisions pertaining
to the procedure for recovery of tax by the Collector to
whom a certiﬁcate is issued have been incorporated in a
separate Schedule to the Act, which will constitute a self-
congained Code. In drafting this Schedule, we have exa-
mined the provisions of the various <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_126">Revenue Recovery
Act</a>s of the various States as also of the various Municipal
Acts. The procedure to be followed by the Collector
is not very clear and varies from State to State. This va-
rianeein procedure has been commented upon by the Su-
preme Court.' Whatever the position may be in regard
to recovery of tax levied by States, we consider that there
shoulci be a uniform procedure in regard to recovery of

'Ce.-ntral taxes. (See detaiied discussions below under

"Revenue Lavcs".}

</p><p id="p_55">(iii) Provision' has been made for an Income-tax 0fﬁ~
oer to send a certiﬁcate to the Collector of any district
in India in which theassessee possesses property or resides.
At present, the Income-tax Officer can send a certiﬁcate
only to the Collector of the district in which he functions,
and where the certiﬁcate is to be sent toanother Coiiector,
the Collector to whom the certiﬁcate has been sent has to
forward it to the other Collector. This procedure re--
sults in delaying proceedings for recovery.
</p>
<p id="p_56">(iv) It is the departmental ractice and it is also con-
venient from the point of View 0 assesse,es---that the power
to grant payments in instalments should rest with the In--
come-'tax Oiﬁcer, and that the power should continue even
after the issue of a certiﬁcate to the Collector. We have
inserted the necessary provisions on the isubject'.
</p>
<p id="p_57">(V) The scope of <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_127">sections 46</a> (3) and 46(4), under which,
in areas notiﬁed by the Commissioner, 'arrears can be rea-
lised in the manner provided by the Mxjnﬁcipai Act of the

State, has been narrowed down. Of the various remedies r

provigied by Municipal Acts. 'ch power of distrainf: and

<p id="p_62">been speciﬁcally dealt with in the draft'. It will be avail-
able to any Income-tax Officer authorised for the p rpose
by the Commissioner. The procedure to be adopted 1; the
Income-tax Ofﬁcer. in the case of distraint of property
has been dealt with in a separate Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_63">Several Municipal Acts contain provisions for an ap-
plication being made to a Magistrate having jurisdiction
over the area and provide that the Magistrate will §there~
upon collect the tax in the manner provided for the reco~
very of fines or prosecute the defaulter for non-payrxient of
the tax. These powers have in fact never been exercised,
and we think it unnecessary to retain them'.
</p>
<p id="p_64">(vi) For expediting recovery, we think that it ould
be desirable to have;a provision enabling the loco e-tax
Officer to apply directly to a court (in whose custodyf; there
is money belonging to the assessee) for payment of the mo--
may in its possession. This will save time, and dolaway
with the necessity of proceedin through the Collector as
at present. We have according y inserted a provisiop' for
the purpose. g

</p><p id="p_65">(vii) One more mode of -' eovery is recovery by suit.
This is implied under the p 'nt law, but we felt at it
might be useful to ifnake a rspeciﬁc mention of it ' the
Act, and have mentioned it aboordingly'.
</p>
<p id="p_66">(viii) At present one of Qhe modes of recovery
imposition of a penalty under <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_128">section 46</a> (1), the ,.- -
penalty imposed not exceedin the tax payable.
ject of this provision is to p am; the assessee from
ing money which belongs to veroment without co pen-.
sating the Government by a of interest for the elay-v
ed payment. Under ﬁle ore' - , it
may happen that while the '
where payment is delayed, ='t may not be --».=.~ in
another case where 'also payment is delayed. It may
also happen that 1111' the case of a particular 
the penalty imposed under safction 46 (1), is remitt
appeal. This, we corlsider, would lead to discrim' tion
between assessees who are V' tlarly situated. The
sion in the Australiari Act in.  behalf has appea
us as being more equitable. We 'have, therefore, pro '
for interest at 10 per ent beitg payable by every  ~- -
who is 'in default in pent V the amount outst
from the date on whiizh the mount falls due. (We
that the rate of interest shou d be sufficiently high a as

to induce assessees to-_ make prompt payment of arr are.)

We have also provided' for the interest being waived in

cases where the tax is paid within three months of the
default.
</p>
<p id="p_69">The corresponding provisions in the Canadian, U.K.
and Australian Acts may be compared'.
</p>
<p id="p_70">(ix) The position 'regarding the action to be taken
for the correction or cancellation of a recovery certiﬁcate
issued by the Income-tax Oﬁicer to the Collector is very
uncertain at present. If after the issue of a. certiﬁcate
some mistake is detected or the amount is reduced or in-
creased or the Income-tax Oﬁicer desires to- withdraw the
certiﬁcate for some reason, the action to be taken is not
easily ascertainable from the Act. _We have. therefore, ad-
ded a provision' to make the position clear. Under the pro-
vision proposed by us, the "assessee cannot challenge the
correctness of a certiﬁcate before the Collector; but he will
have the right to move the Income-tax Officer (who issued
the certiﬁcate) in appropriate cases. We have also provid-
ed for an appeal against an order of an Income-tax Ofﬁcer

rejecting an application of the assessee raising objection to
the certiﬁcate.
</p>
<p id="p_71">(x) Regarding <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_129">section 46</a> (5), which confers on the
Income-tax Oﬂicer a power to require the employer of an
assessee to withhold the assessee's sala and remit the
amount to the Income-tax Ofﬁcer towaxtrlls payment of the
assessee's arrears, we feel that the power should not be
available in respect of that portion of the salary which
exempt from attachment under the Civil Procedure Code.
We have changed the provision accordingly'.
</p>
<p id="p_72">69. As regards recovery under revenue Laws, a detail- Revenue
ed discussion of the position appears to be desirable. Sub- Laws-
section (2) of <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_130">section 46</a> contains, the fprocedure to be fol-
lowed by the Collector after receipt 0 the certiﬁcate from
the Income-tax Ofﬁcer. The procedure is the same as that

laid down for the recovery of arrears of land revenue in
his State.
</p>
<p id="p_73">The proviso to sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_131">section 46</a> confers
upon the Collector all the powers which a court under the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, exercises for the purpose of
recovery of an amount due under a decree. This, of course,

is without prejudice to any other powers of the Collector
in that behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_74">[The provisions of <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_132">sections 46</a> (3) and 46 (4) will be

<p id="p_79">. 70. The powers of the Collector are to be gathered
from the laws relating to the realisation of land revenue
obtaining in the appropriate State, supplemented by the
powers exercisable under,the Code .of Civil Procedure. An
examination of the revenue laws obtaining in the States
now forming' part of India shows that under these laws
the following processes for realization of arrears of revenue
are available.
</p>
<p id="p_80">(a) distraint and sale of moveable property of the de-
faulter; '

</p><p id="p_81">(b) attachment and sale of immoveable property of
the defaulter;
</p>
<p id="p_82">(c) attachment of property belonging to the defaulter
and management thereof;
</p>
<p id="p_83">(d) arrest and detention of the defaulter in civil pri-
son.
</p>
<p id="p_84">All these modes of recovery do not obtain in all the
States. Further, in the same State, there are variations
depending upon the place of accrual of the revenue ar-
rearsa according as the arrears arose in the capital city or
outsi e.
</p>
<p id="p_85">71. Section 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908,
lays down the modes of execution and it contains as. many
as ﬁve -methods of execution of a decree of Civil Court. Sub-
clauses (b), (c) and (d) of that section are alone relevant
for the purpose of income-tax law, and they are :---
</p>
<p id="p_86">(i) attachment and sale. orsale without attachment of
any property (the word property is here used so
as to include moveable and immoveable property);
</p>
<p id="p_87">(ii) arrest and detention in prison, and
</p><p id="p_88">(iii) appointment of a' receiver.
</p>
<p id="p_89">72. It will be seen by a comparison of the modes. avail-
able under the revenue laws with those under the; Civil
Procedure Code that the only additional power which the
Code of Civil Procedure confers is the power to appoint
.a receiver in execution of a decree. The Code of Civil
Procedure lays down in Order XXI the procedure to be

followed in respect of these modes. Revenue laws Aof the

States also lay down the detailed procedure to be allow-
</p>
<p id="p_90">-ed by the Collector for realising arrears of land revenue.

<p id="p_382">78. From the foregoing analysis it is clear that the re-
medies available in the different States under the revenue

laws are not uniform and the procedure also varies in some

details.
</p>
<p id="p_383">79. In Purshottam Govindjfs case' the Supreme Court Ne_ed . for.
</p>
<p id="p_384">held that <a href="/doc/244572/" id="a_151">section 46(2)</a> is valid and does not offend articles "_mf°'m"Y'.
21, 22 and 14 cf the Constitution. Chandrasekhara Iyer J .,
though he agreed with the majority view, observed that
"for the enforcement of the levy of a Central Tax like the
income--tax there should be uniformity of procedure and
identity of consequences from non-payment". The learned
Chief Justice in his judgment compared the Provisions of
different laws adopted by the different States for the reco-
very of land revenue and observed that even in "the same
State there were two procedures to which defaulting
assessees could be subjected according as they were in or
outside the city of Bombay". The learned Chief Justice
also pointed out the variation in the terms of imprisonment
provided in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_152">State Act</a>s and that in some State (e.g.
Assam) there was no provision for imprisonment. Though
section -46(2) was upheld as valid, a perusal of the judg-
ment convinces one that uniformity is desirable and that
the observations of Chandrasekhara Iyer J. are justiﬁed.
</p>
<p id="p_385">80. We have therefore thought it incumbent upon us to Action -
codify the law in this respect and include it in a separatepoﬂd R¢V°';
Schedule. The judgment ()f the Supreme Court also gives ""°1""'.')'
an authoritative interpretation of the proviso to <a href="/doc/244572/" id="a_153">section
46(2)</a>. The meaning of the proviso maybe stated, in the
words of the Supreme Court, as fo11ows:-- -
</p>
<p id="p_386">"On a_ proper reading, that sub-section does not pres-
cribe two alternative modes of procedure at all.
All that the sub-section directs the Collector to do
is to proceed to recover the amount as if it were
an arrear of land revenue, that is to say, he is to
adopt the procedure prescribed by the appropriate
law of his State for the recovery of land revenue,

' (1955) 28 I. T. R. 891.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">40</span>
<p id="p_387">and that in this proceeding he is, under the pro-
viso, to have all the powers a Civil Court has
under the Code. The sub-section,does not prescribe
two separate procedures. The statement to the con-
trary in the judgment of the Bombay High Court
in <a href="/doc/1289057/" id="a_154">Sat Ali Ahmed v. Collector of Bombay</a>', does not
appear to us to be correct. In 'our opinion, the pro-
viso does not indicate a different and alternative
mode of recovery of the certiﬁed amount of the
tax but only confers additional powers on the Col-
lector for the better and more effective application
of the only mode of recovery authorised by the
body of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_155">section 46</a>".
</p>
<p id="p_388">81. A power is distinct from the procedure for the exer-
cise of the power. The procedure laid down by the Code
for the exercise of the powers enumerated in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_156">section 51</a> is
contained in Order 21 of the Code. The revenue laws of
each state lay down the powers as well as the procedure.
As held by the Supreme Court, the Proviso confers only

additional powers on the Collector for the better

</p><p id="p_389">-and more effective application of the only mode of

Action Pro-
</p><p id="p_390">posed (Muni-
</p><p id="p_391">.&lt;:ipal laws).
</p>
<p id="p_392">recovery authorised by the body of sub-section (2) of sec-
tion 46. The only additional power contained in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_157">section 51</a>,
C.P.C. is the power to appoint a receiver in execu-
tion of a decree. In some of the <a href="/doc/201374/" id="a_158">Revenue Act</a>s, the Collector
possesses the power to attach an estate or a village or a
part of it and mana e such attached property through his
agent. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_159">Section 51</a> o the Civil Procedure Code is not res-
tricted in its scope and a receiver may be appointed in any
case even without attachment of the property. This addi-
tional power is also now included by us in the proposed

draft.

<p id="p_393">82. The process enforceable for the recovery of an
arrear of municipal tax and'local rate, referred to in sub-
sections (3) and (4)_of <a href="/doc/308356/" id="a_160">section 46</a>, has nothing to 'db with

months after the application for refund, the Central Gov-

recommendation was made by the Income-tax Investiga-

agency which is under the direct control of the Central
Board of Revenue should be vested with jurisdiction to
hear appeals from the orders of the Income-tax Oﬁicer.
Justice should not only be done, but should appear to be
done and should inspire conﬁdence in the persons concem-
ed. - It is an elementary principle of the law that a person
should not be a judge in his own cause. The Appellate
Assistant Commissioner, being under the direct control of
the Central Board of Revenue,
a satisfactory authority to hear and dispose of appeals
against the orders of the Income-tax Oﬁicer. One sugges-
tion that was made long ago was that the Appellate Assis-
tant Commissioner should be placed under the control of

the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, so as to make him in-

<p id="p_443">dependent of the authority and inﬂuence of the Central
Board of Revenue. This question was examined by the
Income-tax Investigation Commission, and that Commis-
sion observed' that there Was no reason to think that by
reason of' the subordination of the Appellate Assistant
Commissioners to the Central Board of Revenue, they were
inﬂuenced by the Central Board of Revenue in their deci-
sions or that they were in any manner partial in the dis-
charge of their duties, or that their judgments were
affected by any considerations irrelevant to the decisions
of the appeal. No doubt, in spite of this conclusion the
Commission did make a recommendation that there should

pellate Assistant Commissioners should be removed from
the control of the Central Board of Revenue and placed
under the Appellate Tribunal. But this recommendation
was not accepted by the Select Committee constituted in
connection with the Income-tax Amendment Bill of 1952,
which examined the question in the light of the recom-
mendations made by the Income-tax Investigation Commis-
sion. The Select Committee was not in favour of any
change in the existing system. The Taxation Enquiry
Commission' again examined the question in greater de.tail
and also came to the conclusion that no change was neces-
sary. In support of their conclusion, the Taxation Enquiry
Commission gave figures to Show that in nearly 90%: of the
appeals disposed of by the Appellate Assistant Commis-
sioners the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commi sioner
were either accepted by the assessee or conﬁrmed y the
Tribunal. We have examined the further ﬁgures r the
years 1953-54, 1954-55 and 1955-1956 furnished to us y the
Central Board of Revenue and they establish that 2% of
the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner have
either been accepted by the assessee or conﬁrmed yr the
Tribunal. From this it follows that only about 8% 'of the
appeals disposed of by the Appellate Assistant C' mis-
sioners are reversed on appeal to the Appellate Tr' unal.
The value of the ﬁltration made by the Appellate As istant
Commissioners cannot be ignored, and if the decisi ns in
92% of the appeals disposed? of by them are accep d by
the assessee or conﬁrmed by the Appellate Tribunal, at fol-
lows that the disposals are not affected or vitiated any
extraneous inﬂuence and give satisfaction to the asggssees
concerned. Though we feel the force of the principl that
appeals should be disposed qf by an independent a . ncy
other than the one which is subordinate to the C ntral
Board of Revenue, the ﬁgures 'furnished to us do n jus-
tify any alteration in the existing system. We the efore
agree with the conclusion of the Taxationx Enquiry Com-
mission that a change in this behalf is neither nec ssary
nor justiﬁed. We consider therefore that the Ap llate

  

Assistant Commissioners should continue to functi n as

authority for four taxes,--income-tax, wealth-tax, expendi-
ture-tax and gift-tax, and it is also proposed to make it
the ﬁnal fact-ﬁnding authority under the Estate Dut Act.
We are constrained to observe that men of the re§uisite
calibre and independence are not being recruitedf r dis-
charging so heavy a responsibility as that of the ﬁnal fact-
ﬁding authority under the new pattern of taxation. ;There
are many complaints that the disposal of appealsby the
Appellate Tribunal is very unsatisfactory for a variety of
reasons. Often, the judicial and independent app roach
which is necessary in the ﬁnal fact-ﬁnding authority, is not
displayed by the Tribunal. In several cases the determina-
tion of complicated questions of fact and law is done! in a
very perfunctory manner. Very often, the Tribunal does
not clearly record its ﬁndings of fact or its reasons for arriv-
</p>
<p id="p_501">ing at its ﬁndings. In a number of cases, factual or legal"
</p>
<p id="p_502">contentions raised by the parties are not dealt with 'at all,

the unsatisfactory nature of the orders passed by the ppel-
late Tribunal and also on the unsatisfactory stateme ts of
case drawn up by them in the references under sect' n 66.
The High Courts had to remit the cases to the" Ap
Tribunal for a further. and better statement of the cas with
fuller particulars. To give satisfaction to the large n mber
of assessees, a decision of an independent and good ap llate
authority is an undoubted necessity, if justice is to b done
to them. There is considerable delay" in disposing f the
appeals 'and very often it is said that they, the Trib nals,
spare very little time for the appellate work with hich
alone they are concerned. Very often the Members f the
Tribunals attend the sittings at any time they choose, here-
by not conforming to regular office hours, for the di posal
of the work. A Bench of two members of the Tri, unal
hears the appeals, but in practice the contribution to the
decision of the case by one of the members is often not
appreciable. i

bunal on questions of law submitted to it and that advisory
jurisdiction cannot be exercised usefully unless the fact-
ﬁnding authority submits the facts carefully, clearly and
accurately. I am sorry to say that in the reference with
which we are dealing both in the statement of case and
in the judgment there are several inaccuracies which in
some cases are patent. A little more care would have
been sufﬁcient to make the Tribunal realise that the state-
ment of facts prepared by them was not as correct and
as satisfactory as it should have been. I hope that in
future the Tribunal will bear this in mind when preparing
the statement of case".

"The supplemental case returned to us by the Tribunal,
and which is now before us is highly unsatisfactory. The
Tribunal appears to be ,far more concerned with excusing
the statements of factlin the ﬁrst case, which are unques-
tionably contradictory, than with complying with the direc-
tioni of this Court given under <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_183">Section 66(4)</a> of the Income-
tax ct. -
</p>
<p id="p_517">"The matter was referred back to the Tribunal to record
its ﬁndingof fact more clearly, and implicit in that direction
is the takingof further evidence, if there is no otherway
of determining facts in order that the Tribunal may make
its ﬁnding clear. For the Tribunal to say that because a
fact was not before it when they disposed of the asses_see's
appeal "We are unable to include it in the case at this
stage of the proceedings", is a most surprising statement
and is one which indicates that the Tribunal does not appre-
ciate the duties cast upon it when this Court refers a matter
back under <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_184">section 66(4)</a>. The reference back to the Tribu-
nal was to record its ﬁnding more clearly and after a lapse
of one year and ten months the matter now comes back
with nothing new except the affidavit of Mr. Pralhadrai
Brijlal, which is annexed to the supplemental case".

"We have so far endured with patience the type of
statements of cases which have been submitted to 'this
Court in connection with the references that have come
up this session, but we think that the limit has been passed
and we ought to make some observations.' One common

feature -of these statements of cases is that the appeal was'

heard by two members, whereas the statement of the case
in almost every case was drawn up by different members.
In drawing up the statement, they do not seem to have

always considered it necessary to refer to the appellate
order, nor necessary to be exact in the statements they
made, n9r necessary to make a full statement of the rele-
vant facts.'. Most of the statements of cases are sketchy in
the extreme and, were one to rely upon them alone, it would
be impossible to answer any question at all. It has been 'a
frequent experience this session to ﬁnd two members of a
Tribunal deciding a particular case in a particular manner
and one of those members, acting with a third member,
stating a case for this Court which differed materially from
the case made and found at the hearing of the appeal. We
shall not say, out of respect for the Tribunal, that_ the
members have acted in a careless manner, but we feel
bound to say that the manner in which they have dischar-
ged their duty of drawing up statements of cases for this
Court can only be called carefree".

<p id="p_522">"Unfortunately, the treatment of the question by the

there is hardly any justiﬁcation for the Tribunal failing to
realise at least what facts were required to be found and
stated. The statement of the case is sketchy and bare and
like most of the statements we have had to deal with dur-

<p id="p_538">95. The present procedure leads to delay also. If the
Tribunal refuses to make a reference to the High Court
where it should have done so, the asesisee or the depart-
ment have had to go to the High Count under <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_190">section 66(2)</a>
and this has led to considerable delay in giving a ﬁnality
to the assessment. The extracts given above would also
show that the statements of cases submitted by the Tribu-
nals to the High Court are scrappy, with the result that
the High Court has had to ask for a supplementary state-
</p>
<p id="p_539">ment in several cases.
</p>
<p id="p_540">96. For these reasons we are strongly of the opinion Ab§liti°n 01'

A that the Appellate Tribunal should be abolished and that a 'h°*'APP°"""°

direct appeal should be provided both on questions of fact :;:E$'alpr°'

as well as of law to the High Court fmm the orders of the
Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The assessee should
have the satisfaction that the facts of the case and the law
applicable to it have been examined b a competent autho-
rity. It would also save the time ol, the High Court, as
it would avoid the necessity -for a reference to the High
Court on a question of law either under <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_191">section 66(1)</a> or
under <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_192">section 66(2)</a>. We have therefore, provided' an ap-
peal to the High Court from the decisions of the Appellate
Assistant Commissioner. Where the amount in dispute is
Rs. 7,500 or more, the appeal" will be on fact as well as
0? law. In other cases the appeal will be only on questions
0 law. «

It is stated that the disposal by the High Courts may
cause delay, particularly as the rules of the High Courts
require printing in ﬁrst appeagls. To obviate this difficulty,
we suggest that by a rule made by the appropriate autho-
rity the printing of records inésuch cases may be dispensed
with, and the Department and the assessee may be allowed
to furnish typed copies of papers on which they intend to
rely at the time of the hearing of the appeal before the
High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_541">97. We have also examined the ﬁnancial implications
of the proposal and we are satisﬁed that it does not involve
the States in any extra expenditure, as all expenditure.
necessitated by the appointment of more Judges in the
High Court and the necessary' staff can be met by the fee.
that will be levied on the appeals instituted in the High
Court. At present the fee is Rs. 100 in case of appeals
to the Appellate Tribunal and, the ariiount realised in the
year 1955-56 by the Tribunal. is Rs. 8,46,390 which, of
course, includes also fees for Reference Applications. (The
department does not pay any fee when it ﬁles an appeal
or asks for a reference). The expenditure incurred' in
that year for the Appellate Tribunal. is Rs. 8,7-4.684. We
have not got the ﬁgures for 1956-57. Even if the fee is res-.
tricted to Rs. 100 per appeal and if 10,000 appeals are ﬁled,
all the States will get an ingome  }Rs\ 10,00,000. If 20

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">54</span>
<p id="p_544">Judges are appointed for all the High Courts, the total
salary payable per year will be Rs. 8.40,000 leaving a sur-
plus for the expenditure on the additional staff that would
be required by the appointment of additional Judges.
</p>
<p id="p_545">_ If we consider the position State-wise, the highest ins-
titution of appeals is in Bombay and may be taken rough-
ly at 2,000 appeals per year. The Bombay State will get a
fee of Rs. 2,00,000. Even if four more Judges are appointed
their total salary per year will be Rs. 1,68,000, leaving a
surplus for the additional staff. Similarly, Madras may re-
quire three Judges. Bengal may require two Judges
and Uttar Pradesh may require two or three
Judges. In other States like Bihar and Punjab an addi-
tional Judge may be required. It will, therefore, not en-
tail any additional .expenditure from State funds which
could not be met from the fee leviable on the appeals ins-
tituted in the respective State High Courts. As observed
already, the work in which the High Courts are now enga-
ged namely disposing of references either under <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_193">section
66(1)</a> or under <a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_194">section 66(2)</a> will pro tanto be reduced, and
this is an additional advantage for the High Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_546">98. Rules will necessarily have to be made to regulate
the procedure for the disposal of the appeals expeditious-
ly. Delay is occasioned by the printing of records which
will not be necessary. If the rule making power is confer-
red on the various High Courts there may not be uniformi-
ty in that behalf. We, therefore, think that it will be more
appropriate to confer the rule making power upon -the
Supreme Court' as was done in the case of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_195">Companies
Act</a>, 1956. As regards the levy of the fees and the scales
which are to be prescribed, it may not be possible for the
Centre to prescribe the fee. Some method should be adopt-
ed to make the Court-fee payable on the memorandft) of
appeal presented to the High Court in such matters uni rm
in all the States. We have not therefore made any deﬁinite
proposal in this behalf. .
</p>
<p id="p_547">99. In view of the recommendation made by us for-the
abolition of the Appellate Tribunal, and as appeals would
henceforth lie to the High Court from the Appellate 'As-
sistant Commissioners' orders, We consider that Gov rn-
ment should ensure that the posts of Appellate Assis ant
Commissioners are held by experienced and senior oiﬁders.
</p>
<p id="p_548">100. It will be more satisfactory if experienced :and
senior oiﬁcers of the Department hear appeals. ;
</p>
<p id="p_549">101. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner shduld
also, in our opinion, be given some training in judicial
practice and procedure by being attached to a Judge of a
Civil Court, z'.e., a District Judge, for a period of, say, three
months. This will be very necessary because the order, of
the Appellate Assistant Commissioner should be writﬂen,

'Sec-.. clause 277, App. 1. '



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">55</span>

more or less, like a judgment'and should make mention of
the points for determination, and the ﬁndings thereon. We'
consider that if Appellate Assistant Commissioners are
given this type of training, it will inspire greater conﬁ-
dence in the litigant public.
</p>
<p id="p_550">102. It may be recalled in this connection that when
the Appellate Tribunal was notgin existence, i.e., prior to
1939, the reference to the High Court, though directed
against the order of the Assistant Commissioner, was made
by the Commissioner of Income-tax himself. Though an
officer of the status of Commissioner of Income-tax may
not hear all appeals, it would be desirable if appeals ' '
against assessments of incomes in excess of rupees one
lakh were heard by the Commissioner of Income-tax or by
an officer of equal status. If this recommendation is ac-
cepted, the necessary amendments may be made in the
Act. Other appeals should be heard by senior oﬁicers
Whose scale of pay is attractive. We would recommend for
Appellate Assistant Commissioners a «scale of pay inter-
mediate between the present Appellate Assistant Commis-
sioner's scale and the present Commissioner's scale.
</p>
<p id="p_551">103. As second appeals would lie (if our proposal isC°mmis5i°n-
</p>
<p id="p_552">accepted) to the High Court and as the smaller assessees "'5'

may not be able to afford the expense involved in such an

appeal, we would recommend the free use by commission-
</p>
<p id="p_553">ers of Income-tax of their judicial powers to give relief to

the smaller assessees. In the case of smaller assessees the
Commissioner should treat an application in revision as an

appeal. Administrative instructions to this effect may be

given by the Central Board of Revenue. '

</p><p id="p_554">104. The.other important change which has been made other chan-
</p>
<p id="p_555">in this Chapter is the provision' for appeals against all 868-

'"'°"'' The important changes made in this Chapter are as
under :-- i

(1) -Authorised representatives.--'We consider thatthere
is no justiﬁcation for permitting a person who is not a
lawyer or a chartered accountant to appear in the i ome-
tax proceedings. The Income-tax Officer exercises wers
which are often far more_ responsible than the powers'simi-
larly exercised by a civil court or a criminal court. hen
persons other than lawyers are not allowed to appear fore
the civil court and the criminal court, there is no reason
why persons who are not entitled to appear beforeYsuch
courts should be permitted to appear in an income-tax, pro-
ceeding. An exception should however be made in favour
of chartered accountants as they assist companies in the
maintenance of accounts. Moreover, they have certain obli-
gations under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_198">Companies Act</a> in relation to the prE}&gt;ara-
tion of the accounts of companies. We have therefor pro-
vided that appearance in income-tax proceedings be confined
to lawyers and chartered accoilntants. 1

In order to protect the interests of those personsgwho
are, under the provisions of the present Act entitl d to
appear in the income-tax proceedings, we have provide for
the continuance of their right to appear in the incom tax
proceedings. We have however, provided that they s ould
be registered as Income-tax Practitioners. We are al 0 of
the opinion that there should be a disciplinary bo to
control such Income-tax practirtibners. We have ther f-ore
made suitable changesin the provisions of <a href="/doc/638929/" id="a_199">sections 59</a> and
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_200">61</a> ' '

(2) Service of notices.--We have provided for the ode
of service of notice under the Act in the assessmen of
dissolved ﬁrms, dissolved associations and dis ted
H.U.Fs. also. 
</p>
<p id="p_561">(3) Rules.'--We have added a provision authorisin the
Central Board of Revenue to make rules relating to the
issue of tax verification certiﬁcates. Such certiﬁcates ave
been found useful in practice ' d it is desirable to ace

them on a statutory footing. e have also added a p ovi- _

sion for making rules relating to the constitution of an
authority to take disciplinary -action against Incom tax

practitioners (other than lawyers and Chartered Accoun-'

tants).
</p><p id="p_562">110. The Schedules which we propose to annex to» the
Act are as under :-- L
First Schedule--re1ptes to iisurance business.' {
'Sec clause 324, App. I,; d clause 9, ibid. I
'See notes on the Sched , for the , ngcs made.

Schedules.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">57</span>
<p id="p_563">Second Schedule.--Brings together in one place the pro-
visions pertaining to the procedure to be adopted by the
Collector for the recovery of tax on a "certiﬁcate issued to
him. 1

Third Schedule.--Deals with the procedure to be adopt-
ed by the Income-tax Officer who is empowered by the
Commissioner to recover tax by distraint and sale of mov-
able property.
</p>
<p id="p_564">111. In the preparation of notes on clauses we have Scheme of
departed from the method adopted by us in our previous "OW! 011
reports. In the previous reparts we have followed the ""'°s'
order of the sections in the Act under rwision and wherever
new provisions were suggested, they were dealt with in
appropriate places. This method could not be followed in
revising this <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_201">Act (Income-tax Act</a>) as 'we have reshuﬂied
all the sections and sub-sections of the Act. Hence the order
of the clauses in the proposed draft has-been followed in
preparing the Notes on clauses.
</p>
<p id="p_565">112. A word may be said about the increased number Incr asc in
of the sections in the draft.' The U.K. Act of 1952 contains nu"? ' °f
532 sections and 25 Schedules. The existing Income-tax5°°"°""
Act has 67 sections and one Schedule. One section (Sec-
tion 10) of the existing Act however, covers 14 printed pages
in the Income-tax Manual, and some of the sections in the
Act, though bearing one number have the letters A to V
added e.g., <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_202">sections 58A</a>, and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_203">58B</a>. The 67 sections of the
Act cover 186 printed pages in the Income-tax Manual.
</p>
<p id="p_566">The actual number of sections in the' existing Act is not
67, but "about 120. The number of sections in the draft
is thus only two and a half times the number in the ex-
isting Act. The increase in the number of sections is
due to the fact that the existing sections have been split
into a number of sections. It is h-oped that the_total cover-
age of the draft in printed pages Will not show any appre-
ciable increase.

<p id="p_838">Existing Sec- (15) Regarding grossing up of dividends, it is further

tion I6 (2)- recommended that where a dividend is declared out of pro-
ﬁts taxed in earlier years, and there are no taxable proﬁts
of the company in the year of declaration of the dividend,
the grossing up should be allowed at the rate which would
have been applicable to the company in the year of decla-

would clarify the position'.

band is a partner, is included in the total income of the hus-
band. In modern times, however, a large number of'
partnerships have come into existence, in which the wife
contributes substantial capital, or renders active assistance
by virtue of her professional qualiﬁcations. It is recom-
mended that the provision in question should notapply
to professional partnerships in such cases. (The case of a
wife working in partnership with her husband as a doctor
or lawyer may be cited as a typical example.)

It may be noted that the provision in question was
enacted at a time when women had no resources of their
own and had not joined the learned professions. With the
changes in economic and social conditions that have taken
place in modern times, the provision must be modiﬁed.
This will also be in accordance with the s irit of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_240">article 15</a>

(21) The present anomalous position regarding assess- Exming sec-
ment- of companies in respect of distributed and undistri- tion 23 A.

the fact that existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_242">section 23A</a> of the Income-tax Act
encourages the maximum distribution of proﬁts, while the
provision in the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_243">Finance Act</a> aims at the minimum distri-

<p id="p_4700">land from which the income derived is agricultural income",

tural land from taxation by the Union, and it would,
therefore, be in conformity with that scheme to express
this exclusion, not in terms of "agricultural income" but in
terms of land. Agricultural land which has been cultivated,
say, for 5 years and then remained fallow for 2 or 3 years
during which it is sold, would, under the existing deﬁnition,
attract capital gains tax. This anomaly will now be remov-

<p id="p_4751">Notes to clause 3.
</p>
<p id="p_4752">Sub-clause (1)----
</p>
<p id="p_4753">(1) The word "person" has been substituted for the
words "individual", "Hindu undivided faimily" etc. and the
deﬁnition of "person" is being jwidenedl' for the following
reasons :-- : .. '

</p><p id="p_4754">(a) As already explained'. the co ined effect of the

T deﬁnition of "person" in section,'2(9) of he <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1957">Income-tax Act</a>

and section 3(42) of the Generali Clause 'Act is that a "per-
son" includes (a) Hindu undivided fam' y; (b) local autho-
rity; (c) company; and (d) assbciationotr body of indivi-
duals whether incorporated or riot. No eciﬁc mention has
been made of corporations othdr than dmpanies included
within category (d). i  »

The problem which has troubled the courts is whether
such corporations are withinithe ch ing section. It
can be met by the suggested mend ,t by introducing 7
the word "person" in the se tion. <a href="/doc/1027409/" id="a_1958">I 'Commissioner of

</p>
<p id="p_4758">ly, in <a href="/doc/265200/" id="a_1959">Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras vs. The Bar
Council, Madras</a>', a bar council_ and in the Baronetcy case'
a corporation sole, were treated as individuals. It seems
desirable to make the position clear.
</p>
<p id="p_4759">(b) There is also the problem of private religious
trusts in favour of deities or mutts which are treated as
artiﬁcial jurisdical person in law, vide existing<a href="/doc/1543897/" id="a_1960"> S. 41</a>. The
point for consideration is whether it is proper to bring
them under "individual" by a strained construction or whe-
ther it would be more appropriate to include them under
"person". These difficulties can be solved if we adopt the
word "person" in<a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_1961"> S. 3</a>, the charging section. It may be
noted incidentally that in the existing<a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_1962"> S. 3</a> it occurs only
in the expression "association of persons".
</p>
<p id="p_4760">(c) All the foreign Acts employ the term "person" in
the charging section, and it is better to resolve all doubt
about the chargeability of particular classes of persons by
using the comprehensive term "person" in <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_1963">section 3</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4761">(2) The next point for consideration is the,difﬁculty
noticed in sustaining the legality of the recovery of the
tax on the current income under<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1964"> S. 18</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1965">18A</a>. The charge
created under <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_1966">section 3</a> applies to the income of the pre-
vious year, while the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1967">sections 18</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1968">18A</a>
apply to the income of the assessment year also. To meet
this difficulty a proviso has been added on the lines of the
Ceylon Income-tax Ordinance to cover the provisions of
the Act relating to charging the tax in particular cases in
respect of income, proﬁt and gains of a period other than

_the previous year. This will cover<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1969"> S. 24A</a>, <a href="/doc/1226169/" id="a_1970">25(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1971">44B</a>

(3) of the Act, whereby the income of the assessment year
itself is made.chargeable at the rates prescribed by the
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_1972">Finance Act</a> of the assessment year.
</p>
<p id="p_4762">Sub-clause (2) is intended to make it clear that there
is some kind of liability to pay tax in cases where tax is
xdeductible at source or payable in advance. It seems desir-
able to make a reference to this obligation to pay tax in
advance etc. in the charging section itself, so as to bring
out more directly a position which is implied in existing
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1973">sections 18</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1974">18A</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4763">(3) After the phrase "in respect of the total income
of the previous year" the words "or years, as the case may
be" have been added. Under the deﬁnition of "previous year '
in the existing <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_1975">section 2(_11)</a> a person may have separate
previous years in respect of each separate source of in-

set in the taxable territories" in the existing <a href="/doc/1627329/" id="a_2007">section 42(1)</a>
are slightly ambiguous, since "in taxable territories" can
be read either with "sale" or with "capital asset". To re-
move this ambiguity, the word "situate" has been added
after "capital asset". (It is not necessary to make any such
addition in the earlier phrases referring to business con-
nection etc._. since the language there does not end itself
to any ambiguity.)

The words "that part of the operations", inthe existing
<a href="/doc/1627329/" id="a_2008">section 42(3)</a> have been replaced by "the operations", for
two reasons; ﬁrst, the word "that" in the existing section

secondly, the existing words are not in symmetry with

</p><p id="p_4831">2. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_2020">Before the Amendment Act</a> of 1939, there was in
the Act only the provision which corresponds to the exist'-
mg provision in 4(3) (1), main era. The instruction in the
Income-tax Manual issued by e authority of the Govern-
ment of India at that time was, that the word "property"
in clause (i) does not bear the restricted meaning that it
bears in <a href="/doc/1369261/" id="a_2021">section 9</a> of the Act, but includes securities or
business or share in a business. In view of the recommen-
dations made in the Income-tax Enquiry Report, 1936' (to
give statutoryeﬁect to this practice, subject to the condi-
tions to be observed by the business) an amendment was
introduced by adding clause (via) which was as follows :--
</p>
<p id="p_4832">» "Any income derived from business carried on, on be-
half of a religious or charitable institution, when the in-
coréie is applied solely for the purposes of the institution
an

</p><p id="p_4833">(a) the business is harried on in the course of the car-
</p>
<p id="p_4834">rying out of a primary purpose of the institution,
or

</p><p id="p_4835">(b) the work in connection with the business is mainly

carried on by beneﬁciaries of the institution."
</p>
<p id="p_4836">(After the amendment in 1939, the Government chang-
ed the instructions in the Manual, expressing the view that
in the case of business, the conditions laid down in clause
(ia) should be fulﬁlled before exemption could be grant-
ed).
</p>
<p id="p_4837">9 3. The meaning of the word "property" in clause (i)
was judicially considered and it was held that it includes
even business if the business was subject-matter of a trust.
This was the view taken in Charitable Gadodia. <a href="/doc/1058556/" id="a_2022">Swaideshi
Stores vs. C.I.T., Punjab</a> by the Lahore High Court'. Deal-
ing with the contention that the word "property" in clause
</p><p id="p_4838">(i) does not include business. their Lordships of the Lahore
High Court held that the two clauses were intended to
apply to different situations and that the word " roperty"
in clause (i) was wide enough to include all kin s of pro-
perty including business. It was also pointed out that
clause (ia),dealt with a business conducted by a religious
or charitable institution without any reference to ?trust'
whatever. In an instructive judgment, Din. Mohammad J.
in that case also pointed out the distinction between an
institution and a trust. He held that an institution
may be religious or charitable and may still. not
be held under trust. Clause (ia), according to
him, does not in any way subtract anything from the sub-
ject and provides immunity for a certain kind of business
which in the view of the legislature had not already, been

rovided 'for. From this decision it follows that where
gusiness, which is property within the meaning of elause
</p><p id="p_4839">(i), is impressed with the character of trust, the income
from such business is altogether exempt and it is not obli-
gatory that in the case of. suchbusiness the conditions laid

down in clause (ia) should be fulﬁlled. (Clause (ia) thus
applies to a different situation, namely, where there is an
institution and that institution 'carries on business which
is not subject to a trust. In such a case the remiisites of
the section must be complied with. The income must be
applied solely to the purpose of the institution and the
charitable or religious institution must also fulﬁl the con-
ditions in sub-clauses (a) and (b). As to the distinction
between an institution and a trust, see also the discussion
in a recent Privy Council case,' and Gunn's commentary
on the Australian Income~tax Act.')

</p><p id="p_4842">4. That "property" in clause (i) includes business has
been well established not only by a decision of the Judicial
Committee' but also by the latest pronouncement of the
Supreme Court in J. K. Trust Case'. . This aspect there-
fore does not present much difficulty. (The dilﬁculty as
to in which set of circumstances clause (ia) applies still
remains, though the View in Gadodia Swadeshi Stores'
case has subsequently been followed and conﬁrmed by the
High Courts -of Allahabad' and:Bombay'.
</p>
<p id="p_4843">5. In view of the recommendations. made by Din.
Mohammad J. in Gadodia's case and by the Income-tax In-
vestigation Commission [Report (1948) at pages 56-57,
paragraph 131] the legislature in 1953 [vide the amending
Act of 1953 (Act 25 of 1953)] converted clause (via) into a
proviso to clause (i), and by subsequent legislation it was
made clause (b) of the proviso to clause (i) (vide the
amending Act of 1955). 'The object of this legislation was
to restrict the operation of clause (i), where the property
consisted of business impressed with the character of trust,
by applying the limitation imposed by clause (b) of the
proviso'.
</p>
<p id="p_4844">But in carrying out this object, the immunity which
was granted under clause (ia), (as it stood before 1953),
in the case of business carried on' 'by a religious or charit-
able institution and not subject to trust, was negatived.
The linking up of old clause (via)_ to clause (i) had the
effect of taking away the separate exemption granted by
clause (ia). In other words, the conversion of clause (ia) in-
to a groviso has led to the op osite result of depriving the

conferred by clause (ia) on charitable and religious instit-
tutions which carried on business which was not subjected
to trust (provided they fulﬁlled the conditions laid down
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of that clause). We think that
this result was not intended by the legislature. If the
intention is----as undoubtedly it has been from 1936----to
impose restrictions in the case of business whether carried
on by a trust or by a religious or charitable institution, the
intention should be clearly stated in the Act. But the im-
munity itself need not be taken away. In order to avoid
the anomaly the clauses should be so drafted as to bring
about the real intention of the legislature, and this we
have done in the proposed draft. '

</p><p id="p_4848">6. Incidentally, it may be noted that the legislature
really wanted the conditions contained in paragraph (b)
of the Proviso to apply not only to cases where business
is carried on by the institution, but also Where the business
was the subject-matter of a trust (i.e., even if there was
no institution). This object has also not. been properly car-
ried out, and some redrafting is desirable on this point
also. On this assumption, it has been made clear in the
draft that the restrictions in paragraph (b) of the Pnoviso
will apply to both the cases. ~ ,

</p><p id="p_4849">7. In short, the redraft makes clear the two points that
require clariﬁcation, namely :.--- '

</p><p id="p_4850">(i) Exemption under <a href="/doc/1493165/" id="a_2026">section 4(3)</a> (i) is (in the case of
a business) subject to the conditions given in@ Pro-
visio (b), irrespective of whether the business is
carried on by a trust or an institution. =

</p><p id="p_4851">(ii) The exemption is also available to institutionf not
subject to trust, (subject to the same conditons).
</p>
<p id="p_4852">8. For the sake of clarity, a__ trust carrying on a busi-
ness is dealt with separately in draft sub-clause (2), and
draft sub-clause (1) is conﬁned to other properties, wide

</p><p id="p_4853">9. Besides this important change, the following pbints
may also be noted :---- 
</p>
<p id="p_4854">(a) The phrase "religious or charitable purposes?' oc-
curring in the existing Act has been replacetl by
the phrase "charitable or religious purposes", to
give more prominence to charitable purposes.'

</p><p id="p_4855">(b) The existing <a href="/doc/1493165/" id="a_2027">section 4(3)</a> (i) opens with the words

"subject to the provisions of clause ((3) of %sub-
section (1) of section '16". The limitation expres-
sed by these words has been retained in draft sub-
clause (1), but it is to be considered whether there
is any sound reason for this limitation. '111e eﬁect

salary which is "due" to an employee and other salary
"paid" which is not due to him. The former is taxable on
"due" basis whether actual payment has been made or not,
while the latter is taxable on the basis of actual payment.
This aspect is more clearly brought out in the present draft.
(See the decision of Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/1498889/" id="a_2035">Bhuban Mohan

held that an amount due in one year could be taxed in a
later year in which it was received).

<p id="p_4879">But the arrears of salary which call for speciﬁc treat-
ment are those where Services are rendered in a past "ear

since in many cases the determination may take years. It
would also not be possible to keep the assessment pending
until such determination is made. The Departmental prac-
tice has been to include such arrears in the total income
</p><p id="p_4881">-of the year of receipt. Relief is aﬁorded against the hard-
ship involved in the taxation of the lump-sum by means of
an order under <a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_2036">section 60</a>, sub-section' (2), the effect of
which is that the arrears are attributed to the periods to
which they should reasonably be related. Assessment in
the year of receipt is in accordance with the decision of
the Calcutta High Court in Usha Ram' Roy Choudhuran'i.'s
case.
</p>
<p id="p_4882">The recent decision of the Calcutta High Court in
Bhuban Mohan Bane'rjee's case,' however, contains obser-
vations which may be taken to mean that a salary pay-
ment made in a subsequent year would still be taxable
'only on due basis in the ﬁrst year. The decision does not
create any diﬁiculty if the word "due" is interpreted as
relating to the point of time when the amount is actually
«quantiﬁed by the employer. On this view the claim for
relief under <a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_2037">section 60(2)</a> may not be admlssible. But
if it is intended that such amounts should be related to
the back years and subjected to tax under <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_2038">section 34</a>, diffi-
culty may arise in the initiation of such proceedings be-
cause of limitation. It can even be argued that these are
not cases of escapement of -income, there being no omis-
sion or commission by the assessee or by the Department.
'There will be further difficulty for the employer in the
matter of making deduction of tax at source, and some
confusion is bound to arise as to whether the tax so deduct-
</p>
<p id="p_4883">ed at the time of payment should be' given credit for the

year for which the assessment under <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_2039">section 34</a> is supposed
to be made. .
</p>
<p id="p_4884">On the whole the present Departmental practice seems
to be a reasonable compromise and is fair to the assessee
and the Department. It is fair to the Department because
the complication of <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_2040">section 34</a> is avoided, and even when
.an. order under <a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_2041">section 60(2)</a> is passed the consequential' ad-
justment of tax is made in that assessment itself and not
'by reopening past assessments. It ispftnir to the assessee,
because if the amount were to be treated as due only when
it is paid, the question of relief under'<a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_2042">section 60(2)</a> would
not.arise, while the Departmental practice ensures that the
assessee is to be in the same position as if he had been
"taxed in the respective years after spnead-back of the ar-
rears to the relative period. »

There may, of course, be cases when the assessee will
be worse off by the arrears being related back than when
he is taxed on the arrears. This will happen when the ar-
rears of salary are received after retirement or after rever-
sion from a higherpost. In those cases-tl'ie'ass'essee will not
apply for relief under <a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_2043">section 60(2)</a> and no action is taken
by the Department itself  'section :34..o,r otherwise.

as follows :--

<p id="p_4892">(i) Draft sub-clause 16 (ii) :----The provision relating
to deduction for entertainment allowance has been made
more logical in one respect. Where a person was in receipt
of entertainment allowance at a lower rate before 1stfApriE
1955, his claim for deduction will not be tofally forileited,

given effect to.
</p>
<p id="p_4895">(ii) Draft clause 16 (iv) :---The allowance for expenses-
incurred by an employee in the performance of his duties
has been made exclusive not _only of entertainment allow-
ance (as at present), but also of the allowance for ex nses
for books etc. and conveyance allowance. The existin pro-
vision; <a href="/doc/1849490/" id="a_2048">section 7(2)</a> (iii), does not include these latte . cate-
gories. The change has been made in order to make' the
provision comprehensive. 3

The wording has also been changed so as to make it
precise. The word "necessarily" has been omitted,§ as it
is unduly restrictive. We have followed the language of
existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2049">section 10(2)</a> (xv). ~

It may also be pointed out that the Royal Commission

wording "all expenses reasonably incurred for the appro-
priate performance of the duties of the oﬁice or employ-
ment". This, the Commission has pointed out, would re-
move the complaint that the legislature imposes upon
those in employment a narrower form of allowance for
expenses than it accords to persons deriving a private in-
come from their own efforts. The wording suggested by

the Royal Commission is worth consideration as an alter-'

native.
</p>
<p id="p_4896">(iii) Draft clause 17(1) :--'1'-he deﬁnition of "employer"
as now adopted includes a foreign Government, reference
to which is not to be found in the present <a href="/doc/1849490/" id="a_2050">section 7</a>. It is
for consideration whether the mention 'of foreign Govern-
ment as employer is acceptable; It has been suggested that
by such inclusion the assessee'will not be subject to any
heavier tax burden but on the other hand may qualify for
relief under <a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_2051">section 60(2)</a> which will be advantageous to
him. The possibility of an employee of a foreign Govern-
ment being required to make an actual payment of tax (on
"due" basis) without actually receiving the salary will
not arise, because <a href="/doc/1953304/" id="a_2052">section 7(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2053">2nd</a> roviso, lays down that
where tax is deductible at source, t e sesessee shall not be
called upon to pay the tax himself unless he has received
salary without deduction. How far the procedure for de-
duction (<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2054">section 18</a>) will be enforceableagainst a foreign
Government will also be a matter for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_4897">(iv) Draft clause 17(2) :---Item (ii) relating to annui-
ties has provoked some discussion. It has been suggested
that annuities paid by the Government or local authorities
should be taxed as salary irrespective of Whether the payee
is an employee or not. This cannot be accepted, as it goes
against the basic scheme of the section.

in the draft. these have been treated as deductions, it is
possible that the deductions might. in a particular case,
exceed the total gross income. In such cases, the excess
will be treated as a loss. We do not think that this result
should be avoided. Deductions under the head "Interest
on securities" should be treated on the same lines as de-
ductions under other heads; if the income is a loss, it should
be dealt with as a loss under any other head.

Notes to clause 22 to 21

. _ <a href="/doc/1369261/" id="a_2065">Section 9</a> of the existing Act has been split up into
separate clauses'. The title of 'the head has been charged
into '"Income from house property", because the section
deals only with that property 'and not any other immova-
able property. --
</p>
<p id="p_4914">In the draft, after having stated that the annual value
is the basis of chargeability, the expression "annual value"
is deﬁned. The basis of computation of annual value in the
case of a tenanted building and in the case of owner-
occupied building is set out separately'. The main drafting
changes are the omission of provisos and re-arranging the
section on a more logical basis. An interpretation clause
has been added. '

The detailed changes made in each clause are explain-
ed below :--
</p>
<p id="p_4915">Clause 22 '

The head has been changed into "Income from House
property" as already explained. In the expression "bona-
tide annual value" the words "bona-ﬁde" have been omit-
ted. The section deﬁnes only "annual value" and not
</p><p id="p_4916">2. "bona-ﬁde annual value". <a href="/doc/1767760/" id="a_2066">Section 9(2)</a> also uses "annual
value'' only. Moreover the words "bona-ﬁde" do not in
any way make the meaning clearer.
</p>
<p id="p_4917">Clause 23

Sub-clause (1) :--The sub-clause corresponds to sec-
tion 9(2) and no change has been made.
</p>
<p id="p_4918">Sub--clause (2):--This is new. It seems desirable to
embody some rules in the Act to furnish guidance in deter-
mining the annual value of tenanted property. The draft
sub-clause tries to set out the considerations to be
borne in mind in such cases. The sub-clause, of course,
does not purport to be exhaustive, and refers only to fac-
tors of importance. «

Sub-clause (3) :---Deals with property occupied by the
owner. The ﬁrst para sets out, in a simple form, the provi-
sion contained in <a href="/doc/1767760/" id="a_2067">section 9(2)</a>, first proviso for reduction
of the annual value. The form has been changed in order
to avoid all ambiguity. The second para corresponds to
the last line of <a href="/doc/1767760/" id="a_2068">section 9(2)</a>, ﬁrst proviso. The existing sec-
tion provides that the annual value shall not exceed 10
per cent. of the total income of the assessee. Now the
total income of the assessee will naturally include income
from such occupied property. The calculation of the an-
nual value thus becomes a complicated mathematical pro-
blem (see formula below). It will be evident from the
formula given below that the annual value so calculated
comes to 6/55 i.e., roughly 11 r cent. of the other income
of the assessee. The draft, t erefore, provides that this
11 per cent. shall be taken as the annual value. No addi-
tional liability is saddled on the assessee.

As regards the proviso to existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2089">section 10(2)(vi)</a>,
clauses (a) and (c) of the proviso have been transferred to
the draft clause on conditions for depreciation'.

<p id="p_4973">Clause (b) of the proviso has been transferred to the
Chapter on Aggregation of income and Set off of loss, being

</p>
<p id="p_4974">Item 32(1) (ii)--See notes under item (i) above.
Item 32(1)(iii)---Existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2090">section 10(2)</a> (via) has been
simpliﬁed as follows :--
</p>
<p id="p_4975">(i) The main proviso finds a place in clause (iii) while
the second parenthesis (for exclusion of extra allowance for
double shift working) has been framed,as an Explanation;
this will avoid interruption in reading.
</p>
<p id="p_4976">(ii) The ﬁrst parenthesis-----containing the words
"(which shall be deductible in determing the written down
value)" has been omitted. Since clause (via) now forms
part of "depreciation", the allowance will naturally be de-
ducted in determining the written down value under exist-
ing <a href="/doc/472660/" id="a_2091">section 10(5)</a> (bi).
</p>
<p id="p_4977">(iii) The time for the allowance--ending on the
31st day of March 1959, has been transferred to the clause
relating to conditions for depreciation". If this deduction
becomes obsolete by the time the new Act comes into force,
it may be deleted.
</p>
<p id="p_4978">Clause 32(l)(iv)----The propositions embodied in sec-
</p>
<p id="p_4979">tion 10(2)(vii) are these :--
</p>
<p id="p_4980">1. A loss on the sale of an asset is allowed as a deduc-
tion. "Loss" here means the difference between the
written down value and the sale price when the
latter is lower than the former;
</p>
<p id="p_4981">2. A proﬁt on such sale is counted 'as income. "Proﬁt"
here means the excess of the sale price over the
written down value. (If the sale price exceeds even
the original cost, then such excess is a capital
gain.)

</p><p id="p_4982">3. In the case of asset not sold, but discarded, eto., the

place of sale price is taken by its scrap value, as increased
by insurance moneys, etc., if received.

</p>
<p id="p_4986">(i) Only the "Loss" aspect has been dealt with. here.

</p><p id="p_4988">(ii) Unnecessary repetition has been avoided. The 3rd
proviso and the main para of <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2092">section 10(2)(vii)</a> have been
combined in the draft in clause 32(1) (iv), since the princi-
ple is the same.
</p>
<p id="p_4989">Much of the existing 4th proviso repeats parts of the
3rd proviso. The draft clause 32(1) (iv) expresses the prin-
ciple behind these two provisons in such a manner as to
render repetition unnecessary in the draft for the fourth
proviso'. .
</p>
<p id="p_4990">(iii) Simplicity in expression in general has been at-
tempted. For example, the 3rd proviso at present says that
where insurance, etc., moneys are received, then the amount
by which the difference between the written down value
and the scrap value exceeds the amount of insurance
moneys is allowed as a deduction. This merely embodies
the simple proposition (vide proposition 3rd above), that in-
surance -moneys are added to the scrap value.
</p>
<p id="p_4991">Thus--the existing formula is--
</p>
<p id="p_4992">Written down value minus scrap value minus Insu-
rance--Allowed deduction (Shifting "scrap value", this be-
comes) ~ '

Written down value minus' (Scrap value+Insurance)=
Allowed deduction.

<p id="p_4994">Existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2093">section 10(2)(vib)</a> has been incorporated here.
An important change has been made with reference to the
year in respect of which the development rebate is to be
allowed. The existing section allows it only for the year of
acquisition or installation; but it seems desirable to allow
the rebate in the next year, if the ship or machinery is ac-
tually put to use in the next year.
</p>
<p id="p_4995">The proviso to existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2094">section 10(2)(vib)</a> has been

ing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2105">section 10(2)(vi)</a> or 10(2)(via). The draft provision has
therefore been added to avoid a double allowance. Since
the draft was prepared. the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2106">Finance Act</a>. 1958, has also in-
corporated this provision. in the Act. But it would, seem
that "furniture" should not be subject to the restriction em-
bodied in this clause, since existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2107">section 10(2)</a> (vii) does
not apply to furniture. The draft retains "furniture" in
view of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2108">Finance Act</a>. but the matter requires to be con~
sidered. '

Sub-clause (3)--A part of existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2109">section 10(2)</a>§(vib),
as amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2110">Finance Act</a>, 1958, has been inco orat-
ed here. The changes are mostly verbal and 'cons,quen--
tial; but an important point which requires to be mdntion-
ed is, that, the words "and if any gush ship, machinery or
plant is sold .......... ..", occurring in the latter half of the
proviso to existing <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2111">section 10(2)</a>|(Vib) have, in the draft, been
taken as applicable to all ships etc., in respect of which
development rebate has been obtained, and not conﬁned to
the ships etc. to which clause (b) of that proviso applies.
This wider interpretation seems in consonance With <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_2112">section
35(ll)</a> (as inserted by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2113">Finance Act</a>, 1958) which is appli-
cable to all ships etc.

The provisions contained in existing <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_2114">section 10(2l3)</a> and

Government does not want to enforce these provisions for
the future: in any case. the 'changes made in existing sec-

so far as development rebate ls concerned.

for deduction for» land revenue etc. and says that the deduc-

the business. The provision for deduction has already
been dealt with in the draft clause on deductions. The
present draft sub-clause deals with the limitation regard-
ing "part".

respect in draft sub-clause (1), in order to avoid any al-
teration in tax liability.]

Sub-clause (3)--corresponds to existing section- 10(3).
The word "wholly" has been replaced by the word "exclu-
sively". It has been held' that the words "not wholly .... .."
mean that the building is not used exclusively for the
purposes of the business, but for other purposes also.
(These words, the court held, have nothing to do with
the period of user during the previous year.) The draft
gives effect to this decision.

providing that the Income-tax Officer is to determine' the
amount with reference to the extent to which the user was
for the purpose of the business.

with all cases of partial user in the context of deduc-

in the case of an asset acquired by the assessee by gift or'
inheritance, its written down value shall be the Written
down value in the case of the previous owner or the market
value (whichever is less). The provision thus appears as'
a part of the deﬁnition of "written down value"; but it
would be more appropriate to place it as a part the
deﬁnition of actual cost. What is intended is the ﬁ tiom
of a notional ﬁgure of actual cost and not a notional rgure

of written down value as such. The written down value
of an asset is an amount that is constantly diminishing, and"
cannot be frozen at the ﬁgure of written down value of
the previous owner, as the existing section purports to do.
The real object is to invent an "actual cost" (because a.
person acquiring property by gift and not paying anything
for it does not, actually, incur any cost).

has been omitted as obsolete.

<p id="p_5112">But it has been made clear that the transaction must

<p id="p_5117">Sub-clause (ti)--The existing provision reads "any dis--

The words "deed of" have been omitted, so as to include-

the wording was "registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_2153">Indian Companies

subsidiary company should be an "Indian company". The
wording has been changed acdordingly. (It may be noted,
that the existing wording wogild, if "construed strictly, ex»
clude companies registered under a pie-1956 law, and this"
narrows down the scope. On the other hand, it would slight-

actual cost to the assessee of the capital asset" (with
certain inclusions and exclusions) being deducted from the
consideration. But there are cases where "actual costs" is
replaced by written down value, e.g., see existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2155">section

the amounts to be added to the actual cost (as representing
improvements) vary in various cases, according to the date
of acquisition of the asset etc. In order to cover all these
cases, it seems desirable to use some convenient expression
to denote the deductible cost. The expression "statutory
cost" has been used for the purpose. The manner of arriv-
ing at the statutory cost is dealt with separately for' the
sake of simplicity.

<p id="p_5123">As to the amounts spent on improvements (additions
and alterations), they have not been mentioned in the draft
in the present clause, but have been dealt with elaborately
in the draft clauses to follow,' explaining in detail what is
"statutory cost" in various situations. The reason is, that
the date after which the improvements should have been
made will vary in various situations. To take an example,
where the fair market value of the asset on 1st January,
1954, is substituted under existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2159">section 12B(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2160">3rd</a> pro-
viso, it is only improvements made after 1st January, 1954

culty in understanding it, because it combines two things
in one, namely, (1) where the capital asset became the
property of the assessee before 1st January, 1954, and (2)
where it became the property of the previous owner be-
fore the 1st January, 1954. The draft separates these two

situations and deals with them separately for the sake of

The draft expresses the meaning of the clause in the

INCOMES OF OTHER PERSONS, INCLUDED' IN

Notes to clause 63.
</p>
<p id="p_5202">Existing <a href="/doc/1509588/" id="a_2202">section 16(1)(c)</a> deals with two kinds of trans-
fers: '(1) transfer of income only, without transfer of the
corpus, and (2) revocable transfer of the corpus. In order to
prevent the two kinds of transfers being mixed up, it is

' considered desirable to separate the two into two sec-
</p>
<p id="p_5203">tions.
</p>
<p id="p_5204">The draft clause under discussion deals with the ﬁrst
kind of transfer. The existin section uses the words "set-
tlement or disposition" and en goes on to deﬁne these
words as including, besides other things,' "disposition" (see
second proviso). For the sake of brevity, only the word
"transfer" has been used in the draft throughout the group
of clauses incorporating section l6(1)(c). The word 'trans-
fer' has been deﬁned separately.
</p>
<p id="p_5205">The existing section contains the words "from assets re-
maining the property of the settlor or disponer".. These
words do not easily convey the exact meaning. The obvi-
ous intention is to refer to a case where there is no trans-
fer of the property from which the income arises. This is
made clear in the draft.
</p>
<p id="p_5206">Provisos 1 and 3 to the existinglsection l6(l)(c) are
framed in wide language so as to convey the impression
that they are applicable to transfers of mere income also.
But since transfers of mere income Gthat is, transfers co-
vered by the draft clause under discussion) fall within the
section "whether revocable or not", it seems incongruous
to give any deﬁnition of "revocable" in respect of such
transfers. It could not have been the intention that if the
transfer'of income is itself irrevocable, then the section will

not apply. The ﬁrst and third provisos should therefore' 

be conﬁnedlto transfers of cor us, being revocable. The cor-
responding draft clauses' ac ordingly narrow down the
scope. -

The existing provision, i.e., <a href="/doc/1509588/" id="a_2203">section 16(1)(c)</a>, third provi-
so, applies only to "settlement or disposition". It does not
mention "transfer", but obviously all transfers of corpus
are also covered by the proviso, since the main para. of
<a href="/doc/1509588/" id="a_2204">section 16(1)(c)</a>, latter part, speaks of "revocable transfer
of assets", and the proviso is intended to save certain trans-
</p>
<p id="p_5212">fers which, though revocable, are not revocable for a

certain period. Hence the draft mentions transfers.
</p>
<p id="p_5213">Sub-clause (1)--The existing provision speaks of a set-
tlement etc. which is not revocable during the life-time of
the "person". This "person" is obviously the transferee (see
the opening line of the existing <a href="/doc/1509588/" id="a_2205">section 16(1)(c)</a> which be-
gins with "all income arising to any person"). This has
been made clear in the draft in para. (a). In the case-of a
transfer by way of trust, the transferee, that is, the person
to whom the income arises, is in theory, the trustee, but in

substance the beneﬁciary. This has also been speciﬁcally '

provided for in the draft.

in the second proviso, has beenreplaced by a deﬁnitio' of
transfer. The deﬁnition of "settler or disponer" co ain-
ed in the existing second proviso, does not seem to be
necessary. The intention behind the deﬁnition, probably,
was to clarify that in the case of a settlement by two or
more persons, each of the settlors is regarded as asettlor.
It is unnecessary to have such a provision by way of
specific deﬁnition.

The signiﬁcance of <a href="/doc/1509588/" id="a_2209">section 16(3)</a> lies in the principle
that the income of one person (wife, child etc.) is regarded

directly in the draft by commencing each item with words

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_324">372</span>
<p id="p_5253">Sub-clause (1) states the rule relating to set elf in
the same year (from one head to another). The existing
expression "loss of proﬁts or gains" is slightly inappro-
priate, as it speaks of "loss-" of "proﬁts". It has, therefore,
been replaced by the words "net result is a loss... .... .."
The words "subject to the other provisions of this Chap-
ter" have been added in order to make it clear that there
are special provisions regarding ﬁrms, capital gains, specu-
lation losses etc. Whichappear in the subsequent clauses.
</p>
<p id="p_5254">Set off is allowed, not with reference to the previous
year, but with reference to the assessment year. Previous
years may be different according to the source of income,
but the Income-tax Oﬂicen is concerned only with the as-
sessment year for which the loss is to be computed. This
is the position for carry forward also. Suitable verbal chan-
ges have been made on this point in the draft clauses
concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_5255">Under the existing law a loss arising under any head
is to be set off against income under the head "Capital
gains". Now it is well understood that the taxation under
the head "Capital gains" is at a lower rate than the taxa-
tion under other heads, by the operation of existing <a href="/doc/938899/" id="a_2220">section
17(6)</a>. The result is, that an assessee is forced to set off
a loss against capital gains. He thereby obtainsa "reduc-
tion of his taxable income which does not fetch the g same
beneﬁt as it would have fetched if the set off had beeh con-
ﬁned to other heads. For example, if a loss of Rs; 2,000
under the head "Income from property" is set off against
capital gains, then, assuming that the tax on capital gains
works out at 10 N.P per rupee, the reduction in tax §WhiCh
the assessee would obtain by such set-off would be R33. 200.
While, if the assessee is to set off the loss only against in-
come other than-capital gains, then, assuming that the rate
of tax,under other heads is 25 N.P per rupee, the educ-
tion in tax which the assessee "would -obtain by su_h set
off would be Rs. 500. It would seem that there is  rea-
son for driving the assessee to *a course which cau$s pe-
cuniary loss to him. It may be noted that in the converse
case when a loss is sustained under capital gains, the'asses-
see is not allowed to set off the loss against any othe head,
vide existing <a href="/doc/47944/" id="a_2221">section 24(2A)</a>. The position regarding et off
against income under the head capital gains has th%§efore
been altered on the lines indicated above. The nec sary

cussion, and the draft clause corresponding to existi sec-
tion 24(2A) has been made comprehensive so as to es body
the law relating to set off otfa loss under other.' head

with a few drafting changes explained below.
</p>
<p id="p_5273">The existing provision refers to the loss of a registered
ﬁrm "which has been apportioned". These words are mis-
leading; in the case of a registered ﬁrm apportionment is
compulsory and universal. and no question of conﬁning the
provision to a loss which "has been" apportioned can arise.
The language has, therefore, been slightly altered, and the
words in question omitted.
</p>
<p id="p_5274">As a matter of fact, it is not necessary to have any pro-
vision at all to the effect that a registered ﬁrm cannot
carry forward its losses. The reason is, that when the loss
of A is apportioned between B and C, it no longer subsists
as the loss of A, and the question of its carry forward by
A should not arise. The proviso is, however, useﬁul by
way of clariﬁcation, particularly in View of the péculiar
nature of the provisions for assessment of ﬁrms and part-
ners in the Act, and has, therefore been retained.

its losses shall "also be carried forward and set oﬁ??under

accurate way of stating the position. A registered ﬁrm is
never allowed to carry forward its loss [see existi sec-
tion 24, sub-section (2), proviso (c), earlier half], and there-
fore, to say that the loss may be "carried forward as if
it were a registered ﬁrm" is meaningless. The language

<p id="p_5281">This,c1ause deals with unregistered ﬁrms, while registered
ﬁrms have been already dealt with'. '

Sub-\clause (1)--The existing provision, for unregistered
ﬁrms, says that the loss of the ﬁrm shall be set off only
against that income of the ﬁrm and not againt the income
of any of the partners. When analysed, this gives the fol-
lowing propositions :--
</p>
<p id="p_5282">(1) The loss of the ﬁrm shall be set off only against the
income of the ﬁrm. This proposition has been se-
parately dealt with in the draft, though it follows
from the principal provision in the draft" i.e., any
assessee is entitled to have loss under one head set
off against the income under any other head. That
provision applies to unregistered ﬁrms, just as it
applies to the other assessees.
</p>
<p id="p_5283">(2) The loss shall not be set off against the income of
"any of the partners".
</p>
<p id="p_5284">What is really meant is that where an assessee is a
partner in an unregistered ﬁrm and his share is a loss, the
loss cannot be set off against his other income. Draft sub-
clause 2(a) embodies this proposition.
</p>
<p id="p_5285">Sub-clause (2)--As to para. (a), see notes above. As to
para. (b), minor changes have been .made. '

Strictly speaking, this provision is also unnecessary.
The main provision in <a href="/doc/625246/" id="a_2238">section 24(2)</a> applies to all assessees,
including unregistered ﬁrms. Therefore, any loss incurred
by the ﬁrm is to be carried forward in computing the
ﬁrm's income. ' The question of its carry forward in a
partner's income cannot arise. The provision is, however,
useful by way of clariﬁcation, as it emphasises the propo-
sition that a partner in an unregistered-ﬁrm cannot claim
a separate set off and that all that is allowed is the collec-
tive set off available to the ﬁrm as a whole.

that certain conditions should be fulﬁlled by an institution
or fund to which the section applies. Condition No. (iv)
contains the word "or" at the end and is followed by con-
dition No. (v). It is not clear whether the "last condition
No. (v) is an alternative to condition No. (iv) only, or' whe-
ther it is to take the place of all the conditions (i) to (iv).
Since condition No. (iii) contains the word "and" at the
end, it can be argued that conditions Nos. (i) to (iv) are to
be taken together and condition No. ,(v) is to be taken s'ep-
arately. But thisdoes not seem to have been the inten-
tion; the result of such construction would be to eliminate
a very important requirement, namely, the requirement in
condition No. (i) that the income should be exempt under
the category for "Charitable Institutions". The ﬁrst three

4 conditions should be fulﬁlled by all the institutions or

funds, While the fourth and ﬁfth conditions are alterna-
tives to each other. This intention has been brought out
in the draft by combining the contents of existing condi-
tion No. (v) with condition No. (iv). '

Condition No. (i) at present requires that the institu-
tion should be one "the incmne whereof is exempt iunder
clause (i) of sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_2264">section 4</a>". But in: cases
where an institution has no property, the applicati n of
this condition becomes difficult. The wording has, . here-
fore, been slightly altered. _ Further, institutionst ough
not strictly falling under section (4) (3) (i), such as iver-
sities or educational institutions not existing for jproﬁt,
should be regarded as standing on the same footin as
purely charitable institutions, and they have, thefefore,
been included in the draft (just as their income ha' been
exempted----See the draft clause inserted on the s 'ect'.
Institutions depending on voluntary contributions ; ave

Existing condition No. (iv), when mentioning univer-
sities, requires that they should be established by law, but
when speaking of other educational institutions recognis-

quirement that the university should be established by law.

that the resident receivesteither. no proﬁts or less than nor-
mal proﬁts. In such a case the Income-tax Officer ~ has
to determine the true proﬁts of the 1'?-sident attributable
to such camouﬂaged transactions. This is now brought out
clearly in the draft. ' '

The existing section says that the income of the non-
resident shall be chargeable "in the name of the resident
who shall be deemed to be..." .......... .. the assessee". These
words have been replaced in the draft by the words "and
include such amount in the total income of the resident".
This verbal change has been made for the sake of unifor-
mity, and for emphasising the true construction of the sec-
tion as explained above.

<p id="p_5372">Notes to clause 96.

<p id="p_5373">The existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2271">section 44D</a> "relating toitransfer of assets
to non-residents is considerably involved in its expression.
It is difficult to understand the section ias a whole and its
grammatical structure without some effort.' The section
has been slightly recast en thefllines of section

between the existing section and the draft clause are ex-

<p id="p_5374">(1) Sub-sections (1) and (2) of the existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2272">section 44D</a>

were the income of such persqn, woul be chargeable to
income-tax" becomes payable to a non-resident. This re-

these rights might ﬂow either from the transfer or from
its associated operations.
</p>
<p id="p_5377">(4) The words "m consequence of whic " occurring
for the second time in the existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2275">section 44D(1)</a> have
been omitted in the draft. These words related to "rights
.......... ..in consequence of which he _has.........power to
enjoy". It seems sufficient to have the words "by virtue
of" in this context. '

(5) Under the existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2276">section 44D(1)</a>, the income to
be taxed as the income of the resident is "that income",
that is, the income earlier referred to as arising from the
transfer to a non-resident, which the resident has power
to enjoy. Thus, two ingredients are required for taxing
the income at present: (i) the income must arise from the
transfer, and (ii) -it must be income which the resident has
power to enjoy. The draft clause, however, makes an im-'
portant departure here. All that is required in order to
tax an income is that (other conditions being satisﬁed),
it must be income which the resident has power to enjoy.
Under the draft it is not necessary that the taxable i ' me
should coincide with the income arising to a nonire (dent
from the transfer. Thus the power to enjoy must arise
from the transfer, but the words "power to enjoy ésuch
gtcome" have been replaced by "any income of a noti-resi-
</p>
<p id="p_5378">ent". '

(6) The existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2277">section 44D(2)</a> suffers from on) im-
portant ﬂaw, in that it does not state how the'sum re rred
to therein is to arise. The section says: "Where any rson
receives or is entitled to receive ....... ..any sum pa by
way of loan etc ....... ..such income shall ....... ..be deemed
to be the income" of the resident. One would hawe ex-
pected the section to say, like sub-section (1), "when any
person by means of any tra er .......... ..receives any" um"
etc. The draft sub-c1_ause (1 (b) makes it clear th t the
capital sum must be one "the payment whereof is ' any
way connected with the transfer '. . 1

This is merely a condition to be satisﬁed. ' What! is to
be charged to tax is a different matter, discussed  the
next item. E

(7) The existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2278">section 4g4D(2)</a> says that "such income
shall be deemed to be the income" of the resident: It is
with some effort that one is able to locate the income to
which this word "such" is a licable; it is the inconie be
coming payable to a non-resi eht under the transfer": This
has been expressed in a more intelligible form in the
draft.
</p>
<p id="p_5379">(8) The length of the existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2279">section 44D(2)</a> has been
reduced in the "draft, by replacing the words "any sum

Notes to clause, 97. A

_ Existing sections 'i4E and.44F have been combined in
this clause, and certain important changes of substance
have been made as follows:--- '

(1) Existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2280">section 44E(l)</a> applies where the owner
of the securities, having agreed to sell or transfer the
securities, "by the same or any collatoral agreement"
agrees to buy back etc., the securities. In" practice, however
it is difficult for the Department to prove that there was
an "agreement" to buy back the securities. Moreover, as
a matter of substance, it does not appear to be necessary
to insist on the requirement of "same or collateral agree-
ment". The object of the section is to ' revent avoidance of
tax, and the provision should exten to all cases where
the transaction of sale and re-purchase of securities results
in such avoidance. The sco of the section has, accord-
ingly, been extended in the raft [seelsub-clause (1)].
</p>
<p id="p_5383">(2) It has, however, been made clear in the draft that
the provision in the existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2281">section 4413</a> will not apply if
there was no avoidance or if the avoidance is not sys-
tematic; see draft sub-clause (4) which mentions sub-
section (1) speciﬁcally. .
</p>
<p id="p_5384">(3) Existing <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2282">section 44F</a>, operative part, deals with the

cases where a person transfers securities before the dec- '

laration of the dividend, thus' shifting the right to receive
the dividend to another person. The operative part of this
section has been incorporated- in draft sub-clause (3). An
important departure from the existing section has, how-'
ever, been made; the existin' section provides for appor-
tionment, vide sub-section (2 , latter "half read with sub-
section (3). Under it, only the inconmelattributable to the
period upto the transfer is deemed to The the income of the
transferor. Under the draft, however', the income for the
full year will be deemed to be the income of the trans-
feror, vide sub-clause (3), lat line. - Since the rovision
is intended to stop avoidance, it should ;go the ful way.
</p>
<p id="p_5385">ance is "more than 10 per t of t amount of income-
tax" for the year. This requkement as been omitted in
the draft, in order to make the provision against avoidance
more stringent.
</p>
<p id="p_5386">(4) While the operative "portion of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2283">section 44F</a> thus
ﬁnds a place in the draft, the machin¢"ry,provisions in sub-
sections (4), (5) and (6) of thatsection have been omit-

Even the Finance (No. 2) Act 1957, First Schedule,

senting his views when any question as to the place of as-

</p>
<p id="p_5553">Under draft sub-clause (3), the transferring authority is
given the power, in special cases, to dispense with an op-
portunity to the assessee before the order is passed. But it

which was inserted . to get the situation created by
a decision of the Supreme Court'= whereby a whole-sale
transfer of cases, without reference to the year of assess-
ment, was held to be illegal. After the Explanation was
inserted, the question of its validity came up before the
Supreme Court in a later case'. The Supreme Court up-
held the validity of the Explanation and explained its scope
by pointing out that when a case of any particular assessee

pending before one Income-tax Oﬂicer is transferred to.
</p>
<p id="p_5555">another Income-tax Ofﬁcer under <a href="/doc/949665/" id="a_2370">section 5(7A)</a>, th_en----

the date of transfer in respect of any year what-
ever are also included thereil.
</p>
<p id="p_5558">The result is that the transferee Income-tax Oﬁicer
would be in a position to continue pending proceedings
and also to institute fresh proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_5559">This aspect of the Explanation, namely, that 'it
amounts to a transfer of proceedings' for past assessment
years also and that its inclusive part applies to proceedings

<p id="p_5560">Incidentally, it will be noticed that the deﬁnition of

</p><p id="p_5566">No comments are needed.
</p><p id="p_5567">Notes to clause 134.
</p>
<p id="p_5568">This clause is new. Some doubt has been felt as to
the Income-tax authority which is entitled to prosecute
or defend an appeal in the High Court etc. whenever the
assessee's case is transferred from one authority to an-
other. For example, when one Commissioner ﬁles an appeal,
and the case of the assessee is transferred to the jurisdic-
tion of another Commissioner, the question arises whe-
ther the transferee Commissioner can continue the ap-
peal. Provision has, therefore been made to make it clear
that the authority for the time being seized of the case
would be the person competent to initiate or continue
such proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_5569">For the sake of simplicity the cases of Commissioner
and of the Income-tax Officer have been dealt with in
separate sub-clauses.
</p>
<p id="p_5570">The principle underlying the provision is not new.
Nor is it conﬁned to the particular provisions referred to
in the draft clauses; it should be applicable for all provi-
sions of the Act. But, since difficulties have been felt only
in regard to certain provisions, the draft clause is conﬁn-
ed to these provisions. The provisions of existing <a href="/doc/949665/" id="a_2375">section
5</a>, sub-section (7C) cover cases where a proceeding is
peéiding before an Income-tax authority who is transfer-
re .
</p>
<p id="p_5571">Notes to clause 135.
</p>
<p id="p_5572">General--This clause corresponds to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2376">section 64</a> of the
existing Act. The question whether the section confers a
right on the assessees has come up beforethe courts more
than once and has now been settled once for all by the Su-
</p>
<p id="p_5573">preme Court'. The discussion in the case just cited makes.
</p>
<p id="p_5574">it clear that it is too late in the day to say that there is no
right to be assessed by the Income-tax Ofﬁcer of a parti-
cular area. The earlier decision of the Supreme Court',
holding that the beneﬁt conferred on the assessee by sub-
sections (1) and (2) of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2377">section 64</a> is to be regarded as
a right, has been reinforced by the later decision' refer-
red to above.
</p>
<p id="p_5575">The marginal note of the section "place of assess-
ment" is, however, slightly misleading, because the section
does not deal with the place where the assessment is actu-
ally made but with the Income-tax Oﬂicer having uris-
diction. The marginal note, has. therefore. been _al ered
accordingly.

an entry adverse to his case' in a civil suit, the assessee of-

not "disclose" any document.) It is the Income-tax au---

PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSMENT
Notes to clause 143.
</p>
<p id="p_5632">General.--The provisions relating to procedure for
assessment have been arranged in this'Chapter in proper'
sequence. The proceedings for assessment begin with the
notice under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2405">section 22</a> calling for a return, which may be-
followed by the provisional assessment, enquiry by the
Income-tax Officer and the regular assessment. Reopening"
of the assessment at the instance' of the assessee, or reas-
sessment at the instance of the Income-tax Officer under'
existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2406">section 34</a>, are subsequent proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_5633">The sections relating to assessmentaliave been placed'
in this order in the Chapter. Amendment by way of recti-4
ﬁcation of mistakes is dealt with next, followed by the notice»
of demand under existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2407">section 29</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_5634">The procedure for assessment proper having been
dealt with in the earlier half of the C ter, the latter half
of the Chapter goes on to embed pro ions regarding in-
cidental matters, or matters wh, are inor importance
(e.g., miscellaneous information} and c p tes).

Sub-clause (1):-The following changes have been

"made to improve thelanguage of the section in precision
.and clarity :--
</p>
<p id="p_5636">An important departure has been made from the exist-
ing Act by providing for an automatic submission of re-
</p>
<p id="p_5637">'turn of income by all persons who are assessable under the

Act. Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2408">section 22(1)</a> requires the Income-tax Oﬂicer
to issue a general notice calling for the Submission of such
returns. This provision entails a lot of expense and labour
to the department, since a notice has to be issued in identi-
cal terms by each Income-tax Oﬁicer. Further, the provi-
</p>
<p id="p_5638">sion has no parallel in the taxation statutes of other coun-
tries which provide for the primary obligation of the tax-
</p>
<p id="p_5639">payer to send a return of income by the prescribed date.
Lastly, recent taxation statutes in India, for example, the
<a href="/doc/988436/" id="a_2409">Estate Duty Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_2410">Wealth Tax Act</a> and the Expenditure

"<a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_2411">Tax Act</a>, contemplate the submission of a return for the pur-
</p>
<p id="p_5640">poses of those Acts without notice by the Income-tax
Ofﬁcer_ It seems, therefore, desirable to make the pro-
</p>
<p id="p_5641">vision more rational on the lines of the other taxation'

statutes just now referred to.
</p>
<p id="p_5642">Apart from this important change, the following
«changes have also been made for precision and clarifty--
</p>
<p id="p_5643">(i) it has been made clear that the return of income
is to be submitted in the ﬁnancial year;
</p>
<p id="p_5644">(ii) at present it is doubtful whether a person is liable
to make a voluntary return of the income of any
other person in respect of which he is assessable.
There are several provisions in the Act, such as
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2412">sections 40</a>, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2413">41</a>, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2414">42</a> etc., which make one person
assessable in respect of the income of another.
This lacuna has been removed by the addition of
suitable words ;
</p>
<p id="p_5645">(iii) the notice under existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2415">section 22(1)</a> usually
provides that the return should be furnished be-
fore the expiry of 65 days from the date oftpubli-
cation of the notice. This leaves the date indeﬁnite
until the date of publication of the notice? is as-
certained. It has'been provided, therefore, in the
draft, that the return should be furnished on or
before the 30th day' of June;
</p>
<p id="p_5646">(iv) a proviso has been added to the effect that a person
who has already submitted a return in response
to an individual notice under sub-section (2) need
not furnish a return under sub-section ( 1) ;
</p>
<p id="p_5647">(v) the existing requirement that the return should
be a return of "total income" and "total eworld
income" etc., has been replaced by the . imple

words "subject to the provisions of sub-section (2)" and

it applies to all notices under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2452">section 34(1)</a>.

</p>
<p id="p_5741">Very often, assessment ﬁroceedings are stayed by an

<p id="p_5742">Explanations 2 and 3.--Proceedings by way of appeal,
revision etc. sometimes result in an order under which the
inclusion of a particular item of income in the total income
of a particular previous year is disallowed. As a result. it
becomes necessary to count that income as a part of the
total income of another previous year. Such recomputation
should be regarded as consequential on the proceedings by
way of appeal etc., and the time-limit under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2471">section 34(3)</a>

of B. This process also should not be regarded as subject
to the period of limitation prescribed' by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2472">section 34(3)</a>, since
it is consequential on the order passed in the appealetc.
All that is necessary. is a safeguard» to the effect that the

<p id="p_5761">The provisions contained in existing sub-sections (6),
(7) and (10) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2477">section 35</a> have--_been omitted, for the reason
that no scope for the application of any 'of these provisions
would remain in respect of assessments made under the
new Act. The new Act will apply only to assessment years
subsequent to its enforcement. Thus, any recomputation of
total income consequential on assessment or modiﬁed assess-
ment of excess proﬁts tax or business proﬁts tax under sec-.
tion 35(6) will be conﬁned to cases arising under the old
Act, that is to say, for assessment years prior to the enforce-
ment of the new Act. The reason.is,; that neither excess
proﬁts tax nor business proﬁt; tax is in force now, and it
is only for past assessment years that these taxes have any
relevancy. Similarly, the recomputation {Of the total income
of the share-holders consequential on the modiﬁcation of the
assessment of the company under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2478">section 23A</a>, will neces-
sarily be in respect of assessment years prior to the new
Act. The reason is, that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2479">section 23A</a> (as it stands in the pre-
sent Act as amended up--to-date and) as embodied in the
draft) does not have any relevancy on the assessment of
the total income of the share-holders. Any action under sec-
tion 35(7) will be conﬁned to past as _ ent years. On the
same reasoning, any action unlder sect -on 35(10) will neces-
sarily be related to the assessment years prior to the new
Act, since the recomputationjof tax (by reduction of the
rebate) under that sub-section: is applicable only in respect
of the assessment years 1948-49 to 1954-55. These sub-sec-
tions have, therefore, been omitted.

<p id="p_5763">sections referred to in the sub-section. This has been made
clear in the draft, by separating the situations into para-

<p id="p_5765">(iii) as already explained in the notes under the clause'
corresponding to existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2485">section 35(1)</a>, action under sec-

ther, the extension of the provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2486">section 35(1)</a> to the
special cases dealt with in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2487">section 35(5)</a> and subsequent
sub-sections is purely artiﬁcial, and it would be better if
the word "rectification" is not used in respect of these

<p id="p_5769">of uniformity, the expressions used in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2488">section 35(8)</a> have,
in the draft, been used in all the sub-clause/s.

<p id="p_5770">Sub-clause (2).----This is new. The existing section is
silent on the question whether an order similar to that
under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2489">section 35(5)</a> can be passed in the case of a member
of an association where the assessment of the association
itself is revised. It seems desirable to add such a provision,
and this sub-clause is intended to achieve that object. Since
the provision is new, a proviso has been added t-o save the
rule contained in existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2490">section 14(2)(b)</a> which enacts
that tax is not payable by an assessee on any amount on-
which the tax has already been paid by the association.
</p>
<p id="p_5771">Sub-clause (3).--The only change that requires explana-
tion is the omission of clause (b) of existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2491">section 35(8)</a>.
This clause is meant for a -casewhere a company is assessed
under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2492">section 23A</a> and in consequence it becomes necessary
to compute or recompute the: total income of the share-
holder. As already explained. above, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2493">section 23A</a> (as it
stands in the present Act as amended up-to-date and as
embodied in the draft) has no relevancy now on the income
of the shareholders. Clause (b) of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2494">section 35(8)</a> has, there-
fore, been omitted. Other changes are consequential.
</p>
<p id="p_5772">Sub-clause (4).----Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2495">section 35(9)</a> provides: that
where a company does not ay the tax on its proﬁts "within
three years after the ﬁnancial year in which the dividend
was declared", the Income-tax Oﬂicer may proceed to re-
compute the amount of tax deemed to have been paidby
the shareholders. This presupposes that the assessment of
the company has taken place and the company has failed
to pay the tax. There may, however, be cases where the

the assessment of the company itself is delayed. In such
cases, it would not be proper to insist that the company
should pay the tax within three years from the year in
which "the dividend was declared". It would seem desira-
ble to allow, in such cases, a period of at least one year
from the end of the ﬁnancial year in which the assessment
of the company is made. Necessary alteration has been made
in the draft sub-clause on this point. Other changes are
'verbal and consequential.

when an assessee claims deduction for a bad debt in res-

law, the assessee cannot obtain any deduction for such
earlier years. The draft sub-clause is intended to remove
"this hardship by conferring the necessary power on the

This reproduces existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2498">section 29</a>. The words "or

</p>
<p id="p_5806">General.--The assessments under existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2509">sections 40</a>,
A41 and 42(1) are really "representative assessments" as
.they are styled under the South African Income-tax Act.
This will be clear from the following analysis :--
</p>
<p id="p_5807">(i) <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2510">Section 40(1)</a> relates to persons under disability.
The persons under disability enumerated in the section
are, "minors, lunatics and idiots". In these cases, the
guardian etc., of the minor, or the manager or committee
of the lunatic or the idiot would have no ownership «in the
property or income. The income really belongs to the per»
sons under disability, and all that the sections provides
is a machinery for enforcing the liability of the incapa--
citated person. The tax is recoverable from the guardian etc.
in the like manner and to the like amount as it w c Id be
leviable upon the person under disability if of full a e and
in direct receipt of the income. This is a case where Income
received by the guardian etc., on behalf of the incapacitat-
.cd person is taxed in the hands of guardian etc., and can
therefore be treated as a representative assessment.
</p>
<p id="p_5808">(ii) <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2511">Section 40</a> (2), dealing with trustees or agents of
non-residents, also limits the liability of the trustee or
':agent by the words "in the like manner and to the same
amount" as the liability of the beneﬁciary if in direct
receipt of the income. Here again, the income which a
trustee etc. received on behalf of the beneﬁciary is taxed in
the hands of a trustee etc. It is therefore a representative
assessment.
</p>
<p id="p_5809">(iii) Secion 41 relates to income received on behalf of
:a beneﬁciary by the Court of wards, Administrator-General,
the Official Trustee, trustee appointed under a deed of
trust etc. The section makes these persons liable: to be
assessed in respect of income received by them "on ?behalf
of" the beneﬁciary and "in the like manner and ?to the
same amount" as the beneficiary. (There are two provisos
"which are not relevant for the purposes of the present dis-
</p><p id="p_5810">-cussion). The assessment is thus a representative one.
</p>
<p id="p_5811">(iv) <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2512">Section 42</a> relates to the agent of a non-resident

and empowers the department to treat the agent as the'

.assessee in respect of tax leviable on certain income,of the
non-resident deemed to arise in India. The income does not
"belong to the agent, but, for facilitating the collection of
tax he is made liable and "is (deemed to be the assessee
;for all the purposes" 'of the Act.' He is thus a representative
.assessee. - '


l



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_367">423</span>

It would, therefore, contribute to clarity if all these:
provisions are simpliﬁed and treated in a uniform manner"
The substance of these provisions is the same, namely, that.
the tax is leviable and recoverable from A even though nor-
mally it would be recoverable and leviable from B. The
treatment of all these provisions in one section will also-
avoid the unnecessary repetition of the words "the tax
shall be leviable and recoverable" or words like " ....... 
shall be deemed to be the assessee" etc.

The scheme adopted, therefore, is to collect these pro---
visions at one place (in so far as the rules applicable are
common to all the cases), under the head "Representative
assessees".

<p id="p_5812">General Scheme of sections relating to representative

"Representative assessee" may also be perused as to the

general scheme of these sections. I

Sub-clause (1).---rA unif "rtn provision has bee made
</p><p id="p_5829">-as to the nature and extent the liability of the rep sente-
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_369">425</span>
<p id="p_5830">tive assessee. The existing sections on the subject, 1'..e. sec-
</p>
<p id="p_5831">tions 40(1), 41(1) and 42(1), ex ress themselves in different '

ways; for example, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2535">section 40</a> =1), after providing that the
guardian etc. is to pay the tax (vide the words "the tax
shall be levied .......... ..") goes on to say that "all the pro-
visions of this Act shall apply accordingly". <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2536">Section 40(2)</a>
also employs the same language. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2537">Section 41(1)</a> is also
on the same lines. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2538">Section 42(1)</a>, main para, last line, pro-
vides that the agent "shall be deemed to be for all the
purposes of this Act, the assessee" in respect of the tax
payable by the non-resident.
</p>
<p id="p_5832">It is desirable that this diversity of language be replac-
ed by the same formula for all these cases, since such
diversity unnecessarily causes confusion and gives rise to
doubts as to whether any difference in substance is intended
or not. Draft sub-clauses (1) and (2), therefore, make it clear
that the representative assessee is subject to the same
duties, liabilities etc. as if the income were his own income.
It further provides that he is liable to assessment in his
own name. The category under which he is to be assessed
and the computation of _tax, however, are to be governed
by the priniciples that would have been applicable to the
beneﬁciary himself, and this has been made clear in the
draft.
</p>
<p id="p_5833">The words "representative capacity? will, incidentally,

remove one lacuna existing in the present Act. When _a . 7

trustee is charged in respect of income of the trust in his
hand, the question might arise whether his individual in-
come derived from his personal properties can be included
in the same assessment. In other words, the question is,
whether the assessment of a trustee quit-trustee is to be kept
completely separate from his assessmerft in his private capa-
city. On principle the two should be kept separate as the
capacities are different, but there is 110 provision in the
present Act giving clear guidance on this point. The words
"representative capacity only", as usodi in the draft sub-
clause under discussion, will make the position clear. ,

Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2539">section 41(1)</a> etc. are limited to "tax". The
position regarding penalty or any other sum due under the

Act should not, however be different, and the provision as _

drafted will cover penalties and other sums also.
</p>
<p id="p_5834">Sub-clause (2).--The provision ﬁh t a representative
is liable only to the extent of the asset grith him at present
appears only in the case of in legal' _presentative liable
under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2540">section 24B(1)</a>. There iséhowev no reason why this
protection should not extend to representative assessees,
such as guardians, trustees, agents, etc. It is therefore put
in a general form in this sub-clause. (There are, of course,
special remedies available against certain representative
assessees, which have been saved in the draft clauses on
the subject that follow in this Chapter.)_

Sub-clause (3).--Persons 1' ble as representative asses-
</p>
<p id="p_5835">sees, especially as trustee, gua 'an or ager etc. (i.e.' the
assessees governed by exist' secti 140 and 41) are, at



\ 426

present, liable to be charged directly under <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2541">section 3</a>._also.
In any case, the absence of a speciﬁc provision lends sup-
port to the opinion expressed by some commentators that
the Act leaves an option with the Department to assess
the trustee etc. either under <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2542">section 3</a> or under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2543">section 40</a>
or 41. Since assessment under <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2544">section 3</a> might be more
onerous than under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2545">section 40</a>' or 41, it seems desirable to
make it clear that it is obligatory on the Department to
apply the provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2546">sections 4Q</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2547">41</a> in cases where
they are applicable, leaving the general liability under sec-
tion 3 to be applied only in cases which are outside <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2548">sections
40</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2549">41</a>. The draft sub-clause under discussion is intend-
ed to achieve this object.
</p>
<p id="p_5836">Notes to clause 171

Sub-'clause (1).----This is new. The principle of the sub-
clause however is not controversial and is therefore embodi-
ed in the draft on the lines of section 71(1) of the South
African Income-tax Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5837">Sub-clause (2) and (3).----Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2550">section 42</a>, second and
third provisos, lay down a procedure whereunder the agent
of a non-resident can approach the Income-tax Oﬂicer for
the issue of a certiﬁcate stating the amount to be retained by
the agent for discharging his estimated liability in respect
of tax on the income of the non-resident. This provision can
be usefully extended to all cases of representative assess-
ment, and has therefore been embodied in the draft sub-
clause under discussion.
</p>
<p id="p_5838">Notes to clause 172

This is new and is based on section 72 of the South
African Income-tax Act. In a sense, it is a corollary of
the provision in the main clause' relating to the liability
of a representative assessee, to the effect that he is liable
only to the extent of the estate and in a representative
capacity only. If the representative assessee parts with the
assets without making proper payment of tax, it is but fair
that he should personally become liable.
</p>
<p id="p_5839">(The South African Act, of course, includes even a
case where the representative -assessee alienates, char es or
disposes of the income in respect of which the tax is. c arge-
able; in South Africa the tax is payable on the income of
the current year itself. Since, however, the scheme of the
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_2551">Indian Act</a> is different, this partof the South African sec-
tion has not been incorporated in the draft clause under
discussion.) ' ;

<p id="p_5843">Paragraph (d) embodies <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2553">section 40(2)</a> in a brief form-
It seems unnecessary to treat the case of a trustee of a
non-resident separately from' the agent of a non-resident
or to devote a separate section to it. In subst ce, the lia-

should be the same as that of the agent. -
</p>
<p id="p_5844">Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2554">section 43</a>, main para, contains the words
"upon whom the Incometax Officer has caused notice of his

vision for giving opportunity to the agent is already con-
tained in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2555">section 43</a>, second proviso, (vide draft sub-clause

subsequent to the commencement of the new Act.

viso to the draft sub-clause. An attempt has been made to
make the language less involved, by Toning the proviso
with a reference to the "broker", instea of beginning with
the word "transactions" as the existing proviso does.
</p>
<p id="p_5847">Sub-clause (2).--Existing section 43, 2nd Proviso, has

The ﬁrst proviso to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2560">section 41(1)</a> has been split up into
paragraphs, for the sake of clarity. The position in respect
of income-tax has been stated separately from the position
regarding super-tax, since .the provision that the tax shall
be levied at the maximum rate does not: apply to super-tax,
see existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2561">section 58(1)</a>. '

[The latter part of the Proviso, of course, must be
taken as applying to superbtax also, and this has been
made clear in the draft, vide sub-clause (b).] '

The latter part of the Proviso _is, obviously, an excep-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_371">428</span>

also does not apply. The draft makes this clear by treat-
ing the latter part as an item--item (i) in the draft--falling
under the earlier part, i.e. undér sub-clause (a) of the draft.
</p>
<p id="p_5850">One impgrtant change has been made in the substance
of the existing provision. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2562">Section 41(1)</a>, lst Proviso, (dealing
with the case where the income is not speciﬁcally receiva-
ble for one person or where the shares are unknown) pro-
vides that income-tax shall be chargeable-
</p>
<p id="p_5851">(i) where the beneﬁciaries have no other personal
income, and none of them is an artiﬁcial judicial
person, then at the rate applicable to an associa-
tion;
</p>
<p id="p_5852">(ii) in other cases, at the maximum rate. This provi-
sion leads to an anomaly. Where a beneﬁciary
has even 1 Rupee of other income, the income
becomes chargeable at the maximum rate. More-
over, the provision is not simple in its Working.
The draft, therefore, proposes a provision where-
under the tax will always be at the rate appli-
cable to an association, except in cases where
the income is received by a beneﬁciary and the
Income--tax Olﬁcer desires to charge income-tax
at the rate individually applicable to him'.

in this clause, which does not need, any comments.
</p>
<p id="p_5854">Notes to clause 176

This is new and has been introduced on the lines of
section 75 of the South ,African Income--tax Act, in order
to make it clear that the fact that a person is holding cer-
tain property as a representative assessee (and not as the
beneﬁcial owner) does not affect the remedies available to
the department against the property;
</p>
<p id="p_5855">Notes to clause 177

Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2565">section 41(2)</a> provides, in effect, that though
a Court of Wards, Oﬂicial trustee, trustee appointed under
a deed etc. is assessable as representing the beneﬁciary. the
direct assessment of the beneﬁciary is not barred. There is
no reason why this principle should not be applied to all
representative assessees, and 'the rule has, therefore. been
embodied in this clause, which will be applicable to all cases
of representative assessment.

Notes to clause 178

This is new and is intended to state the position re-
garding tax in respect of the estate .of a deceased person
in the hands of the executor. The clause, of course will be
conﬁned in its application to income derived after death.
Income in respect of the period up to death will be governed
by existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2566">section 24B</a>, which has already been incorporat-
ed in the draft clause in this Chapter relating to legal re-
presentatives.
</p>
<p id="p_5857">The clause has been drafted on the lines of the relevant
provision of the Ceylon Income-tax Ordinance.'

Notes to clause 179

This is consequential on the new clause introduced in
the draft laying down the liability of the executor, and
will authorise the executor to recover the tax from the
persons to whom the estate is to be distributed.
</p>
<p id="p_5858">Notes to clause 180

General.--Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2567">section 26(2)</a>, which deals with the
case of succession to business, profession or vocation, raises
a number of difficulties, and the language of the section has
not escaped criticism". Some difficulty is created by the
words "where a person carrying on a business .......... ..has
been succeeded in such capacity". The exact signiﬁcance of
the words "in such capacity" is not clear. The observations
of the Privy Council' indicate that what is in-
tended is, that the business _etc. should continue to be
carried on by the successor. A person who becomes merely
a successor (in the sense that he gets the legal ownership
of the business etc. but does not actively continue the busi-
ness etc.) would not be governed by this section, since in
his case there would not be any income after the date of
succession. The wording of the section, therefore requires
some change to make this intention clear.
</p>
<p id="p_5859">For the sake of simplicity, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2568">section 26(2)</a> has been split
up in three sub-sections in the draft.
</p>
<p id="p_5860">Sub-clause (1).--Apart from the changes explained
above. the following drafting changes have been made :---
</p>
<p id="p_5861">(1) The existing words "person succeeded" and "person .

<p id="p_5862">succeeding" cause a slight confusion, since it is not clear
whether the predecessor is .intended or the successor is
intended, and some effort has to be made to remember the
person intended to be covered. The expressions "predeces-
sor" and "successor" have, therefore, been used in the
draft in place of these words. i

(2) In ordergto explain the effect of this section more
clearly, clauses (a) and (b) have been added in the draft
to provide that the income upto succession is assessable. on
the predecessor and the income after successi.on is assess-
able on the successor. Incidentally, the use of the words
"income of the previous year up to succession" will also
make it clear that the previous year talked of is the pre-
vious year in which the succession took place.
</p>
<p id="p_5864">Sub-clause (2).--The words "year in which succession
took place" have, in the draft, been prefaced by the word
"previous". For the sake of clarity, the latter half of sec-
tion 26(2), Proviso, has been dealt with in a separate sub-
clause, see draft sub-clause (3).
</p>
<p id="p_5865">Sub-clause (3).--In existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2570">section 26(2)</a>, Proviso, latter
half. which provides that the tax in respect of the "assess-
ment .......... ..assessed on the person succeeded", shall. be
payable by the successor, the wording does not sound well ;
the recurrence of "assessment" and "assess" can be avoid-
ed. The language has, therefore, been altered' in order to
make the intention clear, though this has resulted in a
slight elaboration.
</p>
<p id="p_5866">Sub-clause (4).--Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2571">section 25A</a>. sub-section (2),
deals in part with the case of succession, though that sec-
tion mainly deals with the partition of a Hindu family. The
portion dealing with succession has been incorporated in
this sub-clause, for reasons already explained in the notes
to the draft clause' dealing with partition of Hindu families.
</p>
<p id="p_5867">The words "where any person has succeeded to a busi-
ness .......... ..formerly carried on by a Hindu undivided
family whose joint family property has been partitioned
on or after the last date on which it carries on such busi-
ness .......... .." in existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2572">section 25A(2)</a>, do not give out
the intended meaning easily. What is intended is, that there
is ﬁrst a succession to the business of a family, and simul-
taneously with the succession or subsequent thereto there
is partition of the family property. This has been stated in
more direct language in the draft sub-clause under discus-
sion. It has also been made clear that it is the income upto
the date of succession which is to be assessed in the manner
provided in the section relatin to partition. Income sub-
sequent to succession will be t en care of by existing sec-
tion 26(2), and this has also been made clear by the words
"but without prejudice to the provisions of this section" at
the end of the draft sub-clause.
</p>
<p id="p_5868">Notes to Clause' 181

General.--Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2573">section 25A</a> is really intended to lay

.down the proposition, that until there has been a complete

be treated as joint and assessed as a Hindu undivided -fami-
1y. The way in which the section begins, however, clouds
the main proposition, because the section begins with pro-
cedural matters and relegates the main proposition to the
last sub-section. The various sub-sections have, therefore.
been re-arranged in order to emphasise the main proposi-
tion contained in the section.
</p>
<p id="p_5869">Sub-clause (1).--It has been held by the Privy Council'
that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2574">section 25A</a> applies only where there is a total parti-
tion. This is certainly the position under the existing sec-
tion. But it would be desirable to apply the procedure con-
tained in the section to partial partition also. The draft,
therefore, makes this alteration in the section, with con-
sequential changes. '

Sub-clause (2).--The proviso to <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2575">section 25A(1)</a> has been
combined with the main para.
</p>
<p id="p_5870">Sub-clause (3).---Provision has been made that the In-
come-tax Oﬁicer, while passing an order under this section,
should record a ﬁnding as to the date of the partition. This,
besides avoiding many complications, will facilitate the
assessment for the periods before and after partition.
</p>
<p id="p_5871">Sub-clause (4).--Some confusion is caused by the
language of existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2576">section 25A(2)</a>, Which, while opening
with a reference to a case of partition, goes off at a tangent
to deal with the case of succession. For the sake of clarity,
these two cases should be dealt with separately, even though
the substantive rule to be applied may be the same. Draft
sub-clause (4) conﬁnes itself to partition. Succession is dealt
with in the separate clause' corresponding to existing sec-
tion 26(2).
</p>
<p id="p_5872">The existing provision in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2577">section 25A(2)</a>, main para, to
the effect that the Income-tax Ofﬁcer shall make assess-
ments on the members or group of members accordingly
'_'in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2578">section 23</a>"' creates an
impression that a special assessment for the purposes of
this section has to be made, on the member etc. This is,
however, not the intention. The section is merely intended
to lay down the liability of the members for pre-partition
income, and does not require that the assessment made in
pursuance of his liability should be made separately from
the individual assessment of each member. This part of
the sub-section has, therefore, been omitted.
</p>
<p id="p_5873">There is some amount of confusion, in existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2579">section

sub-section says that each memberis liable for a "share of
the tax on the income so assessed" according to the por-
tion of the joint family pr erty allotted to him, the pro-
viso says that the liability s all be _"g'qint and several". The

<p id="p_5875">position is not quite clear. The 'intention, however, seems
to be this, that a member is jointly and severally liable, and
that for the purpose of computing his "several" liability the
property received by him is to be taken into account. To
make this clear, the language of the proviso has been modi-
ﬁed and the position has been stated in a diﬁerent form in
the draft. For clarify, cases of partition during previous
year have been dealt with separately from the cases of
subsequent partition.
</p>
<p id="p_5876">In order to make the section comprehensive, partial par-
tition has also been dealt with, as pointed out above in the
notes under sub-clause (1). The Words ''total income receiv-

income received by the family in the assessment of the
family even after the partial partition.

of business was situated before the partition; in other cases
the place of residence of the last manager will govern the
decision of the question.

<p id="p_5901">Notes to clause 184

<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2597">Section 24A_</a> has been embodied in this clause. For the
sake of simplicity, the provision has been split up into a
number of sub-sections. ~

Sub-clause (1).----The provision for assessment in the
current ﬁnancial year, embodied in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2598">section 24A</a> and other
similar sections, really constitutes an exception to the gene-
ral principle embodied in <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2599">section 3</a> that it is the income
of the previous year that is taxable.
</p>
<p id="p_5902">The chargeability of the income in the current assess-
ment year is made clear by speciﬁc words in this sub-clause,
and it is also made clear that to this extent the section over-
rides <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2600">section 3</a>. (As a matter of fact the draft clause for<a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2601"> s.
3</a> is itself subject to the other provisions of the Act»). (See
also notes to sub-clause (2) below).
</p>
<p id="p_5903">It may be added that the language of this section has
also been criticised by the Income-tax Investigation Com-
mission'. The alterations made in the draft, though they
do not follow the lines suggested by the Commission, re-
move the ambiguities and lacunae to which the attention of
the Commission was directed.
</p>
<p id="p_5904">Since the section will apply only to natural persons,
the expression "person" has been replaced by the expression
"individual".
</p>
<p id="p_5905">Sub-clause (2).--The period, whose income is char_ge~
able is mentioned separately in this sub-clause. The existing
provision says that the total income to be assessed is "'of
the period from the expiry of the last previous year of
which the income has been assessed in his hands to the
probable date of his departure from the taxable territories,
or where he has not been previously .assessed, on his total
income of the period up to the probable date of his depar-
ture from the taxable territories". Now, in so far as this
period covers a previous year which has been completed
before the commencement of the ﬁnancial year in which the
Income-tax Officer takes action under this section, the sec-
tion has no importance, because assessment for such earlier

Ev

</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_377">45</span>
<p id="p_5907">previous years can be made even umier the normal pro-
vision in <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2602">section 3</a>. It is only in respect of a previous year
which falls wholly or in part within the ﬁnancial year that
the section needs to be relied upon. In the draft, therefore,
the words just now quoted have been omitted.
</p>
<p id="p_5908">Of course, it is still necessary to cover cases where a
completed year of income forms part of the period from
the end of the last previous year to the date of departure.
For example, a person whose previous ear ends on the 31st
December may leave India, say, in ebruary, 1958. The
year of income commencing on the 1st January, 1957 has to
be covered, because the assessment year for that income
will be 1958-59, which has not yet started. In such cases
the complete year of income 1957 as well as the fraction
from 1st January, 1958 to February, 1958 may be governed
by this section. Hence, draft sub-clause (2) does not make
any other modiﬁcation as regards the taxable period.
</p>
<p id="p_5909">Under the existing section, the position regarding rate
</p><p id="p_5910">-of tax has been stated in a very elaborate manner. It says
that the assessment shall be made. "as regards each com-
pleted previous year" at the rate at which such income

would have been charged had it been fully assessed. Now, -
</p>
<p id="p_5911">as already explained, the incomes of years completed before
the commencement of the assesment year in which the In-
come-tax Olﬁcer takes action are governed by the normal
provision in <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2603">section 3</a>, and it does not make any difference
whether they are dealt with under <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2604">section 3</a> or under this
section. Under <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2605">section 3</a>, the rate applicable is the rate for
the relevant ﬁnancial year; such cases should, therefore, be
left to be governed by <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2606">section 3</a>, and hence the words just
now quoted are unnecessary and have been omitted in the

draft. The remaining "previous year", that is, the period'

from the end of the previous year for the assessment year
to the date of the departure will continue to be governed
by this section.
</p>
<p id="p_5912">As a matter of fact, the words just now quoted are
misleading from one point of view, because, if interpreted
strictly, they would mean that a person leaving India in
February, 1958 and having his previous year ending with
the 31st day of December, 1957 would he chargeable at the
rate applicable to the assessment year'1'958--59. Obviously,
this is not the intention, and the provision as embodied in
the draft will obviate any possibility of any such wrong
result being deduced from this section.
</p>
<p id="p_5913">Sub-clause (3).--The criticism of the existing section,
made above in the notes to sub-clause (2), applies in res-
pect of the provisions for estimating the total income also.
The power to estimate should not be conﬁned, as in the
existing section, to a fraction of aipreirious year; even a
completed previous year might fall within the period for
which the income has to be ."qstima, ". The sub-clause
has therefore been widened to-' -'ve a fder. power to the
Income-tax Officer in this respg = _q »_-. - '



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_378">436</span>

Sub-clause (_4).~--In view of the simpliﬁcation made in
sub-_section (1), it has become possible to simplify this sub-
section by removing the elaborate description of the period
for which return is to be called.
</p>
<p id="p_5914">The_ words "(along with such other particulars as may
be provided in_ the notice)" have been omitted in the draft,
since the pI'0VlSl0I1 that it is a notice under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2607">section 22</a> (2)
implies that other particulars are also to be furnished,
where required. The words "subject to the provisions of'
this section" have been added for precision, particularly
in view of draft sub-clause (3).
</p>
<p id="p_5915">Sub-clause (5).----It appears desirable to make it clear
that the special assessment made under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2608">section 24A</a> is in
addition to any regular assessment which may happen to
take place in the same assessment year. This has been
made clear by this sub-clause. Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2609">section 25(1)</a>, latter
portion, may be compared. ~

Sub--clause (6).--This is new. The special provision
limiting the period of hotice to seven days, embodied in
sub--clause (4), is applicable to the emergency assessment:
by virtue of the section itself. Where, however, the normal
assessment for any. past previous year has not, yet, been
made on the assessee who leaves India, it may sometimes.
be necessary to ﬁnish the assessment before the assessee
leaves India. In such cases the normal period of 30 days-
provided for in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2610">section 22</a> may be difficult to be complied"
with. The draft sub-clause, therefore, allows the Income-
tax Officer to reduce the period in such cases. This new
provision will ultimately be for, the beneﬁt of the assessee,.
since he cannot obtain a clearance certificate under exist-
ing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2611">section 46A</a> until his assessments have beenpﬁnalised.

<p id="p_5916">Sub-clause (7).--A time limit-of three months will be
allowed to the Income-tax Officer except where the delay
is occasioned by any conduct of the 'assessee.

income of the normal previous year is to be com-
bined with the income of the current assessment
year, when making the assessment. It has been
considered desirable to alter the wording on this
point to make the intention clear. The draft,
therefore, uses the words "the total income ....... ..

reference to the normal previous year in sub-

SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO FIRMS
Notes to clause 189

Provisions relating to ﬁrms have been brought together
in this Chapter under the following groups :--
</p>

</p><p id="p_5943">(2) Registration.
</p><p id="p_5944">(3) Other provisions.

<p id="p_5945">Sub-clause (1).--Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2627">section 23</a> (5) (a) provides
that the total income of each partner, "including therein
his share" etc., shall be assessed and the sum payable by
him on the basis of such assessment determined. Since the
scheme of assessment in the case of a registered ﬁrm is,
that the partner is himself assessed on his share, these
words have been replaced in the draft by the words "the-
share .......... ..shall be included in his total income" etc.,
which seem to be more appropriate.

in the rules, and the draft clause has therefore, been made
more elaborate. -
</p>
<p id="p_5956">Sub-clause (1).---.The existing words "constituted
under" an instrument of partnership are found in practice
to lead to unnecessary controversy based on sharp distinc-
tions'. They have, therefore, been replaced by the words
"evidenced by".
</p>
<p id="p_5957">The existing words "specifying the individual shares

times, so that applications for registration are re used if
the shares are not given in the partnership deed speciﬁcally
in so many words, or if the partnership deed is not self-
contained and has to be read with the deeds relating to
subsidiary ﬁrms in which the partners are interested. It
is felt that registration should not be refused in such cases
"merely on the ground of the existence of such ﬂaws in the
partnership deed. Necessary drafting changes have been
made to achieve this object.

Sub-clause (3).----The persons who should join in an
application for registration have been mentioned exhaus~
tively in this sub-clause, which_ incorporates the second
paragraph of rule 5 of the Income-tax Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_5962">Sub-clause (4).--~Under the existing provisions (rule 2
of the Income-tax Rules), the first app ication for regis-
tration has to be made within six months of the constitu-
tion of the firm or before the end of the previous year of
the ﬁrm, whichever is earlier, if the ﬁrm was constituted
in that previous year. Where a firm is already registered
under the <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_2636">Partnership Act</a> or the deed is registered under
the Indian Registration Act, the application has to be made

before the end of the previous year. It has been suggested .
</p>
<p id="p_5963">that the 30th day of June of the assessment year "should be
,.adopted as thelast date by which an application for ﬁrst
registration should be made. But the adoption of this

time-limit would enable the assessee to get registered an'

antedated partnership. It seems desirable that, irrespective
</p><p id="p_5964">-of the fact whether the deed is or is not registered under
one or other of the laws referred to above, the application
should in all cases be made before the expiry of the pre-
vious year. The reason is, that the assessee is claiming an
advantage under the Act in respect of proﬁts earned in
the previous year on the basis that during that year the
ﬁrm came into existence. If that is so, he must be able to
make good that plea by a proper application made before.
the end of the previous year. If any more time is given,
there will be ample scope for the assessee to make up his
mind whether to get the ﬁrm registered or not and for
that end to invent a partnership antedating the constitution
for the entire period and bringing into existence a docu-
ment evidencing such partnership.
</p>
<p id="p_5965">The draft sub-clause under discussion gives effect to
this proposal. A proviso has been added authorising the
Income-tax Oﬁicer to entertain an application made after
the end of the previous year in proper cases.
</p>
<p id="p_5966">Sub-clause (5).--~The provision contained at present
in the rules, requiring the application to be accompanied
by the instrument evidencing the partnership, has been
incorporated in this sub-clause, and it has also been made
clear that in ﬁt cases a certiﬁed copy of the instrument
may be accepted in lieu of the original.
</p>
<p id="p_5967">Sub-clause (6).--The provisions contained in existing
rule 3 of the Income-tax Rules and Form I below that

application for registration has to be made "at such times"
as may be prescribed. The use of the word "times" suggests
a necessity of renewal of registration every year, and

has -to be made for any sub uent yepq. This, requirement

seems to be rather too hard, particularly in cases where
there were no change in the constitution of the ﬁrm after
its first registration. So far as renewal is concerned it
should suffice' if a declaration is made by the ﬁrm (along
with the return of income for the assessment year con-
cerned) to the eﬁect that no change in the constitution of
the ﬁrm or the shares of its partners has taken place in
the previous year; where such a change has taken place,

elaborately laid down. The ground on which application
can be refused has been narrowed down so that if the exist-

General.~The scheme adopted in the draft is to deal
in separate clauses with deductions in respect of the" vari-
ous classes of income, such as salary, interest, dividends,
etc. The substantive provision for deduction has been
placed in the first few clauses, while incidental provisions
like certiﬁcate, etc., and consequences of deduction like
credit, payment of tax by the person deducting etc., :have
been placed after those clauses.

<p id="p_5999">Sub-clause (1).-The existing words "at a rate re-
presenting the average of the rates applicable" have 4been
replaced in the draft by the words "average rate of income-

change has been made for the sake of precision. Further,
the existing words "' plicable to the estimated total in-

second step is to find out how much of that total income
falls under the category of income subject to advance tax.
That having been done, the next step is to actually compute
the tax on the income subject to advance tax by applying

the average rate of tax. The result arrived at is the amount
of the advance tax.

<p id="p_6071">Sub-clause (1).--Existing section . 18A(5) relating to
interest payable by the Central Government on tax payable
'in advance has been embodied here. The sub-section, as
amended in 1953, raises a diﬂicult quation of interpreta-
tion. The main part of the sub-section provides that inte-
rest should be paid (at 4 per cent.) on any sum paid after
1st April, 1955, "from the date of payment to the date of
the provisional assessment" or? to the regular assessment
:as the case may be; but the secdnd proviso, inserted in 1953,
:says that for the period beginning with"? 1-51; April, 1952, the
interest is payable from the beginning of the next finan-
«cial year to the date of the r A ar ausdssment. There is
thus a change as regards the eriod ﬁr' which interest is
to be paid. ,Another change made in 1 _ is as regards the
uamou-nt on which interest is pa able. Ie the main para.
provides that interest is paya "on ah amount payable
in accordance with the provisipns of th section .......... ..
and paid accordingly", the second proviso, inserted in 1953.
provides that for the period inning with the 1st April,
1952, interest is payable only the amount by which the

aggregate of the instalments paid durin the ﬁnancial year '

in which they are payable exceeds the am urfder the regu-
lar assessment.
</p>
<p id="p_6072">Now the question is, whether, these. changes inserted
by the 1953 Act in the shape cf the second proviso are to
govern the whole of the post-1 52 periqd: or whether they
are to apply only in respect 0 4 the pant-41952 and pre-1955
period. If the second proviso is taken as overriding' the
main para, the former view is correct. If, on the other and,

"as if it were an arrear of land revenue". Since the law re--
lating to recovery of land revenue varies from State to

given in respect of the tax deemed to have bee paid
on dividends. Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2720">section 49B</a> also contains pro-

General.
</p>
<p id="p_6140">Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2724">section 48</a>, dealing with refunds. is confused
in its arrangement. The general right to claim refund,
dealt with in existiig sub-section (1), is mixed up with
provisions relating to special. situations in sub-section (3).
Further, the restriction regarding questions that can be



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_402">459</span>

raised in refund proceedings is unnecessarily put in the
same section in sub-section (4). An attempt has, therefore,
been made, in the draft, to separate these various topics.
</p>
<p id="p_6141">Clause 247--The following drafting changes have been
made in existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2725">section 48(1)</a> :--

family" etc. have been replaced by one word "person".
Existing <a href="/doc/308955/" id="a_2726">section 3</a>, as proposed in the draft, uses only the
word "person",' and it is felt that the right to claim re-
fund should be co--extensive with the liability to tax. In
the case of State Governments, it may be pointed out, there
is a rohibition against tax being charged from them, under
the onstitution. Even in respect of shares held by State
Government, refund of tax deemed to have been paid under
existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2727">section 49B</a> is allowed only if the dividend is in-
cluded in the total income of the person concerned; see

of the pending claims as on 1st April, 1953, approximately
60% were less than three months old, while only 13% were

ment that under administrative instructions it was obliga-

refund claims within three months. In view-of this, it is
obvious that normally the refund applications are disposed
of, (at any rate at present) within a period of three months.
The Department will not, therefore, be affected by a provi-
sion for payment of interest. The provision is intended
only to make sure that the representation made to the
Taxation Enquiry Commission by the Department would
invariably be followed with no exception. The liability to
pay interest will act, as an incentive for an early disposal

General

The power of revision by the Commissioner' at the

ing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2786">section 33A(2)</a>. Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2787">section 33A(1)</a> is also mainly
:meant for cases where revision proceedings are started for
passing orders not prejudicial to the assessee. There is
no harm if both these sections are combined in one sec~
tion. Some of the provisions contained in these two sec-
tions are common to the proceedings under the two sec-
tions. An attempt has, therefore, been made to combine
them in this clause. No change of substance will result
from such combination, since, wherever necessary a distinc-
tion has been drawn between a revision at the instance of
the assessee and a revision at the instance of the Commis-
:S10neI'.

General.
</p>
<p id="p_6252">The constitutionality of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2799">section 28(1)(c)</a> has been up-
held by a Division Bench of the High Court of Madras'. The
attack on the validity of this section in that case was based"
on the argument that under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2800">sections 28</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2801">51-52</a>, the
Inspecting Assistant Commissioner has a choice as to whe---
ther a penalty should be levied on the' assessee or whether
the assessee should be prosecuted under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2802">sections 51-52</a>, The
course to be pursued by the department is, it was argued,
left to the unfettered discretion of the Inspecting Assistant
Commissioner and the enactment gives no guidance and
prescribes no standard. This argument was rejected by the
High Court. which observed that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2803">section 28(4)</a> was in the
nature of a concession and there was noquestion of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2804">article
14</a> of the Constitution being attracted to invalidate it. Sec-
tions 51-52 had been enacted for vindicating public justice
and for the punishment of the offender for the deliberate
infraction of the law, while <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2805">section 28</a> is enacted for the
purpose of rendering evasion unproﬁtable and of securing
to the State compensation for damage caused by attempted
evasion. The two sections do not always overlap; but even
where there is overlapping in a concrete instance, the two
remedies could have been taken at the same time, but for
the provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2806">section 28(4)</a>. The two remedies are not
in their nature mutually exclusive, and the grant of a
concession to the assessee in the form of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2807">section 28(4)</a> does
not alter the situation.
</p>
<p id="p_6253">In view of this pronouncement. it is not considered
necessary to disturb the substance of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2808">section 28</a>, but sec-
tion 28(4) has been made into a separate section, in order
to bring out its true function. A

The words "in the course of any proceedings" also
came up for consideration in the case cited above. The'
High Court noted that the practice is, that when an In-«
come-tax Oﬂicer ﬁnds that an assessee has concealed his
income etc., he estimates the concealed income. adds it
to the income returned and levies tax on the entirety of
the income as thus determined in his assessment ordered. At
the same time he issues' notice to the assess' to show
cause why a penalty should not be levied un er <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2809">section

28(1)</a> and (2). But the assessee may not have been heard I

and no ﬁnal conclusion is reached at that stage. The assess-
ment is completed and a demand is made for the tax. and.

regards the assessments, are over. After obtaining the
assessment ﬁgures as ﬁnally deterrnind, the Income-tax
Ofﬁcer pursues the notice already issued, resumes the
penalty proceedings, hears the assessee and passes an order
in proper cases under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2810">section 28(1)</a> after obtaining an
approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner. "This
practice", the High Court observed, "appears to be
fair to the assessee and not contrary to the language of the
enactment"'. In the view of the High Court, "the proceed-
ings for the levy of a penalty must be initiated by an
authority when such authority was in seisin of the assess-
ment or other proceedings in the course of which it is
found that the assessee has brought himself within the mis-
chief of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2811">section 28</a>. When once the notice has been issued,
"the jurisdiction of that authority to continue the proceedings
is not dependent upon the continuance of other proceedings

initiated."

Notes to clause 28.0

General.--The provisions contained in the Chapters on

scheme adopted in the draft is to make a reference, in
other sections, to the provisions relating to such funds,
wherever convenient. Though this entailed some repetition,
it has been done for facilitating reference. E

Clause 289.--Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2829">section 58B</a> has been reproduced
here. The only change made is the addition of the proviso
in sub-clause (1). <a href="/doc/97777162/" id="a_2830">Section 9</a> of the Employee's <a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_2831">Provident
Funds Act</a>, 1952, deems a provident fund established under
a scheme in accordance with that Act to be a recognised
provident fund under this chapter. So far as the funds
established under such schemes are concerned, this deem-
ing provision is sufficient. But, certain provident funds
under that Act have been exempted by Government. under
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2832">section 17</a> of that Act, from the operation of the scheme.
Such provident funds would not be covered by the deeming
provision and it appears to be desirable to enable a relaxa-

to achieve this object. [Such provident Fundshave toffu1-

been embodied in this clause. The proviso has been express-
ed as an item of the main sub-section.
</p>
<p id="p_6293"><a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2845">Section 58G(2)</a> talks of exemption from the payment
of income--tax and says that the accumulated balance shall
be "excluded" from the computation of the employee's
total income. It is thus a case of total exclusion and has
been treated so in the draft. '

So far as super-tax is concerned, the exemption in sec-
tion 58G (2) was originally applicable to super-tax also,
but the words "and super-tax" were omitted by the Indian
Income-tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1933 (18 of 1933).
The reason for removing these Words from this sub-section
apparently was that the exemption for super-tax was dealt

<p id="p_6294">with separately in a separate sub--section----<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2847">section 58G</a> (1)

which was introduced by the same amendment Act. This '

"exemption" from payment of super-tax has, under the
scheme adopted in. the draft, to be treated as a case of
excluse from total income'. and, therefore, the draft
clause under discussion regards the exclusion as effective
both for income-tax and for super-tax. '

In other words, existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2848">section 58G</a> (2) has, in the
draft, been expressed as applicable both for income-tax and
for super-tax and existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2849">section 58G</a> (1) earlier part, has
not, therefore, been reproduced. in the draft'. It is, of
course, true that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2850">section 58G</a> (1), earlier half, (that is, ex-
emption for super-tax) does not require continuous service

while <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2851">section 58G</a> (2 (exemgtion for income-tax) d s re-'

quire such service. ut it oes not appear necess y to
make any such distinction. The draft, therefore, does not
make any such distinction. '

The draft clause requires ﬁve years' continuous service,
before exclusion can be claimed. This will now be applic-
able in both cases, but it does not put a fresh bur en on
the assessee; because, even now under section 5 G (3)
if the employee leaves before ﬁve years he has to pity not
only income-tax but also super-tax on the basis thiat the
exemption was not available. .

Sub-clause (2).--S1ight verbal changes have beeni inade
for precision. E

Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2853">section , 58G</a> (1). consists of two parts. The
earlier portion, exempting the accumulated balanc from
super-tax, has alreaw been accounted for in the t, as
the exemption has been treated as an exclusion fro total
income, common to income-fax and super-tax'.
</p>
<p id="p_6297">The latter part enacts the exception in respect of nual
accretions up to 1st "April 1 3. That has been repr duced
in the draft with two draft ng changes. First, the ords
"which is not included in his total income" have been added
by way of introduction. Secondly, instead of the e ' ting
negative form "except .......... ..", a positive form of angu-
age has been used to emphasise the 'liability to p y the
amount referred to inthe provision. , .

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_418">475</span>
<p id="p_6300">The provision in question was enacted only to make
an adjustment necessitated by the course of legislation
(see note below), and hence the aspect of payment receives
a higher emphasis compared with the aspect of liability.
</p>
<p id="p_6301">The Provident Funds Chapter was introduced in 1929.
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2854">Section 58E</a> provided for the inclusion of the annual ac-
cretion in the total income. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2855">Section 58F</a> exempted the
annual accretion from income-tax, subject to certain con-
ditions. Though the intention of the legislature was, thus,
to assess the annual accretion to super-tax, by the omission
of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2856">section 58F</a> from the sections not applicable to super-tax
mentioned in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2857">section 58</a>, the provisions of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2858">section 58F</a> be-
came applicable to super-tax. The annual accretion, there-
fore, remained exempt from super-tax also up to 1933.
</p>
<p id="p_6302">The legislature noticed this defect in 1933 and rectiﬁed
it by including <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2859">section 58F</a> in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2860">section 58</a>. Simultaneously
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2861">section 58G</a> (1) was introduced and 58G (2) was made not
applicable to super-tax. The resulting position is that though
the accumulated balance is exempt from payment of super-
tax, the employee receiving the accumulated balance has
to make good the super-tax that he would have paid bet-
ween 1929 and 1933. '

Notes to clause 298

Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2862">section 58H</a> has been embodied here. The sec-
tion provides that at the time of payment of the accumulat-
ed balance. the trustees shall deduct therefrom any income--
tax payable under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2863">section 58G</a> (3). So far as this require---
ment is concerned. the words "in cases where section ....... ..
[58G (3)] applies," have been added in the draft, to make
it clear that deduction is permissible only where the liabi-
lity for payment of tax has arisen.
</p>
<p id="p_6303">The existing section further provides for the deduc-
tion of any income-tax and super-tax payable on an em--
ployee's total income as determined under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2864">section 58J</a> (3).
This requirement does not appear to be intelligible. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2865">Section
58J</a> (3) does not really apply at the time of payment of
accumulated balance to the employee and is conﬁned to
the taxation, at the time of recognition, of sums transferred
to the employee's account in the recognised provident

fund. This requirement has, therefore, been omitted in the
draft.

Existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2876">section 58R</a>, relating to exemption in respect
of superannuation funds, combines a number of provisions.
These provisions embody exemptions falling under various
categories. For example, the opening lines direct that in-
come derived from investments of such funds shall be "ex-
empt from payment of income-tax"; while the subsequent
lines provide that "any sum paid by an employer by way
of contribution shall .......... ..be deducted in computing the
income .......... ..". It is obvious that the ﬁrst exemption is
in the nature of an exclusion from total income, while the
second is a deduction for expenses. In order to bring out

tributions are "repaid", to an employee, the amounts so
repaid shall be deemed, for the purpose of income-tax, the
income of the employee for that year. The words "repaid"
would, at ﬁrst sight, seem to suggest that it is only the em-
ployee's contributions that are intended to be covered by
these words. But it seems that the employer's contribu-
tions should also be covered, because there does not appear
to be any reason for excluding employer's contributions;
the word "repaid" was probably used in a wider sense.

MISCELLANEOUS
Notes to clause 319

_ This is new. It seems desirable to make it clear that
income once charged to tax shouldnot again be charged
to tax in the hands of the same person. This safeguard
seems to be necessary, in view of the fact that an item of
income may be chargeable either on the basis of its ac-
crual or on the basis of its having arisen or on the basis
of its actual receipt, within a particular period. In other
words, the chargeable periods may vary according to the
basis on which the tax is sought to be assessed. '

Notes to clause 320

It has been made clear that even in the case of a local
authority or company, service may be made on its princi-
pal officer. The deﬁnition of "principal oﬁicer" is applicable
to local authorities and companies also.

<p id="p_6361">Notes to clause 321

Sub--clause (1).'--This is new. Since the family will
not be in existence after partition, a provision for service
of notices in respect of proceedings pertaining to the
disrupted family appears to be necessary and has been in-
corporated in this sub--clause. The Supreme Court has held'
that in such cases the notice need not be iven to all mem-
bers. This view has been followed in the draft, treating,
however, a notice under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2902">section 34</a> in a different manner'.

<p id="p_6362">This draft sub--clause will apply only where an order re-

can be served in the usual manner, and, no special provi-
sion is necessary to the effect that the notice in such cases

the members so separated must of course be served. But

Notes to clause 323

This is new. It is desirable that documents placed on
the ﬁle of an Income-tax authority should bear proper en-
dorsement so that their tracing and identiﬁcation may be
facilitated whenever a reference to them becomes neces-
sary. It is also desirable that where an Income-tax autho-
rity bases any order on any document. the document shall
expressly be referred to in the order, so that there may
be no difficulty in understanding the basis of the order.
The draft clause is intended to achieve this object.

Note on Repeal and transitional provisions

(At ﬁrst, draft clauses on repeal and transitional pro-
vision were prepared in the Commission, but later it was
felt that it need not be done in the Commission and might
be left to the Ministry of Law.) .
</p>
<p id="p_6391">When the new Act comes into force, the existing Act.
i.e., 1922 Act will, of course, cease to apply. While d ' fting
the repeal clause, it would be desirable to consider hicl1_
of the following courses should be adopted.-
</p>
<p id="p_6392">(1) Absolute repeal of the existing Act----This my not
be feasible, since it .would necessitate innu rable
saving provisions and' may cause inconve ience
also. '

(2) Formal repeal of the existing Act with a pr ision
that so far as the assessments etc. for asse ment
years prior to the commencement of the ne Act
are concerned, the existing Act will contin e to-
apply. This seems to'be .the method adop ed in
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2916">section 13</a> of the Finance Act, 1950 (25 of 19 ) and
section 6 of the Taxation Laws (Extens on to

while repealing the old laws, preserve the ol laws
for the purpose of "ldvy, assessment and coll ction"
of income-tax, etc. for past years. '

Section 527 of the U.K. Act. 1952 follows the same
method; sub-section (1), main para, repeals the piievious
laws as listed in the twenty-ﬁfth Schedule, but the proviso
enacts that the provisions of the new Act "shall not-apply
to income-tax for the year 1951-52 or any previous year of
assessment and the provisions of the enactments me tioned'
in the twenty-ﬁfth S hedule "shall continue to apply r tax

Section 2 of the Australian Income-tax and Social Ser-

ing the enactment concerned (vide the main paragraph),
provides (vide first proviso) that the Act repealed by this
section, shall continue in force for all purposes in connec---
tion with income-tax payable for any ﬁnancial year prior
to ,.the ﬁnancial year commencing on the_1st January, 1936.

the Indian Acts i.e.. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2918">Finance Act</a>, 1950 and the _Act relating"
to Jammu and Kashmir, save the old law for levy, assess--

(3) Another alternative would be, not to "repeal" the

(A clause framed on these lines would not of course, attract
the provisions relating to repeal in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_2919">General Clauses Act</a>
and they will have to be speciﬁcally incorporated in the-

<p id="p_6396">A precedent for this will be found in section 130 of

Transitional provisions

A number of orders, notiﬁcations etc. issued under the
existing Act, will have to be continued for the purposes of
the new Act, until the appropriate action is taken under the
new Act. The actual form of the clause on the subject
would, of course, depend on how the repeal clause is'fram-
ed. If the usual repeal clause is adopted, <a href="/doc/1921918/" id="a_2928">section 24</a> of the
General Clauses Act would have the effect of continuing
appointments, notiﬁcations, orders, schemes, rules, forms.
'bye-laws etc. But still a number of other things which do
not fall under <a href="/doc/1921918/" id="a_2929">section 24</a> of the General Clauses Act would
have to be dealt with. If straight-away repeal is not effect-
ed, the continuation clause will, of course, have to men-
tion orders, notiﬁcations and, rules etc. also. -
</p>
<p id="p_6402">It may be necessary to make some provisions as to
how far the Act is retrospective. Section 129(6) of the
Canadian Income-tax Act, may be compared.
</p>
<p id="p_6403">. Provision for ensuring that income taxed under the
existing Act is not taxed again under the new Act might
also be necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_6404">Since the Tribunal is proposed to be abolished, it may
be necessary to make elaborate provisions in respect of
'proceedings pending under the existing Act before the
Tribunal. These proceedings may include not only appeals,
but also applications for making a reference under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2930">section
66</a> of the existing Act. It will also be necessary to provide
how references pending in the High Court under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2931">section 66</a>
or applications pending in the High Court under Section
</p><p id="p_6405">-66(2) or <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2932">section 66(3)</a> should be dealt with, and also as to
the authority which should carry out the decisions passed
by the High Court on these references. Where an applica-
tion under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2933">section 66(1)</a> has been rejected before the com-
mencement of the new Act, it would also be necessary to
'provide that the assessee or the Commissioner maylapply
'to the High Court as regards the merits or as regards the
issue of limitation. Provision will also have to be! made
as regards decisions given by the Commissioner or _A.A.C.
(before the new Act) in respect of which an appeal: could
have been ﬁled to the Tribunal if it had not been abcﬁished.
</p>
<p id="p_6406">The usual clause relating to power to remove d_ilﬁcul--
ties in achieving thetransition or giving effect to the pro-
visions of the Act will also have to be embodied.

<p id="p_6407">Notes to First Schedule

Rule 1

The existing Schedule uses the expression "yea1"" and
'deﬁnes it in rule 5(1). In the draft, however, the expres-
sion "previous year" has been used. The deﬁnition of
"previous year" as-adopted in the draft' deals speciﬁcally
with insurance business, so that the expression "pr eding
year" need not be used in the substantive provisi ns.

</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_429">487</span>
<p id="p_6409">Instead of the expression "income proﬁts and gains",
the shorter expression "profits and gains" has been used, on
the lines of the existing <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2934">section 10</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_6410">Rule 2

Slight changes have been made to simplify the lan-
guage. For example, the existing Schedule, rule 2 proviso,
clauses (a), (b) and (c), repeat the word "plus". This has
been replaced by the words "aggregate of the following".
</p>
<p id="p_6411">Rule 3
The following drafting changes have been made:----
</p>
<p id="p_6412">1. The ﬁrst proviso to the existing Schedule, rule 3(a),
has been omitted, as it was applicable only to the "first such
computation" made under the rule.
</p>
<p id="p_6413">2. The second proviso to the existing Schedule, rule
3(a) says that if any amount reserved for policy holders is
not paid to or expended on behalf of the policy holders,
then the proportion previously allowed as a deduction is
to be treated as a part of the surplus. The proportion has
been described as "one--half or four-ﬁfths as the case may
be". The reference to "one-half" in the Act is not intelli-
gible on first reading, because the deduction allowed is four-
ﬁfths under the main para of existing Schedule, rule 3(a).
The text of the rule. as it stood before the amendment made
by Act 25 of 1953, contained the words "one~half" and the
intention apparently was to cover also cases where a deduc-
tion was allowed before the amendment of 1953.
</p>
<p id="p_6414">Ordinarily speaking, by the time the new Act comes in
force cases of deductions under the existing Act as it stood
before 1953 will have been exhausted. However, as a.
matter of caution, the reference to."one-half" has been
retained in the draft.
</p>
<p id="p_6415">The words "under this Act or under the Indian Income-
tax Act, 1922" have, however. been added in the draft, in-
order to deal with cases where a deduction under the exist-
ing Act is to be adjusted in the surplus under the new Act.
</p>
<p id="p_6416">3. Existingrule 3, clause (b), uses the Words "securi-
ties or other assets". But the appropriate word seems to
be "investments"; that is the word used in the existing
Schedule, rule 6, last sentence. The draft, thenefore, uses
the word "investments".
</p>
<p id="p_6417">4. Existing Schedule, rule 3, clause (c), has been incor-
porated in the draft sub-clause (c), with minor drafting

<p id="p_6433">'NOTE BY DR. N. C. SEN GUPTA

I am in agreement with the lines of approach to the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2938">Income Tax Act</a> adopted by the Report. I appreciate and
agree generally with regard to the important provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_6434">There is one thin however which I must repeat once
again. I think it W0 d have been an advantage if the con-
sideration of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2939">Income Tax Act</a> had been adjourned until
the Tyagi Committee' had formulated their conclusions. I
have been informed that the Chairman thought otherwise.
Because he expressed the opinion that the Tyagi Com-
mittee has nothing to do with these proposals. I shall clear
up the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_6435">Income~tax is now only one of a number of personal
taxes which, as things stand, have to be assessed by the
Income Tax Officer. he result is that there is nothing to
show that it wili be the same Income Tax Officer who will
assess a person----(l) for income and super tax, (2) for ex-
penditure tax, (3) for wealth tax and (4) for Estate duty.
But assessment proceedings must necessarily involve an
examination of the accounts of the assessee for each of these
purposes. The same account will have .to be gone through
in the Tax Oﬁice, not once for all, but separately and not
necessarily by the same Income Tax Ofﬁcer. It would be
not only convenient but almost necessary if the whole
thing could be taken together in the case of a person who
has to pay all these separate taxes or more than ne of
them. Each assessment proceeding will be separatel , start-
ed according to the procedure laid down in the separate
Acts and necessarily the same accounts will have"to hie exa~
mined in each case. Now the Tyagi Committee can evolve
a measure by which the integrated taxes could be assessed
in the same office for each person and by a simpler proce-
dure. It would be an undoubted advantage. But it'is not
possible now to suggest in connection with the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2940">Income Tax
Act</a> how this can be done or  the separate proced res of
these several Acts can be integrated or amalgamat . It
would seem, therefore, that my suggestion to consider the
procedure of the assessment" of income tax after the Par-
liament has ﬁnally decided on the integration or otherwise
of the proceedings on the report of the Tyagi Committee
would be advantageous. Without that it may very well be
that all our labours upon the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2941">Income Tax Act</a> would be lost.
</p>
<p id="p_6436">With regard to the content of the Report, I will refer
to one or two matters only. The Report takes into account
all the shortcomings of the present procedure and the con-
fusing mode in which it has been laid down in the Act, and
it seeks to safeguard the interest of the tax_-payers ade-
quately. I am in full sympathy with the C!'it1clSl'I1S_.'\_'Vhl9h
have been made and the lines of approach. As it Is,
the long-drawn proceedings of mcome tax assessment and
the present features ,-of tax' _ all round, amount to _ great
pressure on and hardship small assessees._ But at the
same time it leaves gopen , E-gaps for escaping payment



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_431">491</span>

of the tax by suﬁiciently resourceful and rich parties. It
is true that the assessee has got to be safeguarded against
oppression and at the same time, it should be seen that
the tax is not evaded by rich parties. For this purpose, I
am afraid, the procedure in the present <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2942">Income Tax Act</a>
is not adequate. The draft report attempts to make several
efforts to remedy this defect. But I do not quite agree
with its treatment to the question of evasion. The amend-
ment suggested in <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_2943">section 34</a> seems to me to be generous
to the assessee. But we have got to see whether it does
not become too generous to a wily evader at the cost of the
honest tax-payers who have to bear additional burden. I
agree that there ought to be a limit to the period for which
the proceedings for taxation could be re--opened. Whatever
limits are ﬁxed, there ought to be a general principle laid
down that if escape from assessment or under--assessrnent
has been shown to be due to any- dishonest or fraudulent
practice of the assessee. there ought to be no limitation to
re-open the proceedings. On the other hand. the limitation
in ordinary cases ought not to exceed what is now prescrib-
ed under the Act.

<p id="p_6437">With regard to the procedure of assessment and appeals,
I agree with the proposals made. But I am not sure that
the members of the Committee have given adequate con-
sideration of the principles in French Law. Under that
Law, in the case of assessment and realisation of provincial

taxes, the matter is primarily Within the jurisdiction of -ad-,

ministrative officials. But it is provided that if any ques-
tion of title is raised before the matter receives the sanc-
tion of the Ministry of the Interior, the Administrative
Ofﬁcer~in-Charge of the proceedings has to refer it imme-
</p>
<p id="p_6438">diately to a Civil Court after which the proceedings take '

the form of a Civil suit. Something similar to this is to be
found in a <a href="/doc/792189/" id="a_2944">Bengal Act</a>. the Estate Partition Act. Under
that Act appeals to the Civil Court are strictly limited. But
if a question of title is raised in any stage of the pro-
ceedings, the Collector carrying on the proceedings has got
to stay the proceedings and refer the parties to the Civil
Court. I think some procedure like this might be con-
veniently provided for in the case of income tax assessment.
There are some questions which would ultimately go from
Civil Court upto the High Court even under the present
Act. If such questions are raised at an early stage of assess-
ment, the law may provide that the matter must be referred
to the Civil Court and assessment proceedings stayed.
Otherwise the assessment proceedings would be regarded
as purely -administrative--though under the strict control
of the superior Administrative Ofﬁcers, represented in
France in the Council d' estate.

<p id="p_6439">With further reference to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2945">Income Tax Act</a> in the
proposals before the Tyagi Committee. I wish to add a
few words with reference to myplea for; the simpliﬁed and
integrated procedure in the asse$ment of all personal taxes.
It will be remembered that thei new peydonal taxes have

been im ed on the basis of the report of Professor -
dor in w ' I ﬁnd that he gives» some indication ahou _ the
procedure. The principles behind 'the new taxation,' ac-
cording to Kaldor Report, are independent of each 0 her.
The taxes are intended to ch :and balance each oth ,--
so that there may be in integnated taxation. It is no the
same thing as was asked for by older economists undo the
name of a single tax. For that purpose also it is nec

that in assessing one tax. ref¢r_ence will be made t the
other taxes, so that ultimately there is no conflict o in-
consistency between efferent assessment. 1'

As to the mode of assessngent Professor Kaldor r tens
to the Swedish procedure. In Appendix A hegiv the
suggested form of a comprehensive return ,for nail
taxation in which the entries gate made with referen e to
this and also other ta which have not been impo yet.
In Appendix B, Part wo. he, gives the form of a r urn

under the Swedish Law which is based on the same rin-r

ciples. The whole return goes to the same oﬂioer
parently garries out investigations in respect of them,»-iwith
a view to a consolidated assessment. Unless something. like
this is done in India also. the objective of Professor Kal-
dorls' suggestion about multiple. personal taxes would be
defeated. Therefore, I suggested that the whole law oi pro-
cedure for the assessment and realisation of taxes uld
be recast on the linemsuggested in Ka1dor's report an for
that purpose I should suggest that the Committee-inow
appointed should go to the question of laying dotvn a
procedure by which simplici and coordination m be

properly achieved. The quest on of the amendment the _

procedure of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2946">Income Tax Act</a> must necessarily ait;
and the procedure not only for income tax but for a the
personal taxes together should be laid down in one act-
ment. *

I do not accept the pruiciples of Professor Kaldor's--
report in their entirety. But 's' we are not concemednvith
the amendment of the tax structure, at least this call be:
accepted thalt the procedgire laid down sgoluldi be 3 as
to avoid mu tip ication o p1'I#=¢ed1n' gs an ea to a e
§ust assessment of taies than: under the separate ti tionf

There is another matter hich I should like to m ' tion
with reference to Professor 'iﬂldofs report. I-Iis crlt '
of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2947">Income Tax Act</a> for assessm t of
Companies are trenchant but entirely justified; and ' sug-
gestions for the simpliﬁcationi of the procedure wi ' the
framework of the present tax structure are wort of
serious consideration. I regret to ﬁnd, however, th our
Draft Report does not make aux, reference to that an pro-
ceeds as if the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2948">Income Tax Act</a> g as the sole Act with hich
we are concerned. I [him]: it was our duty to point 0 t the
