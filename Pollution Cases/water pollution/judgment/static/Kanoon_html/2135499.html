Ajit Prakash Shah, Chief Justice (Oral) :-


        The question that falls for consideration in this appeal is whether the first

respondent (original writ petitioner) is a "person aggrieved" to maintain an appeal before

the National Environment Appellate Authority (hereinafter referred to as the „Authority‟)

under <a href="/doc/31965171/" id="a_1">Section 11</a> of the National Environment Authority Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred

to as „the Act‟).

2.      The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are as follows:

        The first respondent claims to be a social and environmental activist involved in

issues concerning tribals and environment and also is the President of the Orissa Unit of

the Lok Shakti Abhiyan, an organization dedicated to social and environmental causes.

It is claimed that together with his group, he has been closely following the

environmental issues in Brundamal and Bhurkamunda, District Jharsuguda, Orissa and is

LPA 277/2009                                                               Page 1 of 17
 working among the affected communities.

3.     The second respondent, i.e. the Orissa State Pollution Control Board announced a

public hearing on 20th October, 2005 for a proposed aluminum smelter plant under the

provisions of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 1994. The first

respondent objected to the public hearing on the ground that this is not a separate project

but the third stage of a Bauxite Mining Project. The public hearing was cancelled and

re-scheduled for a later date on 09.12.2005.          The first respondent made another

representation challenging the faulty EIA of the project on 9.12.2005, inter alia stating

the following:

                 "The Public Hearing for this Aluminum Smelter, an integral part
                 of Vedanta‟s bauxite miming, alumina refinery and aluminum
                 smelting project which is currently sub judice is legally wrong.
                 State Pollution Control Board is going ahead with the Public
                 Hearing without taking into account the recommendations of the
                 Central Empowerment Committee to the Supreme Court of India
                 which show that Vedanta has violated forest and conservation
                 laws.

                 It may be recalled that the CEC in its recommendation to the Apex
                 Court had asked for the withdrawal of the environmental
                 clearance to the alumina refinery plant located in Lanjigarh and
                 strictly recommended not to give the Niyamgiri Hills for bauxite
                 mining to the company. The three phases of an aluminum plant
                 involves necessarily the first step of having captive bauxite mining
                 which would provide raw material for the second step that is the
                 alumina refinery that in turn will be supplied to aluminum
                 smelter in the third step. The following situation prevails with
                 regard to the above three steps, which are essentially part of the
                 same project.

                          1. Bauxite mine: License for mining not granted. The CEC
                 says "It is of considered view that the use of the forest land in an
                 ecologically sensitive area like Niyamgiri Hills should not be
                 permitted (para 32, page 52)" and again the CEC says "The
                 project may only be considered after an alternative bauxite mine
                 site is identified (para 33, page 53)"

                         2. Aluminum refinery: The observation of the CEC is
                 significant on the alumina plant when it says "The casual
                 approach, lackadaisical manner and the haste with which the
                 entire issues of the forests and environmental clearance for the
                 alumina refinery project has been dealt with smacks of undue
                 favour/leniency and does not inspire confidence with regard to the
                 willingness and resolve of both the state government and the
                 MoEF to deal with such matters keeping in view the ultimate goal
                 of national and public interest. In the instant case had a proper
                 study been conducted before embarking on a project of this nature
                 and magnitude involving massive investment, the objections to this
                 project from environmental/ ecological/ forest angle would have
LPA 277/2009                                                                Page 2 of 17
                become known in the beginning itself and in all probability the
               project would have been abandoned at this site" (para 32, page
               52). The CEC further states that "keeping in view all the facts and
               circumstances brought out in the preceding paragraphs it is
               recommended that this honourable court may consider revoking
               the environmental clearance dated 22.9.2004 granted by the
               MoEF for setting up of Alumina refinery plant by M/s Vedanta
               and directing them to stop work on the project (para 33, page
               53)"

               In the EIA of this project it has been mentioned in page 27, point
               2.3.1 that the proposed aluminum smelter plant will receive
               alumina from the alumina refinery at Lanjigarh, Kalahandi
               district of Orissa which is about 240 kms away from the smelter
               plant. So public hearing of for an aluminum smelter whose raw
               material is planned to be drawn from sub judice Lanjigarh refinery
               is completely contingent on the orders of the Honourable Supreme
               Court on the Lanjigarh Alumina Refinery. By holding a public
               hearing on the aluminum smelter, the Orissa State Pollution
               Control Board is exceeding its brief and disrespecting the
               Honourable Supreme Court. Therefore, you are requested to kindly
               consider this public hearing on 9th December, 2005 null and
               void."


4.     It is also the case of the first respondent that the appellant illegally started

construction work for its proposed aluminum smelter plant at Brindamal, Jharsuguda,

Orissa without obtaining the mandatory environmental clearance and, therefore, he again

objected before the second respondent by his letter dated 5.6.2006; the receipt of the said

communication is not denied by the second respondent. By its letter dated 8.2.2007, the

second respondent directed the appellant to stop all construction activities till the

appellant obtains environmental clearance from the MoEF.

5.     The environmental clearance for the project was granted on 7.3.2007 and

aggrieved by this, the first respondent filed an appeal before the Authority on 5.4.2007.

The Authority, by an order dated 29.1.2008, dismissed his appeal stating that first

respondent is not a "person aggrieved" under <a href="/doc/31965171/" id="a_2">Section 11</a> of the Act. The relevant

paragraphs of the impugned order are extracted hereunder:

               "6. The point for decision at this stage is whether he appellant is
               eligible to file the appeal in this case. The appellant has submitted
               that he has filed this appeal in his personal capacity as President
               of Lok Shakti Abhiyan, Orissa Unit. Let us see how the appellant
               qualifies to file this Appeal.

               7. Section 11(1) of the NEAA Act, 1997 clearly prescribes two
               conditions for eliginilty of any person to file an appeal:-


LPA 277/2009                                                               Page 3 of 17
                (a) He should be a person aggrieved by the environmental
               clearance order.
               (b) He should file appeal with stipulated time.

               7.1 The term person, as defined under Section 11(2) of the NEAA
               Act, 1997, is shown below-

               (a) any person who is likely to be affected by the grant of
               Environmental Clearances;
               (b) any person who owns or has control over the project with
               respect to which an application has been submitted for
               environmental clearances;
               (c) any association of persons (whether incorporated or not) likely
               to be affected by such order and functioning in the field of
               environment ;
               (d) the Central Government, where the environmental clearance is
               granted by the State Government and the State Government where
               the environmental clearance has been granted by the Central
               Government; or
               (e) any local authority, any part of whose local limits is within the
               neighbourhood of the area wherein the project is proposed to be
               located.

               7.2 In light of the above, the Appellant is not an aggrieved person
               under the clause (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 11(2) of the NEAA
               Act, 1997 narrowing down the scope to clause (a) of this Section.
               The Appellant has however sought to take advantage of clause (a)
               of this section by claiming that he is a social and environmental
               activist involved in the issues concerning the tribals as well as the
               environment. He submitted that he has filed this appeal as
               president of Lok Shakti Abhiyan. He and his group has been
               closely working among the affected communities of Brundamanl &amp;
               Bhurkhamunda District, Jharsuguda, Orissa on the issues of
               development.

               8. While his representations to the Orissa State Pollution Control
               Board and other on faulty Environmental Impact Assessment
               Report, postponement of Public Hearing and not attending the
               Public Hearing on personal reasons is not disputed, we could not
               find him affected in any manner so as to satisfy the criteria laid
               down for "person aggrieved" in the judgment of Supreme Court in
               the case of <a href="/doc/1922606/" id="a_3">Thammanna V. K. Veera Reddy and Ors</a>. as reported at
               para 16 of (1980) 4 Supreme Court Cases 62.

               9. Having perused all the submissions and the documents filed by
               the Appellant, the Respondent, the Authority finds that the
               Appellant is not qualified to file this Appeal under clause (a) of the
               Section 11(2) of the NEAA, Act 1997. The Appeal is accordingly
               not admitted."


6.     Aggrieved by the order of the Authority, the petitioner preferred a writ petition

being CWP No. 3126/2008. The writ petition was allowed by S. Ravindra Bhat, J. by

the order under appeal. S. Ravindra Bhat, J., on a detailed analysis of the scheme and



LPA 277/2009                                                               Page 4 of 17
 provisions of the Act, came to the conclusion that first respondent has the locus standi to

maintain an appeal before the Authority. The learned Judge observed:

               "16. ......the expression "person aggrieved" has to be given a
               panoptic import and be understood to include persons like the
               petitioner who display interest in social and environmental causes.
               This is established by the fact that his organization was closely
               following the issue of setting up of aluminum smelter plant during
               various stages of the project to the extent that it had, on two
               occasions objected to the holding of the „public hearing‟ and sent
               a detailed letter elucidating the objections and further when it
               learnt about alleged unauthorized construction at the project site,
               he wrote to the second respondent, which later directed the third
               respondent to stop such activities.

               17.     .....In the impugned order the Authority acknowledged that
               the petitioner had on several occasions in the past made
               representations before the Orissa State Pollution Control Board
               challenging the holding of public hearing and that the petitioner
               could not attend the hearing due to personal reasons. Public
               hearings, in such cases, are organized to elicit comments from the
               members of public before granting clearance to a project in order
               to assess the nature of environmental damage, if any, due to the
               likely execution of project and its impact on the rights of
               inhabitants and the persons who depend on that area for livelihood
               or otherwise. A person who participates in the public hearing, and
               thus in the process of decision-making, potentially becomes an
               aggrieved person if his grievances are not properly addressed. The
               petitioner, though not participating in the public hearing, had
               presented his detailed objections before the second respondent
               against the holding of public hearing on the ground of faulty
               environmental impact assessment report. At one stage, his
               representations were found substantial by the authorities. Denial
               of the right to appeal would also lead to a highly incongruous
               situation whereby someone like him, allowed to participate in the
               principal decision making process, is denied the right to question
               the findings of the primary decision maker, in the appellate
               proceedings."


Consequently the impugned order of the Authority was quashed and the Authority was

directed to entertain and dispose of the appeal of first respondent in accordance with law.

7.     Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, relying

upon the decision in Thammanna V/s. K. Veera Reddy &amp; Others, (1980) 4 SCC 62,

emphasized that "a person aggrieved has to be a person with a legal grievance". He

submitted that in the instant case, it is not even the contention of the first respondent that

he is representing any local population which is affected by the project.            The first

respondent is not even a local resident of the area. His only contention is that he is

working among the affected communities. It is nowhere his case that any of the affected
LPA 277/2009                                                                 Page 5 of 17
 persons either asked him to appear on their behalf or raised any grievance to him about

the project. Dr. Singhvi further submitted that <a href="/doc/16785523/" id="a_4">Section 11(1)</a> only gives locus to a person

aggrieved to file an appeal. According to him the predominant purpose of <a href="/doc/31965171/" id="a_5">Section 11</a> is

the quick redressal of public grievances. In order to prevent the delays, the Act has

circumscribed the kind of person who can file an appeal against the environmental

clearance. If the objective of the statute was to allow appeals by anyone then instead of

the phrase "person aggrieved", the phrase "any person" would have been used. He

submitted that a person not falling under the definition of „person aggrieved‟ under the

Act can always approach the High Court by way of PIL under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India or the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_7">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India.

He also placed reliance on the decisions in <a href="/doc/145860470/" id="a_8">Krishna Swami v. Union of India</a> (1992) 4

SCC 605 and Regina v. Secretary of State For Environment, (1990) 2 WLR 187.

8.     In reply, Mr. Sanjay Parekh, learned senior counsel appearing for the first

respondent submitted that the question of locus of an individual in our country, as far as

environment is concerned, rests in the public and constitutional law domain. Such

public and constitutional right cannot be curtailed by any statutory enactment. Any

action which affects the environment can be questioned by individual/individuals as a

matter of right as well as duty. Mr. Parekh submitted that the decision of the Supreme

Court in Thammanna V/s. K. Veera Reddy &amp; Others (supra) relied upon by Dr.

Singhvi has no application to the present case where the issues of environment have been

raised. According to him, the expression "person" for the purpose of the Act is used in a

wide manner and includes anyone likely to be affected by the grant of environment

clearance. The use of the word „likely‟ in the Act, clearly establishes that there is no

requirement to show a direct linkage between the activity proposed and the impact on the

aggrieved person. He also referred to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act

which states that the necessity of setting up of National Environment Appellate Authority

was due to Public Interest Litigations filed before the Supreme Court relating to

environment and it was intended to provide quick redressal of public grievances, where

the public could approach by means of petitions, complaints, representations or appeals.


LPA 277/2009                                                             Page 6 of 17
 The submission of Mr. Parekh is that the first respondent is working in the area in

question on the environmental issues and following up the issues of this project since

beginning. The first respondent, though was not able to participate in the public hearing

in person, but objections were sent by him to the project authorities and also to Pollution

Control Board.    Learned counsel further submitted that welfare statutes have to be

interpreted in a manner which serves the interest of those whom they are intended to

benefit. The protection of forests and the natural environment is a fundamental duty of

every citizen under <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_9">Article 51-A(g)</a> of the Constitution. The Authority provides a forum

for redressal of grievances on environmental issues and at the same time for those who

are concerned about taking proactive measures to protect the environment. He submitted

that it is settled law that courts should favour an interpretation that promotes the general

purpose of an Act rather than one that does not.

9.     Mr. Chandhiok, learned ASG appearing for the Ministry of Environment and

Forest supported the interpretation of <a href="/doc/31965171/" id="a_10">Section 11</a> by S. Ravindra Bhat, J. and also drew

our attention to the decisions of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1224932/" id="a_11">Ghulam Qadir v. Special

Tribunal &amp; Others</a>, (2002) 1 SCC 33 and <a href="/doc/1875824/" id="a_12">N.D. Jayal v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., (2004)

9 SCC 362.

10.    It is now well settled by a series of judgments of the Supreme Court that though

the industrial development is of vital important to the country as it generates foreign

exchange and provides employment avenues, it has no right to destroy the ecology,

degrade the environment and pose as a health hazard. <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_13">In Vellore Citizens' Welfare

Forum v. Union of India</a>, (1996) 5 SCC 647, the Supreme Court held that the traditional

concept that development and ecology are opposed to each other is no longer acceptable.

"Sustainable Development" is the answer.        In the international sphere, "Sustainable

Development" as a concept came to be known for the first time in Stockholm Declaration

of 1972. Thereafter in 1987, the concept was given a definite shape by the World

Commission on Environment and Development in its report called "Our Common

Future" popularly known as "Brundtland Report". In 1991, the World Conservation

Union, United Nations Environment Programme and World Wide Fund for Nature,


LPA 277/2009                                                               Page 7 of 17
 jointly came out with a document called "Caring for the Earth" which is a strategy for

sustainable living. Finally, came the Earth Summit held in June, 1992 at Rio where as

many as 153 nations signed two conventions, one on biological diversity and another on

climate change.      The delegates also approved by consensus three non-binding

documents, namely, a Statement on Forestry Principles, a declaration of Principles on

Environmental Policy and Development Initiatives and Agenda 21, a programme of

action into the next century in areas like poverty, population and pollution.             The

Supreme Court noted that some of the salient principles of "Sustainable Development",

The Court noticed that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees protection of life

and personal liberty. The Court also noticed that <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_15">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution cast a

duty on the State to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the forests and

wild life of the country and <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_16">Article 51A(g)</a> of the Constitution spells out duty of citizens

to protect and improve the environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and

to have compassion for living creatures. The Court also noted that apart from the

constitutional mandate to protect and improve the environment, there are plenty of post

independence legislations on the subject, namely, The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_19">Environment Protection Act</a> 1986. In view of the above mentioned constitutional and

statutory provisions, the Court held that Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays

Principle are part of the environmental law of the country.

10.    In Indian Council for <a href="/doc/998721/" id="a_20">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India</a>, (1996) 5 SCC

281, the Court noted that even though laws have been passed for the protection of

environment, the enforcement of the same has been tardy, to say the least. Environment

degradation is best protected by the people themselves. The following observations of

the Court are relevant:


LPA 277/2009                                                               Page 8 of 17
                "41. With rapid industrialisation taking place, there is an
               increasing threat to the maintenance of the ecological balance. The
               general public is becoming aware of the need to protect
               environment. Even though, laws have been passed for the
               protection of environment, the enforcement of the same has been
               tardy, to say the least. With the governmental authorities not
               showing any concern with the enforcement of the said Acts, and
               with the development taking place for personal gains at the
               expense of environment and with disregard to the mandatory
               provisions of law, some public spirited persons have been initiating
               public interest litigations. The legal position relating to the exercise
               of jurisdiction by the Courts for preventing environmental
               degradation and thereby, seeking to protect the fundamental rights
               of the citizens, is now well settled by various decisions of this
               Court. The primary effort of the Court, while dealing with the
               environmental related issues, is to see that the enforcement
               agencies, whether it be the State or any other authority, take
               effective steps for the enforcement of the laws. The Courts, in a
               way, act as the guardian of the people's fundamental rights but in
               regard to many technical matters, the Courts may not be fully
               equipped. Perforce, it has to rely on outside agencies for reports
               and recommendations whereupon orders have been passed from
               time to time. Even though, it is not the function of the Court to see
               the day to day enforcement of the law, that being the function of
               the Executive, but because of the non-functioning of the
               enforcement agencies, the Courts as of necessity have had to pass
               orders directing the enforcement agencies to implement the law.

               taking place in different parts of the country, it may not be possible
               for any single authority to effectively control the same.
               Environmental degradation is best protected by the people
               themselves. In this connection, some of the non-governmental
               organisations (NGOs) and other environmentalists are doing
               singular service. Time has perhaps come when the Government
               can usefully draw upon the resources of such NGOs to help and
               assist in the implementation of the laws relating to protection of
               environment. Under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_21">Section 3</a> of the Act, the Central Government

               the power to issue directions under Section 5 of the Act of the

               organisations may of course be a front for competitive interests but
               they cannot alt be tarred with the same brush. Our jurisprudence is
               replete with instances where voluntary organisations have
               championed the cause of conservation and have been responsible
               for creating an awareness of the necessity to preserve the
               environment so that the earth as we know it and humanity may

<p id="p_6">12.    <a href="/doc/1875824/" id="a_25">In N.D. Jayal v. Union of India</a> (supra), the Court held:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               24.      The right to development cannot be treated as a mere right
               to economic betterment or cannot be limited to as a misnomer to
               simple construction activities. The right to development
               encompasses much more than economic well being, and includes
               within its definition the guarantee of fundamental human rights.
               The 'development' is not related only to the growth of GNP. In
               the classic work, Development As Freedom, the Nobel prize
               winner Amartya Sen pointed out that 'the issue of development
               cannot be separated from the conceptual framework of human
               right'. This idea is also part of the UN Declaration on the Right to
               Development. The right to development includes the whole
               spectrum of civil, cultural, economic, political and social process,
               for the improvement of peoples' well being and realization of their
               full potential. It is an integral part of human right. Of course,
               construction of a dam or a mega project is definitely an attempt to
               achieve the goal of wholesome development. Such works could
               very well be treated as integral component for development.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">               25.     Therefore, the adherence to sustainable development
               principle is a sine qua non for the maintenance of the symbiotic
               balance between the rights to environment and development. Right
               to environment is a fundamental right. On the other hand, right to

                development is also one. Here the right to 'sustainable
               development' cannot be singled out. Therefore, the concept of
               'sustainable development' is to be treated as an integral part of 'life'
               under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_26">Article 21.</a> Weighty concepts like inter-generational equity

               sustainable development.

               Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 (for short "the Act") and this
               is quite necessary to guarantee "right to life" under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_29">Article 21.</a> <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">If
               the Act</a> is not armed with the powers to ensure sustainable
               development, it will become a barren shell. In other words,
               sustainable development is one of the means to achieve the object
               and purpose of the Act as well as the protection of 'life' under
               <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_31">Article 21.</a> Acknowledgment of this principle will breath new life
               into our environmental jurisprudence and constitutional resolve.
               Sustainable development could be achieved only by strict
               compliance with the directions under the Act. The object and
               purpose of the Act: "to provide for the protection and improvement
               of environment" could only be achieved by ensuring the strict
               compliance with its directions. The authorities concerned by
               exercising their powers under the Act will have to ensure the
               acquiescence of sustainable development. Therefore, the directions
               or conditions put forward by the Act need to be strictly complied
               with. Thus the power under the Act cannot be treated as a power
               simpliciter, but it is a power coupled with duty. It is the duty of the
               State to make sure the fulfillment of conditions or direction under
               the Act. Without strict compliance, right to environment under
               <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_32">Article 21</a> could not be guaranteed and the purpose of the Act will
               also be defeated. The commitment to the conditions thereof is an

               considered necessary to set up an independent body for quick
               redressal of public grievances. Consequently, an Ordinance was
               promulgated providing for the establishment of a National

granting environmental clearance has a right to prefer an appeal to the Authority and the

definition of „person‟ as contained in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/181903687/" id="a_38">Section 11</a> at Clause (a) thereto

provides that any person who is likely to be affected by the grant of environmental

clearance has an undoubted locus standi to file an appeal. <a href="/doc/105719283/" id="a_39">Section 11(2)(c)</a> is worded

differently and is wider in scope than sub-clause (a).          Sub-clause (c) speaks of

"association of persons" (whether incorporated or not) who are likely to be affected by

the impugned action and who work in the field of environment.              In other words,

sub-clause (a) talks of those who are affected or are likely to be affected and the emphasis

is on the impact on an individual, though the sub-clause does not rule out more than one

person likely to be affected who are actually aggrieved. In contrast, sub-clause (c) refers

 to an association of persons, particularly an incorporated one.       Such association of

persons, particularly an incorporated association, cannot be said to be affected in the

manner traditionally understood. Moreover, in environmental cases the damage is not

necessarily confined to the local area where the industry is set up.         The effect of

environmental pollution or environmental degradation might have far-reaching effects

going beyond the local area and might have national or global effects. For example, the

destruction of forests is said to be one of the causes leading to global warming.

<p id="p_9">Therefore, the aggrieved person need not be resident of the local area.            Such an

               the right can sue and it is therefore, held in many jurisdictions that
               since the State representing the public is the holder of the public
               rights, it alone can sue for redress of public injury or vindication of
               public interest. It is on this principle that in the United Kingdom,
               the Attorney-General is entrusted with the function of enforcing
               due observance of the law. The Attorney-General represents the
               public interest in its entirety and as pointed out by S.A. de Smith in
               "Judicial Review of Administrative Action" (Third edition) at page
               403; "the general public has an interest in seeing that the law is
               obeyed and for this purpose, the Attorney General represents the
               public." There is, therefore, a machinery in the United Kingdom
               for judicial redress for public injury and protection of social,
               collective, what Cappellatti calls 'diffuse' rights and interests. We
               have no such machinery here. We have undoubtedly an Attorney
               General as also Advocates General in the States, but they do not
               represent the public interest generally. They do so in a very limited
               field; see Sections 91 and 92 of the Civil Procedure Code, But,
               even if we had a provision empowering the Attorney General or
               the Advocate General to take action for vindicating public interest,
               I doubt very much whether it would be effective. The Attorney
               General or the Advocate General would be too dependent upon the
               political branches of Government to act as an advocate against
               abuses which are frequently generated at least tolerated by political
               and administrative bodies. Be that as it may, the fact remains that
               we have no such institution in our country and we have therefore to
               liberalise the rule of standing in order to provide judicial redress
               for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from other
               violation of the Constitution or the law. If public duties are to be
               enforced and social collective 'diffused' rights and interests are to
               be protected, we have to utilise the initiative and zeal of
               public-minded persons and organisations by allowing them to
               move the court and act for a general or group interest, even though
               they may not be directly injured in their own rights. It is for this
               reason that in public interest litigation -- litigation undertaken for
               the purpose of redressing public injury, enforcing public duty,
               protecting social, collective, 'diffused' rights and interests or
               vindicating public interest, any citizen who is acting bona fide and
               who has sufficient interest has to be accorded standing. What is
               sufficient interest to give standing to a member of the public would
               have to be determined by the Court in each individual case. It is
               not possible for the Court to lay down any hard and fast rule or any
               strait-jacket formula for the purpose of defining or delimiting
               'sufficient interest', It has necessarily to be left to the discretion of
               the Court. The reason is that in a modern complex society which is
               seeking to bring about transformation of its social and economic
               structure and trying to reach social justice to the vulnerable
               sections of the people by creating new social, collective 'diffuse'
               rights and interests and imposing new public duties on the State
               and other public authorities, infinite number of situations are
               bound to arise which cannot be imprisoned in a rigid mould or a
               procrustean formula. The Judge who has the correct social

                perspective and who is on the same wavelength as the Constitution
               will be able to decide, without any difficulty and in consonance
               with the constitutional objectives, whether a member of the public
               moving the court in a particular case has sufficient interest to
               initiate the action.

Krishna Iyer, J. quoted with approval the following passage from Access to Justice by

Cappelletti and B. Garth which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">               "The recognition of this urgent need reflects a fundamental change
               in the concept of "procedural justice".... The new attitude to
               procedural justice reflects what Professor Adolf Homburger has
               called "a radical change in the hierarchy of values served by civil
               procedure"; the paramount concern is increasingly with "social
               justice," i.e., with finding procedures which are conducive to the
               pursuit and protection of the rights of ordinary people. While the
               implications of this change are dramatic-for instance, insofar as the
               role of the adjudicator is concerned-it is worth emphasizing at the
               outset that the core values of the more traditional procedural justice
               must be retained. "Access to justice" must encompass both forms
               of procedural justice."

               Interest Litigation. On the facts and in the circumstances of the

<p id="p_13">19.    It is well settled that in construing remedial statute the courts ought to give to it

widest operation which its language will permit. The words of such a statute must be so

construed as to give the most complete remedy which the phraseology will permit, so as

to secure that the relief contemplated by the statute shall not be denied to the class

intended to be relieved. The statute being remedial in nature is given liberal construction

to promote the beneficient object behind it.        <a href="/doc/794165/" id="a_47">In Workman of American Express

speaking for the Court observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "The principles of statutory construction are well settled. Words occurring
       in statutes of liberal import such as social welfare legislation and 'Human
       Rights' legislation are not to be put in Procrustean beds or shrunk to
       Liliputian dimensions. In construing these legislations the imposture of
       literal construction must be avoided and the prodigality of its
       mis-application must be recognised and reduced. Judges ought to be more
       concerned with the 'colour', the 'content' and the 'context' of such statutes
       (we have borrowed the words from Lord Wilberforce's opinion in Prenn v.
       Simmonds). In the same opinion Lord Wilberforce pointed out that law is
       not to be left behind in some island of literal interpretation but is to
       enquire beyond the language, un-isolated from the matrix of facts in which
       they are set; the law is not to be interpreted purely on internal linguistic
       considerations. In one of the cases cited before us, that is, <a href="/doc/1201719/" id="a_48">Surendra
       Kumar Verma v. Central Government Industrial Tribunal</a> cum-Labour

                  "Semantic luxuries are misplaced in the interpretation of
                  "bread and butter" statutes. Welfare statutes must, of
                  necessity, receive a broad interpretation. Where
                  legislation is designed to give relief against certain kinds
                  of mischief, the Court is not to make inroads by making

order, the Authority acknowledged that the first respondent had on several occasions in

the past made representations before the Orissa Pollution Control Board challenging the

holding of public hearing and that he could not attend the hearing due to personal

reasons.   The first respondent, though not participating in the public hearing, had

presented his detailed objections before the Pollution Control Board against the holding

of public hearing on the ground of faulty environmental impact assessment report. At

one stage, his representations were found substantial by the authorities.
