Justice Dr. P. Jyothimani, Judicial Member

</p><p id="p_5">1.   We heard the learned counsel for the appellant as well as

the counsel for the respondents at length. We have also perused

the report filed by the single member Expert Committee

appointed        by        this      Tribunal         presided        by

Dr. R. Sivacoumar, Principal Scientist, CSIR-NEERI.



</p><p id="p_6">2.   This appeal has been filed by the appellant, who is

engaged in the business of blue metals involving the process of

stone crushing, against the order of the Tamil Nadu Pollution

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                             2</span>
 Control Board dated 25.4.2013 by the which the Pollution

Control Board by exercising the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section

31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981

has directed the immediate closure of the stone crushing plant

of the appellant on various grounds., that all the air pollution

control measures namely closed cover for the jaw crusher and

rotary screen were found to be in damaged condition, that no

water sprinkler was provided to suppress the dust emission

both at the jaw crusher and other vulnerable points in the

premises, that conveyors were not provided with cover, that the

unit has expanded its activity by providing Hot Mix Plant and

Ready Mix Concrete Plant without obtaining Consent of the

Board, and that complaints were received against the operation

of the unit causing air pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.   It is not in dispute that the hot mix plant and the ready

mix concrete plant of the appellant unit were completely

removed and therefore the complaint made by the Tamil Nadu

Pollution Board in that regard has become infructuous. The

Appellant who is engaged in the business of crushing blue

metals is stated to have established its industry during 1990 as

a small scale industry with nearly 500 employees. Thereafter, in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                   3</span>
 the year 2000, after purchasing the adjacent business of stone

crushing which was carried on in the name of M/s. Ponni Maan

Blue Metals, the Appellant has applied for consent and it is

stated that it has been functioning for the past 23 years

without any complaint either under air or water related

pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.   It is the case of the Appellant that the consent to renewal

to operate was granted to the Appellant under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 only on

3.12.2012    which   was   renewed   till   30.6.2013   and   the

application for further extension of renewal is stated to be

pending before the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. It is

also stated by the Appellant that the Appellant has planted

around 3000 trees around the crushing unit. While so, the

impugned order has been passed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution

Control Board abruptly ordering the closure of the unit without

even giving opportunity to the Appellant. In fact, the Appellant

has chosen to   state that the reason adduced for the abrupt

closure of the unit by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board

were that in the Appellant unit the pollution control equipments

are not functioning properly, the water sprinkling unit has


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                    4</span>
 exceeded its production capacity, that the Appellant unit is

operating hot mix plant and concrete mixing plant without the

consent of the Board, that the Appellant unit is operating in

violation of various conditions imposed by the 1st and the 2nd

respondents resulting in the pollution of agriculture lands in

and around the unit and complaints from public have been

received, etc. Therefore, the appeal has been filed challenging

the impugned order on various grounds including that the

impugned order is in violation of the principle of natural justice,

that the impugned order has been passed ignoring the fact that

the consent for the unit has been granted by the same Tamil

Nadu Pollution Control Board which is in force till 9/2013 and

that the further action for renewal of consent is also pending

and no order has been passed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.   That apart, it is the case of the Appellant that the Tamil

Nadu Pollution Control Board has failed to find out any non-

compliance of various conditions and requirements of the Tamil

Nadu   Pollution   Control   Board   itself   and   therefore,   the

impugned order has been affected by total non-application of

mind. As stated above, where all the alleged violations relating

to the hot mix plant and the concrete mix plant are concerned,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                       5</span>
 since the same were closed, we are to consider about the other

requirements.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.   After hearing the learned counsel, the Tribunal, in order to

find out the correct factual position, appointed a Single Member

Expert Committee presided by the Dr. R. Sivacoumar, Principal

Scientist, CSIR-NEERI, who after a thorough inspection, has

filed his report before this Tribunal. The report, which has

taken note of each and every minute detail regarding the

functioning of the unit with reference to the terms and

references made by the Tribunal, considered various issues at

length, as to whether the unit has installed all the pollution

control equipment in the stone crushing unit.

</p><p id="p_11">7.   While considering each one of the issues, the expert has

stated that in so far as the installation of air pollution control

equipment, the same has been complied with by the Appellant

unit. That apart, while answering the same, the expert has also

stated that the Appellant has planted nearly 3111 trees of

various species. Again, while referring to the next question on

proper functioning of air pollution control equipments, the

Expert has      given his report positively. Relating to      the

measuring of air ambient quality available in and around the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                     6</span>
 plant, it is stated by the Expert that the scheme of measuring

the ambient air quality is not available in and around the plant

and neither Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board nor M/s.

Gokulam Blue Metals has any scheme of measuring the

ambient air quality in and around the plant. The non-providing

of such a facility would not mean that the project proponent

has exceeded the limit as far as the ambient air quality is

concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_12">8.   While answering the next question about the unit whether

it has installed water sprinkling to control quarry dust

emanating during the operation, again the Expert has given a

positive reply. That was so in respect of the next question of

production. Since the change in the ownership of the unit,

there is no change in the sanctioned capacity and production

during the time of inspection of the unit according to the

Expert.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.   Further, while answering the next question on whether the

unit has any hot mix plant without approval, the expert has

also concurred with the Appellant and there is no operation of

hot mix plant during the time of inspection. As stated above,

the project proponent, namely the Appellant, has removed the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                   7</span>
 said two schemes namely the hot mix plant and the ready mix

concrete plant and he also undertakes that he has no proposal

of reintroducing the same in future.
</p>
<p id="p_14">10.    The Expert, while answering for any visible observations

on the impact of this crusher unit on abutting agricultural

lands, has clearly stated that there is not much visible dust

emanating from this stone crushing unit on the abutting

agricultural lands around the crusher unit. He has also

answered many other observations and has given the following

recommendations:
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1.   Construction of metalled / paved road
           within the premises leading to bunker
           near jaw crusher;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2.   Crusher sanctioned capacity may be
           stipulated on daily basis 55MT/day for 24
           working days per month) instead of
           monthly basis so as to utilise optimally
           the assimilative capacity of the air shed;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      3.   A buffer zone of at least 200 m may be
           provided by the Government / Authorities
           around M/s. Gokulam Blue Metals so as to
           contain any dust in case of strong winds;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      4.   It is recommended that M/s. Gokulam Blue
           Metals may be asked to replace the wind
           breaking net in the west direction from
           where the complaint is originating, with a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                  8</span>
           permanent structure - either steel with
          proper support or masonry wall up to a
          height of 15 m.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">11. The learned counsel for the appellant, while reiterating his

stand, submits that the impugned order is not innocuous in the

sense that the same has been passed in total violation of the

principles of natural justice and that the order is in ignorance

of the existing factual position and it is to be set aside on the

ground of total non-application of mind. The learned counsel

would fairly submit that the unit is prepared to comply with the

recommendations given by the learned Expert and if necessary,

abide by any other conditions which may be imposed by this

Tribunal also.
</p>
<p id="p_17"> 12.   On going through the recommendations of the learned

Expert, we are of the view that there is no reason to go against

the report of the Expert except, of course, a few minor

modifications which are based on the existing facts and also on

the statutory and other circulars issued by the Tamil Nadu

Pollution Control Board. Accordingly, we dispose the appeal

with the following directions.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                    9</span>
</p><p id="p_19"> 1)   Construction of metal / paved road within the

     premises leading to bunker jaw crusher;
</p>
<p id="p_20">2)   Relating to the second recommendation of crusher

     capacity which has to be stipulated on daily basis

     instead of monthly basis, so as to utilise optimally the

     assimilative capacity of the air shed; while reiterating

     that the unit shall follow the same, we also make it

     clear that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board

     shall consider the effect of the sanctioning capacity on

     daily basis and monthly basis in respect of the other

     concerned units in the State by appointing an Action

     Group to make a thorough study about the same and

     if necessary, file a report before this Tribunal to enable

     the Tribunal to give guidance in future.
</p>
<p id="p_21">3)   Relating to the recommendation on the buffer zone,

     the Expert has stated that at least 200 m to be

     provided by the Government or Authorities around the

     Appellant unit so as to contain any dust in case in

     case of strong wind.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                  10</span>
</p><p id="p_23"> 13. The learned counsel appearing for the Tamil Nadu

Pollution Control Board has brought to the notice of this

Tribunal about the proceedings of the Board under B.P.Ms. No.

4 dated 2.7.2004 which has streamlined the norms for the

location for stone crushing industries based on the orders of

the Appellate Authority of Pollution Control constituted under

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>. In this proceedings, in paragraph 1.0.

the Board has framed criteria for the existing stone crushing

units which are based on the recommendations of NEERI. The

distance criteria which has been stated in respect of the

existing stone crushing units is set under paragraph 1.1 and is

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       1.No stone crushers units should be
         located within 500 m from any NH or SH
         or primary residential area or mixed
         residential area or places of public and
         religious importance;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       2.The minimum distance between two
         stone crushers should be 1 km to avoid
         dust pollution influence of one over the
         other.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">14.   Since the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has already

assessed and issued proceedings, admittedly the Appellant unit

is an existing stone crushing unit, as rightly submitted by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                  11</span>
 learned counsel appearing for the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control

Board. In as much as it relates to the Appellant unit, the said

Board's proceedings being statutory in nature as provided by

law, shall be the guiding factor. Accordingly, in respect of the

suggestions made by the learned counsel, we direct that the

Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board proceedings as mentioned

in its proceedings dated 2.7.2004 and contained in paragraph

1.0 and 1.1 shall be made applicable to the Appellant unit and

the Appellant unit shall make necessary arrangements to

implement them.
</p>
<p id="p_25">15.   Relating to the next suggestion that the Appellant unit,

shall be asked to replace the wind breaking net in the west

direction from where the complaint is originating by a

permanent structure either steel sheet with proper support or

masonry wall up to a height of 15 m, the learned        counsel

appearing for the Appellant unit would submit that putting up

a masonry wall to the extent of 15 mts will be absolutely

impossible and that would also affect the free flow of air and

therefore, he has suggested that the Appellant unit may be

directed to put up a masonry wall to the height of 3 m and

thereafter another 4 m by way of dust arresting net, instead.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                   12</span>
</p><p id="p_26"> 16.   We find reason in such a contention raised by the learned

counsel for the Appellant and therefore we are of the view that

instead of directing the Appellant unit to construct a wall of 15

m height, we direct the Appellant unit that the wall shall be in

combination of masonry and dust arresting net as proposed by

the learned counsel for the Appellant unit to the extent of 3 m

height and thereafter for another 4 m       of dust arresting net

shall be put up by the Appellant unit, thereby the total barrier

shall be 7 m in height. We are of the view that providing such

arrangement will be sufficient to prevent air pollution that

arises on the western side.
</p>
<p id="p_27">17.   On the compliance of the above said directions, the

Appellant unit should be entitled to run with its full capacity, of

course in accordance with all requirements in law and as per

the directions of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_28">18.   We also make it clear that it is always up to the Tamil

Nadu Pollution Control Board to have the overall provision of

supervisory powers over the unit to see as to whether the

Appellant unit has complied with the above said directions

within a period of 4 months and ensure the compliance


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                      13</span>
 accordingly. With the above said directions, the Appeal stands

closed. We also record our appreciation for the involvement and

work done by the Expert Dr. R.           Sivacoumar and the

suggestions made and the efforts taken by the learned counsel

for the Appellant unit Shri K. Rajasekaran and the able

assistance rendered by the learned counsel appearing the Tamil

Nadu Pollution Control Board Smt. H. Yasmeen Ali. The parties

shall bear their own costs.
