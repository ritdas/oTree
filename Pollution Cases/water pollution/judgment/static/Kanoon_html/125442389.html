   has been defined to mean a plant used for any
   industrial or trade purposes and emitting any air

   workers are working in different mining lease areas

   activities in such mining lease areas of less than 5
   hectares may be permitted subject to their obtaining
   consent from the M.P. State Pollution Control Board
   wherever such consent is required within a period of
   three months from today.

<p id="p_20">          Regarding mining lease areas of 5 hectares of
   more, clearance under the notification dated
   14.09.2006 will have to be obtained either from the

   Environmental Impact Assessment Authority. In case
   the applications have been filed for such clearance
   before the Central Government or the State Level
   Environmental Impact Assessment Authority, the
   same will be processed as early as possible and the
   results intimated to the applicants by the concerned
   authority within a period of one month from the
   receipt of certified copy of this order from the
   applicants. As soon as such clearances are obtained

        if the same have been excavated prior to 2.7.2008,

<p id="p_27">7.      In our considered opinion, particularly in view of the fact

that respondent No.3 has already taken the required action

purpose would be served to keep the overburden dumped on the

spot for an indefinite period.

the controversy, we direct that the authorities shall allow the

petitioner to remove the overburden from the spot on payment
