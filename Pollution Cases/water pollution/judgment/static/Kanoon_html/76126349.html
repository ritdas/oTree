<p id="p_2">        The assessee has filed the present Stay Petitions praying for

stay for recovery of outstanding amount for the assessment years

2009-10 to 2012-13.

</p><p id="p_4">2.     Ms. Aparna Nandakumar, the Ld.counsel for the assessee,

submitted that the assessee is a State Government organization

constituted under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_1">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. According to the Ld. counsel, the income of

the assessee was exempted under <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_3">Section 10(20)</a> of the Income-

tax Act, 1961 (in short 'the Act') till 01.04.2003. <a href="/doc/1387816/" id="a_4">Section 10(20)</a> was

amended with effect from 01.04.2003 restricting the exemption only

to local bodies.    Therefore, according to the Ld. counsel, the

assessee applied for grant of exemption under <a href="/doc/1387816/" id="a_5">Section 10(23C)(iv)</a>

of the Act as a charitable institution. The application filed by the

assessee is still pending before the Chief Commissioner and no

order was passed sofar.     In the meantime, according to the Ld.

counsel, the Assessing Officer treated the receipts as income of the

assessee and raised demand about ₹105 Crores for all the five

years. According to the Ld. counsel, the assessee also filed writ

petition before the High Court for mandamus directing the Income

Tax Department to issue a notification exempting the assessee

under <a href="/doc/1387816/" id="a_6">Section 10(23C)(iv)</a> of the Act. The writ petition, according to

the Ld. counsel, is still pending for adjudication. According to the

Ld. counsel, if the approval under <a href="/doc/1387816/" id="a_7">Section 10(23C)</a> of the Act is

granted by the Chief Commissioner, then the entire income of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3                     S.P. Nos.83 to 87/Chny/18</span>


assessee is exempted, therefore, there is a prima facie case for

grant of stay.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.     We heard Ms. S. Vijayaprabha, the Ld. Departmental

Representative also. The assessee is a statutory body established

by the State Government for performing statutory function. It is not

known how the assessee is claiming itself as a charitable institution.

Moreover, it appears that now the application for approval as

charitable institution is pending before the Chief Commissioner.

Therefore, this Tribunal is not expressing any opinion on the merit of

the claim of the assessee as charitable institution. Suffice to say

that as on today, there is no approval under <a href="/doc/1387816/" id="a_8">Section 10(23C)</a> of the

Act from the competent authority and the assessee was not

registered under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Section 12AA</a> of the Act. Therefore, the income of

the assessee is not eligible for exemption as claimed by the

Ld.counsel for the assessee. Therefore, there is no prima facie

case for grant of stay. Accordingly, all the Stay Petitions filed by the

assessee stand dismissed.      The Registry is directed to post the

appeals for final disposal on 23.04.2018. The copy of this order of

the Stay Petitions shall be treated as notice for hearing on

23.04.2018.
