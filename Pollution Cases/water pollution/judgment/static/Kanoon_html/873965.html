ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.	Rule.
</p><p id="p_2">Mr.Rashesh Rindani, learned Assistant Government Pleader, waives
service of notice of Rule on behalf of   respondents Nos.1,2 and 4,
Mr.Kaushal D.Pandya, learned advocate, waives service of notice of
Rule on behalf of respondent No.3 and Mr.Sunil L.Mehta, learned
advocate, waives service of notice of Rule on behalf of respondent
No.5. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, and with the
consent of the learned advocates for the respective parties, the
petition is being finally heard and decided.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.	The
challenge in this petition preferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, is to the Notification dated 16-07-2011,
issued by  the Commissioner of Police, Surat City,  under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_2">Section 144</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,
("The Code" for short).
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.	The
brief factual background leading to the filing of the petition is as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.1	The
petitioners are artisans, engaged in the business of making idols of
Hindu Gods and Goddesses in the City of Surat.  These idols are made
of clay, or Plaster of Paris. After manufacture, the said idols are
sold in the market and are purchased by the public for worship during
festivals,  such a Ganesh Chaturthi, after which they are
ceremonially immersed in the River Tapi. According to the
petitioners,   Plaster of Paris  is a  a natural product, and while
preparing the idols, no chemicals  or toxic colours are used. The
Commissioner of Police, Surat City (respondent No.2), issued a
Notification dated 21-05-2011,  under the provisions of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_3">Section 144</a>
of the Code, prohibiting the use of Plaster of Paris in making the
idols and banning the use of toxic colours for painting them. The
Notification contained certain other prohibitions, such as,  the
height of the   idol should not exceed 9 ft., etc. This Notification
was made effective from 21-05-2011 to 20-07-2011. During the pendency
of the petition, the period  of validity of the said Notification has
come to an end, therefore, respondent No.2 issued another,
identically worded Notification, dated 16-07-2011, with effect from
21-07-2011, valid upto 18-09-2011. The petitioners were permitted to
amend the petition, in order to include a challenge to this
Notification which has been done.  The Notification dated 16-07-2011,
 is under challenge in the present petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.	Mr.B.C.Dave,
learned advocate for the petitioners has made several submissions,
the gist of  which is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_7">(a)
The petitioners are engaged in the preparation of idols of Hindu Gods
and Goddesses which are sold in the open market. No chemicals are
being used by the petitioners in preparation of the idols and no
toxic colours are used for painting them. Plaster of Paris, which is
the material used for making the idols, is a natural product, and no
chemicals are being mixed with it.
</p>
<p id="p_8">(b)	The
petitioners have no role to play, insofar as immersion of the idols
during religious festivals is concerned. It is the duty of  the local
authorities such as the respondent Municipal Corporation,  to ensure
that immersion of the idols does not cause pollution of the River and
other environmental hazards.
</p>
<p id="p_9">(c)	There
is no justification in the issuance of the impugned Notification by
respondent No.2, especially in the  absence of any material with
regard to the adverse effect upon  public health and hygiene.  The
Notification has been issued  without basis. There is no  material on
record to show that an emergent situation existed, justifying the
exercise of power under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_4">Section 144</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_10">(d)	
The power under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_5">Section 144</a> of the Code can be used only in urgent
situations. No such urgent situation existed, in the present case.
There is no material on record to show that an urgent situation
existed, warranting a conclusion by respondent No.2  that the use of
Plaster of Paris in preparation of the idols, and immersion thereof,
is causing imminent danger to public health and hygiene. It is not so
stated in the impugned Notification, therefore, respondent No.2 has
exceeded the jurisdiction vested in him under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_6">Section 144</a> of the
Code.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(e)	
Respondent No.2 has not recorded his subjective satisfaction that an
urgent situation, endangering human life and health, has arisen,
causing the issuance of the impugned Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_12">(f)	The
Notification has been issued only in the City of Surat and not in any
other part of the State.  Banning the manufacture of idols made of
Plaster of Paris in Surat  only,when no ban has been imposed in any
other part of the State, causes hostile discrimination to the
petitioners, as no restrictions on the manufacture of Idols of
Plaster of Paris  have been imposed on  similarly situated persons in
other parts of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_13">(g)	The
issuance of the impugned Notification is violative of the fundamental
rights of the petitioners under Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the
Constitution of India. The petitioners have a right to carry on their
occupation in any part of the country. There is no rationale or
reasonable basis for imposing this prohibition in the City of Surat
only. By preventing the petitioners from making idols, which is the
sole means of earning  their livelihood, there is a violation of 
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(h)	Though
the petitioners have been prohibited from manufacturing idols of
Plaster of Paris in Surat City, no restriction is imposed  upon
bringing such idols into the City  from outside, which goes against 
the very  object for which the Notification is purported to have 
been issued.
</p>
<p id="p_15">(i)	In
support of the above submissions, learned advocate for the
petitioners has placed reliance upon the following judgments:

	High 	Court) (Gwalior Bench).
</p>
<p id="p_17">5.	The
petition has been strongly opposed by Mr.P.K.Jani, learned Government
Pleader, appearing for respondents Nos.1,2 and 4, on the following
grounds:
</p>
<p id="p_18">(a)	
The Commissioner of Police has been empowered to issue a Notification
under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_11">Section 144</a> of the Code in certain situations, as mentioned in
the Section. In the present case, manufacture and immersion of idols
made of Plaster of Paris, painted with toxic colours, is likely to
cause danger to human life, health and safety. The power under
<a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_12">Section 144</a> is in the nature of an extraordinary power, used  to 
prevent something with immediate effect. It is  to be exercised where
a speedy remedy is  required to be resorted to.
</p>
<p id="p_19">(b)	
Pursuant to directions issued by the  High Court of judicature at
Bombay, the Central Pollution Control Board has framed Guidelines,
that have been circulated vide letter dated 28-06-2010, of the
Hon'ble Union Minister for Environment and Forests, to all State
Governments. In pursuance thereto, the Department of  Forests and
Environment, State of Gujarat has, by communication dated 26-07-2010,
circulated the Guidelines to local bodies and authorities throughout
the State, with  directions to ensure their strict implementation,
with a view to preventing pollution of water. In this background,the 
 Commissioner of Police, Surat City, has issued the impugned
Notification, after granting the petitioners and similarly situated
persons and stakeholders, an opportunity of hearing, and after
considering the representations made by them. The Notification has
been issued with a view to preventing pollution of the waters of the
River Tapi, and  resultant environmental pollution that occurs due to
immersion of a large number of idols. The immersion of  idols causes
danger to human life and health, in addition to being dangerous to
aquatic life. The  word "urgent" used in <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_13">Section 144</a>, has
to be understood in the context of the peculiar facts of the case.
The prohibitory order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_14">Section 144</a> of the Code is in consonance
with the spirit of the said provision. Had the said Notification not
been issued,there would  have been danger to human life and health,
therefore, the issuance of the Notification is absolutely justified,
and in doing so, respondent No.2 has not exceeded the jurisdiction
vested in  him by <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_15">Section 144</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(c)	The
petitioners have participated in the decision-making process, and
during the hearing given to them, they have agreed to discontinue the
use of  Plaster of Paris and toxic colours in preparation of the
idols. It is not open for the petitioners to challenge the
Notification, at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_21">(d)	The
Commissioner of Police has not permitted the manufacturers  of idols
of Plaster of Paris from outside the City of Surat to  bring such
idols into the City. The apprehension expressed by  the petitioners,
in this regard, is unfounded.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(e)	
No prohibition has been imposed on the manufacture of  idols. What
has been prohibited is manufacture of idols made of Plaster of Paris,
and the use of toxic paints. The activities of the petitioners have
been regulated, but not prohibited, and the said regulation does not 
constitute a violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioners
under Articles 14, 19(1)(g), and   21, of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_23">(f)	The
petitioners could have approached the State Government in  accordance
with the provisions of <a href="/doc/109001/" id="a_16">Section 144(6)</a> of the Code but did not choose
to  avail of this remedy, and have  invoked the extraordinary
jurisdiction of this Court straightaway, therefore, the petition may
be dismissed on the above grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_24">(g)	In
support of the above submissions, reliance has been placed upon the

</p><p id="p_26">6.	Mr.Kaushal
D.Pandya, learned advocate for  the Surat Municipal Corporation
(Respondent No.3) has submitted that the impugned Notification has
been issued after proper application of mind. As the jurisdiction of
respondent No.2 is restricted to Surat City, the said Notification
has been issued in the City of Surat only, therefore, the  grievance
of the petitioners regarding discrimination is without basis. It is
contended that the River Tapi is one of the largest rivers in the
State of Gujarat, and the number of idols immersed during religious
festivals is  huge. The respondent Corporation supplies  potable
water from the River Tapi to the  citizens of Surat City. The  water
from the River   is also used for irrigation and industrial purposes.
A weir-cum-causeway is constructed on  the Tapi River for this
purpose. The immersion of idols in the river causes water pollution
and health hazards to the citizens. Idols made of Plaster of Paris 
take a long  time to dissolve.   It is contended that due to the use
of  toxic and chemical colours for paining the idols, the TDS (Total
Dissolved Solid) level rises to alarming proportions when the idols
are immersed in the river. Not only  is the  water of the River Tapi 
 polluted, but the immersion of idols  adversely affects aquatic
life. It is emphasised that the Corporation is making efforts to 
contain environmental pollution, and for this purpose  22 spots,
divided into 5 Zones, have been identified for immersion of idols, 
and barrels are being put into place to demarcate the spots. The 
material for worship and 'Pooja', which is used during and after
immersion, can be collected in those spots, so as to contain
pollution.  The immersion of idols made of Plaster of Paris,  
painted with toxic colours,will  contaminate the water of the Tapi
River and  adversely affect the health of the citizens of Surat City,
therefore, respondent No.2 is justified in issuing the Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_27">6.1	It
is further submitted  by the learned advocate for respondent No.3,
that prior to issuance of  the Notification,  a meeting took place in
which the President of the Association of idol makers, Officers of
the Police Department and representatives of social organizations and
NGOs participated and there was  consensus regarding stopping the use
of Plaster of Paris for making idols. It is contended that the
petitioners cannot now challenge the Notification that has been
issued after hearing all concerned parties, and looking to the public
interest involved, the petition may be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_28">7.	Mr.Sunil
L.Mehta,learned advocate for respondent for Gujarat Pollution Control
Board (respondent No.5) has also supported the issuance of the
impugned Notification and has adopted the stand taken by the learned
Government Pleader and learned advocate for Respondent No.3. In
addition thereto, he has  submitted that the Guidelines of the
Central Pollution Control Board  have been communicated to the State
Pollution Control Board,  and have been further circulated by it to
all concerned authorities, throughout the State. It is contended that
a communication dated 12-07-2011 has been received by it from
respondent No.4 regarding the manner in which the idols should be
made, and the steps to be taken by the local authorities during
immersion of the idols, which has been sent to all concerned
authorities. The Notification has been issued in order to prevent 
pollution of the river and the environment, therefore, the Court may
not interfere.
</p>
<p id="p_29">8.	In
rejoinder, learned advocate for the petitioners has reiterated the
submissions advanced by him earlier. In addition, it has been
submitted that the Association of persons manufacturing   idols is
not a Registered one. The petitioners were not heard and have not
given their consent. The President of the said Association, who had
participated in the meeting held by respondent No.2 has later resiled
from the consent given by him, regarding discontinuation of the use
of Plaster of Paris in preparing the idols, and this has been
communicated to the said respondent. It is contented that, though the
petitioners have not approached the State Government under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/989759/" id="a_24">Section 114(6)</a>, they may not be relegated to this
course of action  at this stage, as it is a settled position of law
that a Notification under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_25">Section 144</a>, is amenable to the writ
jurisdiction of this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_30">9.	Having
heard the  learned counsel for the respective parties, and  in the
background of the submissions made by them, it would be relevant to
refer to the impugned Notification dated 16-07-2011, issued by the
Police Commissioner, Surat City. The   relevant portion thereof reads
as below:
</p>
<p id="p_31">		"Different
	religious festivals are celebrated every year in Surat city, during
	which idols of Gods and Goddesses are installed. These idols are,
	after a period  of time, immersed in the River Tapi by conducting
	religious rituals. The idols of Gods and Goddesses are made of
	Plaster of Paris, and chemical colours are used on them. Such idols
	are immersed in Rivers, ponds and the Sea. Idols made of Plaster of
	Paris  dissolve in the water and this results in the death of
	aquatic life, such as fish. Immersion and dissolution of the idols
	in the water causes damage to the environment and pollutes the
	water.  Keeping in mind these aspects, Surat Municipal Corporation, 
	social organizations and NGOs of Surat City have jointly undertaken 
	 the cause of cleaning the Tapi River and protecting the
	environment.  In order to prevent pollution of the environment and
	water, and in exercise of powers conferred under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_26">Section 144</a> of the
	Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, it is necessary to prohibit the
	following acts relating to making of idols of Gods and Goddesses for
	religious occasions:
</p>
<p id="p_32">				 Prohibited
Acts
 

 


 
	  

Idols
	should be made from natural material such as traditional clay, in
	accordance with religious tradition, and baked clay and Plaster of
	Paris should not be used.
</p>
<p id="p_33">Idols
	should be made in a manner that they  dissolve easily in water, and
	only non-toxic and  bio-degradable colours should be used for
	painting them.
</p>
<p id="p_34">While
	making the idols the use of grass, wood and bamboo is not excluded.
</p>
<p id="p_35">(4)The
	height of the idol should not exceed  9 ft.
</p>
<p id="p_36">(5)The
	places where the idols are made and the surrounding areas, should be
	kept clean.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">(6)</span>
<p id="p_37">	After sale of the idols, the unused idols and  broken parts of the
	idols, should not be left strewn around.
</p>
<p id="p_38">While
	making idols care should be taken that no signs or marks are put on
	them,  which may hurt the religious feelings of persons of other
	religions.
</p>
<p id="p_39">These
	prohibitions/Rules would be applicable to those persons who are
	bringing idols for sale from outside Surat City.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">									-0-</span>
<p id="p_40">10.	An
affidavit-in-reply has been filed on behalf of respondent No.2,
wherein it is stated that the Notification under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_27">Section 144</a> of the
Code has been issued by the Commissioner of Police, who has been
vested with power  of an Executive Magistrate, vide Notification
dated 07-01-1989, by the State Government, with a view to controlling
water and environmental pollution. It is  stated that the
Notification has been issued in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_28">Section 144</a>
of the Code, "to frame Rules  with respect to manufacturing
idols of Gods/Goddesses and laying foundation thereof in connection
with the celebration of religious festivals." It is further
stated that the said Notification has been issued with "a noble
cause". It is stated in the affidavit that the Notification in
question has been published after taking into consideration the
guiding principles set out in the Guidelines for immersion of Ganesh
idols issued by the Central Pollution Control Board. In addition, the
Government of Gujarat has also issued certain Guidelines, with
directions to the concerned authorities for their strict compliance.
It emerges from the affidavit, that the stand taken by respondent
No.2 is that, immersion of  idols made of Plaster of Paris, painted
with toxic or non-biodegradable colours in the Tapi River, causes
pollution of the river and the environment, which may harm the
public, therefore, the issuance of the Notification is justified, in
the public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_41">11.	In
the affidavit-in-reply filed by Surat Municipal Corporation, emphasis
has been laid upon the adverse environmental impact of idol immersion
on water bodies, by stating that the Corporation provides potable
water to the citizens of Surat City, and idols made of Plaster of
Paris take a long time in dissolving, adding to the hardness of the
TDS of water, which is likely to  cause health hazards to  the
citizens.
</p>
<p id="p_42">12.	In
the affidavit-in-reply filed on  behalf of respondent No.5-Gujarat
Pollution Control Board, emphasis is once again laid on the
Guidelines framed by the Central Pollution Control Board, as
communicated to all States, and the necessity of implementing the
same. The stand of the said respondent is the same as that of the
other respondents, that the immersion of idols of Gods and Goddesses
made of Plaster of Paris, painted with chemicals and
non-biodegradable colours, causes water pollution and damage to the
environment, necessitating the issuance of a Notification under
<a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_29">Section 144</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_43">13.	It
may be relevant to note that the High Court of Judicature at Bombay,
in its judgment in the matter of State of Maharashtra (PIL/W.P.(C)
No.1325/2003), issued certain directions to the Central Government
regarding immersion of idols.  Pursuant thereto,  the Central
Pollution Control Board framed Guidelines for Idol Immersion, in June
2010. These Guidelines are being heavily relied upon by the
respondents,  and have formed the basis for the issuance of the
impugned Notification. It would be relevant  to advert to the salient
features of the said Guidelines, which are reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_44">2.0
	Guidelines
	 

2.1
	General Guidelines for Idol Immersion.
</p>
<p id="p_45">Idols
	should be made from natural materials as described in the holy
	scripts. Use of traditional clay for idol making rather than baked
	clay, plaster of paris, etc. may be encouraged,allowed and promoted.
</p>
<p id="p_46">Painting
	of idols should be discouraged. In case idols are to be painted,
	water soluble and nontoxic natural dyes should be used. Use of toxic
	and non-biodegradable chemicals dyes for painting idols should be
	strictly prohibited.
</p>
<p id="p_47">Worship
	material like flowers, vastras (clothes), decorating material (made
	of paper and plastic) etc. should be removed before immersion of
	idols. Bio-degradable materials should be collected separately for
	recycling or composting. Non-biodegradable materials should be
	collected separately for disposal in sanitary landfills. Clothes may
	 be sent to local orphan house(s).
</p>
<p id="p_48">Public
	should be educated on ill effects of immersion in the holy water
	bodies through mass awareness programme.
</p>
<p id="p_49">The
	'Idol Immersion Points' shall be cordoned of and barricaded.
	Synthetic liner may be placed in the bottom, well in advance. The
	said liner shall be removed on completion of immersion ceremony so
	that remains of idols would be brought to the bank. Bamboo and
	wooden logs, if any would be reused. Clay, etc. may be taken to
	sanitary land fill for disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_50">General
	Guidelines for Local Bodies/Authorities:
</p>
<p id="p_51">Local
	bodies/District Authorities generally make efforts to identify
	adequate number of designated immersion spots to avoid overcrowding
	and also to reduce pollution load on water bodies, such spots need
	to be notified and public &amp; pooja committees be informed of such
	designated sites through awareness programme preferably a month
	before such events of idol immersion. All the stakeholders such as
	River Authority, Port Authority, Water Supply Board, Irrigation
	Department, etc be consulted for identification of the Immersion
	Ghats,where flow in stream is naturally available.
</p>
<p id="p_52">(ii)	A
	co-ordination Committee comprising Police, Non-governmental
	Organizations, Local Authorities, SPCBs, representatives of pooja
	committees and stakeholders may be set up for guiding the public in
	carrying out the immersion with minimal impact on water bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_53">(iii)	At
	the immersion sites, burning of solid wastes, so generated
	comprising of used flowers, clothes, decorating materials, etc.
	should be prohibited.
</p>
<p id="p_54">(iv)	Within
	48 hours of the immersion of idols, the left over material at idol
	immersion points on the banks of rivers, lakes, beaches, etc. should
	be collected by the local bodies for disposal as per point 2.1 (iii)
	above.	
</p>
<p id="p_55">(v)In
	case of immersion of idols in rivers and lakes, arrangement may be
	made for construction of temporary confined ponds with earthen bunds
	for the purpose of immersion of idols. After the completion of
	immersion, supernatant water may be allowed to flow in river, pond
	and lake, as the case may  be, after checking for colour and
	turbidity. Lime may be added in temporary confined ponds.
</p>
<p id="p_56">(vi)The
	Pooja organizers be involved in a campaign on the ill effects of the
	toxic components of coloring materials, not only of the idols, but
	also other decorating materials used during the festive season.
	Specific leaflets and poster for mass awareness may be prepared and
	the Pooja committees persuaded to be display such posters and
	distribute leaflets among worshipers.

	Guidelines for Idol Immersion in Rivers:
</p>
<p id="p_58">	Temporary
ponds having earthen bunds along river bank should be created as idol
immersion spots. Removable synthetic liner may be placed well in
advance in bottom of pond. The said liner along with remains of idols
should be removed from the point within 48 hours of immersion of
idols.
</p>
<p id="p_59">14.	Certain
recommendations have also been made which  form part of the
Guidelines. Those of some relevant to the matter in hand are
reproduced hereinbelow:
</p>
<p id="p_60">RECOMMENDATIONS:
</p>
<p id="p_61">A
	study to commissioned to quantify the amount of toxic metals that
	contaminate the nature through colours used for painting the idols,
	clearly specifying the compositions of all the colour materials used
	for the specific purpose. This study should also delineate the
	routing of the colours, i.e.,  the way the colours reach the
	artisans from the sources, i.e., the manufacturers.
</p>
<p id="p_62">(2)Discontinuation
	of the colours known commonly by "Yellow Puree Halka",
	"Yellow Puree Bhari". "Red Oxide" and "Red
	Lead" is to be aimed at through workshops with  artisan idol
	makers and the colour manufacturers. Target for this may be fixed as
	the season of idol making in year 2009, i.e., alternatives are to be
	set in place by August, 2009.

(4)	Keeping
	in view of the possible contamination of water bodies from lead
	laden paints via various sources other than immersion, it is felt
	that the problem should be dealt at source - i.e., within the
	paints themselves - in the long run. It is an admitted
	position as documented in the report that the use of lead has been
	almost fully restricted as per USEPA guideline as it is known to
	have highly disastrous impacts on people per se and children in
	particular and even an international expert committee - the
	Executive Committee of the International Conference on Lead
	Poisoning during a conference at Bangalore. India in November 1999
	in its 'Recommendations on National Policy and Implementation'- had
	recommended in this matter sometimes back. The central government
	should undertake appropriate steps in this matter and state
	environment department is requested to take up the matter with
	appropriate central government agencies. The respective detailed
	document is annexed herewith."
</p>
<p id="p_64">15.	Having
noticed the Guidelines, it would be fruitful to examine the legal
position as enunciated by the Supreme Court and some High Courts,
regarding the issuance of a Notification under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_30">Section 144</a> of the
Code.

	It
is  not disputed  before us that the power conferred under this
section is intended for immediate prevention of  breach of  peace or 
speedy remedy.  An order made under  this section  is to
remain valid for two months from the  date of  its making as
provided in sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_32">Section  144</a>. The proviso to  sub-s.
(4) authorises the State Government in  case it considers it 
necessary so to do for preventing danger  to human  life, health  or
safety, or for preventing a  riot or  any affray, to direct by
notification that an order made by a Magistrate may remain in
force for a further period not exceeding  six months  from the  date
on which the  order made  by the Magistrate would have, but for such
order, expired. The  effect of the proviso, therefore, is that	 the
State  Government would be entitled to give the prohibitory order  an
additional term of life but that would be limited  to six 
months beyond  the two months' period in terms of sub-section
(4) of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_33">Section 144</a> of the Code. Several decisions of different High

16.2		In
Wing Commander Utpal Barbara v. State of Assam (Supra),
a ban was imposed on the use of polythene bags on members of the
general public by the Magistrate acting under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_34">Section 144</a> of the Code
of Criminal Procedure.  The Gauhati High Court held as below:
</p>
<p id="p_70">	"15.
</p><p id="p_71">Keeping in mind the various decisions rendered by the Supreme Court
and the High Courts, the matter at hand has to be examined by this
Court. The reasons apparent on the face of the order are that the
unregulated disposal of the used polythene bags thrown into drains in
the city of Guwahati has blocked the normal flow of water causing
water logging and environmental pollution. It is a fact that the
polythene bags are in use throughout the country since a long time
and it cannot be construed as 'imminent danger' to the health and
hygiene of the people. The reasons given in the impugned
notification, in the opinion of this Court, do not appear to be a
sound logic for arriving at a conclusion that the unregulated manner
in which the polythene bags have been disposed of by the members of
the public has suddenly caused 'imminent danger' to the public health
and security. In my opinion, the remedy available to the district
administration or other authorities like Guwahati Municipal
Corporation lies in taking proper steps to regulate the use and
disposal of the polythene bags and not in imposing a total ban in its
use. If, however, the district administration or the State Government
considers that a total ban has to be imposed on the polythene bags,
they may do so by taking resort to appropriate legislation. In this
connection, we may refer to the Himachal Pradesh Non-Biodegradable
Garbage (Control) Act, 1995 and the Sikkim Non-Biodegradable
(Control) Act, 1997. Both the Himachal Pradesh Government as well as
the Sikkim Government enacted appropriate legislation to regulate the
disposal of non-biodegradable garbage in public drains and open
places. For that matter, it can be said that the State of Assam has
to enact appropriate law to obviate the possibility of any danger to
public health and hygiene.
</p>
<p id="p_72">16.	It
would further appear from the impugned order that the learned
Additional District Magistrate in the impugned order cited blockade
of the drains in the city of Guwahati as the main reason for 'issuing
the prohibitory order'. But this impugned order has been brought into
force throughout the territorial limit of the district of Kamrup
without proper justification. The application of this order beyond
the limit of Guwahati city in a flash of concern for public health
without recording adequate reasons does not inspire this Court to
accept it as just and proper.
</p>
<p id="p_73">17.	There
is no second opinion that anything that affects or is likely to
affect 'public health', 'hygiene' and tranquility has to be abhorred.
For that matter what is needed is proper study to identify those
objects and to plan ahead to obliterate those possible hazards before
they surface as a menace. To tide up such eventuality, necessary laws
will have to be enacted. Resort to temporary or emergency powers
under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_35">Section 144</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be a
permanent solution to those problems. Use of polythene bags
containing lead (toxic element) because of dye used as an ingredient
may be dealt with under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_36">Section 144</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
for a short period, but not in perpetuity. Moreover, this is not
included as one of the reasons in the impugned order. If the
recycling process is undertaking by any of the manufacturers in
violation of any law in force, the problem has to be dealt with under
that law only. The 'legislative intent' embodied in the language of
<a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_37">Section 144</a> and as has been explained by the Apex Court in the case
referred to herein before suggests that this power is available only
to meet an 'imminent situation'. This essential requirement is
missing in this case. Although this Court admires the rare flash of
concern for public health, the requirement of law cannot be lost
sight of. Considering all these aspects, this Court is of the opinion
that the 'satisfaction' arrived at by the learned Additional District
Magistrate in issuing the impugned order cannot be justified in the
given circumstances of this case. The order issued in exercise of
powers under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_38">Section 144</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_39">Cr.P.C</a>. being ex facie illegal has to be
set aside. The argument advanced by Shri P. Pathak, learned Addl.
Advocate General that the petitioners should have availed the
alternate remedy made available in Sub-section (7) of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_40">Section 144</a>,
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_41">Cr.P.C</a>. do not deserve any concession for the above reason."

<p id="p_74">16.3		In

the Magistrate ordered closure of an industrial Unit for two months
causing pollution on account of poisonous gas being emitted as

108 of 1987. This petition was filed against an order passed by the
Sub-Divisional Magistrate, who had refused to proceed under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_44"> the Code</a>

by the Magistrate is incorrect. In para 17 of the order this Court
observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_77">	"In
the ultimate analysis I find that in view of the <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_45">Special Act</a>s, the
learned S.D.M. was right in holding that he has no jurisdiction to
proceed with the matter which is in relation to acts which constitute
offences under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_46">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_47">Air Act</a>."
</p>
<p id="p_78">Accordingly,
I am of the view, that as a specific provisions exist in the
aforementioned <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_48">Central Act</a>s, the Additional District Magistrate was
not competent to pass an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_49">Section 144</a> of the Code."
</p>
<p id="p_79">17.	To
elucidate the legal position further, the judgments cited by the
learned Government Pleader, may now be examined.
</p>
<p id="p_80">17.1		In
the case of Babulal Parate v. The State of Maharashtra (Supra),
a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court rejected the challenge to the
constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_50">Section 144</a> of the Code. Regarding the
exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_51">Section 144</a>, this is what Their Lordships
have laid down:
</p>
<p id="p_81">	"(20)
It seems to us, however, that wide though the power  appears to
be, it can be exercised only in an emergency and for the purpose	
of preventing obstruction, annoyance or  injury  to any  person 
lawfully  employed, or danger  to human  life,health or   safety,  or
 a  disturbance  of the   public tranquility  or  a riot, or "
an affray ".  These  factors condition   the  exercise  of
the  power  and  it   would consequently  be  wrong to  regard  that 
power  as   being unlimited  or untrammeled.  Further, it should be
borne  in mind  that no one  has a right  to  cause 
"obstruction,annoyance  or injury etc., " to anyone. Since
the  judgment has  to be of a magistrate as to whether in  the 
particular circumstances  of  a  case an order, in exercise  of 
these powers,	 should be made or not, we are entitled  to  assume
that the powers will be exercised legitimately and honestly. The 
section  cannot be struck down on the ground  that	 the magistrate
may possibly abuse his powers."  (emphasis supplied)
 

 


 

17.2		<a href="/doc/496236/" id="a_52">In
Madhu Limaye v. Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Monghyr (Supra</a>)
a Bench  of seven Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court held as below:
</p>
<p id="p_82">	"24.The
 gist  of  action under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_53">Section 144</a> is  the  urgency  of	 the
situation,  its efficacy in the likelihood of being able  to
prevent some harmful occurrences.  As it is possible to act
absolutely and even exparte it is obvious that the emergency
must  be  sudden and the  consequences	sufficiently  grave. Without
it   the   exercise  of  power   would   have  no
justification.	 It  is not an ordinary power  flowing	from
administration but a power used in a judicial	 manner	and which  can
stand further judicial scrutiny in the  need	for the exercise
of the power, in its efficacy and in the extent of its application.
 There is no general proposition that an order  under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_54">section 144</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_55">
Criminal Procedure Code</a> cannot  be passed without taking evidence :
see Mst.  Jagrulia  Kumari v.  Chobey Narain Singh  which in our
opinion is  correct in  laying  down this proposition.  These 
fundamental  facts emerge from the way the occasions for the exercise
 of the power  are mentioned.  Disturbances of public  tranquility,
riots  and affray lead to subversion of public order  unless they 
are prevented in time.  Nuisances dangerous  to  human fife,  health 
or  safety have no doubt	 to  be abated	 and prevented.  We are,
however, not concerned with this part of the  section  and  the
validity of this	 part  need  not  be decided here. In so far as the
other parts of the  section are  concerned the key-note of the power
is to  free  society from  menace of serious disturbances of a  grave
 character. The section is directed against those who attempt to
prevent the exercise of legal  rights  by others or imperil the
public safety and health.  If  that  be so the matter must  fall
within the restrictions  which  the Constitution itself  visualises 
as permissible  in the interest of public order, or  in the interest 
of the general public.  We may say, however,that annoyance  must
assume sufficiently  grave  proportions  to bring the matter within
interests of public order."

<p id="p_83">17.3		<a href="/doc/177888/" id="a_56">In

specifically  lays down that the  order under this Section	 "may
be, directed to a particular individual or to the   public  generally

of orders mentioned  here are obviously intended only to prevent
dangers to life,  health, safety or peace and tranquility of members

<p id="p_85">17.4	In
the case of <a href="/doc/1203298/" id="a_60">Gulam Abbas v. State of U.P</a>.(supra),
the Supreme Court has dealt with the exercise
of power under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_61">Section 144</a> of the Code and the relevant extract of
the judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:
</p>
<p id="p_86">	"26.The
 entire  basis	 of  action  under  <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_62">Section  144</a>  is provided by  the
urgency  of the  situation  and  the  power thereunder is  intended
to  be availed	 of  for  preventing disorders, obstructions and
annoyances with a view to secure the public weal by maintaining
public peace and tranquility. Preservation of	the public  peace
and	tranquility  is the primary function  of the  Government and the
aforesaid power is conferred  on the  executive magistracy  enabling 
it  to perform that function effectively during emergent situations
and as such it  may  become  necessary for the  Executive Magistrate
to  over-ride temporarily private rights and in a given  situation  
the power  must  extend  to  restraining individuals from  doing acts
perfectly lawful in themselves, for, it is obvious that when there is
a conflict between the public interest  and private rights the former
must prevail. It is further well settled that the section  does not 
confer any  power  on  the  Executive Magistrate to  adjudicate or
decide disputes of civil nature or questions  of title	to properties
or  entitlements  to rights but  at the same time in cases  where 
such  disputes  or  titles	or entitlement  to   rights  have already
been adjudicated and have become  the subject-matter of judicial
pronouncements and  decrees of Civil Courts  of  competent
jurisdiction then in the exercise of his power under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_63">Section 144</a> he
must have  due regard to such established rights and subject	 of  
course to   the paramount  consideration  of maintenance of public
peace and tranquility the exercise of power must  be in  aid of those
rights and against those who interfere with the lawful exercise
thereof and even in cases where there  are no declared or established
rights the power should not be exercised in a manner that would give
material advantage to  one party to the dispute over the other but in
a fair manner ordinarily  in defence  of legal rights,  if there be
such and the lawful exercise thereof rather than in suppressing them.
 In other  words, the Magistrate's action should be  directed against
 the wrong-doer  rather than the wronged. Furthermore,  it would	not
be a proper exercise of discretion on  the  part  of  the  Executive 
Magistrate  to interfere with the lawful  exercise of the right by a
party on a  consideration that  those who  threaten to  interfere
constitute a  large majority and it would be more convenient for the
administration to impose restrictions which would affect only a minor
 section of  the community rather than prevent a larger section more
vociferous and militant."

Since the business of sale of lottery tickets is of a pernicious
nature, no person has a legal or a fundamental right in it. There is
good authority for the proposition that trade or business which is
noxious or pernicious in nature, is not covered under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_71">Article
19(1)(g)</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_72">21</a> of the Constitution. The Apex Court in M.J. Sivani
and others Vs. State of Karnataka,AIR 1995 SC 1770, was confronted
with the question as to whether regulation of video games violates
the fundamental right to trade or business or avocation guaranteed
under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_73">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_74">21</a> of the Constitution. In this regard it
held as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_94">"....No
one has inherent right to carry on a business which is injurious to
public interest. Trade or business attended with danger to the
community may be totally prohibited or be permitted subject to such
conditions or restrictions as would prevent the evils to the utmost.

...If

but its deprivation cannot be extended too far or projected or
stretched to the avocation, business or trade injurious to public

Therefore, regulation of video games or prohibition of some of video

<p id="p_112">19.	<a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_88">Section
144</a> of the Code appears in Chapter X, under the heading of
"Maintenance of Public Order and Tranquility". Chapter X
is divided into four parts. Part
</p><p id="p_113">-A, from <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_89">Section 129</a> to <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_90">132</a> pertains to "Unlawful assemblies".
Part-B, from <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_91">Section 133</a> to <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_92">143</a>, pertains to "Public
nuisances". Part-C, comprising of <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_93">Sections 144</a> and <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_94">144A</a>,
pertains to "Urgent
cases of nuisance or apprehended danger", and Part-D from
<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_95">Section 145</a> to <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_96">148</a> pertains to "Disputes as to immovable
property". As is seen from the Scheme of Chapter X of the Code,
<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_97">Section 144</a> is a remedy to deal with urgent cases of nuisance or
apprehended danger. It vests the competent authority with power to
issue orders in urgent
cases of "nuisance" or "apprehended danger".
Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_98">Section 144</a> provides that the District Magistrate,
Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially
empowered by the State Government in this behalf  (the Commissioner
of Police, Surat City, in the present case), in case where the
District Magistrate forms an opinion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding under the Section and immediate
prevention or speedy
remedy is desirable,  he
may make a written order
stating the material facts, to be served in the manner provided in
<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_99">Section 134</a>, directing any person to abstain from a certain act  with
respect to certain properties in his  possession or

to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance or injury to
any person lawfully employed "or
danger to human life, health or safety",
or a disturbance of the public tranquility, or a riot, or an affray.
For the purpose of this petition, the relevant aspect of Sub-section
(1) is the part dealing with danger to human life, health or safety. 
</p>
<p id="p_114">20.	The
consistent legal position emerging from the judgments referred to
herein-above,  is that the sine qua non for
making an order under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_100">Section 144</a> is urgency, requiring immediate and
speedy  intervention. An order under this Section is intended for
immediate prevention of the situations mentioned in Sub-section (1),
by way of a speedy remedy. Sub-Section (4) of <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_101">Section 144</a> provides
that no order made  under this Section shall remain in force for more
than two months from the making thereof. The proviso
thereto stipulates, that if the State Government considers it
necessary to do so for preventing danger to human life,health and
safety or for preventing a riot or any affray,it can direct that
an order made by the Magistrate under this Section shall remain in
force for such further period, not exceeding six months, from the
date on which the order made by the Magistrate would have, but
for such order, expired. Thus, an order made under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_102">Section 144</a> is
valid for two months, which period of time can, at the most, be
extended to six months, thereafter. The legislative intent appears to
be clear, that an order under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_103">Section 144</a>, by its very nature, is a
temporary one, and is to be issued in grave situations of imminent
danger and emergency. This principle of law is stated in  the
judgment of Babulal Parate
v. The State of Maharashtra (Supra), Madhu Limaye v. Sub-Divisional
Magistrate, Monghyr (Supra), Md.Gulam Abbas v. Md.
Ibrahim (Supra) and Gulam
Abbas v. State of U.P. (Supra).
</p><p id="p_115">A bare reading of the provisions of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_104">Section 144</a> of the Code, together
with the principles of law laid down in the above-quoted judgments,
leaves no manner of doubt that the power under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_105">Section 144</a> of the
Code is of a temporary
nature, to be exercised in urgent situations of imminent danger,
where immediate prevention and speedy remedy is required.
</p>
<p id="p_116">21.	It
would be appropriate to refer to the impugned Notification in light
of the legal position emerging from the judgments referred to above
and the provisions of <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_106">Section 144</a>. The Notification refers to the
celebration of  religious festivals in Surat City,   during which
idols of Gods and Goddesses are installed, and later immersed by the
public in the waters of the  Tapi River, amidst religious rituals. It
is stated in the Notification that these idols are made of Plaster of
Paris and are painted with chemical colours. Immersion of such idols
in rivers, ponds or the sea, results in pollution of water, causing
death of aquatic life and pollution of the environment. It is further
stated in the Notification, that the Surat Municipal Corporation,
other Social Organizations and NGOs, have undertaken the cause of
cleaning the Tapi River and protecting the environment. The
Notification has been issued under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_107">Section 144</a> of the Code in order
to prevent pollution of the water and the environment. The
Notification prohibits the manufacture of idols made of baked clay or
Plaster of Paris, use of toxic and non bio-degradable colours for
painting them. It also prohibits making of idols that exceed 9 ft. in
height.  It is stated that cleanliness should be maintained in the
area where the idols are made and after sale of the idols, the unused
idols and broken parts thereof should not be strewn. It is further
stated in the Notification that no such marks or signs should be made
on the idols, that may hurt the feelings of persons  professing other
religions. The above prohibitions had been made applicable to persons
bringing idols for sale from outside, into  Surat City. The impugned
Notification makes it clear, in no uncertain terms,  that the
intention behind its issuance is prevention of pollution of the river
waters and the environment, by imposing certain restrictions. The
affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of respondent No.2, who has issued
the Notification, further elaborates upon the intention behind
issuing the Notification. It is stated in the affidavit that the
Notification has been issued with a view to controlling water and
environmental pollution, in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_108">Section 144</a> of
the Code, "to frame Rule with respect to manufacture of idols
of Gods and Goddesses and their immersion during religious
festivals". In  addition thereto, it is stated that the
Notification has been issued with a "noble cause", after
taking into consideration the views of leading  persons of society,
representatives of Non-governmental Institutions and the President of
the Associations of Idol makers. The Guidelines framed by the Central
Pollution Control Board have also been referred to, and it is stated
that the Notification has been issued after taking into consideration
the guiding principles set out in the said Guidelines, and in the
letter dated 26-07-2010, addressed by the Principal Secretary,
Forests and Environment, Government of Gujarat, to various
authorities in the State, exhorting the said authorities to implement
the Guidelines strictly. A reading of the entire affidavit leaves no
manner of doubt that the impugned Notification has been issued to
enforce the Guidelines framed by the Central Pollution Control Board,
with a view to preventing pollution of water and the environment. 
</p>
<p id="p_117">22.	There
can be no two opinions that environmental pollution and contamination
of water bodies has assumed alarming proportions, and stringent
measures are required to be taken and mechanisms evolved by the
concerned Government and local authorities to tackle this problem.
Having said so, one cannot lose sight of the fact that pollution of
rivers or the environment is not a temporary phenomenon that appears
for a short duration like a flash of lightening, and suddenly
disappears. In the world in which we live today, with all the
technical and industrial advancements that have taken place,
pollution of rivers, water-bodies and the environment has become a
permanent problem. It is a deeply-rooted malady that requires to be
tackled at the source, in a systematic, co-ordinated, and
well-planned manner, by all concerned authorities. A permanent menace
such as environmental and water pollution calls for permanent
solutions, and not for temporary measures such as the issuance of a
Notification under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_109">Section 144</a> of the Code. In the instant case, the
cause is right but the remedy is not a correct one. The remedy under
<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_110">Section 144</a> is a short-lived one, with a life of two months which can
be stretched to a maximum limit of  six months, but not beyond that
period. As held by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/798012/" id="a_111">Acharya Jagdishwaranand
Avadhuta v. 	Commissioner of Police, Calcutta (Supra</a>), it is not
legitimate to go on making successive orders after earlier orders
have elapsed by efflux of time. The power under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_112">Section 144</a> cannot be
exercised in lieu of enactment of an appropriate legislation or
framing  rules, which course of action would address the issue of
water and environmental pollution in an appropriate and permanent
manner.
</p>
<p id="p_118">23.	It
is true that pollution of the water can result in adverse
consequences to the life and health of human beings, and it is
imperative that  clean, potable water is supplied to citizens for
drinking purposes.  However, these are the functions of the State,
local bodies and authorities. A duty is cast upon the State and local
authorities to ensure that the water bodies are not polluted so as to
endanger human life, health and safety. This duty is to be discharged
by taking effective measures, of a permanent nature, and by tackling
the menace of pollution at its source, after conducting proper
studies of its causes and the roles played by different players, at
different stages and levels, in contributing to pollution, be it of
the environment or of water bodies. Manufacture of idols made of
Plaster of Paris and their immersion in Rivers and water bodies, has
been prevalent for innumerable years, and is likely to continue as
long as people observe the rituals of their faith. It is, therefore,
not a temporary  phenomenon that has emerged suddenly, requiring a
speedy remedy of short duration. As stated by the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/798012/" id="a_113">Acharya Jagdishwaranand Avadhuta v. 	Commissioner of Police,
Calcutta (Supra</a>), the power conferred by <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_114">Section 144</a> is intended
for immediate prevention of breach of peace or speedy remedy. <a href="/doc/177888/" id="a_115">In  
Md.Gulam Abbas v. Md. Ibrahim (Supra</a>), it has been held by the
Supreme Court that orders under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_116">Section 144</a> are only temporary
orders. In Gulam Abbas v. State of U.P. (Supra),  the Apex
Court has reiterated that the power under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_117">Section 144</a> is to be
exercised during emergent situations. 
</p>
<p id="p_119">24.	It
is nowhere stated in the impugned Notification that it has been
issued in order to meet an urgent situation that is causing imminent
danger to human life, health or safety. Neither has it been stated
that the act of manufacture of idols made of Plaster of  Paris and
their immersion, is likely to give rise to an urgent situation of
"nuisance"  or "apprehended danger" for which
 a speedy, temporary remedy is required. The Notification has been
issued on the basis of the Guidelines framed by the Central Pollution
Control Board and the discussions held with the Surat Municipal
Corporation, NGOs and social organizations. Respondent No.2 has not
recorded his satisfaction that there are sufficient grounds for
issuing an order under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_118">Section 144</a> of the Code. The emergent
situation or urgency that has prompted action under this provision,
is also not reflected in the Notification. The impugned Notification
merely reiterates some of the Guidelines framed by the Central
Pollution Control Board. The power under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_119">Section 144</a> is not meant to
be used for enforcement of Guidelines, but to deal with urgent
situations.
</p>
<p id="p_120">25.
	The Guidelines, as reproduced hereinabove, are extremely detailed
and aim at tackling the issue of pollution in a multi-pronged and
systematic  manner. By the said Guidelines,  a duty has been cast
upon local bodies/authorities to identify  adequate number of
designated immersion spots, to avoid overcrowding, to reduce the load
of pollution on water bodies, to make arrangements for collection of
"pooja" materials at the immersion sites and to collect
left-over material at the idol immersion points, within 48 hours of
immersion of the idols. Guideline No.2.2(v) casts a duty upon the
local authorities to make arrangements for immersion, by constructing
temporary, confined, ponds with earthen bunds for the purpose of
immersion of idols. Guideline No.4 of Idol immersion states that  a
removable synthetic liner may be  placed, well in advance, at the
bottom of  pond so that the remains of the idols can be removed by
lifting the liners. Use of lime has been advised for dissolving idols
in the idol immersion ponds. It has been stated that the remnants be
removed from the site within 48 hours of immersion. The Guidelines
further speak of formation of Committees by local bodies/
authorities, comprising  Police, Non-Governmental Organizations, etc.
 to guide the public in carrying out the immersion, with  minimal
impact on the water bodies. The Guidelines further  state that idols
should be made of natural material, and use of baked clay of Plaster
of Paris should be avoided.  Painting of idols with toxic and non
bio-degradable dyes should be discontinued. Certain recommendations
have been made which form a part of the Guidelines. It has been
recommended that a study be commissioned to quantify the amount of
toxic metals that contaminate nature through colours used for
painting the idols, and that this study should delineate the routing
of the colours, that is, the way the colours reach the Artisans  from
the manufacturers. Discontinuation of colours, known as "Yellow
Puree Halka", "Yellow Puree Bhari", "Red
Oxide" and "Red lead" has been recommended by
holding workshops with Artisan idol makers and the colour
manufacturers. Emphasis has been laid upon the contamination of water
bodies from lead laden paints, via various sources other than
immersion, and it has been recommended that appropriate steps be
taken to redress the issue. As admitted by respondent No.2 in the
affidavit-in-reply, these Guidelines have formed the basis for the
issuance of the impugned Notification. As is seen from a perusal of
the Guidelines, they cast a duty of tackling the problem of
environmental and water pollution upon the local bodies and
authorities, in addition to involvement of social organizations and
NGOs. The Guidelines envisage a collective effort of local bodies and
Governmental authorities to tackle the problem of environmental and
water pollution caused by immersion of idols in the River, in order
to remove it from the source, in a permanent manner. 
</p>
<p id="p_121">26.	The
Guidelines form the very basis of the impugned Notification, and the
sole intent and purpose behind its issuance is the objective of
preventing pollution of water bodies, such as the River Tapi, and of
the environment, caused by idol immersion during religious festivals.
The scope of the Guidelines and the field covered by it is vast,
entailing a collective effort by all concerned authorities. A
Notification under <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_120">Section 144</a> cannot be the answer to the monumental
problem of water pollution. The concerned authorities and local
bodies cannot take shelter behind the Notification, instead of
performing the functions and discharging the duties cast upon them by
the Guidelines, such as making ponds with earthen bunds lined with
synthetic liners for immersion of idols, ensuring that idols are
immersed only at the identified sites, ponds, which will prevent
pollution of the river waters, and taking steps to remove the
remnants of idols within 48 hours of immersion. If implemented
strictly and seriously, these guidelines will go a long way in
preventing pollution of the river and environment. Needless to say,
that such measures can only be taken by the concerned authorities and
local bodies with prior planning, the remedy under  <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_121">Section 144</a> of
the Code is not meant to be used for such purposes. In my considered
view, the permanent and deeply-rooted malady of environmental and
water pollution can be eradicated by strong, systematic and lasting
solutions, that  trace the sources that cause   pollution, and evolve
measures to control, ban or regulate polluting substances or
materials, and create mechanisms in order to eradicate the problem
permanently. Constant vigilance and a coordinated effort will be
required, and it is clear from the legislative intent emerging from
<a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_122">Section 144</a> of the Code that the solution cannot be found by issuing
a Notification under this provision.
</p>
<p id="p_122">27.
	A submission has been made by the learned advocate for the
petitioners that the issuance of the impugned Notification violates
the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Articles 14, 19 and
21 of the Constitution of India and discriminates against the
petitioners. Insofar as the question of discrimination is concerned,
it is relevant to  note that respondent No.2 has issued the
Notification for Surat City only, for the simple reason that his
jurisdiction does not extend to cities in other Districts of the
State. The Notification imposes restrictions on idols being brought
into  Surat City from outside.  The plea of discrimination against
the petitioners is, therefore, not well founded. As regards the plea
that the fundamental rights of the petitioners under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_123">Article 19(1)(g)</a>
of the Constitution of India have been violated by restricting them
from carrying on their occupation, trade or business, it deserves to
be noted that the impugned Notification does not prohibit the
manufacture of idols per se, but only prohibits the manufacture of
idols made of Plaster of Paris. The petitioners have not been
prohibited from carrying on their occupation of making idols,
however, certain restrictions and regulations have been imposed
regarding the material to be used for making them, which does not
constitute a violation of their fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_124">Article
19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India. Similarly, there is no
discernible violation of the fundamental rights of  the petitioners,
as enshrined under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_125">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_123">28.	It
has been urged by the learned Government Pleader that the word
"urgent", mentioned in <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_126">Section 144</a> of the Code should be
read in the context of the facts of the particular case, and in the
present case, the manufacture and immersion of idols made of Plaster
of Paris and painted with toxic colours, would endanger human life
and health, making the situation an urgent one.  Emphasis has been
laid on a judgment of the High Court of Delhi in Akhil Bhartiya
Sarkari Lottery Vyapari Mahasangh v. Commissioner of Police (Supra)
by submitting that, in the said case the High Court of Delhi had
upheld the Notification under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_127">Section 144</a> of the Code, banning the
sale of lottery tickets on the ground that the said action is noxious
or pernicious in nature, therefore, not covered under Articles
19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India. In the present case,
the manufacture  of idols of Plaster of Paris, cannot be said to be 
"noxious" or "pernicious" as a whole. Sale of
lottery tickets cannot be compared with pollution of water and the
environment. The said judgment,  rendered on its own facts, would not
be relevant in the present case. 
</p>
<p id="p_124">29.	
There can be no doubt that anything that is likely to adversely
affect public health or endanger human life has to be dealt with 
appropriately. As already stated hereinabove, the correct approach
would be  for the local bodies/authorities and the State Government
to undertake a proper study in order to identify the substances and
materials that cause pollution, such as toxic paints and prevent them
from  reaching the Artisans from the source. The Guidelines issued by
the Central Pollution Control Board, if  implemented strictly by the
concerned authorities, would have lasting effect and would go a long
way in  containing and eradicating the problem of pollution of water
bodies and the environment. Pollution is a permanent problem, that
cannot be dealt with by resorting to temporary solutions, such as
exercise of a Notification under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_128">Section 144</a> of the Code. 
</p>
<p id="p_125">30.	The
impugned Notification does not state that respondent No.2 has formed
an opinion that there are sufficient grounds for exercise of power
under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_129">Section 144</a> of the Code, or that an urgent situation has
arisen, of a nature demanding immediate prevention by way of a speedy
remedy, warranting a conclusion that use of Plaster of Paris in
preparation of idols of Gods and Goddesses and their immersion in
Rivers and other water bodies has resulted in imminent danger to
human life, health and safety. 
</p>
<p id="p_126">31.	The
cumulative effect of the above discussion leads to the conclusion
that no urgent situation, as envisaged by the provisions of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_130">Section
144</a>  of the Code, is reflected in the impugned Notification dated
16-07-2011, so as to justify exercise of power under the said
provision of law. The impugned Notification cannot be sustained in
law.
</p>
<p id="p_127">32.	For
 the aforestated reasons, the petition is allowed. The impugned
Notification dated 16-07-2011 is quashed and set aside.  Rule is made
absolute. No order as to costs.
