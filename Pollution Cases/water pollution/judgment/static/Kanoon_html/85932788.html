<p id="p_2">                    This application is directed against the impugned order

              no. 306 dated 11.05.2012 issued by the respondent no. 4,

              Assistant District Mining Officer, Latehar whereby he has

              expressed his inability to issue the transport challan in favour

              of the petitioners in absence of Environmental Clearance

              Certificate from the Department of Pollution Control Board.

              The petitioners have also sought direction upon the Pollution

              Control Board to issue N.O.C. under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the

              Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

              under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention of Control and

              <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and in the meantime petitioners have also

              sought for issuance of the transport challan in favour of these

              nine petitioners in the present writ petition.

</p><p id="p_3">                    According to the petitioners, they had been granted

              mining lease for the major minerals and deeds of lease have

              also been executed by the State Government for different

              period. They were carrying mining activities     and extracted

              concerned minerals from mines and transported on the basis

              of transport challan issued from time to time by the
                  W.P. (C) No. 923 of 2013
respondent-Office of District Mining Officer. Learned counsel

for the petitioners submits that the applications were made

for grant of issuance of N.O.C. before the Pollution Control

Board. It is also submitted that the applications for renewal of

lease    have been made by the petitioners within stipulated

time after its expiry, which are still pending before the

Competent Authority, therefore, in the meantime, they are

entitled   to   continue   their   mining   activities   during   the

pendency of the renewal application of lease. However,

because of the order passed by the Assistant Mining Officer,

all the activities relating to transport of the excavated mineral

is being suddenly interrupted.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             The respondent-Pollution Control Board, on the

other hand, in their counter affidavit have taken stand that in

terms of the provisions of Environmental Protection Act and

notification issued thereunder, each one of these petitioners

have been directed to obtain environmental clearance from

the Competent Authority at the time of renewal of their

mining lease. It is, therefore, submitted that mining operation

without N.O.C., consent to operate from State Pollution

Control Board and without obtaining environmental clearance

by the competent authority, is not permissible in law.

</p><p id="p_5">        Learned counsel for the Board has drawn attention upon

the applicability of the EIA Notification, 1994 whereunder in

respect of Mining Project of major minerals having more than

5 hectares lease hold area, at the time of renewal of lease, the

environmental clearance is mandatory            in terms     of the

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court delivered in the case

of M.C. Mehta Versus Union of India and Others. In that

view of the matter, the respondent-Pollution Control Board
                 W.P. (C) No. 923 of 2013
submits that the petitioners cannot claim to operate mining

activities or insist for their transportation in absence of

compliance of the mandatory requirement of law.

</p><p id="p_6">       The respondent-State, on the other hand, also appeared

and filed their counter affidavit in which the similar stand has

been taken on their behalf that in absence of environmental

clearance certificate, before renewal of the mining lease,

which are pending before the respondent-authorities, the

petitioners are not entitled to transport the mining mineral,

which is contrary to the requirement of law under the various

environmental laws as also the direction of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. Learned counsel for the State also submits

that   in these circumstances, the District Mining Officers

concerned have been directed not to issue mining transport

challan in favour of these persons, who have not obtained

environmental clearance certificate and also have not been

granted NOC from the State Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_7">       The petitioners, on the other hand, have stated that

these mineral have been mined before the expiry of the mining

lease and are lying in their custody, which need to be

transported and, therefore, precondition of the environmental

clearance for transportation of excavated mineral, is not

mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       Learned counsel for the petitioners, however, submitted

that they are in process to approach before the Competent

Authority under the Ministry of Environment and Forest for

seeking environmental clearance certificate. Learned counsel

for the petitioners also submits that in similar circumstances,

Madhaya Pradesh High Court has directed the authorities to

issue transport challan for removing the extracted minerals.
</p><p id="p_9">                   W.P. (C) No. 923 of 2013
       I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have

gone through the relevant materials on record. In the instant

case, the mining lease of nine petitioners for major minerals

have already expired and they have made application for

renewal of their mining lease before the Competent Authority.

From perusal of Annexure-4 of the writ petition itself, it

appears that area granted for mining lease in respect of

individual petitioners are beyond five hectares where the

competent authority is the Ministry of Environment and Forest

and which has the jurisdiction to grant environmental

clearance in respect of mining lease beyond five hectares of

area. These petitioners, however, have claimed that they need

to transport their excavated minerals from the mining area in

question, which were already excavated under lease granted

to them. However, it is requirement of the provisions of

notification issued under the Environmental Protection Act,

1986 that for all mining project of major minerals more than

five   hectares   lease   area,    for   renewal   of    their   lease,

environmental clearance is mandatory and as of now these

petitioners have not obtained environmental clearance from

the competent authority of the Ministry of Environmental and

Forest. In these circumstances, the request made by the

petitioners for grant of transport challan before complying

with precondition of obtaining mandatory environmental

clearance certificate, NOC from the competent authority

with consent to operate from the State Pollution Control

Board is not based on subsisting legal right to transport

mineral which is said to be excavated on their behalf before

the expiry of the mining lease. At the moment the mining lease

have    admittedly   expired      and    thereafter,    environmental
                             W.P. (C) No. 923 of 2013
           clearance certificate has not been taken at the time of

           application for renewal of permanent lease. The order relied

           upon by the the petitioner is only an interim order passed by

           the Madhya Pradesh High Court. In the present facts of the

           case, it is not practically              possible to direct the respondent-

           authorities to ascertain whether the excavated mineral were

           extracted at the relevant point of time when the original lease

           was existing or not or thereafter. Therefore, the prayer made

           in the instant writ petition for directing the respondent to

           issue transport challan             cannot be accepted. The petitioners

           will   have    to     obtain    necessary          environmental    clearance

           certificate from the competent authority as also NOC with

           consent to operate mining lease from the Pollution Control

           Board before they can lawfully operate the mines in question

           in respect of which the renewal application, is still pending

           before the competent authority. In these circumstances, I do

           not find any reason to interfere in the writ petition. However,

           it will be open to the petitioners to approach competent

           authorities     for    grant        of    such     Environmental    Clearance

           Certificate as also NOC that are mandatory requirement of

           law in respect of the mining lease in question. If such

           application is made before the competent authority for

           seeking environmental clearance certificate then he may

           consider      the     same     in    accordance       with   law    withing   a

           reasonable time.

<p id="p_10">                    However        for     the        facts    and   reasons    rendered

           hereinabove, this writ petition is, dismissed.
