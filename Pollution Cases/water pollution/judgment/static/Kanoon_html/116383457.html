<p id="p_1">    These  batch   of  writ  petitions  are  filed   by

petroleum dealers, prospective petroleum dealers and

also federation of the dealers named the All Kerala

Federation of Petroleum Traders, challenging insistence

of consent of the Pollution Control Board (PCB) to

establish or operate petroleum outlets.

</p><p id="p_2">    2.   In exercise of powers conferred by <a href="/doc/850762/" id="a_1">Section 64</a>

of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 the Government of Kerala in consultation with the

State  Pollution   Control   Board  promulgated   Water

(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules 1976. In

the Rules, industries are categorised into Red, Orange

and Green based on pollution potential. Among the list

W.P.(C).No.5625/2012 and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             -:2:-</span>

against    Orange    category,     entry  26   is  related  to

petroleum    products/crude      oil    storage  and  transfer

excluding     cross-country       pipeline.      The   Central

Pollution     Control      Board     issued   guidelines   for

Management of Consent and Authorisation to be followed

by all the PCBs in the States.          As per clause 10(1) of

the guidelines, consent of the PCB has to be obtained

for industries categorised in red, orange and green

categories.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.    The Board in its meeting held with the major

petroleum    products     company    decided   to  direct  the

petroleum company that all their dealers should have

clearance from PCB.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.    In    W.P.(C).No.13835/2012,      a   communication

issued by the Chairman of PCB to the All Kerala

Federation of Petroleum Traders is produced.              This

communication (Ext.P2) insist that all dealers shall

obtain consent.      It is aggrieved by insistence of such

consent, these writ petitions are filed by the writ

petitioners.       There are two fold challenge against

W.P.(C).No.5625/2012 and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             -:3:-</span>

insistence of consent.        First challenge is that dealer

is  not    the   owner   of   petroleum  retail  outlet and

therefore, the responsibility is on the oil company to

provide such mechanism in the dealer's outlet and cost

has to be borne by the company themselves.            Second

ground of challenge is that no pollution is caused by

operation of petroleum outlets and therefore, without

conducting any study regarding pollution, insistence of

consent by PCB amounts to infringement of their right

to carry business.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     5.    The dealers' case is that they are operating

the petroleum retail outlets on commission basis and

they have no legal ownership on the outlets to cast

liability upon them other than operating outlets based

on the commission basis.        It is further submitted that

outlets belong to company and the company is free to

cancel the dealership.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     6.    Whatever may be the relationship between the

company and dealers, in law an occupier of premises has

a responsibility. This responsibility cast a liability

W.P.(C).No.5625/2012 and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             -:4:-</span>

on him for any omission or commission arising out of

that responsibility for control of mischief.            The

liability in law is not based on the legal interest

such as title, possession etc. over the property.        On

the other hand, liability is based on the duty owed to

control the mischief.         Therefore, any person who has

control over the premises is legally liable to comply

with any norms prescribed by the PCB.         The effort of

PCB is to prevent occurring of any mischief on account

of operation of activities in the premises.             The

consent    is   insisted    to   prevent pollution.   This,

obviously, is intended to protect the life of others,

who may otherwise will be affected based on escape of

mischief.     Thus, every dealer whatever may be their

relationship with the oil company, they are bound to

obtain consent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     7.    The learned Senior Counsel Shri K.Jaju Babu

appearing for the petitioners in W.P.(C).No.13835/2012

submits that if at all they are required to comply with

W.P.(C).No.5625/2012 and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             -:5:-</span>

the directions in regard to obtain consent of the

Board, the costs shall be borne by the Oil Company.

</p><p id="p_8">     8.    I am of the view that the dealers are free to

take up the matter with the company in appropriate

manner for claiming reimbursement of costs.

</p><p id="p_9">     9.    The other challenge in the writ petitions is

that no pollution is caused by the operation of the

petroleum outlet.        There is no dispute in regard to

classifying petroleum products as an industry of orange

category.      In the absence of any challenge regarding

classification     of   petroleum     products as an  orange

category industry in the Water (Prevention and Control

of    Pollution)      Rules,      1976   this  argument  is

unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     10. In view of the above, these writ petitions are

disposed as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_11">     i)    The dealers shall be given at least three

months time to comply with direction of PCB to obtain

the consent.
</p>
<p id="p_12">W.P.(C).No.5625/2012 and connected cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             -:6:-</span>
</p><p id="p_13">     ii) If any of the dealers make a request for

reimbursement, such request shall be considered by the

oil company within two months from the date of such

request.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     No costs.
