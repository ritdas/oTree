             of 2012 have been transferred to this Tribunal by Hon'ble High

             Court of Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad and thereafter have

             been registered as Applications. Both these Applications involve

             common issues related to pollution caused due to Brick kilns,

             environmental impacts of brick kilns and operating the Brick

             Kilns       without         necessary          permissions           from   regulatory

             authorities, including MPCB. For the sake of clarity, facts in

             both these cases have been separately narrated before outlining

             the Issues to be decided in these Applications.

             2013 seeking prohibitory injunction against Respondent No.7

             Sitabai from running brick-kiln in agricultural land bearing Gat

             Karajgaon          under        Newasa         Tahsil   (District       Ahmednagar).

             Incidentally, he also challenged order dated 5th December 2012

             issued by Tahsildar, Newasa, whereby Respondent No.7 Sitabai

             was permitted to run the brick-kiln in the said agricultural land.

</p><p id="p_3">              3.              The above Writ Petition was transferred to this

             Tribunal by Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Bench

             at Aurangabad by order dated October 01st, 2013.                Afresh

             notices were issued thereafter. The pleadings were completed.

             The matter was thereafter heard on merits.

<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">             4.             Briefly stated, case of Applicant Sonyabapu is that

             Respondent No.7 Sitabai is running a brick-kiln in agricultural

             land bearing Gat No.51/2A, situated at village Karajgaon,

             without obtaining valid permission of competent authority, in

             defiance of the statutory provisions. His father had filed Writ

             Petition No.2854 of 2005 in the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay,

             seeking relief against the illegal activities of running brick-kiln

             by Respondent No.7 Sitabai. That Writ Petition was, however,

             disposed of in view of statement made by Learned A.G.P. to the

             effect that the District Collector will take appropriate action

             against Respondent No.7 Sitabai if the brick-kiln is found to be

             illegal and being run without necessary permission. Still,

             however, no action was taken till the date.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">             5.             Applicant Sonyabapu gave account of civil dispute

             which was raised by filing a suit (R.C.S.No.27 of 2005) by

             Respondent No.7 Sitabai against him in the Court of Learned

             Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) Newasa for prohibitory injunction. By filing

             such a suit, she sought permanent injunction restraining him

             from interfering into her lawful possession over the suit

             property, namely, land bearing Gat No.51/2A. The suit was

(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)   N.G.T.(WZ)       5
              decreed by the Civil Court vide its judgment and decree dated

             23rd January 2009.                Feeling aggrieved, Applicant Sonyabapu

             preferred an Appeal (R.C.A.No.14 of 2009) in the District Court,

             Shrirampur. He also sought stay to the injunction decree. An

             exparte stay order was granted by the District Court against the

             exparte order of stay, Respondent No.7 Sitabai has preferred

             Writ Petition No.5142 of 2012 in the Hon'ble High Court of

             Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad.                       That Writ Petition is still

             pending.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">             6.              According to Applicant Sonyabapu, he made various

             complaints against illegal activities of Respondent No.7 Sitabai.

             By communication dated 29th June 2009, the TahsildarNewasa

             informed him that Respondent No.7 has not obtained any

             permission from the District Health Officer or Zilla Parishad

             Ahmednagar or Gram Panchyat Karajgaon for running of the

             brick-kiln. He alleges that on enquiry, he came to know that

             the Gram Panchyat office of village Karajgaon did not issue "No

             Objection Certificate (NOC)" to Respondent No.7 Sitabai for

             running of the brick-kiln.                  He gathered information that the

             Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has not granted

             any permission to Respondent No.7 Sitabai for running of the

             brick-kiln.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">             7.           It is the case of Applicant Sonyabapu that as per the

             guidelines of the MPCB, set-out vide communication dated 18th

             February 1997, no brick-kiln can be permitted within distance

(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)     N.G.T.(WZ)             6
              of 500 meters from residential premises or a public road. The

             brick-kiln of Respondent No.7 Sitabai is being run illegally in as

             much as it is at a distance of about 120 ft. from the nearby

             public road.           Thus, it is being operated in violation of the

             guidelines issued by the MPCB. Further, the brick-kiln is being

             run without payment of royalty to the Government for the stock

             of earth (soil) that was being used for manufacturing of the

             bricks.       Therefore, on 24th February 2012, Respondent No.7

             Sitabai was directed to pay a fine of Rs.25,000/- for illegally

             transporting of the earth (soil) without payment of royalty, as

             per the communication issued by the Tahsildar, Newasa.

             Though, previously the Tahsildar had prohibited Respondent

             No.7 Sitabai from running of the brick-kiln by an order dated

             13th June 2012, yet subsequently by impugned order dated 5 th

             December 2012, the said prohibitory order was re-called and

             declamped.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">             8.             According to Applicant Sonyabapu, brick-kiln of

             Respondent No.7 Sitabai is surrounded by residential houses of

             300 to 400 inhabitants. The life and health of the inhabitants

             residing around the brick-kiln is endangered due to the

             pollution caused on account of running of the brick-kiln by

             Respondent no.7 Sitabai.                    The Air Pollution caused due to

             smoke emanating from the brick-kiln has also damaged the

             crops in the surrounding area. The authorities have failed to

             take suitable action against Respondent No.7 Sitabai in spite of


(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)     N.G.T.(WZ)          7
              various complaints made by him and other inhabitants of the

             locality.       His right to life and right to enjoy pollution-free

             atmosphere is violated due to running of the brick-kiln by

             Respondent No.7 Sitabai. It is necessary to shut down the illegal

             brick-kiln in order to protect his life as well as life of other

             inhabitants of the locality as per protection available under

             <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is in the wake of these

             background facts that he approached the Hon'ble High Court

             Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad by filing of the Writ Petition

             which has been transferred to this Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">             9.             By filing reply-Affidavit, Arun Ujagare, Tahsildar

             Newasa resisted the Application on behalf of Respondent Nos. 1

             to 5. All the material allegations of Applicant Sonyabapu are

             denied by him. He submitted that the earlier order dated 13th

             June 2012 was recalled by impugned order dated 5-12-2012 in

             view of subsequent developments.                   He contended that since

             Respondent No.7 Sitabai was granted prohibitory decree by the

             Civil Court, as a result thereof the earlier communication was

             recalled. His response in the matter is, however, of no much

             importance.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">             10.             On behalf of the Respondent Nos.2 and 3, the

             Regional Officer, Shri. Ankush Fulse, filed reply affidavit. In his

             affidavit, he explained that the MPCB, is not the Authority to

             grant Consent to establish for the bricks Kilns and the same are

             being regulated by the Revenue Department, the Govt. of

(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)    N.G.T.(WZ)          8
              Maharashtra till the date. His affidavit is to the effect that the

             role of MPCB, is limited to the extent of monitoring air emissions

             and to look into the complaints of air pollution, in respect of the

             bricks kiln activities. The affidavit shows that the emissions in

             respect of impugned brick kiln were found to be normal during

             the course of monitoring of ambient air quality, as conducted in

             pursuance to the communication of the District Collector,

             Ahmednagar, in June, 2006. The affidavit of Shri.Ankush Fulse,

             is to the effect that the impugned brick kiln is adjacent to the

             road and is situated at a distance of about 100 mtrs from the

             road. The affidavit further shows that the brick kiln of

             Respondent No.7, Sitabai, is approximately 2 km away from the

             village locality of Karajgaon and is about 2 km away from the

             river 'Mula'. So also, it is about 250-300 mts away from the

             residential house of the Applicant-Sonyabapu. The brick kiln

             was found closed w.e.f. 7th June, 2013. The affidavit shows that

             the     brick      kiln     is    an     old       type   (traditionally   used)   for

             manufacturing of bricks at the countryside and is called

             'Çhamp Bhatti'.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">             11.             The stance of the Respondent Nos.2 and 3, is that

             they are not the Authorities for granting permission/licence for

             the brick kilns and particularly, traditional type Clamp brick

             kilns run at the countryside.

<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">             12.              By filing her reply affidavit, Respondent No.7,

             Sitabai, resisted the Application. She is the main contesting

(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)          N.G.T.(WZ)                9
              party to the Application. According to her, the bricks kiln is

             being run since 1988, in traditional way. She submits that she

             is a Potter by caste and it is her family business to deal in

             manufacturing of the bricks. She narrated that she has

             obtained necessary permission for Non-Agricultural use (NA-

             permission) issued by the Revenue Authority for converting land

             Gat No.51/2A for Non-Agricultural use. She claims to have

             purchased the said land Gat No.51/2A, from its previous owner

             for valuable consideration. According to her, as per Notification

             of the Revenue and Forest department, the traditional Potter is

             permitted to remove earth, stone and murum up to the extent

             of 500 brass, from the bed of the Sea or from the bed of any

             creek, river and Nallas, in accordance with the Rules under the

             Mines and <a href="/doc/47147010/" id="a_2">Mineral Regulation (Development) Act</a>, 1957. She

             claims, however, to have paid royalty for procurement of the

             sand and the earth, for manufacturing of the bricks. According

             to her the bricks kiln, is being run without causing any pollution

             to the nearby area. Her case is that she had filed a suit bearing

             RCS No.27 of 2005, for perpetual injunction against the

             Applicant and sought injunction restraining the Applicant from

             running the bricks kiln business. She submits that the suit has

             been decreed and, therefore, the Applicant has filed various

             complaints including the present Application. She denied that

             the bricks kiln is being run without any lawful permission. She

             further denied that the bricks kiln is being run against the


(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)   N.G.T.(WZ)   10
              settled parameters, as per the guidelines of the MPCB. Her

             contentions is that though the bricks kiln does not cause any

             air pollution and violation of environmental norms, yet the

             Applicant has filed false Application with a view to harass her.

             Hence, she sought dismissal of the Application.


</p><p id="p_22">             13.             No other response was filed by any other party. Nor

             we think that it is necessary to insist for calling any such

             response from them.

<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">             14.             Before we proceed to consider the contentious Issues,

             let be it noted that the parties have already gone through one

             round of civil litigation. A suit bearing RCS No.27 of 2005, was

             filed by the Respondent No.7, Sitabai, against Applicant

             Sonyabapu for prohibitory injunction. The Civil Judge, Newasa,

             decreed that suit. It may be mentioned here that the Ld. Civil

             Judge, considered the question of lawful possession of

             Respondent No.7, Sitabai, over land Gat No.51/2A, in that suit.

             The decree in that suit, in fact, has no bearing in the context of

             the present Application. The subject matter of the present

             Application is the threat to the environment, which is caused,

             or likely to be caused due to running of the bricks kiln,

             particularly, due to the air pollutants discharged therefrom. The

             real question is whether any standards are prescribed for the

             traditional brick kilns called 'Çlamp (Country type) brick kilns'.

             Another important question is, whether the MPCB is licencing

             authority, under any rules for such kind of Bricks Industry. For,

(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)   N.G.T.(WZ)     11
              the chief bone of contention raised by the Applicant is that the

             bricks kiln, is being run against the settled environmental

             norms and particularly the guidelines of the MPCB.


</p><p id="p_25">             15.             Learned Counsel for Respondent No.7 Sitabai argued

             that air quality Report of the MPCB was found to be as per

             prescribed standard when the samples were collected and

             examined. He referred to MPCB report dated 12-11-2006. The

             samples were collected on 7-1-2006. The report shows that the

             brick-kiln is located at a distance 2 k.m. from the village

             Karajgaon and is run seasonally for 5 months per year. The

             Report further shows that the fuel used is coal of 3 to 4 M.T.

             p.m. The proposal of renewal for licence was found pending with

             the Tahsildar. There was no Chimni fixed on brick-kiln. The

             report shows that there was no fugitive emission around the

             area. This report runs contrary to the Enquiry Report submitted

             by the Tahsildar, Newasa vide communication dated 29-2-2009.

             Moreover, the report pertaining to the samples collected in the

             month of January 2006 has hardly any bearing on the juxta

             position for the subsequent period.                  We have perused the

             photographs placed on record. We have also the perused the

             copies of challans filed by Respondent No.7 Sitabai. It appears,

             no doubt, that Respondent No.7 Sitabai has paid royalty for

             extraction of sand in order to run the brick-kiln. She has not

             however, placed on record any valid permission granted in her

             favour to run the brick-kiln.</p><pre id="pre_2">

              16.             We      may       mention          at   this   juncture    that   by

</pre><p id="p_26">             communication dated 06-05-2012 bearing Tahsil/Jamin/31-

             12, Tahsildar, Newasa directed Respondent No.7 Sitabai to close

             down the brick-kiln for the reason that the smoke emanating

             therefrom was causing nuisance to the inhabitants of the

             vicinity. The said communication further shows that the policy

             of the MPCB was that no permission should be granted to such

             old type Clamp (traditional) brick-kilns. Thus, it is amply clear

             that closure of said brick-kiln was ordered due to the fact that

             it was found to be nuisance to the residents of the vicinity due

             to the smoke which was found emanating there from. There is

             no substantial reason to deviate from such observations shown

             in the communication issued by the Tahsildar.


</p><p id="p_27">             17.             What appears from impugned communication dated

             05-12-2012 (Ex-N) is that the Tahsildar, Newasa had withdrawn

             the earlier communication because the suit bearing R.C.S.No.

             27/2005 was decreed and though the interim order was

             challenged, yet, the Tahsildar was not made a party in the suit

             as well as in Writ Petition No. 9131/2012.                                Obviously,

             withdrawal          the previous communication was for extraneous

             reasons unconcerned with issue of environment and based

             upon the decree which was passed in the Civil Suit bearing

             R.C.S.No.27/2005. As stated before, the subject matter of that

             suit was the question of lawful possession claimed by

             Respondent No.7 Sitabai over land Gat No.51/2A and had no

              relation with the question of environmental damage caused due

             to running of the brick-kiln in that land. Needless to say, the

             issues involved in the earlier suit and the present Application

             are quite distinct in nature.

             FACTS OF APPLICATION NO.36 (THC) OF 2013



</p><p id="p_39">             20.            The Writ Petition No.9855 of 2012, was transferred to

             this Tribunal by the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at

             Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad vide its order dated 20th

             September, 2013. This Application has been filed by the

             Applicant claiming that brick kilns operated by the Respondent

             Nos.5 and 6, have posed a serious issue of pollution and health

             hazard in the surrounding area and also ambient temperature

             has increased in the locality. It is claimed by the Applicant that

             he has agricultural farm in gut No.280 of village Mahe-

             Deshmukh, taluka Kopargaon District Ahmednagar. He has

             further submitted that the Respondent Nos.5 and 6 have started

             brick kilns in gut Nos. 278 and 277 which are adjoining to his

             land. The Applicant further claims that serious air pollution is


(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)   N.G.T.(WZ)       15
              caused and also the solid waste from the brick kilns is disposed

             improperly and therefore there is serious environmental

             concern and degradation in the area and his agricultural fields

             are affected and also there is serious threat to the health of

             people residing in the surrounding.

             Nos.2 and 3), however, the Authorities have not taken necessary

             action on his complaints. The Applicant further submits that

             the brick kilns are being operated illegally without obtaining

             statutory permission from the revenue Authorities as well as the

             MPCB. The MPCB visit inspection report is produced on record

             which shows that the brick kilns have not been provided with

             any type of air and water pollution control system. Further

             village Mahe-Deshmukh is about 250-300m from the brick

             kilns. Further the residence of complaints (Applicant) is about

             250-300. The brick kilns are along Mahe-Deshmukh to Kolgaon

             Thadi road. The affidavit goes on to mention that various crops

             like Sugarcane, Wheat, Onion were observed in the agriculture

             lands adjoining to the brick kilns and the brick kilns were not

             in operation during the visit.

             Respondents, therefore, plead that they are operating their

             traditional brick kilns by paying necessary royalty to the

             revenue department and in fact, Tahasildar Kopargaon, has

             granted permission to the Respondents to operate their

<p id="p_52">             27.            The Respondents have submitted 7x12 extracts of

             above lands since 1999 till the date and the Counsel for the

             Respondent No.5, argued on the basis of these documents that

             all gut numbers except gut No.280, which is owned by the

             Applicant, are being cultivated. He further mentioned that

             regular crops are being taken even in the gut Nos. 278 and 279

             where the brick kilns are operational. He, therefore, argues that

             there is no truth in the allegations of the Applicant that the brick

             kilns operations have affected the agriculture fields and the

(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)        N.G.T.(WZ)             19

             cultivated by the Applicants since year 2002, for the reasons

             best known to him and the Applicant is trying to blame the

             Respondents for his own inaction and negligence, which cannot

             permitted by any law and in equity. The Applicants have also

             submitted affidavits of some villagers, whom he claim to be

             users of this road, which is adjacent to the brick kilns on the

             north side, mentioning that there is no nuisance or pollution

             experienced           while       traversing       through         the   road.   The

             Respondents further submit that there is no human habitation

             within the distance of about 600m (2,000 ft) from the traditional

             brick kilns of the respondents and therefore, there is no

             question of having any adverse impact of pollution of brick kilns

             on the human health. The Respondents, therefore, have pleaded

             for dismissal of the Application with heavy costs.

</p><p id="p_57">             29.             There is no denial to the fact that the MPCB, has

             issued guidelines for running of the brick kilns. The brick kilns

             are required to be run by obtaining necessary permission of the

             District Collector or any Authority to whom such power is

             delegated by the Collector. A communication dated 13th

             February, 1997, issued by the then Member Secretary of the

             MPCB, and addressed to the Collector, on the subject of

             permission to be granted to the brick kilns, would show that the

             safeguards and guidelines of the MPCB are required to be

             considered by the Authority, while granting such permission to

             run the brick kiln and same may be incorporated in the

             permission letter. The communication further shows that no

             separate consent by the MPCB will be necessary for running of

             the brick kilns. The communication is annexed with a separate

             note, which shows various guidelines, set out for five(5) kinds of

             brick kilns.

</blockquote>
<p id="p_61">             31.             Admittedly, there is no particular standard fixed by the

             MPCB for grant of consent to traditional country type (clamp

             type-Bhatti) i.e. category-I brick-kilns. Nor, the MPCB initially

             claimed          to    be      the      authority         to    grant      consent   to

             establish/operate such kind of the brick-kilns. What appeared

             from the record is that the MPCB has issued communication to

             the District Collector of each district to incorporate safeguards

             as per those guidelines while granting permissions for

             establishment of the brick-kilns. The                          guidelines, no doubt,

             cannot be treated as part of the Rules. We find from the record

             that the Applicants in both Applications made various

             complaints in respect of the fugitive emissions arising from the

             brick-kilns run by concerned Respondents.                               However, MPCB

             has not submitted the levels of pollution and also, ambient air

             quality data, except one observed in 2006.

<p id="p_62">

             February 10, 2014, we have perused record of both the matters

             together. We have noted that Chairman, Central Pollution

             Control           Board         (CPCB)             vide    letter        No.   F.No.B-

              PCBs. It is noticed from the letter that brickfields are classified

             as Orange Industry/Process, for grant of Consent and other

             relevant activities. The term 'Brickfield' has been defined by the

             Oxford Dictionary, as "an area of ground where bricks are

             made". Similarly, Free Dictionary defines the Brickfield' as

             "place where bricks are made and sold". It can be seen from the

             above that the CPCB, has already considered the brick

             manufacturing as an activity for which the consent under the

             Water and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Air Pollution Act</a>, is required and accordingly the

             directions have been issued to the State PCBs.


</p><p id="p_65">             33.           We brought this to the notice of counsel for MPCB and

             sought clarification from the MPCB, whether the directions of

             the CPCB dated 4.6.2012, and clarification of the entries in the

             said directions pertaining to bricks kilns, are applicable to the

             brick kilns of traditional nature i.e. Clamp type (country type)

             brick kilns (Bhatti). He was also asked to clarify whether any

             particular emission standards are prescribed or likely to be

             prescribed and whether any consent is necessary for such type

             of brick kilns from the MPCB?
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">             34.           Accordingly, the MPCB has filed additional affidavit on

             17.2.2014, through Ankush S. Fulse, the Regional officer of the

             MPCB. The MPCB has submitted that the brick kilns (excluding

             fly ash bricks manufacturing using lime process), are covered

             under entry No.7 of the list of Orange category Units and

             therefore, in view of the specific categorization of the brick kilns

(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)   N.G.T.(WZ)     23
              in Orange category, as far as consent regime is concerned, it is

             obligatory on the part of all the brick kilns to obtain consent

             form the Board. (Emphasis supplied). The affidavit further goes

             on to mention that the MPCB has, therefore, directed all the

             Regional Officers and Sub-Regional Officers to cover such type

             of activities under consent management by circulating CPCB

             directions. We have noted that this is complete change of stand

             taken by the MPCB, as in the earlier affidavits MPCB has stated

             that it is not at all concerned in the permission granting

             mechanism for the brick kilns and it is the revenue authority

             who grants them permission. However, the present affidavit has

             taken volte-face.
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">             35.           The affidavit of the MPCB further mentions that the

             MoEF has already notified the standards for bulls trench kilns

             (BTK), down draft kin (DDK) and necessary conditions have also

             been stipulated. However, the affidavit do not contain anything

             about the emission standards which have been prescribed or

             will be prescribed while considering the Applications for consent

             by clamp type i.e. traditional brick kilns, though it was

             specifically directed by the Tribunal to the MPCB to clarify the

             position. We, therefore, find it difficult to appreciate on what

             basis and circumstances; the Board has decided to cover these

             traditional brick kilns under the consent regime, when it has

             not decided any emission standards which form the core part of

             the Consent under the provisions of Air and Water (Prevention


(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)   N.G.T.(WZ)   24
              and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>s. The affidavit itself mentions that

             unless the brick kilns obtains consent to operate (after

             stipulation of necessary pollution control arrangements) the

             brick kilns will not be allowed to operate. We find it difficult to

             understand such a proposition when the Board itself is not sure

             about the emission standards, required air pollution control

             system, required environmental safeguards which need to be

             considered in appraisal of the consent application and also, the

             monitoring mechanism for compliance of conditions.


</p><p id="p_70">             36.           MoEF         has      notified       industry      specific     emission

             standards for the brick kilns under the provisions of

             Environmental             (protection)        Rules    vide      notification    dated

             Vertical shaft kiln (VSK) types of the Brick kiln. This notification

             is salient about the emission standards for the Clamp type of

             Brick kiln. MoEF has further issued a office memorandum on

             24.6.2013          notifying        the     guidelines     for        consideration   of

             proposals for grant of environmental clearance under EIA

             notification for mining of 'Brick earth' and 'ordinary earth' which

             are also relevant in the instant case. Incidentally, SPCB's in

             Rajastan, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have a policy to grant

             consent to Brick kilns under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>, 1981 and

             <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a>, 1974. In fact, Rajastan PCB grants consent to Brick

             kilns under Red category i.e. highly polluting activity.


(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)         N.G.T.(WZ)                   25
</p><p id="p_72">              37.           One of the important observations noted in the present

             Application relates to absence of emission standards for the

             clamp type traditional brick-kilns, as noted from the MPCB

             affidavit. MPCB has already submitted that all the brick-kilns

             need to obtain the Consent from MPCB under Water and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water

             Act</a>s in compliance with the directions issued by CPCB. It is an

             admitted fact that the emission standards and also, the

             conditions to be incorporated in consent are essential pre-

             requisites for appraising the consent applications. We therefore

             record the necessity of stipulating the air emission standards

             and      other      conditions         for     environment     safeguard   before

             implementing the decision of MPCB to cover the brick kilns

             under consent management. This Tribunal has already ruled on

             the Authority for prescribing the emission standards under

             provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>, 1981 in M.A.No.202 of 2013 and

             according, it is the State Pollution Control Board which will have

             to formulate and stipulate the air emission standards and other

             environmental safeguards for such brick kilns. In the instant

             case, MPCB has taken the decision based on the directions given

             by CPCB, and therefore it is expected that CPCB must have

             considered all such aspects while issuance of directions, and if

             such standards have already been framed by CPCB, MPCB can

             consider adopting the same or develop its own standards by

             following due process of law.

             reasonable suspicion. It is not always necessary that there

             should be direct evidence of harm to the environment." The

                        a balance has to be struck, for the reason that if the
                        activity is allowed to go, there may be irreparable damage
                        to the environment and there may be irreparable damage
                        to the economic interest. A Similar view has been

             such permission, yet, guide-lines issued by the MPCB in 1997

             are ordinarily required to be followed in absence of fixation of

             standards for Clamp type of Brick kiln and particularly when

             there are no specific Rules framed for Clamp type Brick kiln by

             the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) or the State

             Government. In both cases, these guidelines are not adhered

             to. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the running of

             impugned brick-kilns is illegal activity and will have to be shut

             down as it poses threat to the environment to the surrounding

             area. We are also of the opinion that there is need to consider

             fixation of environmental safeguard as per Environmental

             (Protection) Act 1986 and/or <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a>, 1981 and also to identify

             the authority who is competent to issue permission for

             establishment/operation of such brick-kilns. We have noted

             that the state of Uttar Pradesh has framed certain Rules titled

             "Uttar Pradesh brick-kilns setting Criteria for Establishment)

             Rules 2012". Govt. of Andhra Pradesh has also notified

             guidelines for Clamp type Brick Kilns. Rajastan Pollution

             Control Board has also issued guidelines for Brick kilns.


</p><p id="p_79">             40.           Admittedly, the brick kilns in both these cases are

             operating without the necessary consent from MPCB and also,
(Common-J) Application No.07(THC)/2013 &amp; No.36(THC)/2013 (WZ)   N.G.T.(WZ)   28
              have not provided the air pollution control arrangements, as

             noted by MPCB. Cumulative result of the foregoing discussion

             is that the Applications will have to be allowed. We deem it

             proper to allow the Applications with certain conditions. We

             direct concerned Respondent owning and operating the Brick

             kilns to stop running of the brick-kilns and also direct the other

             Respondents to ensure that such activity is closed down.

             However, we are not inclined to make our order operational with

             immediate effect because MPCB has just now came forward with

             a decision to cover such brick kilns under consent regime and

             also, MPCB has not finalized any emission standards or the

             requirement of air pollution control arrangements at such brick

             kilns besides stipulating the required safeguards.
