Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.           The petitioner is stated to be in the                business of Screening-

Cum-Washing       of   gravel    and     has        set   up    the   industry   at   killa

Nos.35//23/2(4-16), 24(3-11), total measuring 8K-7M (Brani) land, in the

year 2008. It is stated that the unit of the petitioner after complying with

all the norms and conditions has been functioning since the year 2008 and

the respondents have arbitrarily and illegally directed it to be shut down.

</p><p id="p_3">3.           Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the unit of

the petitioner is complying with the provisions of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred as '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a>') and Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred as '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air

Act</a>'). He has drawn the attention of this Court to the report of the

Superintending Engineer and Executive Engineer, Department of Drainage

dated 14.12.2015 wherein the distance of the petitioner unit from the river

bank was found to be over 300 feet and hence it was permissible for the

petitioner to run the unit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.           Learned counsel for the respondents has contended that as the

unit of the petitioner fell within the embankment of river Ghaggar, it has

rightly been directed to be closed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.           We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.           A perusal of the order passed by the Appellate Authority shows

that the unit of the petitioner fell within the embankment of river Ghaggar.

The unit of the petitioner was inspected by a Committee comprising

Officers of various departments i.e. Sub Divisional Magistrate, General

Manager,      DIC-cum-mining       officer         Ajitgarh    (Mohali),   Environmental

Engineer, Punjab Pollution Control Board, Ajitgarh (Mohali), Environmental

Engineer, Punjab Pollution Control Board, Ajitgarh (Mohali), Executive

Engineer, Drainage Division, Department of Irrigation, Ajitgarh (Mohali),

Divisional Forest Officer, Ajitgarh (Mohali) and District Town Planner,

Ajitgarh (Mohali) and it was found to be falling in the river bed. The

Committee is stated to have been constituted by the Deputy Commissioner,

SAS Nagar, Mohali in terms of the order passed on 13.08.2013 in CWP

No.21899 of 2012 titled as Surmukh Singh Vs. State of Punjab and others.

This Committee had visited stone-crusher/screening-cum-washing plants

located within jurisdiction of SAS Nagar, District Mohali. In the report, the

unit of the appellant was shown at Serial No.84. It, therefore, fell in the

Flood Protection Embankment and was in violation of the Act.

</p><p id="p_7">7.        The Appellate Authority has disregarded the report of the

Superintending Engineer and Executive Engineer, Department of Drainage

Patiala dated 14.12.2015 on the ground that although in the report it is

stated that there is no guide bank on the outer side of the plant of the

appellant, but the site plan enclosed with the report of the drainage

department clearly depicts a guide bank on the side of the site of the

industry, thereby showing the site of the industry where the water will be

guided by the guide bank. It is also mentioned that the specific purpose

of the Flood Protection Embankment is to restrict the flood water and the

unit of the appellant as per the report of the Site Appraisal Committee is

situated within the Flood Protection Embankment of river Ghaggar. This

report is also signed by the Executive Engineer of Drainage Department.

</p><p id="p_8">8.        It is, thus, patent that as per the report of the Committee the

unit of the petitioner falls within the embankment of river Ghaggar.

Therefore, we do not find any manifest illegality in the impugned orders
