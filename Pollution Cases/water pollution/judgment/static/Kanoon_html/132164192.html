                             Judgment
11/05/2017

1.   By way of this writ petition, the petitioner has challenged the

action of the Sub Divisional Officer, Balotra in directing Jodhpur

Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited (JVVNL), to disconnect the electricity

supply of the petitioner inasmuch as, on the spot inspection,

leakage/seepage was found in the gutter/drain built of RCC

adjacent to the wall inside the industry.
                                      (2 of 4)
                                                                         [CW-3025/2017]

2.    Precisely, the case of the petitioner is that after carrying out

the repairs, the minor leakage found already stand sealed, which

stands verified by the inspecting team of Rajasthan State Pollution

Control Board (RSPCB), Balotra yet, the electricity supply of the

petitioner is not being restored by the respondents.

3.    Aggrieved by the action of the respondents, the petitioner

had earlier filed an appeal before the National Green Tribunal

(NGT), Principal Bench, New Delhi, however, the same was

dismissed by the NGT observing that since no written order has

been passed by the authority concerned under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

therefore, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Section 16 of the

NGT Act, 2010, cannot be invoked. Hence, this petition.

4.    A reply to the writ petition has been filed by the respondent

no.4 &amp; 5 taking the stand that on the spot inspection by the team

of RSPCB, the leakage/seepage was found in the gutter/drain

constructed by RCC adjacent to the wall in the petitioner industry

and   therefore,     the    action   of    the     respondents      in     directing

disconnection   of    the    electricity        supply   of   the   petitioner      is

absolutely justified. The action taken is sought to be justified by

the RSPCB on the strength of the directions issued by the NGT,

Principal Bench, New Delhi, by way of order dated 1.9.15 passed

in Original Application No.34(thc)/2014. However, it is                           not

disputed on behalf of the RSPCB that the small leakage/seepage

found, after repair carrying out by the petitioner stands sealed.

5.    Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that

after carrying out the necessary repairs, the leakage/seepage
                                     (3 of 4)
                                                               [CW-3025/2017]

found having been sealed, there is no reason why the electricity

supply of the petitioner should not be restored. Learned counsel

urged that the petitioner is operating its own Effluent Treatment

Plant (ETP) and RO Plant which are functional and therefore, no

water pollution whatsoever is likely to be caused by the petitioner

industrial unit if it is permitted to operate. Learned counsel

submitted that the action of the respondents in not restoring the

electricity supply and permitting the petitioner to operate its

industry, is ex facie illegal and arbitrary.

6.    The counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that on

account of the leakage/seepage found, the electricity supply of the

petitioner unit was rightly directed to be disconnected, however, it

is fairly not disputed by the counsel appearing for the respondents

that as per report of RO, RSPCB, Balotra submitted after fresh

inspection made, the leakage point was found repaired and

permanently blocked by cement mixed material and the internal

drain was also found dry. That apart, no outlet was observed

inside/outside the industry premises.

7.    On being asked by the court that if the necessary repairs

have been carried out and no leakage/seepage persists then why

the electricity supply has not been restored, the learned counsel

appearing for the respondents had no answer.

8.    It is to be noticed that the petitioner industrial unit is

operating its own ETP and RO Plant and thus, but for the

leakage/seepage     noticed    as     above,   no   effluent   was   being

discharged by the petitioner outside the industrial premises. It is

not in dispute that after necessary repairs being carried out by the
                                (4 of 4)
                                                            [CW-3025/2017]

petitioner industrial unit, the leakage/seepage stand sealed and no

effluent is being discharged by the petitioner unit outside the

industrial premises. In this view of the matter, the respondents

are not justified in continuing with the disconnection of the

electricity supply of the petitioner in respect whereof no written

order was passed at any point of time.

9.   In the result, the petition is allowed. The respondents are

directed   to restore the electricity     supply of   the    petitioner

forthwith. However, it is made clear that on the petitioner

industrial unit being made operational after restoration of the

electricity supply, if it is found discharging effluent outside the

industrial unit or any leakage/seepage is noticed, the respondents

shall be at liberty to take appropriate action in accordance with

law. No order as to costs.
