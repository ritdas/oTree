				ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.		The
present appeal under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 has been filed by the appellant Gujarat Pollution Control Board,
Surat,  against the  order dated 30th September, 2008  passed by the
learned  Chief Judicial Magistrate, Surat in Criminal Case no. 464 of
1995 whereby the complaint of the complainant-appellant  has been
dismissed for want of prosecution. Originally, the
appellant-complainant had filed the complaint  for the offence
punishable under  <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_2">sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">25</a>, <a href="/doc/624578/" id="a_4">33(2)</a> <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_5">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">44</a>, <a href="/doc/30355/" id="a_7">41(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_8">47</a> of the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.		Brief
facts of the complainant's case are that the appellant-original
complainant had filed  a criminal complaint before learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Surat against the respondent nos. 1 and 2 for
violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_10">sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_11">25</a> and <a href="/doc/624578/" id="a_12">33(2)</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a> which are punishable under
<a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_14">sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_15">44</a>, <a href="/doc/30355/" id="a_16">41(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_17">47</a> of the said Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.		The
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Surat, issued summons as well as
warrant against opponent nos. 1 and 2, but the appellant failed to
serve the warrant and summons upon the opponent nos. 1 and 2.
Moreover, the appellant had also failed to give proper explanation
and was not proceeding with the complaint. Therefore, the learned
Chief  Judicial Magistrate, Surat has dismissed the complaint of the
appellant-original complainant on the ground of non-prosecution of
the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.		Being
aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid order passed by the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Surat,  the appellant has
preferred the present appeal.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.		Heard
learned Advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the appellant.  He has contended
that the learned trial Judge has not considered the original facts of
the case and just due to delay, the complaint has been dismissed. He
has also contended that the learned trial Judge has committed a
serious error in dismissing the complaint. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.		I
have gone through the  order passed by the trial court. I have
perused the date of filing of the  criminal complaint and the date of
the  order passed by the learned trial Judge.  It appears that after
a period of 13 years, the criminal complaint was dismissed by the
learned trial Judge, and that too, when the complainant has failed to
give proper explanation about addresses of the accused as well as for
non-prosecution of the complaint after such a long period.  In the
above view of the matter, I am of the considered view that the trial
court was completely justified in dismissing the complaint filed by
the appellant-original complainant. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.		I
find that the finding of dismissal of the complaint for
non-prosecution  recorded by the trial court is absolutely just and
proper and in recording the said finding, no illegality or infirmity
has been committed by it.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.		I
am, therefore, in complete agreement with the reasons given by the 
court below and hence find no reason to interfere with the same.
There is no substance in this appeal. Hence, the appeal preferred by
the appellant fails and is  hereby dismissed. Record and Proceedings
be sent back to the trial court forthwith. Bail bonds, if any, stand
cancelled.
