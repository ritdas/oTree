                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">K.M. Joseph, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           In these batch of writ petitions certain common questions

arise and we deem it appropriate to dispose of the cases by the

following common judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           2. Petitioners are either service providers or infrastructure

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     3

providers or agreement holders with the infrastructure holders. The

controversy arises on account of obstruction to the construction of

mobile towers and in many cases, obstruction to construction of

towers for their operation and they seek police protection to aid them.

</p><p id="p_4">     3. This issue had engaged the attention of this Court earlier.

Divergent views were expressed by this Court in the decision in

<a href="/doc/1305317/" id="a_1">Reliance Infocom Ltd. v. Chemanchery Grama Panchayat</a>

(2006 (4) KLT 695) (hereinafter referred to as the "Reliance

case"), <a href="/doc/159841562/" id="a_2">Essar Telecom Infrastructure (P) Ltd. v. Circle

Inspector Of Police</a> (2008 (4) KLT 713) and <a href="/doc/23538372/" id="a_3">Dishnet Wireless

Limited v. Circular Inspector of Police</a> (2009 (1) KHC 781).

On noticing the divergent views, a Division Bench of this Court

referred the following two questions to the Full Bench:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "(1) Whether the construction of a Mobile Base
     Station by itself will give rise to a dispute of civil
     nature, merely for the reason that a section of the
     public apprehends that it may cause some health
     hazards and whether a larger question of this nature
     as to whether such Mobile Base Station could cause
     any health hazards could be decided in a petition filed
     under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    4

    (2) If the petitioners have obtained licence in
      accordance with the relevant statute in force and
      when they start functioning of a Mobile Base Station,
      can anybody cause any physical obstruction to such
      work, without raising a dispute and seeking remedies
      available to them under law, and in case, any such
      physical obstructions is caused, is not the Police
      bound to act and whether in the absence, this Court
      could issue necessary directions to the Police."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">    Subsequently, another Division Bench felt that two more

    points require consideration by the Full Bench and sought to

      clarify the following two points :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       "(1)     Whether this Court can exercise the
       jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to the
       police, as if this Court is hearing a suit for
       mandatory injunction and whether the objection
       taken to the same in para 8 of Sadananda Bai's case
       (supra) and para 8 of Essar Telecom Infrastructure
       (P) Ltd's case (supra) is sustainable ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">         (2)     When, for causing obstruction to the
            construction of a mobile phone tower, the
            petitioners have an alternative effective remedy
            of filing a civil suit, is it a proper exercise of
            discretion by this Court to entertain the Writ
            Petitions and advise the respondents to invoke
            the alternative remedies available to them ?"</blockquote><p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      The Full Bench answered the questions in the decision in

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   5

     Reliance Telecommunications Ltd. v. S. I. of Police (ILR

     2010 (2) Ker. 592) (hereinafter referred        to as the Full

     Bench decision) as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">          "33.    Points sought to be clarified as per the
            reference order dated 24-3-2009 in W.P.(C).
</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">            No.6433/2009      and    connected    cases   are
            answered     in  the    above   background      as
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            follows:The construction of a Mobile Base
            Station by itself witll not give rise to a dispute
            purely of civil nature, to be relegated to a civil
            court, merely for the reason that a section of
            the public apprehends that it may cause some
            health hazards. Whether a larger question of
            this nature, as to whether such Mobile Base
            Station could cause any health hazard, could be
            decided in a petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of
            Constitution of India, there cannot be any legal
            bar to such a course in appropriate cases,
            where sufficient materials are provided as to
            the scientific studies and norms/guidelines
            prescribed    by   the    Government/Licensing
            authorities in this regard; which situation is
            conspicuously absent in the instant cases.</blockquote><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">          If the petitioners have obtained all requisite
            licences/permits   in    accordance     with   the
            relevant statutes/orders/notifications in force
            and start construction/functioning of a Mobile
            Base Station, nobody can cause any physical
            obstruction to such work/operation, but it is
            open to them for raising a dispute and seek

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     6

            remedies available under the law.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                  If the police is alerted as to the threat to
            the law and order situation and if there is any
            violation on the part of the Police to discharge
            the statutory duty in takiang steps to prevent
            cognizable offence, a Writ of Mandamus is very
            much liable to be issued granting police
            protection.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         34.    Points sought to be clarified as per the
            reference    dated     2-11-2009    in   W.P.(C).
</p><p id="p_12">            Nos.24384 &amp; 25157/2009 are answered as
            follows:
</p>
<p id="p_13">            (i) In view of the observation in paragraph 8 of
            Sadananda Bai's case (2008 (3) KLT 542) and
            similar observations in paragraaph 8 of Essar
            Telecom's case (2008 (4) KLT 713) holding that
            this Court is very much having the power to
            provide the remedy, in case of violation to
            discharge the duty by the police, further
            reference doubting the power of this Court
            under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> is quite unwarranted. In view
            of the law declared by this Court as stated in the
            forgoing paragraphs, the observations to the
            contrary in the above two decisions (Sadananda
            Bai's case and Essar Telecom's case) are not
            correct or sustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_14">         (ii) Relegation to the Civil Court, in the event of
         forceful obstruction to the construction or
         energization of Mobile Phone Tower is not an
         effective alternate remedy and interference by this

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES      7

           Court, granting `Police protection', invoking the
           power and discretionary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article
           226</a> of the Constitution of India is warranted to
           advance the course of justice."
</p>
<p id="p_15">The Full Bench also approved the law declared by the decision in

Reliance Case and the Dishnet Case. Thereafter, the Full Bench

ordered as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            "36. The next question is whether the merits of
      each case are to be dealt with or not. Even though we
      are very much aware of the scope and power under
      Sec.7 of the Kerala High Court Act, in view of the
      dictum laid down by the Apex Court as per the
      decision in <a href="/doc/1105893/" id="a_8">Kerala State Science &amp; Technology
      Museum v. Rambal Co. and Others</a> reported in (2006)
      6 S.C.C. 258), we find it proper to have the cases
      considered and decided on merits by the appropriate
      Court, in the light of the law declared as above."</blockquote><p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">      4. In many of these cases the matter had engaged the attention

of the Full Bench of this Court.  We are proceeding to dispose of not

only the cases which were listed before the Full Bench, but also other

cases,  many of them filed subsequent to the decision of the Full

Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      5. Sri. P. Sathisan, learned counsel for the petitioners in many

of these cases would make the following submissions: Under Section 4

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES      8

of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_9">Indian Telegraph Act</a>, a licence has been granted to establish a

telegraph, which takes in a mobile business also. He points out that

Entry 31 of List I of the 7th Schedule provides for legislative power to

Parliament, as hereunder:
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                   "Entry 31: Posts and telegraphs; telephones,

      wireless,   broadcasting   and     other   like  forms    of

      communication."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">He would submit that it is in the exercise of the legislative power that

the Parliament has enacted the <a href="/doc/1171314/" id="a_10">Telecom Regulatory Authority of India

Act</a>, 1997 <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_11">(TRAI Act</a> for short). He would draw our attention to <a href="/doc/307295/" id="a_12">Section

11</a> of the said Act. He relies further on <a href="/doc/1517150/" id="a_13">Section 14</a> which provides for

right of appeal to the appellate authority.       He further draws our

attention to Se.2 (l) of the Municipality Building Rules where the word

"building" is defined. He would canvass, in particular, Rule 141 (8) of

the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999. It reads as follows:

</p><pre id="pre_3">            "141.   Submission      of   application    and    its

      disposal.-

            (8)    The Secretary shall, if convinced of the

</pre><p id="p_21">      boundaries and ownership of the plot, plans and drawings

      and genuineness of the certificates, issue permit, not

      later than 30 days from the date of receipt of the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES      9

      application."
</p>
<p id="p_22">He would further contend that there is a right of appeal to the Tribunal

under Se.276 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994.             Without

challenging the permit issued under the Building Rules, it is contended

that it is not open to the respondents or their men in these cases to

obstruct the petitioners from carrying out the work for which they have

taken permit and are otherwise armed with necessary licences under

the Central enactment governing the field.     He would submit that if

the tower is not put up and operated it will affect the quality of the

service which would result in the petitioners being liable to pay

penalties. He would refer to the Division Bench decision of this Court

in <a href="/doc/1714495/" id="a_14">Dishnet Wireless Ltd. v. Circle Inspector of Police and Others</a>

(2009 (1) KHC 781) and the unreported judgment of another Division

Bench. He also relied upon the judgment of the Full Bench (supra) of

this Court and contended that the writ petitions are only to be allowed.

He would submit that there is a bar under Se.37 of the TRAI Act to

institute a civil suit. He relied further on the judgment of the Apex

Court in <a href="/doc/118489/" id="a_15">Union of India v. Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd</a>.

(2007 (7) SCC 517).
</p>
<p id="p_23">      6. Sri. Santhosh Mathew, learned counsel for the petitioners in

many of these cases would essentially adopt the arguments of Sri. P.

</p><p id="p_24">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     10

Satheesan. He would submit that once permit is obtained under the

Building Rules, there is no need for further permission under Se.235

</p><p id="p_25">(h). He would refer to the 73rd Amendment to the Constitution. He

would further refer to Se.166 of the Panchayat Raj Act and would

contend that the local body may not have any further say in the matter

once a permit is obtained. He would also refer to Exts.P9 which are

questions seeking information under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_16">Information Act</a> and

Ext.P10 reply given in W.P.(C) No.10907/2010 to contend that the

petitioners have obtained all necessary permissions required as per

law. He also relied on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/739216/" id="a_17">All India

Federation of Tax Practitioners And Others v. Union of India

And Others</a> (2007 (7) SCC 527 (at 547)). He would further refer to

Se.256 of the Panchayat Raj Act. He would further point out that writ

petitions are pending since 2009. He also referred to the unreported

judgment of the Bombay High Court in Crl. Appeal 930/2009 and the

unreported     judgment      of    the    Karnataka     High     Court

MANU/KA/0496/2001 in W.P No.35408/2000 (para 15) and the

judgment of this Court in W.A.No.1596/2007.

</p><p id="p_26">      7. Shri. Philip Mathew, learned counsel for the petitioners in

many of these cases would point out that except in some cases no

counter affidavit is filed. He would address six points before us. (i).

</p><p id="p_27">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     11

Se.232 and Se.233 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act are not applicable

in view of Chapter 19 of the Municipal Building Rules. (ii) Se.233 (B)

of the Panchayat Raj Act corresponding to Se.450 of the Kerala

Municipalities Act provides for exemption from taking permit for

installation of machinery. In this regard he relies on clause (a) and

</p><p id="p_28">(c). (iii) He refers to the heading of Sec.233 and he would contend

that it is only in cases where the matter is covered by Se.232 that

Se.233 will apply and since there is no notification which requires

taking out a licence under Se.232, Se.233 of the Panchayat Raj Act

cannot apply.     (iv) Sec.4 of the Telegraph Act contains certain

safeguards and the Panchayat Raj Act cannot be made applicable in an

area held by the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_18">Telegraph Act</a>. (v) He would contend that the

technological benefit should be made available to the masses and the

Court must interpret the provisions of laws in such a manner that the

technological advancement are made available to the masses.        He

would also contend that the workplace used in Se.233 (a) must be

given the commonly understood meaning. He would refer to G.P.Singh

Interpretation of Statutes 10th Edition Page 158 where the learned

Author refers to the importance to be attached to the heading of a

section.   He would refer to Mimansa Rules of Interpretation (3rd

Edition) page 185. He relies on the decision in Vijay v. State of

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     12

Maharashtra (2006 (6) SCC 289).      He refers to the provisions of the

Dangerous Trades Licensing Rules made under the Panchayat Raj Act

particularly the explanatory note. He would contend that no separate

form is prescribed under the Municipality Building Rules and he would

refer us to Form A to contend that once a permit is acquired there can

be no scope for obtaining any other permission.      He refers to the

decision of a Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1982470/" id="a_19">Bini v. Sundaran K.V</a>.

(2008 (1) KHC 209). He would contend that State Government has

some power but it may not operate when any collision with the Central


Legislation is occasioned. He      further submitted that without

acquiring land, the rights of the owner cannot be affected and he

relied on the judgment in Raju S. Jeth malani v. State of

Maharashtra (2005(11) SCC 222) and Nasar v. Malappuram

Municipality (2009 (3) KLT 92). He would rely on the decision

in <a href="/doc/791131/" id="a_20">Indore Vikas Pradhikaran v. Pure Industrial Coke &amp;

Chemicals Ltd</a>. (2007 (8) SCC 705) to contend that the Apex

Court has recognised that right to immovable property, though no

longer a fundamental right is a human right. He further relied on

the decision in <a href="/doc/1619661/" id="a_21">Sivadasan v. Mattannur Municipality</a> (2008 (4)

<p id="p_29">      8.   Shri. V. G.Arun, learned Counsel appears for the

petitioners in a number of writ petitions wherein, the petitioners

seek police protection for constructing and operating the mobile

towers. He also relied in Entry 31 of list I, which we have already

referred to. Besides, he also referred us to Entry 13 of list II. He

would refer us to Section 3(1)AA of the Indian Telegraph Act,

<a href="/doc/1171238/" id="a_22">Section 2</a> sub-Section (2) of the Wireless Telegraph Act 1933,

<a href="/doc/1927191/" id="a_23">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1464865/" id="a_24">7</a>, <a href="/doc/485027/" id="a_25">19</a> and <a href="/doc/80037/" id="a_26">8</a> of the Telegraph Act, to contend that the

matter of establishing the telecommunication tower is governed by

the provisions of the Central Enactments. He sought to buttress

this position with reference to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1171314/" id="a_27">Telecom

Regulatory Authority of India Act</a> (hereinafter referred to as the

<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_28">TRAI Act</a>). He referred us to the provisions of <a href="/doc/307295/" id="a_29">Section 11</a> besides

<a href="/doc/537666/" id="a_30">Section 13</a> of the Act.       He also made available the licence

agreement and referred us to various clauses therein in an attempt

to contend that the matter engaged the attention of the Licensing

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES       14

Authority which has provided for various conditions and,

therefore, he would contend that the provisions of <a href="/doc/251935/" id="a_31">The Wireless

Telegraphy Act</a>, <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_32">Telegraph Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_33">TRAI Act</a> r/w terms of the

licence (agreement) occupy the field and there is no space for the

State to legislate as the field is completely occupied. He would also

refer us to the third schedule to the Panchayat Raj Act and <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_34">Section

166</a> of the same. He also would submit that, having regard to the

fact that the new licence condition has been imposed for regulating

electro magnetic field, radiation, by way of self-audit and

providing for officials to cross-check the same and as under the

licence condition, stringent punishment is provided by way of

penalty and also if needed, revocation of the licence, all is well.

In this regard, he referred us to the communication dated 2.11.2010

addressed by the Government Department to the term "cells". He

also relied on the decision in <a href="/doc/1752601/" id="a_35">Baijnath Kedia v. The State of

Bihar</a> (AIR 1970 (SC) 1436).

</p><p id="p_31">      9. Shri. Krishna Prasad, learned Counsel for the petitioners

appearing in writ petitions wherein, the petitioners are civil

contractors, undertaking work of construction of towers, submits

that they are only engaged in construction of towers for which they

are having Permits. According to him, no other permission is

required. He adopts the argument of the other petitioners.

</p><p id="p_32">      10. Shri. A. Mohamed Mustaque, learned Counsel for the

petitioners would raise the following contentions:

</p><p id="p_33">      He appears in the writ petitions wherein the petitioners are

infrastructure providers, i.e., the petitioners are engaged in

construction of mobile towers.     He would broadly contend as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_34">      There is a social philosophy behind the policy of the

Government in the matter of having mobile towers. Secondly, he

would delineate on the aspect of a writ of mandamus and when it

will be issued. Thirdly, he would contend that no permission is

required u/s. 233 of the Panchayat Raj Act or the provisions

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    16

contained the <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_36">Municipalities Act</a>. Expatiating his contentions, he

would refer us to clause 3 at page 55 (compilation No.1).         He

would contend that there is a universal service obligation, that is to

say an obligation to take the mobile telephone to the remote and

rural areas through the length and breadth of the country and there

is a social philosophy as the framers of the policy have found that

reaching this modern means of communication to the far corners,

of the country will best promote the development of the people.

He referred to <a href="/doc/254550/" id="a_37">Sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/159030384/" id="a_38">9A</a>, <a href="/doc/130033439/" id="a_39">9C</a>, and <a href="/doc/170777404/" id="a_40">9D</a> of the India Telegraph

Act. He would point out the gap between the number of towers

required (3,30,000) by 2010 (see page 5 of compilation 1). He

would contend that there is need to bear in mind that concept of

sustainable   development.    He   would    point   out   that    the

implementation of the policy being man made, there will be

imperfection. He would contend that in fact, there is an increasing

awareness and which is being translated to reality also that

operators must share towers. He referred us to various material to

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    17

show that the matter of erection of towers is seized of by

International   Telecommunication Union and also the National

Authorities   in  India,   namely the      concerned   Government

Department. He would point out that there is lot of dispute in the

matter of allocation of spectrum. He would also rely on literature

to contend that it may be necessary to have more base stations

(towers) and it would be in the interest of the members of the

public themselves. He would also submit that the matter must be

treated as occupied field having regard to the central legislation

and the conditions of the licence. He also would refer us to the

experience in other countries. He would contend that the radiation

in the case of a mobile tower is non-ionizing. He referred us to the

concepts of wireless networks cellular topography and contended

that there is no merit at all in obstructing the construction of the

towers. He would contend that ideally when the density of the

population increases, there would be a corresponding increase in

the number of towers.

</p><p id="p_36">      11. Shri A. Mohamed Mustaque would also contend that the

petitioners   had   the   liberty   and,   therefore, there    was

correspondingly no right for the obstructionists to physically

obstruct. He referred us to the decision in Gardon Riots' case. He

would submit that the discretion of this Court would be fettered, if

there is any established violation of law.     Thirdly, he would

contend, in regard to Section 233 of the Panchayat Raj Act and the

corresponding provisions in the <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_41">Municipalities Act</a>, that the

principle of ejusdem generis, must be applied. He would submit

that <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_42">Section 233</a> contemplates a quasi-judicial procedure for

processing applications seeking permission under the same. He

would submit that when the Panchayat Raj Act and the

Municipality Act were enacted, the Legislature had before it the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_43">Factories Act</a>, 1948, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_44">Air Pollution Act</a>, 1981 and the

Environmental Protection Act, 1986.        He referred us to the

definition of "factory" and "machinery" contained in the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_45">Factories

Act</a>. He does not dispute that the Antenna, Receiver and Generator

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    19

(if used) would be machinery. But, he would contend that it is not

machinery as was contemplated under Section 233(1)(b) of the

Panchayat Raj Act. According to him, the machinery must be

machinery which is used in a factory, workshop or work place and

it must be capable of producing pollution or nuisance as is

contemplated in sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_46">Section 233</a>. He referred us to

case law to explain the concept of ejusdem generis and to contend

that <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_47">Section 233</a> of the Act did not and does not contemplate

within its scope, the component parts used in a mobile tower. He

would refer us to the definition of the words "air pollutant" in the

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_48">Air Pollution Act</a>, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_49">Water Pollution Act</a>, 1974 to

contend that the Legislature did not intend to include the

components of a mobile tower within the scope of the Act.

Therefore, he would contend that Section 233 of the Panchayat Raj

Act would not apply as they stand, to the construction or

installation of machinery in the tower.
</p>
<p id="p_37">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  20

</p><p id="p_38">     12. He would next argue that if it is found to be an omission,

then, it is not for the Court to supply the omission of the

Legislature and he projected the principle of casus omissus. He

relied on the Judgments of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1368176/" id="a_50">Smt. Hira Devi v.

District Board, Shahjahnpur</a> (AIR 1952 SC 362), <a href="/doc/948743/" id="a_51">Gullapalli

Development Authority</a> (2010 (7) SCC 129). He also relied on

Black Law Dictionary and Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes

in this regard. He would further submit that <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_53">Section 233</a> B, no

doubt, provide for exemptions. But, he would contend that the fact

that the component parts of a tower are not mentioned therein,

would not immediately mean that <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_54">Section 233</a> applies for the

reasons which he has already advanced. He would further submit

that Section 233 A of the Panchayat Raj Act provides for

remedying nuisance and a perusal of its terms would show that the

Legislature did not contemplate the nuisance if any which may

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     21

emanate from the operation of a mobile tower.

</p><p id="p_39">     13. Shri K. Ramakumar, learned senior counsel appearing for

the petitioner in W.P.(C).No.1693/10 would contend as follows:

</p><p id="p_40">     He would submit that the question as to whether the

component parts are machinery requiring permission has not been

raised or pleaded and it is not open to the Court to decide questions

which are not pleaded or raised. He referred us to the decisions in

<a href="/doc/1643138/" id="a_55">Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra</a> (AIR 1967

SC 1) and <a href="/doc/1931795/" id="a_56">Sundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija v. Collector, Thane</a>

((1989) 3 SCC 396) (paragraphs 16 to 26). He would submit that

at present the protection is sought only for putting up the tower and

the Court need not assume that the local bodies will fail to

discharge their duties. It is not open to the Court to travel beyond

pleadings. It is not open to the people to physically obstruct the

construction of the tower. He relied on the decision in <a href="/doc/1396537/" id="a_57">Union of

India v. Jai Prakash Singh</a> ((2007) 10 SCC 712). In considering

the issue of prerogative writs, the Court must be confined to the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES      22

pleadings and documents before it. He relied on the decision in

<a href="/doc/1758094/" id="a_58">Union of India v. R. Bhusal</a> ((2006) 6 SCC 36). He would

contend that it may be open to the Court to direct the Authorities

concerned to look into as to whether any permission is necessary

and it is not for this Court to primarily decide the very issue itself.

</p><p id="p_41">      The case of the respondents:
</p>
<p id="p_42">      14. In W.P.(C).No.13403/2010, the second respondent has

produced Ext.R2(b), an article written by a retired Civil Surgeon

about the dangers of the radiation. Ext.R2(c) purports to be a

Newspaper Report in Madhyamam Daily. Ext.R2(d) purports to be

another paper Report. Ext.R2(g) purports to be a Report in the

newspaper, the Times of India reporting the adverse effect of

electromagnetic radiation on honeybees. Ext.R2(h) purports to be

a study report by Professor Girish Kumar, Electrical Engineering

Department, IIT Bombay with regard to the biological effects on

the cell tower operation. It is, inter alia, stated that when the

human body is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, it absorbs the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES      23

radiation because the human body contains seventy per cent of

liquid. The current international standards based on ICNIRP

recommendations are purely based on thermal effects of radiation,

whereas various epidemiological and experimental studies have

shown to have significant biological effects far below these

standards. It is stated further that non-thermal effects of radio

frequency radiation accumulate over time and the risks are more

pronounced after 8 to 10 years of exposure. There is reference to

studies in Australia and Germany linking increased level of cancer

to residents near TV and FM towers and cellular transmitter site

respectively. It is further stated as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            "Radiation from cell phone towers has been
      associated with greater increase in brain tumor. (2)
      This is due to the damage in the blood brain barrier
      and the cells in the brain which are concerned with
      learning, memory and movement.          Studies by Carl
      Blackman have shown that weak electromagnetic
      fields release calcium ions from cell membranes (4).
      Leakage of calcium ions into the cytosol acts as a
      metabolic stimulant, which accelerates growth and
      healing, but it also promotes the growth of tumors.</blockquote><p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">      Loss of calcium ions causes leaks in the membranes of
      lysosomes releasing DNAase that causes DNA

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  24

    damage. Another possibility of DNA damage is via
    increased free radical formation inside cells (5, 6),
    which further causes cellular damage in the
    mitochondria.       Irreversible infertility has been
    reported in mice (7) and continuous exposure has been
    associated with reduction in sperm viability and
    mobility by around 25 percent in men (8). Children
    are more vulnerable to radio frequency radiation
    emissions as their skulls are thinner, their nervous
    system still developing and myelin sheath is yet not
    developed. A pregnant woman and the fetus both are
    vulnerable because of the fact that these RF radiations
    continuously react with the developing embryo and
    increasing cells. Microwave radiation damages the
    placental barrier, implying that pregnant woman
    should not use cell phone (9). The RF Exposure can
    adversely affect the heart pace maker, implantable
    cardiovascular defibrillators and impulse generators
    (10). These radiations may stop Pace maker from
    delivering pulses in a regular way or may generate
    some kind of external controlling pulse putting the
    patient to death. Studies of people who are exposed in
    their work (occupational exposure), have shown to
    have elevated levels of health risks. Another study
    reveals that workers who are in the highest 10%
    category for EMF exposure are twice as likely to die of
    prostate cancer as those exposed at lower levls (11).
    Exposure to electromagnetic fields has shown to be in
    connection with Alzheimer's disease, motor neuron
    disease and Parkinson's disease (12).        All these
    diseases are involved with the death of specific
    neurons and are classified as neurodegenerative
    diseases. Inhabitants living near mobile phone base
    stations     are   also   at    risk  for   developing

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    25

      neuropsychiatric problems as headache, memory loss,
      nausea, dizziness, tremors, muscle spasms, numbness,
      tingling, altered reflexes, muscle and joint paint,
      leg/foot pain, depression, and sleep disturbance (13).
      More severe reactions include seizures, paralysis,
      psychosis and stroke. All point to the fact that the
      current exposure standards for microwaves are not
      safe for long-term exposure."
</p>
<p id="p_45">     15. It is submitted by Shri V.P. George that the Full Bench

has not relegated the parties to the civil court. He relies on the

Statement of the Government of India filed in one of the cases. He

would rely on Section 23 of the Environmental Protection Act. He

contends that he does not take the extreme position that mobile

phones should be banned or that mobile towers should not be

constructed. But, having regard to the dangers emanating from the

indiscriminate proliferation of towers and mobile phones and the

radiation which emanates from the same, they are matters to be

regulated. He would submit that an environmental impact report

must be obtained before proceeding further. TRAI is not concerned

with the safety aspects, he contends. He relied on the Judgment of

the Gujarat High Court in D.S. Rana &amp; Others v. Ahamedabad

keeping with the principles applicable thereto. He would submit

that to constitute a "work place", the workers need not go to work

there all the time. Systematic work goes on in a mobile tower with

the aid of power.   Certainly, some workmen will be going there

from time to time.      He relied on the decision in <a href="/doc/1657323/" id="a_69">Consumer

Panchayat Raj Act. He also relied on the alma ata convention and

the asbestos convention, 1986.       He also referred us to      the

constitution of WHO (World Health Organisation). He would

submit that different kind of cells are used and they include micro,

contend as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_60">       He relies on Entry 6 of List II. He would contend that the

State has legislative power under Entry 6 of List II to provide for

public health which is what Section 233 of the Panchayat Raj Act

is all about. He relies on the decision on <a href="/doc/1809331/" id="a_71">State of Rajasthan v. G.

Chawla &amp; Another</a> (AIR 1959 SC 544). He would contend that

the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_72">TRAI Act</a> does not deal with any matter covered by Entry 6 of

List II. In this regard, he referred to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_73">Section 11</a> of

the TRAI Act. Learned Government Pleader would specifically

say that the Government does not have a case that the mobile tower

is a "work place" within the meaning of Section 233 of the

Panchayat Raj Act. However, he would submit that under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_74">Section

233(1)(b)</a>, the component parts installed in a tower would

constitute machinery and, therefore, permission is required under

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    33




<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_75">Section 233</a>. He would contend that Sections 233 and 233A of the

Panchayat Raj Act deal with issues of nuisance and health. He

further drew our attention to the provisions of Section 2 of the

Travancore - Cochin Public Health Act. In particular, he referred

us to the definition of "nuisance".     He further brought to our

attention <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_76">Sections 39</a> and <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_77">40</a> of the said Act, besides <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_78">Sections 95</a>,

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_79">98</a> and <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_80">99</a>. He further referred us to the Town Planning Scheme

and contended that under the Scheme, towers cannot be permitted

in residential areas. He also referred us to the decision in <a href="/doc/698472/" id="a_81">State of

Maharashtra v. Bharat Shanti Lal Shah &amp; Others</a> ((2008) 13

SCC 5). Learned counsel for the petitioners would counter the

arguments of the learned counsel for the respondents and we shall

deal with the same more elaborately.
</p>
<p id="p_61">     24. Construction of mobile towers have given rise to these

Writ Petitions.    In most of these cases, the petitioners have

obtained Permits issued for construction of mobile tower under the

Municipal Building Rules, which Rules have been made applicable

to the Panchayats also.

</p><p id="p_63">     Whether the operation of mobile tower a health

     hazard ?
</p>
<p id="p_64">     25. The first question, of course, is as to whether there is any

material produced to warrant the view that the construction of the

towers and their operation would constitute a health hazard.

Counsel for the petitioners would point out that most of the

materials have been considered by the Division Bench and the Full

Bench. It is contended that this Court has found that the

precautionary principle would not apply in the matter of operation

of the mobile towers and that it is not the burden of the petitioners

to show that there is no pollution or nuisance. In the Reliance

case, the Court proceeded to refer to the constitution of the

Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri N. K. Ganguly, DG,

ICMR by the Government as directed by the Bombay High Court.

The Court, inter alia, held as follows:

          "     Mobile phones produce radio-frequency.
</pre><p id="p_65">    Magnetic energy moving through space is generally
    called radio frequency electro magnetic radiation
    (EMR). EMR is of course a part of everyday life.
    EMR is emitted by natural sources like the sun, the
    earth and the ionosphere and also by artificial
    sources, such as, electrical and electronic equipments,
    radar facilities, broadcast towers and mobile phone
    base stations, etc. EMR absorbed in human body is
    measured in units called the specific absorption rate
    (SAR) which is usually expressed in units of watts per
    kilogram (w/kg.) or milliwatts per gram (mw/g.).
    There     are    multiple   sources of  exposures   to
    electromagnetic fields including radio, FM radio,
    Television and other household gadgets.       Exposure
    standards for Radio Frequency Energy has been
    develop0ed by various countries and organizations.
    Based on these scientific data, the National Council
    for Radiation Protection and Measurement of USA
    and the Australian Communication Authority urges a
    public exposure limit of 200 microwatts per square
    centimetre in the 30 to 300 Mhz range. Direct use of
    mobile phones including radio FM radio, Television
    and other household gadgets would have some
    illeffects on human beings. A workshop conducted by
    World Health Organization (WHO) in Prague in 2004
    reached the following conclusions, viz., that (1)
    reported symptoms are very unspecific and could have
    other causes: (2) there is no casual association
    demonstrated between exposure and symptoms; (3)
    that patients who display those symptoms should be
    medically examined for alternative explanations and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    36

     causes including psychiatric/psychological ones and
     other environmental factors: (4) lowering the safety
     limits for handset radiation (SAR levels) will not affect
     the situation. Study conducted would show that there
     is no scientific evidence for a casual relationship
     between the reported clusters of symptoms and
     exposure to microwave radiation used in cell phones,
     well below the safety standards............Question that is
     posed for consideration in this case is not with regard
     to ill effects of the use of mobile phones but whether
     installation of mobile base station and its functioning
     would cause any health hazards to the people who are
     residing nearby.

appointed pursuant to the decision of the Bombay High Court:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">              "* There are multiple sources of exposures to

              radio,    Television and      other   household
              gadgets. There is a need to acknowledge the
              confounding effects on these sources of RF.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">              * There are different types of Mobile Base
              Stations depending on the requirements of a
              particular system (GSM or CDMA) prevalent
              in India, however GSM system outnumbers
              CDMA.</blockquote><p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">              * RF exposures from Mobile Base Stations are

              television transmissions.
</p>
<p id="p_69">              * The height of Mobile Base Station antennae
              is nominally 36 metres and the effect of radio
              waves depends on the distance from the base
              stations since the antennae are directed
              horizontally with a 5 degree downwards tilt.

              * The strength of radio frequency fields in
              front of the antennae varies with the distance.
              Persons standing directly in front of the
              antennae in these high density zones will be
              higher exposures.
</p>
<p id="p_70">
              * There are two main types of effects of

              disturbances, hearing disorders, etc.

              * Factors like urbanization, siting of base
              stations, distance from the towers, existence of
              multiple towers and multiple providers, etc.
              all may have confounding effects which could
              be difficult to quantify.

              Borkiewicz et al (2004) &amp; Hutter &amp; kundi et
              atl (2006) do not report any quantitative
              parameters related to health hazards.

<p id="p_73">              * ICNIRP Guidelines in respect of restriction
              on Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) are
              available internationally and have been
              adopted by various European countries, such
              as UK, Australia, Malaysia and Korea. But,
              China has adopted more stringent criteria.

              * Various studies conducted across the world
              on RF from Mobile Base Stations have shown
              that the exposures are of a such lower
              magnitude than the internationally accepted
              levels.

<p id="p_74">              * At the moment there is no concrete evidence

              opinion as mentioned in the latest Fact Sheet
              modified in May, 2006. The Committee felt
              that more objective research is needed in the
              above disorders to quantify the effect on
              human health.

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   39

    Committee opined that overall there is not enough
    evidence to show direct health hazards of RF
    exposures from Mobile Base Stations."
</p>
<p id="p_77">The Court also held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_78">          "Atomic     Energy    Regulatory    Board    also
    submitted a report before the Bombay High Court in
    WP.No.2112 of 2004.          Report states that radio
    frequency waves used for mobile phones are not
    covered under the definition of "radiation" as given in
    the <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_82">Atomic Energy Act</a>, 1962 and non ionizing
    radiations do not have the capability to ionize the
    matter with which they interact. Radiation Protection
    Division (NRPB) of the U.K. Health Protection Agency
    in the year 2000 has reported that the balance of
    evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the
    health of people living near the base stations on the
    basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions
    of guidelines. Scientific data made available to the
    Court would indicate that the use of mobile phone, AM
    Radio, FM Radio etc. is more harmful to the human
    beings compared to the power emission from the base
    Transcieving Stations and that of Mobile Towers.
    Surveys conducted in proximity to base stations
    indicate that the public is exposed to extremely low
    intensity RF fields in the environment and all the
    evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk
    to health. We may in this connection also refer to the
    order of the Delhi High Court in OS 1121/02 wherein
    the court opined that so far there is neither any
    conclusive     research  nor   authoritative  scientific
    evidence to show that the radiations emitted by such
    Transmission Towers are dangerous to the health of

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  40

    human beings.
</p>
<p id="p_79">    We have already found that RF exposures from Mobile
    Base Stations are much less than from radio, Fm radio
    and television transmissions and that the consensus of
    scientific community is that the radiation from Mobile
    Phone Base Stations is far too low to produce health
    hazards if people are kept away from direct access to
    the antenna and the overall evidence indicates that
    they are unlikely to pose a risk to health. The strength
    of radio frequency fields in front of the antennae
    varies with the distance. Persons standing directly in
    front of the antennae in these high density zones will
    get higher exposures. We have also found that the
    height of Mobile Base Station antennae is normally 36
    metres and the effect of radio waves depends on the
    distance from the base stations since the antennae are
    directed horizontally with a 5 degree downwards tilt.
    Human studies pertaining to base stations conducted
    by Santini R et al (2002), Bortkiewicz et al (2004) &amp;
    Hutter &amp; Kundi et al (2006) do not report any
    quantitative parameters related to health hazards.
    Therefore, it can safely be concluded that the
    permission granted for installation of Mobile Base
    Station by the Panchayat would not cause as such any
    health hazards nor will it affect the fundamental rights
    guaranteed to citizens under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_83">Art. 21</a> of the
    Constitution.    Right to life enshrined under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_84">Art.21</a>
    includes all those aspects of life which make life
    meaningful, complex and worth living. Development
    of technology has its own ill-effects on human beings,
    but, at times people will have to put up with that at the
    cost of their advantages. Petitioner and others for
    installing towers will have necessarily to comply with

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    41

     the statutory provisions contained in Chapter XIX of
     the Kerala Municipal Building Rules, 1999 which
     permits construction of telecommunication towers
     over buildings. Petitioner has submitted that it has
     already satisfied all those conditions and in such
     circumstance, Panchayat has granted the licence."



Thereafter, the Court referred to the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_85">TRAI Act</a> and its powers. The

Court also, we notice, held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">           "Petitioner has not installed any generator as on
     today and if the installation of generator would cause
     any sound pollution, evidently Pollution Control
     Board can give appropriate direction and the
     petitioner will have to obtain necessary consent from
     the Pollution Control Board for installation of
     generators, so that it would not cause any sound
     pollution. So also, if the installation of Tower and the
     emission of electromagnetic waves causes any air
     pollution, affecting human health the Pollution
     Control Board can take appropriate measures under
     Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_86">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1991."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_80">Reverting back to the decision of the Full Bench, we notice that

since the Full Bench has posted the matter for consideration of the

case on merits before this Bench, it is apposite to refer to the

following findings as well:
</p>
<p id="p_81">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    42

</p><p id="p_82">     26. In the Full Bench decision, it is, inter alia, stated as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">           "The observations by the Division Bench of this
     Court earlier, as per the decision in Reliance's case
     that, as per the scientific data available as on date, it
     was not established that the activity would result in
     any health hazards, stands in tact. The respondents
     have never brought it to the notice of this Court, any
     decision or material to the contrary, so as to draw a
     different inference. In any view of the matter, this
     Court does not propose to examine the correctness or
     otherwise of the finding in Reliance's case as to the
     instance of any health hazards; more so since the
     points of reference are rather something else.
     Similarly, this Court also does not propose to go into
     the merits of the contentions raised by the respondents
     that various other licences are also required under the
     relevant provisions of Panchayat Raj Act/Kerala
     Municipality Act/ Kerala Municipal Building Rules,
     etc., which, however, is strongly rebutted from the part
     of the petitioners as well...........It may also not be
     correct to say that this Court does not have the power
     to consider the various aspects as to the alleged health
     hazards which according to the reference Court is
     surprisingly vested only with the Civil Court. Suffice
     to say, it is not a question of absence of jurisdiction,
     but a question of necessity for interference.       The
     instance of any health hazards has to be established
     with reference to tangible materials and evidence has
     to be let in; for which, it could be said that the matter
     may require to be adjudicated before the Civil Court.</blockquote><p id="p_83">
</p><p id="p_84">     But then, it is for the concerned party to plead and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    43

     prove as to the specific threat to the health hazards
     with reference to reliable materials and also as to the
     alleged infringement of any statutory prescription or
     violation of the norms prescribed. It is not for the
     petitioners to prove a `negative aspects' that there is
     no health hazard. When the petitioners have prima
     facie established their right to construct and operate
     the mobile transmission tower by obtaining all the
     required licences, it is for the objectors, if any, to
     prove infraction of their right, if any, and to show the
     dis-entitlement of the petitioners to establish a mobile
     tower by resorting to the remedy of approaching the
     licensing authorities, or to approach the Civil Court or
     by establishing their right in the Writ Petition for
     police protection. If any such objection is found prima
     facie established, this Court can certainly decline to
     grant police protection or in case the respondent fails
     to prove their right by documentary evidence, could
     still reserve his right to approach the Civil Court, as
     the burden to prove any such infraction is on the
     objector who asserts any such right. That apart, the
     observations made by the Division Bench of this Court
     in `Reliance's case' that the scientific study and the
     materials brought to light as on date did not reveal
     any such health hazards still stands, as the said
     observation has not been successfully challenged and
     no material has been produced to arrive at a different
     finding."
</p>
<p id="p_85">    27. Therefore, the first question which arises is whether any

material is produced by the respondents to establish that there is

any health hazard, at least, prima facie. We have already referred

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    44

to the findings of the Committee appointed by the Government of

India pursuant to the directions of the Bombay High Court as

extracted from the judgment in the Reliance Case.             We have

already also referred to the fact which is again considered by the

Bench in the Reliance Case that the Atomic Energy Regulatory

Board has reiterated that radio frequency waves used in mobile

phones are not covered under the definition of "radiation" as

provided in the <a href="/doc/715059/" id="a_87">Atomic Energy Act</a>, 1962, and that non-ionizing

radiations do not have the capacity to ionize the matter with which

they interact.
</p>
<p id="p_86">     28. Now, let us see the materials which are produced by the

respondents in these cases.
</p>
<p id="p_87">     W.P.(C).NO.35836/2009 Y:
</p>
<p id="p_88">The 11th respondent has, inter alia, stated that it is well settled from

scientific studies that electro magnetic radiation emanating from

mobile towers would result in health hazards and the people who

are continuously exposed to such radiation, would be badly

affected and are more prone to serious illness, like brain tumour

and cancer as a result of such continuous exposure to radiation.

There is reference to the high sound emanating from the diesel

generators. The students in the area would not be able to study in a

peaceful and noise free atmosphere. Ext.R11(f) purports to be an

Article published by one Ali Ashraf in a newspaper, highlighting

the effects of radiation. There is no mention about the credentials

of the Author of the Article by way of his expertise in the field.

Essentially, he refers to various studies. In the Reply Affidavit, the

petitioners would state that the mobile stations erected by the

petitioners are within the safety limits set by the International

Council on non-ionizing, radiation protection and it will not create

any health hazard.      The standard set by the said Council for

efficiency levels are safe and have been adopted by most of the

countries including India. Reliance is also placed on the report of

Technical Committee which is produced as Ext.P11. Ext.R11(e) is

produced by the 11th respondent as a communication from the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     46

Pollution Control Board to the Secretaries of the Panchayats

mentioned. It refers to the need for getting permission from the

generated due to absorption of microwave radiation. Exposure to

thermal effect could cause fatigue, cataracts and reduced mental

concentration. Sadly, the current exposure safety standards are

purely based on the thermal effect while ignoring the non-thermal

effects of radiation. The Author refers to various reports in news

papers from across the world. It is, inter alia, stated as follows:

      After a seventh case of brain tumor observed among
      workers in the top floors of a Melbourne office
      building, the top floors were closed down and 100
      people were evacuated. The mobile phone towers on

    7  Three groups find danger of tumors

       Sun Sentinel, florida (1.2.2006)

       Three European research groups in separate studies
       have found an increased risk of brain tumors in
       people who have used the phones for 10 years or
       more. Two of the studies found a correlation
       between the tumor's location and the side of the
       head where people reported they held the phone
       (Hardell et al 2003).
</p>
<p id="p_117">       One also suggests the greatest risk is in people who
       began using the phones before age of 20. Lennart
       Hardell found that the use of cell phones before age
       of 20 increased the risk of brain tumors by 5.2,

refer to WHO Paper on ionizing radiation. It states, inter alia, as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_125">      Energy emitted from a source is generally referred to as

radiation.   Examples include heat or light from the sun,

microwaves from an Oven, X rays from an X-ray tube, and gamma

rays from radioactive elements. Ionizing radiation is stated to be

radiation with enough energy so that during an interaction with an

atom, it can remove tightly bound electrons from the orbit of an

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     68

atom, causing the atom to become charged or ionized. Ionizing

radiation occurs in waves or particles. Radiowaves, heat waves,

infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X rays and Gamma

rays are different forms of electromagnetic radiation. They differ

only in frequency and wave length. It is also stated that longer

wave length, lower frequency waves (heat and radio) have less

energy than shorter wave length, higher frequency waves (X-ray,

gamma rays). Not all electromagnetic (EM) radiation is ionizing.

Only the high frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is

ionizing. Another paper produced is stated to be part of a series of

background paper prepared for ITU Forum (International

Telecommunication Union Forum) of the regional working group

of the private sector issues, Asia and Pacific region, in New Delhi,

India. It is a Forum said to be jointly organized by the ITU and the

      There is also lack of awareness that RF radiations emitted by

the mobile base station lie in the non-ionizing part of the

electromagnetic spectrum and thus do not have enough energy to

cause genetic damage. It is also not known to most people that the

average level of RF exposure from the base station is only 0.002

per cent, ie. 50,000 times lower than the levels laid down in the

recommended guidelines.          Then, there is reference to the

electromagnetic spectrum and it is stated that the range of

frequencies used for radio transmissions, radio frequency (RF)

signals lie in the non-ionizing part in the electromagnetic spectrum

and do not have any energy to cause genetic damage. The WHO is

quoted and it is stated by it as follows:

</p><p id="p_137">           In Ireland there are 4500 base stations in an
     area of just over 70,000 km2. If these masts were
     evenly distributed geographically no one would be
     more than 2.5 km from a mast. However because the
     distribution of masts reflects the distribution of the
     population, in urban areas no one is likely to be more
     than a kilometre from the nearest mast. This can be

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  74

    confirmed      by   accessing   the    Communications
    Regulator's website www. ComReg.ie. It is clear that
    it is no longer possible for anyone, including children,
    to live anywhere in Ireland and not be exposed to the
    RF fields emitted by phone masts.        However, it is
    equally the case that there is nowhere in Ireland
    where a child is not exposed to the RF fields produced
    by local, national and international radio and
    television broadcasting stations. Indeed there are now
    few adults who have not been exposed to radio
    broadcasts all of their lives. Furthermore, the fields
    from TV and radio stations are usually stronger than
    those from mobile phone masts.
</p>
<p id="p_138">          One reason for the absence of concern regarding
    radio and TV is that broadcasting transmitters are
    more powerful than base station phone masts, so fewer
    of them are required to cover an area. However, over
    500 transmitters are still required to provide national
    TV coverage. Another explanation is that radio and
    TV transmitters are generally located on high ground
    that is usually unpopulated; in the case of the most
    powerful transmitters exclusion areas are employed to
    restrict public access from the areas where the RF
    fields might exceed international guideline limits.

</p><p id="p_139">          The levels of public exposure to phone masts are
    usually thousands and often tens of thousands times
    below the international limits. The highest exposures
    at ground level are found some 50 m to 300 m from the
    phone mast. Fields at ground level at the site and
    within 50 m of the mast are generally lower than those
    at 200 m to 300 m distance.

          National and international health advisory
    authorities have concluded that exposure to base
    station phone masts is not associated with adverse
    health effects.    The position is summarised in a
    conclusion of the Stewart report (IEGMP, 2000):

</p><p id="p_141">                 "The balance of evidence indicates that
    there is no general risk to the health of people living
    near to base stations on the basis that exposures are
    expected to be small fractions of guidelines."

</p><p id="p_142">          The fact that exposures are very small fractions
    of the internationally accepted guidelines of ICNIRP
    has been demonstrated by the Communications
    Regulator's "400 Site Survey" (ComReg, 2004). The
    WHO workshop on children's exposure to EMF
    (WHO, 2004) also concluded that from the low
    exposures and the scientific evidence collected to date,
    it appeared highly unlikely that the weak signals to
    which people are exposed from base stations could
    cause cancer or any other adverse health effects. This
    was explained in the WHO fact sheet on mobile phone
    base stations and wireless networks (WHO, 2006).

</p><p id="p_143">          Children and base stations - conclusions:
</p>
<p id="p_144">          There is no scientific basis for, or evidence of,
    adverse health effects affecting either children or
    adults as a result of their exposure to RF fields from
    phone masts.
</p>
<p id="p_145">          This applies irrespective of the location of the
    phone mast. While the maximum exposures from a
    phone mast will occur at some distance from the mast,

       and not in its immediate vicinity nor underneath it, the

    increases in temperature of more than about 1oC, as

    than that received from a mobile phone. Because base

    epidemiological studies have been undertaken to
    examine the association between cancer incidence and
    living near RF transmitters (UK, 2004; WHO, 2005).
    These studies have provided no evidence that RF
    exposure from transmitters increases the risk of
    cancer, even though the RF exposures are much
    higher than those found near base stations (WHO,
    2006).
</p>
<p id="p_151">          It is of interest to note that more of the energy
    from the RF fields emitted by TV and FM radio
    transmitters is absorbed in the body than those from
    base stations. This is because the frequencies used in
    FM radio (around 100 Mhz) and in TV broadcasting
    (around 450MHz to 600MHz) are lower than those
    employed in mobile telephony (900 Mhz and 1800
    Mhz). At these lower frequencies the height of the
    adult human acts as a more efficient receiving
    antenna.      Children, because of their smaller size,
    absorb somewhat more RF energy at higher
    frequencies than do adults. While radio stations have
    been broadcasting for 80 years and TV for over 50
    years without being associated with adverse health
    effects, there has been only a limited amount of
    research undertaken in this area. Essentially, there
    have been few reasons to carry out such studies.

</p><p id="p_152">          Mobile telephony involves the transmission of

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   79

    complex digital signals. Soon many radio stations and
    most TV stations will also be transmitting their
    programmes digitally. Detailed reviews conducted on
    the possible health effects of digital signals have, so
    far, not revealed any hazard specific to different RF
    modulations (Foster and Repacholi, 2004; WHO,
    2005).
</p>
<p id="p_153">          In addition to these studies there have been
    occasional media reports of cancer clusters around
    mobile phone base stations and these have heightened
    public concern. When these clusters are analysed it is
    often found that the reported cluster doesn't exist. This
    can be due to a number of factors including multiple
    reporting of the same cases; some of the reported
    cancers having occurred many years before the
    existence of the base station; or that a number of the
    cancers were clearly associated with heavy smoking or
    some other more likely cause. Indeed, because cancer
    is primarily a disease that affects older people, over
    20% of the Irish population will eventually die of
    cancer.
</p>
<p id="p_154">          Although most cancer clusters reported in the
    media can be explained, the distribution of cancer in a
    population follows what is termed in statistics as a
    `Poisson distribution'. Because of this, the distribution
    of the incidence of cancer in small areas will be very
    uneven, with some locations having many more cases
    than the average, and others far fewer. Further, since
    there are 4500 phone masts in Ireland, distributed
    relatively evenly among the population, it is to be
    expected that at any location where a cancer cluster is
    reported, there is likely to be a phone mast. This does

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   80

      not mean that the phone mast is the cause of the
      cluster."

<blockquote id="blockquote_57">           What is EHS ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">           The    term   `electromagnetic    hypersensitivity'
      (EHS) is often used to denote a phenomenon where
      individuals experience adverse health effects while
      using or being in the vicinity of electric, magnetic,
      EMF sources and devices, and when the individuals
      themselves attribute their symptoms to EMF emissions
      from these sources and devices.        There are no
      standardised    diagnostic   criteria available   and,
      although the symptoms experienced vary substantially
      among the affected individuals, they are generally
      non-specific with no objective signs present.      The
      severity of the condition varies; the majority of cases
      present mild symptoms, but some people experience
      severe problems with major consequences for work
      and everyday life (SSI, 2004).

      condition among medical specialists. The symptoms
      and the distress they cause clearly exist, but, so far, no
      study has been able to prove a link between EMF
      exposure and the occurrence of symptoms. At a recent
      workshop organised by the WHO on the subject
      (WHO, 2004), it was proposed that, the term should
      not be used.       Instead the expression `idiopathic
      environmental intolerance' or IEI was suggested. The
      independent Expert Group to the Swedish Radiation
      Protection Agency, who also recommend against the
      use of the term `electromagnetic hypersensitivity',
      believe that any term that combines exposures and
      health consequences will hinder further studies (SSI,
      2004)."

<p id="p_157">It also stated that in a Swiss EHS study, it was found that the most

common reported symptoms were sleep disorders, followed by

headaches, nervousness or distress, fatigue and concentration

difficulties. It is stated that, there is no doubt, that the symptoms

affecting EHS individuals (electromagnetic sensitivity) are real and

this has led national and international authorities to investigate and

determine. It is further stated as follows:

</p><p id="p_158">      The authors in studies conducted in 2005, concluded that

while the symptoms described by EHS sufferers can be severe and

are sometimes disabling, it was difficult to show under blind

conditions that exposure to EMF can trigger these symptoms.

They concluded that EHS was unrelated to the presence of EMF

and this conclusion is shared by a United States review. It is also

stated that as sham exposure was sufficient to trigger severe

symptoms in some participants, psychological factors may have an

important role in causing this condition. In conclusion, it is stated

that a WHO workshop in Prague (WHO, 2004) attended by leading

European researchers on EHS, concluded that EHS has no

scientific basis to link its symptoms to EMF exposure. Further,

EHS is not a medical diagnosis, it is stated.

state of materials on record the radiation involved can safely be

treated as non-ionizing. It does cause thermal effect. But the thermal

effect produced is far too insignificant to constitute a perceptible health

hazard provided the radiation is confined to internationally prescribed

standards. Apparently, it is non-thermal effect which is engaging the

attention of researchers all over the world. We have already noticed

hazards as such. At any rate, we do not think that it is appropriate

for this Court with the material as such on record alone to hold that

the respondents have established that siting of the tower would pose a

health hazard sufficient enough to warrant this court to decline

jurisdiction to grant police protection if the petitioners are otherwise

entitled to the same.   We must notice that we are not called upon to

      List II ?
</p>
<p id="p_177">      42. We must also address the arguments raised on behalf of

the petitioners that no other permission is required to construct and

operate a mobile tower, in view of the fact that the Central

Legislation occupies the field. This argument is based on the

provisions of Entry 31 of List I of the VIIth Schedule. It reads as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_178">            "31. Posts and telegraphs; telephones, wireless,

      broadcasting and other like forms of communication."

It is pointed out that in exercise of exclusive legislative power, the

Central Legislature has enacted the <a href="/doc/251935/" id="a_99">Wireless Telegraphy Act</a>, the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    94

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_100">Telegraph Act</a>, and the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_101">TRAI Act</a>. They occupy the entire field.

All aspects are covered by the Central Legislation. There is no

scope for the State Legislature to legislate in respect of

construction or operation of mobile towers, as mobile telephony is

embraced within the scope of          Entry 31 of List I of the

Constitution, it is contended.     Let us consider the provisions

contained in the Central Enactments.      It is necessary that we

consider the scheme of the Central enactment as pressed by the

petitioners. <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_102">The Indian Telegraph Act</a>, 1885 defines the word

"telegraph" as follows:

     examine the impugned legislation in its pith and

    Thereafter, the Court further held as follows:


</p><p id="p_207">           "12. There can be little doubt that the growing

     nuisance of blaring loud-speakers powered by

     amplifiers of great output needed control, and the

     short question is whether this salutary measure can be

     said to fall within one or more of the Entries in the

     State List. It must be admitted that amplifiers are

     instruments     of   broadcasting      and   even    of

     communication, and in that view of the matter, they

     fall within Entry 31 of the Union List.            The

     manufacture, or the licensing of amplifiers or the

     control of their ownership or possession, including the

     regulating of the trade in such apparatus is one

     matter, but the control of the `use' of such apparatus

     though legitimately owned and possessed, to the

     detriment of tranquillity, health and comfort of others

     is quite another. It cannot be said that public health

     does not demand control of the use of such apparatus

     by day or by night, or in the vicinity of hospitals or

     schools, or offices or habited localities. The power to

     legislate in relation to public health includes the

     power to regulate the use of amplifiers as producers of

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    107

      loud noises when the right of such user, by the

      disregard of the comfort of and obligation to others,

      emerges as a manifest nuisance to them. Nor is it any

      valid argument to say that the pith and substance of

      the Act falls within Entry 31 of the Union List, because

      other loud noises, the result of some other instruments

      etc., are not equally controlled and prohibited.

</p><p id="p_208">            13. The pith and substance of the impugned Act

      is the control of the use of amplifiers in the interests of

      health    and   also    tranquillity,  and    thus    fails

      substantially (if not wholly) within the powers

      conferred to preserve, regulate and promote them and

      does not so fall within the Entry in the Union List, even

      though the amplifier, the use of which is regulated and

      controlled is an apparatus for broadcasting or

      communication."

This Judgment has been referred to in <a href="/doc/698472/" id="a_135">State of Maharashtra v.

Parliament to make laws in respect of matters in List I. This power

is conferred notwithstanding anything contained in Clauses (2) and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     111

(3) of the same Article. <a href="/doc/1817786/" id="a_140">Article 246 (2)</a> deals with matters in the

concurrent list with which we are not concerned. Sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_141">article (3)</a>

deals with the exclusive power of the State Legislature to make

laws in respect of matters in List 2 of the VIIth Schedule. It is

pertinent to note that <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_142">Article 246(3)</a> begins with the words "Subject

to Clauses (1) and (2)".       Thus, the scheme of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_143">Article 246</a> is

essentially the supremacy of the Parliament in the federal set up

envisaging distribution of legislative powers between the two

legislative organs. This result is inevitable, bearing in mind, the

non-obstanti clause in <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_144">Article 246(1)</a> and it is made clear further by

the opening words of Sub-<a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_145">article (3)</a> as the power of the

Legislature of the State is made subject to Clauses (1) and (2).

</p><p id="p_219">      49. Lists 1 to 3 of the VIIth Schedule enumerate, as it is well

settled, fields of legislation. Individual entries are to be construed

in a most wide and liberal manner. The framers of the Constitution

have designed the lists intending to deal with different fields of

legislation.    However, overlapping cannot be ruled out and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    112

experience shows that often, superior Courts have had to deal with

the issue arising from legislative exercises made by Parliament and

the State Legislatures, giving rise to questions of occupied field,

doctrine of pith and substance and repugnancy. It is to be at once

noted that essentially the doctrine of repugnancy is appropriately

traceable to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_146">Article 254</a> of the Constitution. The scheme of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_147">Article

254</a> would appear as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_220">      Both Parliament and the State Legislatures have legislative

power to legislate on the fields of legislation indicated in List 3.

However, any law made by the State Legislature must give way to

the law made by the Parliament, if the provisions are irreconcilable

or in other words, if the provisions of the law made by the State is

repugnant to the law made by the Parliament. Of course, Sub-

<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_148">article (2)</a> provides for the exceptional case whereunder State

Legislature makes a law and reserves the Bill for the assent of the

President and assent is accorded.             In such an event,

notwithstanding the provisions contained in such law which are

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES      113

repugnant to the Central Legislation, the State law will prevail in

the State over the Central law.
</p>
<p id="p_221">       50. Coming back to <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_149">Article 246</a>, it becomes necessary to

appreciate that since the Lists have been made intending to

earmark different and exclusive fields of legislation for Parliament

and the State Legislatures (Lists 1 and 2), it is the duty of the

Courts when faced with the contention that the law made by the

State constitutes an encroachment upon the legislative province of

the Parliament, to conduct an enquiry as to what is the true scope

of the enactment in substance. That is to say, the Court will look at

the entries and the law and find out whether, in pith and substance,

the law actually is encompassed within the four walls of an entry in

List 2 and encroachment if any, on a matter covered by List 1, is

purely incidental. This is what the doctrine of pith and substance

is all about. In that juncture, it is also necessary to bear in mind the

aspect theory. A subject matter may have different aspects and,

therefore, a subject matter can give rise to the two legislatures

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     114

possessing legislative power in respect of the different aspects of

the very same subject matter. It is only if after effort is made to

harmonise the different legislation and if possible, to support the

legislation, if it is in substance supported by the entries in List 2

and it becomes impossible for both the Central legislation and

State legislation to operate together that the Courts would be

constrained to hold to accord supremacy to the Central legislation.

This, we think, is the effect of the various decisions.

</p><p id="p_222">      51.   We would only refer to        a few.    <a href="/doc/130570/" id="a_150">In Kerala State

Electricity Board v. The Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd</a>. (1976 (1)

SCC 466), the Court, inter alia, held as follows:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_114">                "There is, in the arguments on behalf of the
         respondents, a certain amount of confusion. The
         question of repugnance arises only in case both the
         legislations fall within the same (sic entry in ) List
         III.     There can, therefore, be no question of
         repugnance between the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_151">Electricity Act</a> and the
         <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_152">Electricity (Supply) Act</a> on the one hand and the
         Kerala Act on the other, if the former fall in List I or
         List III and the latter in List II. If any legislation is
         enacted by a State Legislature in respect of a matter

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    115

        falling within List I that will be without jurisdiction
        and therefore void.........In view of the provisions of
        <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_153">Article 254</a>, the power of Parliament to legislate in
        regard to matters in List III, which are dealt with by
        clause (2), is supreme. The Parliament has exclusive
        power to legislate with respect to matters in List I.
        The State legislature has exclusive power to legislate
        with respect to matters in List II. But this is subject
        to the provisions of clause (1) [leaving out for the
        moment the reference to clause (2)]. The power of
        Parliament to legislate with respect to matters
        included in List I is supreme notwithstanding any
        thing contained in clause (3) [again leaving out of
        consideration the provisions of clause (2)]. Now
        what is the meaning of the words "notwithstanding"</blockquote><p id="p_223">
</p><p id="p_224">        in clause (1) and "subject to" in clause (3) ? They
        mean that where an entry is in general terms in List
        II and part of that entry is in specific terms in List I,
        the entry in List I takes effect notwithstanding the
        entry in List II. This is also on the principle that the
        'special' excludes the 'general' and the general entry
        in List II is subject to the special entry in List I. For
        instance, though house accommodation and rent
        control might fall within either the State list or the
        concurrent list, Entry 3 in List I of Seventh Schedule
        carves out the subject of rent control and house
        accommodation in cantonments from the general
        subject of house accommodation and rent control
        (see <a href="/doc/415355/" id="a_154">Indu Bhusan v. Sundari Devi</a>). Furthermore,
        the word 'notwithstanding' in clause (1) also means
        that if it is not possible to reconcile the two entries
        the entry in List I will prevail.      But before that
        happens attempt should be made to decide in which
        list a particular legislation falls. For deciding under

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   116

         which entry a particular legislation falls the theory
         of "pith and substance" has been evolved by the
         courts. If in pith and substance a legislation falls
         within one list or the other but some portion of the
         subject-matter   of  that    legislation   incidentally
         trenches upon and might come to fall under another
         list, the Act as      a whole would be valid
         notwithstanding such incidental trenching.       These
         principles have been laid down in a number of
         decisions."
</p>
<p id="p_225">     52. Interestingly, the question arose as to whether the

doctrine of pith and substance is applicable to a situation where the

law made by the Central Legislature and the law made by the State

Legislature, though falling in the Concurrent List were under

different Entries. Justice K. Ramaswamy, took the view that the

doctrine of pith and substance cannot be employed in such a

scenario, but the majority held the view that even if the legislation

is apparently conflicting and is traceable to different Entries in the

Concurrent List, the doctrine of pith and substance is available to

ascertain whether there is repugnancy (<a href="/doc/1506108/" id="a_155">See Vijay Kumar Sharma

And Others v. State of Karnataka and Others</a> (1990 (2) SCC

</p><p id="p_226">562). We would think essentially, the concept of "occupied field"

</p><p id="p_227">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     117

is more apposite in the context of the doctrine of repugnancy

which is applicable only when the legislation in question is

traceable to the Concurrent List. As far as the question as to

whether the legislation falls in the Entries in List I or II, it is to be

resolved with the aid of the doctrine of pith and substance and as

held in the Indian Aluminium Company's Case (supra), it is only

if it is not possible to reconcile two legislations, the law made by

Parliament will prevail and it is for deciding as to under which

Entry the legislation falls, the theory of pith and substance is

employed.
</p>
<p id="p_228">       53. Now let us deal with the specific legislation and entries.

Entry 31, no doubt, deals with posts and telegraphs, telephones,

wireless, broadcasting and other like forms of communications. It

is true that in the exercise of the legislative power conferred under

Entry 31, Parliament has enacted the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_156">Telegraph Act</a>, Wireless

Telegraph Act and <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_157">TRAI Act</a>. It is also equally true that mobile

phone and the erection of towers are comprehended within the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    118

scope of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_158">Telegraph Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_159">TRAI Act</a>. We have already

extracted <a href="/doc/307295/" id="a_160">Section 11</a> conferring functions upon the Authority under

the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_161">TRAI Act</a>. We have also extracted and referred to the

provisions in the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_162">Telegraph Act</a>. We would think that the said

enactments do not specifically deal with the place where the

mobile towers are to be located. They do not appear to deal with

the sites of the mobile towers. Section 233 of the Panchayat Raj

Act and the corresponding provisions of the <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_163">Municipalities Act</a>, on

the other hand purport to deal with the issue of public health in

substance. It is at this juncture, we must recall the words of Entry

6 of List II.    The State Legislature under the said Entry is

empowered to make laws in regard to public health and sanitation,

inter alia. Therefore, the State Legislature has the exclusive power

to make laws in respect of public health. If, therefore, we conclude

that mobile tower is a "work place" or/and the component parts are

"machinery" and, therefore, permission under the State enactment

is mandatory and since, the purport of the State enactment is the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   119

protection of the public health by way of obviating or minimising

nuisance and pollution, particularly in the context of a densely

populated area, then necessarily we must hold that in pith and

substance, Section 233 of the Panchayat Raj Act, is a law which

falls in Entry 6 and, when it applies to the mobile tower or to the

"machinery" therein, the encroachment, if we consider it as one, on

the powers of the Central Legislature under Entry 31 of List 1, is

barely incidental. We would appear to be fortified in the view we

take, having regard to the principle laid down by the Apex Court in

Chavlas case (supra) (AIR 1959 SC 543). No doubt, Shri. Philip

Mathew has contended that, that was a case where there was no

law made by the Parliament, but in this case, there are laws made

by the Parliament as aforesaid occupying the field and they cannot

square with each other. We have already found that nothing in the

laws made by the Parliament really deal with the question of sites

of the mobile towers or the public health aspects. We must take it

that the Parliament was aware that public health is the subject

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    120

which is consigned under the Constitution to be exclusive domain

of the State Legislatures. This is particularly so, having regard to

the fact that it is a local legislature which would be better

equipped, to know more of the specific problems having regard to

the topography, the density of population, the salient features

which are present in one State, which may not be present in

another State. The matter is best left for the consideration of the

legislatures of the different States.     We must note that the

petitioners do not have any compliant about acquiring a permit

under the Municipal Building Rules for constructing the towers.

Entry 5, in fact, of List II deals with Local Government, that is to

say, the constitution and powers of Municipal Corporations,

Improvement      Trusts,   District   Boards,  Mining    Settlement

Authorities and other local Authorities for the purpose of Local

Self Government or village administration. There cannot be any

dispute that the Panchayat Raj Act and the Municipality Act and

also the Building Rules made under the Municipality Act which

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    121

are made applicable to the Panchayats also in the State of Kerala

are traceable to Entry 5 of List II.     It is not the case of the

petitioners that (except BSNL where also it relies ultimately on the

Rules) they are exempted from taking the permit under the

Building Rules. If the argument of the petitioners were to be

accepted, then, could it not also be argued that as they have licence

under the Central enactment that is, under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_164">Telegraph Act</a>, they

are free to put up the tower free from all control and without any

restrictions. Therefore, this aspect also would go a long way to

reinforce us in our view we take that the Central enactments,

namely the <a href="/doc/251935/" id="a_165">Wireless Telegraphy Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_166">Telegraph Act</a> and the

<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_167">TRAI Act</a>, notwithstanding, the State Legislature is not denuded

of the legislative power under Entry 6 to make laws to protect

public health or otherwise, catering to public health and we have

no doubt in our minds that the provisions of the Panchayat Raj Act

is geared in substance to preserve and protect the public health.

We, therefore, repel the contention of the petitioners that no other

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     122

permission can be predicated from State Legislatures in their

attempts to secure public health, if otherwise, the activities in

question attract the wrath of the provisions.

</p><p id="p_229">           Whether a base station is a "workplace" under

    <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_168">Section 233(1)</a> (a) of the Panchayat Raj Act and

    corresponding provision of         the Municipality Act ?



</p><p id="p_230">       54. The arguments of some of the petitioners would appear to

be that they have approached this Court seeking protection for

construction of    the towers.     They are either the infrastructure

providers or persons who have entered into agreements with

infrastructure providers. They would contend that as per the interim

orders they have already proceeded with the construction and the

embargo against the commissioning of the tower was put only because

of the view taken      by the Division Bench that a writ for police

protection would not lie in the matter and now that the Full Bench has

held that a writ of police protection would lie, it is contended that no

dispute remained in the matter. It is also contended that they have

not put up any equipment.
</p>
<p id="p_231">      55. Shri. P. Chandrasekhar, however, would point out that the

matter was left open by the Full Bench and interim orders were

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES        123

obtained under which they proceeded to construct and it does not lie in

their mouth to say that this court should not go into the question as to

whether any other permission is required. He would contend that it

does not suffice to operate a tower unless permission is obtained

under Sec.233 of the Panchayat Raj Act, as the tower when it is

operational, is a workplace.        He would further contend that the

permission under Chapter XXI of the Panchayat Raj Act would be

required to put up the tower as it is a "building" as defined under the

Act. It is necessary in this context to refer to the pleadings in the

cases in which he appears. In W.P.(C).No.24384/09, in the Counter

Affidavit filed by respondents 3 to 6, it is, inter alia, stated that Section

235H of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act prohibits construction without

permission. It is also stated that <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_169">Section 235B</a> to G has not been

satisfied in respect of the mobile tower and, therefore, the construction

is illegal. It is also stated that the Permit is granted to construct tower

on the building which is only about 150 Sq. Feet and it is issued

without inspecting the said building and without any application of

mind. The mobile tower is stated to be a building. There is no Reply

Affidavit filed. In W.P.(C).no.14094/2010, in the Counter Affidavits

filed by respondents 5 and 9, it is, inter alia, stated as follows:

</p><p id="p_232">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES       124

      Petitioner has not obtained from the Secretary of the Panchayat,

approval of the site where the telecommunication tower is sought to be

constructed under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_170">Section 235F</a>. The telecommunication tower is a

"building" and site approval is mandatory.          Without site approval,

permission cannot be granted under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_171">Section 235G</a>. It is further stated

specifically that the mobile base station or telecommunication tower is

a "workplace" and, therefore, permission is necessary under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_172">Section

232</a> and permission has not been obtained.             It is also stated that

Permit under the Building Rules is not sufficient, as the Rules are

subordinate legislation and permission under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_173">Section 232</a> and approval

and sanction under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_174">Section 235F</a> and G are necessary. Petitioner does

not have all the Permits and approval required for construction of

telecommunication tower. Shri P. Chandrasekhar would point out that

the respondents had in mind permission under Section 233 of the

Panchayat Raj Act in answer to the contention of the petitioners that a

case under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_175">Section 233</a> was not specifically pleaded. In the Reply

Affidavit filed by the petitioner in this case, it is, inter alia, stated that

there is no prescribed form for issuing Permit under Section 235H of

the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act. It is further stated that Section 235F

and 235H of the Panchayat Raj Act should be read harmoniously vis-a-</p><pre id="pre_10">

vis the Building Rules.      It is further stated that when there is no

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     125

</pre><p id="p_233">prescribed form in the Act, it is to be interpreted that if the petitioner

submits application under Rule 141 (1) of the Building Rules and the

Secretary of the Panchayat issues the Permit under Rule 141(8), it

should be presumed that the mandates contained in <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_176">Section 235F</a> and

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_177">235H</a> has been complied with. No separate permission is required

from the Panchayat under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_178">Section 235J</a>, if the building permit is

obtained under the Kerala Municipality Building Rules. After 6.6.2007,

applications for permit is under Rule 141 (1) of the Building Rules and

prior to the said date, on applications being given to the Panchayat

Authority under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_179">Section 235F</a>, No Objection Certificates were being

issued under Section 253J of the Panchayat Raj Act. It is stated that

the telecommunication tower will not come under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_180">Section 232</a>.

Telecommunication tower is not a "work place", it is contended. There

are other allegations.
</p>
<p id="p_234">      56.   Sri. Vinod Madhavan, learned counsel on behalf of the

Panchayat in the writ petition, as noted, has also contended that the

component parts of a tower would constitute machinery under

Sec.233 (1) (b) of the Panchayat Raj Act. There is no pleading by

any of the local authorities that permission is required under Sec.233

or any other provision.     Of course, Sri. P. Chandrasekhar would

contend that the component parts would constitute machinery and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     126

their installation must be preceded by permission. But, at any rate he

would submit that, that     may be an issue to be gone into by the

primary authority, namely the local body. Learned Government Pleader

would submit that the tower would not be a "work place", but the

component parts would constitute "machinery".

</p><p id="p_235">        57. Considering the matter, we are of the view that we must

go into the question as to whether the mobile tower when it is

operational would constitute a workplace. The word 'workplace' has

not been defined in the Act.       So also, the words "factory" and

"workshop" are not defined in the Act. As far as the word "factory" is

concerned, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_181">Factories Act</a> 1948 (Central enactment ) defines the

word "factory". The words "factory", "workshop" and "workplace" are

all defined in the Travancore-Cochin Public Health Act 1955. They read

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_115">             "2. Definitions.- In this Act, unless there is

       anything repugnant in the subject or context,-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_116">             (12) "Factory" means any premises, including the

       precincts thereof, wherein any industrial, manufacturing

       or trade process is carried on with the aid of steam,

       water, oil, gas, electrical or any other form of power

       which is mechanically transmitted and is not generated by

       human or animal agency."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_117">             (42)   "Workplace" means any premises including

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     127

       the precincts thereof (not being a factory or a workshop),

       wherein is carried on any industrial, manufacturing or

       trade process, at which not less than five persons are

       employed for wages or any other remuneration."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_118">             (43) "Workshop" means any premises including the

       precincts thereof (not being a factory), wherein any

       article or part of an article is made, repaired, altered,

       ornamented, finished or otherwise adapted for use on a

       commercial basis and not less than five persons are

       employed for that purpose for wages or any other

       remuneration."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_119">             58. If we go by the definition of "workplace" in the <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_182">Public

Health Act</a>, undoubtedly there can be no doubt that the mobile tower

would not be a workplace for the simple reason that there is no

industrial, commercial or trade activities involved therein. The

requirement of five employees also is not fulfilled.      However, the

argument of Sri. P. Chandrasekar is that the context and the object of

the <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_183">Public Health Act</a> differs from the object of the Panchayat Raj Act

and <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_184">Municipalities Act</a>. He would seek to establish this pointing out

that Sec.39 of the Travancore-Cochin Public Health Act which deems

certain acts and omissions as nuisance would go to indicate that the

legislature was actually concerned with the interest of the employees

in the workplace, factories and workshops and that was why a criteria

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES        128

based on the number of employees is provided in the definition of the

word 'workplace' also. He would also rely on the judgment of the Apex

Court in Consumer Education and Research Centre and Others v.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_236">Union of India and others (AIR 1995 SC 923) wherein the Apex

Court has stated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_120">     "30. It would thus be clear that in an appropriate case, the Court

     would give appropriate directions to the employer, be it the State

     or its undertaking or private employer to make the right to life

     meaningful; to prevent pollution of work place; protection of the

     environment; protection of the health of the workman or to

     preserve free and unpolluted water for the safety and health of the

     people. The authorities or even private persons or industry are

     bound by the directions issued by this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_185">Article 32</a> and

     <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_186">Article 142</a> of the Constitution."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_237">He would further contend that having regard to the wording of Sec.233

of the Panchayat Raj Act, while each and every place may not be a

workplace for the mere reason that some work is being done, the

crucial criteria to render a place as "workplace" within the meaning of

Sec.233 would be whether the principal work is one which is done with

the aid of power. Where work is done employing steam power, water

power, mechanical power or electric power, it would be a workplace,

he submits. He would say that an Advocate's office may not be a

workplace. He would contend that in an Advocate's office, the chief

work would be the intellectual work of the lawyer and while there may

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     129

be fans, lights and even computers, the main work is not done by

using electricity. There is also no propensity for such work to produce

any nuisance or pollution and the work by itself is innocuous. Thus, in

a general sense while it can be said that a place where the work is

done would be a workplace, Sri. P. Chandrasekhar would contend that

it is not his case that all places where any work is done would be

workplace. He draws the distinction which we have already pointed

out. He would contend that without consuming electric power, the

main work which goes on in a mobile tower station would be

inconceivable, as work on the tower is systematic work of receiving

and transmitting information and messages on the back                of

electromagnetic energy. He also points out in this regard the

provisions of the Building Rules to contend that there is a work room,

etc. Generators are installed. He would further contend that the fact

that no particular number of employees are regularly stationed in the

mobile tower would not detract from the tower being a workplace and

the court should not lose focus of the core issue which is whether the

systematic work is being done in the said place established by an

operator for doing his business. He would further submit that the

statute in question is an on going statute and therefore the court must

give new meaning to the words in question. He would also press into

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES        130

service the Heydon principle namely the Mischief Rule and in this

regard he relied on the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_187">K. P. Varghese

v. Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam and another</a> (AIR 1981 SC

1922) In the said decision the Apex Court has, inter alia, held as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_121">             "It is a sound rule of construction of a statute firmly

      established in England as far back as 1584 when

      Heydon's case (1584) 3 Co. Rep-7a was decided that

      "...........for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes

      in general.........four things are to be discerned and

      considered: "(1) What was the common law before the

      making of the Act, (2) What was the mischief and defect

      for which the common law did not provide, (3) What

      remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to

      cure the disease of the Commonwealth, and (4) The true

      reason of the remedy, and then the Office of all the

      Judges is always to make such construction as shall

      suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_238">He would point out that Sec.97 of the 1960 Act corresponding to

Sec.233(1) of the present Panchayat Raj Act constitutes a conscious

value judgment of the legislature to create a new right and to enforce

a new liability, that is to say, the common law did not provide for

permission from local body for establishing a factory, workplace or

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES        131

workshop and right at common law consisted of then right to sue if

there was nuisance after the factory, workplace or workshop were

commissioned and started operations. The driving force was to secure

public health. Nuisance and pollution being aspects of public health

the State sought to secure the interest of the public by insisting on

permission even for establishing such ventures as are stated. Having

regard to the deleterious effect attributed to radiation emanating from

mobile towers and having regard to the fact that it is an ongoing

statute, the word "workplace" must comprehend the mobile tower

even though it may be true that it was not even contemplated in the

year 1960 when the Panchayats Act was enacted or even in 1994

when the present enactments both the Panchayat Raj Act and

Municipality Act were enacted. It is in this context, he relied on the

decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1269902/" id="a_188">State v. Chaudhary</a> (1996 (1) KLT 454

(SC) where the Apex Court was considering the question whether a

typewriter expert could be examined under <a href="/doc/1025384/" id="a_189">Section 45</a> of the Evidence

Act even though the word used in Sec.45 inter alia refer only to

handwriting expert. The Apex Court inter alia held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_122">     "In the present case, even without resort of the word

     'handwriting' in S.45 to include typewriting therein, in the view we

     have taken the word 'science' is wide enough to meet the

     requirement of treating the opinion of a typewriter expert as an

     opinion evidence coming within the ambit of S.45 of the Evidence

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES        132

     Act. We may, however, add that the long accepted practice of

     judicial construction which enabled the reading of the word

     'telegraph' to include 'telephone' within the meaning of that word

     in Acts of 1863 and 1869 when telephone was not invented, would

     also be available in the present case to read 'typewriting' within

     the meaning of word 'handwriting' in the Act of 1872. This is so

     because what was understood by handwriting in 1872 must now in

     the present times after more than a century of the enactment of

     that provision, be necessarily understood to include typewriting as

     well, since typing has become more common than handwriting and

     this change is on account of the availability of typewriters and their

     common use much after the statute was enacted in 1872. This is

     an additional reason for us to hold that the opinion of the

     typewriter expert in this context is admissible under S.45 of the

     Indian Evidence Act."
</blockquote>
             59.   Still further the Apex Court in Kashmir Singh v.<p id="p_239">

Union of India and Others ((2008) 7 SCC 259) further approved

the concept of ongoing statute and held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_123">             "The courts while construing an ongoing statute

      must take into consideration the changes in the societal

      condition. The courts should also take into consideration

      development in science and technology."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_240">Per contra, it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners

that a tower would not be a workplace. There are no workmen as

such employed for the mobile tower. Occasionally somebody may have

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES       133

to go for doing the maintenance work.              But by no stretch of

imagination it could be called a workplace. The legislature never had

intended to embrace a mobile tower in the word "workplace" either in

1960 or in 1994 when it authored the enactments.

</p><p id="p_283">      62. The word "workplace" has been defined in the Chambers

Dictionary as meaning "the office, factory, etc. where one works".

There is no indication in <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_208">Section 233</a> in express words to the effect

as to whether it must be a place where there are workers employed

for carrying out any work. However, there is some indication

forthcoming in Rule 12 of the Dangerous Offensive Trade and

Factories Rules, 1996 which we have extracted. It could be said

that it does not apply where no workers are needed. The

Explanation assigns the same meaning as to the worker in sub-

rules (2) and (6) as is assigned in the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_209">Factories Act</a>, 1948. Sub-rule

(2) does contemplate specification of the maximum number of

workers proposed to be employed on a day in the workplace

among other places. Again, sub-rule (6) of Rule 12 provides that

in respect of a workplace coming under the purview of the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_210">Factories Act</a>, 1948 can be employed only after obtaining

permission under sub-rule (3) authorising such employment or

after submitting application for fresh permission before the Village

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  142

Panchayat authorising such employment. As far as Section 448 of

the Kerala Municipality Act is concerned, this indication as to

workmen employed is reflected in the parent legislation itself,

namely <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_211">Section 448</a> sub-section (2) which we have extracted. The

application to be given is to indicate the maximum number of

workers proposed to be employed in the workplace and among

other places.   The word "worker" used in sub-section (2) is

assigned the same meaning as it carries under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_212">Factories Act</a>,

1948 (See Explanation in <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_213">Section 448</a>). The concept of the word

"factory" as defined in the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_214">Factories Act</a>, 1948 is as a place where

manufacturing process is carried on. Of course, it does not include

a mine and certain excepted categories which are not relevant for

us to pursue. The word "worker" is defined under <a href="/doc/1980271/" id="a_215">Section 2(l)</a> of

the Factories Act as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_130">           "Sec.2(l): "Worker" means a person employed,

In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of Words And Phrases (Vol.3), it is

noted that a cab proprietor's yard to which cab drivers go as hirers

of cabs was a "work-place" under Section 38 of the Public Health

(London) Act, 1891 (See 1900 (2) Q.B. 397). We further notice

that a road has been held to be not a working place within <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_225">Section

49</a> of the Coal Mines Act, 1911 and <a href="/doc/1734709/" id="a_226">Section 48(1)</a> of the Mines and

Quarries Act, 1954 (See 1954 (1) WLR 264). We notice the

following commentaries under the heading "working place":

      constructing the working roadhead to the coal face,

      working in a "working place" within the meaning of
      these sections (Walsh v. National Coal Board (1956) 1
      Q.B. 511). Such a "working place" includes any place
      where a man works, or is sent to work, or is expected

      place because an element of danger arises (Venn v.</blockquote><p id="p_289">

     the meaning of s.48(1) of the 1954 Act (Hammond v.
     National Coal Board (1984) 1 W.L.R. 1218).

     working-platform     and    should   have    the  same
     characteristics.   A man painting a roof without a

     (gill v. donald Humberstone &amp; co. (1963) 1 W.l/R.
</p><p id="p_292">     929). To fall within this regulation a place had to be a
     place where a man was going to work for an
     appreciable time, a comparatively small area, and
     level; for example, a new flat concrete roof (Kelly v.
     Pierhead (1967) 1 W.l.r. 65). But, a duckboard lying
     flat on the lower half of a barrel-shaped roof was held
     not to be a "working place" within this regulation

     after the removal of scaffolding, a workman was
     instructed to remove some scaffold boards from a flat
     roof, and in doing so, fell and was injured, it was held
     that as the 10 to 15 minutes required to do the job was
     an appreciable time, the roof was a "working place"

with "workplace" as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_137">            "415. Workplace: Any workplace in which, with
      the permission of or under agreement with the owner
      or occupier, two or more persons carry on any work
      which would constitute the workplace a factory if they
      were in the employment of the owner or occupier, is
      deemed to be a factory. If the workplace is not a
      tenement factory or part of a tenement factory, the
      provisions of the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_228">Factories Act</a>, 1961 apply as if the
      owner or occupier were the occupier of a factory and
      the persons working in it were employed in the
      factory."

<p id="p_294">No doubt, it could be said that the laws were essentially labour

legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_295">      64. In the conspectus of all the decisions, the concepts and

the definitions which we have referred to, we are of the view that a

mobile tower would not be a "workplace" within the meaning of

Section 233 of the Panchayat Raj Act or <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_229">Section 448</a> of the

Municipalities Act. As already noted, both enactments are of the

year 1994 and they are patterned on the provisions of Section 97 of

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    149

the Kerala Panchayats Act, 1960 and the corresponding provisions

of the <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_230">Municipalities Act</a>, 1960.     The word "workshop" is found

in the company of the words "Factory" and "Workshop". The

intention of the Legislature is to promote public health by creating

safeguards by subjecting even proposal to establish factories,

workshops and workplaces to scrutiny and to grant permission

conditionally or unconditionally or even to refuse permission. The

concept of    "Factory", inevitably involves the employment of

"workmen". <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_231">Under the Factories Act</a>, a factory is inextricably

intertwined with the concept of manufacturing process. Of course,

the word "manufacturing process" has been defined to embrace

within its scope various activities and it is not to be confused with

the concept of bringing a new product into existence. We have

already noticed that under the Panchayat Raj (Issue of Licence to

Dangerous And Offensive Trades And Factories) Rules, 1996 as

also Section 247 of the Kerala Municipalities Act, the concept of

"worker" is to be the same as the concept in the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_232">Factories Act</a>.

employed in a manufacturing process or in cleaning any machinery

or premises used for a manufacturing process or any work which is

incidental or connected with the manufacturing process. Having

regard to the definition of the word "manufacturing process", we

are of the view that the activity which is carried out in a mobile

tower cannot be treated as a manufacturing process. At any rate,

we would think that drawing light from the definition of the word

"workplace" in the Travancore - Cochin Public Health Act, that

the activity which is carried on in a mobile tower cannot be treated

as an industrial, manufacturing or a trade process. The fact that the

mobile tower operates or works without any employee or workmen

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     153

having to attend to it with any measure of regularity fortifies our

view that it cannot be treated as a workplace, as intended by the

Legislature. We would think that not only must systematic work

be done with the aid of power as stated therein, but there must be at

least a few employees who attend to the work with some measure

of regularity. This feature is certainly not present in the case of a

mobile tower and the presence of an occasional worker, essentially

for doing maintenance once in a while, cannot render the place a

workplace.

<p id="p_300">      68. We do not think that it would be reasonable in the

circumstances to consider it as a workplace on the principle that

the Court must do so on the basis that the enactment is an ongoing

statute. In this regard, the said principle must be applied with great

care, as any interpretation in this direction must also be adopted

with due regard to the consequences which flow from such

interpretation being placed.

      Chapter XXI of the Panchayat Raj Act ? Whether a

      mobile tower is a "building" ?
</p>
<p id="p_303">       It is the argument of Shri. P. Chandrasekhar that permission

is also required under Sections 235F, 235H, 235P and 235Q of the

Panchayat Raj Act. Chapter XXI of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act

deals with the heading "buildings". The word "building" has been

defined in the Panchayat Raj Act in <a href="/doc/1171238/" id="a_237">Section 2</a> (iii) as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_147">                "Unless   the   context   otherwise   requires,
       "Building" includes a house, a out-house, stable,
       latrine, shed, hut and any other structure, whether of
       masonry, bricks, wood, mud, metal, or any other
       material whatsoever"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_304">It is, therefore, contended that a mobile tower being comprehended

within the words "any other structure" would be a building and,

therefore, the relevant provisions in Chapter XXI would apply.

There is an identical definition of the word "building" in the

Municipality Act also.      It is pertinent to note that the Kerala

Municipality Building Rules, 1999, which came into force on

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   155

1.10.1999 defines the word "building" as follows:

<p id="p_315">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   157

It is in Chapter XIX of the Building Rules that provisions are

specifically made for telecommunication towers. It is to be further

noted that the Municipal Building Rules have been extended to the

Panchayats, since 6.6.2007. Besides the Rules, certain provisions

of the Municipality Act are made applicable. They are as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_153">           "Clauses (2), (3), (19), (32), (34), (38) and (46) of

      schedules in so far as they relate to the matters

      specified in Chapter XVII of the Kerala municipality

      Act, 1994 (20 of 1994)."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_316">The power to extend the provisions of the Municipal Laws is

contained in Section 274 of the Panchayat Raj Act. Section 274 of

the Panchayat Raj Act reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_154">           "274. Extension of provisions of the Municipal
      laws or of the rules thereunder.- (1) The Government
      may, whether at the request of the Panchayat or
      otherwise, by notification in the Gazette, declare that
      any of the provisions of the law relating to

</blockquote>
<p id="p_317">It is in Chapter XXVI dealing with supplemental provisions that

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_238">Section 274</a> figures. Shri. P. Chandrasekhar would argue that the

dichotomy which arises is that while under Rule 140A of the

Municipal Building Rules, which is incorporated with effect from

22.2.2001, no site approval is necessary for construction of

telecommunication towers, telecommunication pole structures or

accessory rooms essential for such service, Section 235G of the

Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 prohibits grant of permission to construct

or reconstruct a building unless and until site approval is obtained.

He would remind us that the law recognises the supremacy of a

parent enactment over subordinate legislation and, therefore, it is

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_239">Section 235G</a> which must prevail.
</p>
<p id="p_318">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  159

</p><p id="p_319">      70. We will first consider the question whether a mobile

tower is a "building". As already noted, it is in Chapter XIX that

(Rules 130 to 142) telecommunication towers are dealt with. Shri.

V. G. Arun would point out that Rule 130 of the Municipal

Building Rules, 1999 provides that no person shall erect or re-erect

any tower or pole structures except without first obtaining a

separate permit for each tower. He would point out in other words,

that the rule giver has deliberately chosen not to use the word

"building" in Rule 130 of the Municipality Building Rules to

describe a telecommunication tower. Therefore, he would contend

that a telecommunication tower would not be a "building" within

the meaning of the Panchayat Raj Act or the Municipality Act and,

therefore, permission is not required and only a Permit under

Chapter XIX of the Municipality Building Rules is required. In

this regard, he also referred to Rule 143 of the     Municipality

Building Rules. It provides for regularisation of unpermitted

construction and deviations.     Rule 143 of the Municipality

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  160

Building Rules being relevant, is extracted hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_156">          "143.    Power of the Secretary to regularise

    certain constructions.- The Secretary shall have the

    power to regularise construction or reconstruction or

    addition or alteration of any building or digging of

    any well or telecommunication tower or any structure

    or land development or any work for which permission

    of the Secretary is necessary under this rule

    commenced, being carried on or completed without

    obtaining approved plan or in deviation of the

    approved plan;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_157">          Provided      that     such     construction    or

    reconstruction or addition or alteration of any

    building or digging of any well shall not be in

    violation of any of the provisions of the Act or these

    rules:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_158">          Provided further that such power shall not

    relieve the Secretary of his responsibility in detecting

    and preventing such work and in taking other actions

    as per these rules;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_159">          Provided also that when the construction or work

    was commenced, being carried on or completed after

      the statutory period specified in Rules 15, 97, 126 or

      141 and as per rules, such construction or work shall

      be considered as duly permitted and not one requiring

      regularisation."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_320">He would contend that the said Rule, in fact, speaks about

regularisation of construction or reconstruction, inter alia, of any

building or digging of any well or telecommunication tower or any

structure or land development or any work for which permission of

the Secretary is necessary. He would, therefore, contend that the

law contemplates building, well, telecommunication towers, inter

alia, as falling in different categories. He would submit that this

Rule    would     give   a   clear  indication  therefore,   that  a

telecommunication towers cannot be the same as a building and as

they   are    used   in   the   same    provision  and,   therefore,

telecommunication tower is something different from a building.

Shri. A. Mohamed Mustaque, in this connection, would point out

that the Building Rules have been made not only under Section

381 of the Kerala Municipality Act which provides specifically for

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  162

enacting rules relating to buildings and other provisions under

Chapter XVIII, but also, under Section 565 of the Municipality

Act. Section 565 of the Municipality Act provides for general

power with the Government to make rules to carry out all or any

purposes of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_321">     71. As already noted, "building" has been defined in the Act.

The definition is couched in the widest possible manner, that is to

say, it includes a house, outhouse, stable, latrine, shed, hut, bunk

and any other structure whether of masonry, wood, brick, mud,

metal or any other material whatsoever. The word "structure" is

not defined in the Municipality Act.     The word "structure" is

defined, as already noted, in Rule 2(cc) of the Municipality

Building Rules as meaning anything that is built or constructed or

building of any kind or any piece of work, artificially built up or

composed or part joined together in some definite manner. What is

more the definition further says that the term structure includes

building. We have already noted that the word "building" in fact,

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    163

is defined in the rules as meaning any structure for whatsoever

purpose and of whatever material constructed any every part

thereof whether, is used for human habitation or not and includes

foundation etc and building, services, verandah, balcony, cornice

or projections, part of a building or anything affixed thereto. We

must remind ourselves the question which we are called upon to

decide is whether a mobile tower is a "building" for the

construction of which permission under the Municipality Act or the

Panchayat Raj Act is required. We would think that for deciding

that issue, we need consider the definition of the word "building"

in the Act. We notice, in fact, the definition given of the word

"building" in Section 2(ii) of the Municipality Act which is the

extant provision in question, is different from the definition of the

word "building" in the Municipality Building Rules. There cannot

be any doubt that it is open to a Legislative Body to give an

artificial definition to a word. It is also well settled that when the

definition clause uses the word "includes", the Legislature intends

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   164

to give a wide definition and it intends to encompass the concepts

which are specifically enumerated in such a definition clause also.

If that be so, since the word "building" includes a structure built of

any material whatsoever, it is difficult to hold that a mobile tower

which is built mainly using metal would not fall within the word

"building". In fact, Rule 3 of the Municipal Building Rules also

does gives an indication that the rules have been made in relation

to buildings. The definition of the word in the Building Rules is

also couched in the widest sense and it comprehends any structure.

The fact that rule 130 uses the words "telecommunication tower"

cannot advance the case of the petitioners.             The words

"telecommunication tower" etc are used to convey the intention of

the law giver that without a Permit, a telecommunication tower

cannot be built or altered. No doubt, in Rule 143 of the Building

Rules, the words beginning with the words "or telecommunication

tower" have been inserted with effect from 22.2.2001. Does that

lead us to the conclusion that a telecommunication tower or

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    165

any structure would not fall within the meaning of the word

"building"? We would think that having regard to the definition

of the word "building" in the Municipality Act and the definition

of the words "building" and "structure" in the Municipality

Building Rules, while a telecommunication tower may be of a

special nature, none-the-less, it is a building.

</p><p id="p_322">      72.  Section 235 of the Panchayat Raj Act provides for

no part of the land shall be used as a site and no construction of a

building can be done except in accordance with Chapter XXI and

also open to the Government to apply the provisions of the

Municipal Laws and Rules made thereunder under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_250">Section 274</a>. It

is accordingly that, the Municipality Building Rules, which were

prevalent in the Municipal areas have been made applicable to the

mentioned in the schedule to the Village Panchayats with effect

from 6.6.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_324">     74. It is to be noted that in the Kerala Municipality Act,

Chapter XVIII deals with "buildings". Thereunder, <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_252">Section 381</a>

provides for power for making of Building Rules. Apparently, it

corresponds to Section 235A of the Panchayat Raj Act. Virtually,

similar provisions are contained in the said Chapter as are

contained in Chapter XXI of the Panchayat Raj Act.

</p><p id="p_325">     75. We notice that the definition of the word "building" in

Section 2(2) of the Municipality Act, inter alia, has been made

applicable to the Panchayat areas. Chapter XVIII has been made

applicable. In Chapter XVIII, Section 382 of the Municipality Act

which again corresponds to Section 235B of the Panchayat Raj Act

provides as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_160">           "382.     Building site and construction or
     reconstruction of buildings.- No piece of land shall be

     construction or reconstruction of buildings."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_161">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    168

under the Municipality Act would come into play in the Panchayts

from 6.6.2007.</blockquote><p id="p_326">
</p><p id="p_327">      76. Chapter II of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules

deals with Permits. Therein, inter alia, it provides for site plan,

service plan etc, to accompany an application for any development

Permit. Rule 7 deals with application for Building Permit to carry

out construction or reconstruction of a building. Chapter III has

the heading "action against unauthorised construction".

</p><p id="p_328">      77. Rule 16 falling in Chapter II provides for power to

suspend or revoke any permit under these Rules, if it is satisfied

that the Permit was issued by mistake or that a patent error has

crept into it or that the Permit was issued on misrepresentation of

fact or law or if the construction that will be carried out will be a

threat to life or property. Chapter IV deals with general provisions

regarding site and building requirements. It provides for various

exterior and interior open space, etc.       Chapter V deals with

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   169

occupancy of buildings to coverage and floor area ratio, parking

and loading and unloading spaces.        Then, there are special

provisions for certain occupancy of buildings in Chapter VII.

Buildings in small plots are dealt with in Chapter VIII. Row

buildings are provided in Chapter IX. Chapter XXI deals with

construction of plots , parts or which have been surrendered for

road development. High rise buildings are dealt with in Chapter

XVII. Rule 111 therein provides. inter alia, that the Rules will

apply to such buildings as modified in the said Chapter. Huts are

dealt with under Chapter XVIII. Telecommunication towers with

which we are concerned are specifically dealt with under Chapter

XIX. Rules 130 to 142 deal with almost every aspect which are

dealt with thereunder. It is in such a Chapter that the requirement

of site approval is dispensed with in Rule 140A. Chapter XX

deals with regularisation of unpermitted constructions and

deviations.
</p>
<p id="p_329">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  170

</p><p id="p_330">     78. Thus, the general set of Rules providing for site and

building requirements is contained in Chapter IV in regard to open

spaces. Thereafter, as we have already referred to, there are various

Chapters dealing with different kinds of buildings/structures. The

telecommunication tower, apparently, on account of its peculiar

features have been separately dealt with in Chapter XIX. It starts

with Rule 130 declaring essentiality of permit. Rule 131 provides

for various distances to be maintained. Rule 132 provides for a

FAR (Floor Area Ratio) and height.         Rule 133 provides for

accessory rooms, they being permitted on request being made in

the application accompanied by plans/drawings.            Rule 134

provides for electrical line clearance.    Rule 135 provides for

protective wall. Rule 139 provides that erection of any tower or

pole, structures or accessory rooms shall be permitted only over

authorised buildings.    Rule 140 provides for clearance from

defence establishments, etc.    It is thereafter that Rule 140A

provides for dispensation from site approval. Rule 141 provides

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    171

for the submission of applications in a form accompanied by

various documents and the manner of dealing with the same. Rule

142 provides for completion certificates and it also contemplates

the Authorities concerned allowing power connection etc. for use

of the service.      Section 235F of the Panchayat Raj Act

corresponding to Section 387 of the Kerala Municipality Act, reads

as follows:

site plan and only if the Secretary is convinced, can a permit be

issued. Therefore, he would contend that though Rule 140A(1) of

the Building Rules provides that no site approval is necessary, in

substance, having regard to Rule 141, there is no question of it

being ultravires Section 235G of the Panchayat Raj Act.          Of

course, Shri. P.Chandrasekhar, learned Counsel for the respondents

would point out that a perusal of Section 235F of the Panchayat

Raj Act would show that the law contemplates a site inspection

before site approval is granted.    Learned Government Pleader

would submit that site inspection may be necessary in some of the

cases. The purpose of the site approval is to see that the proposed

construction will be done in conformity with the provisions of law.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_173">           (2) No application for approval of a building site

</p><p id="p_343">      81. Shri. Philip Mathew would contend that the requirement

of the site approval in Section 235G of the Panchcyat Raj Act is

not mandatory for the reason that the permission to construct or

reconstruct a building cannot be refused on the ground that there

has been no site approval going by the grounds for refusal of

permission to construct or reconstruct a building, proceeding on

the basis that a mobile tower is "building". We are not impressed

by the said argument.    It is true that in <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_255">Section 235L</a> there is no

mention of the requirement of site approval or that if there is no

site approval, permission to construct or reconstruct a building is to

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES 177

be refused, but <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_256">Section 235G</a> is categoric, unambiguous and

peremptory in that, the law giver has declared that the Secretary

shall not grant permission to construct or reconstruct a building

unless and until he has approved the site on a application made

under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_257">Section 235F</a>. Therefore, the law does contemplate the

making of an application under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_258">Section 235F</a> and also the grant of

site approval before permission is granted to construct or

reconstruct a building. <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_259">Section 235H</a>, in fact, prohibits

commencement of construction or reconstruction of a building

without permission for the execution of the work. <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_260">Section 235G</a>

read with <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_261">Section 235F</a> must be understood to be an additional

ground, therefore, to refuse permission or construction or

reconstruction of a building.  In other words, apart from the

grounds mentioned in <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_262">Section 235L</a>, it is clear that if a person were

to apply for permission for construction or reconstruction of a

building without having obtained the site approval, the permission

cannot be granted, in view of <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_263">Section 235G</a>.                  Equally

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   178

unmeritorious, is the contention of Shri. Philip Mathew based on

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_264">Section 235A</a>. <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_265">Section 235A</a>, no doubt, provides power with the

Government to make Rules, inter alia, for regulation or restriction

of the use of sites for construction of building and for regulation

and restriction of building constructions. Thus, it is open to the

Government to make Rules for regulation of construction of

buildings.   As already noted, Chapter XVIII of the Kerala

Municipality Act has been made applicable to the Panchayats with

effect from 6.6.2007.      Undoubtedly,      Section 382 of the

Municipality Act corresponds to Section 235A of the Panchayat

Raj Act. The Kerala Municipality Building Rules have not been

enacted under Section 235A of the Panchayat Raj Act. Instead,

they have been made apparently under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_266">Sections 381</a>, <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_267">382</a>, <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_268">387</a>, <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_269">398</a>

and <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_270">406</a> read with Section 565 of the Kerala Municipality Act,

1994. Therefore, the Municipality Building Rules cannot be stated

to be Rules made under the Panchayat Raj Act as contemplated in

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_271">Section 235A</a>. However, since Chapter XVIII of the Municipality

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   179

Act stands extended and enforced in all the Panchayats and as

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_272">Section 381</a> falls in Chapter XVIII of the Municipality Act, the

Building Rules being made under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_273">Section 381</a> in the main, the

requirement of the law would be that construction of a building,

inter alia, must be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter

XVIII and the Municipal Building Rules, as the Municipal

Building Rules are made certainly under the Municipality Act.

Then arises the question as to what is the effect of Section 235G of

the Panchayat Raj Act requiring prior approval being contrary to

Rule 140A of the Municipal Building Rules. In the first place, we

would think that actually, in view of the fact that Chapter XVIII

itself stands extended to the Panchayats, it is the provisions of

Chapter XVIII which would govern construction of buildings

rather than Chapter XXI of the Panchayat Raj Act. It is, no doubt

true that virtually the same provisions are contained in Chapter

XXI of the Panchayat Raj Act as are contained in Chapter XVIII of

the Municipality Act. Sections 387 and 388 of the Municipality

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   180

Act correspond to <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_274">Sections 235F</a> and <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_275">235G</a> respectively of the

Panchayat Raj Act. Thus, the requirement of site approval as

contained in Section 235G of the Panchayat Raj Act or Section 388

of the Municipality Act, is contained in both the enactments.

</p><p id="p_344">     82. What is the effect of the Rules made under an Act ? Will

it become part of the Act ? If there is a conflict between the Rules

and the parent enactment, can it be got over by contending that the

Rules when framed under the Act, must be held to be part of the

Act and, therefore, even if the Rules are in conflict with the Act,

the Rules must be allowed to operate as they are also part of the

Act. This question is no longer res integra and we need only

extract the following passage from M.P. Jain and S.N. Jain on

Principles of Administrative Law (6th enlarged edition - 2007

Vol.1), as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_174">           "The `as if enacted' formula has been used in

      India as well but its legal effect has not been beyond

      doubt because the judicial view about its implications

      has not so far been uniform, consistent and definitive.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_345">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  181

    The Supreme Court adopted the Herschel (or the

    Lockwood) doctrine in a few earlier cases, while in a

    few later cases, the Court declared the rules invalid in

    spite of the `as if enacted' clause. <a href="/doc/740591/" id="a_276">In State of Kerala v.

    KM. Charia Abdulla and Co</a>., the Court stated that if

    the rule-making authority transcends the limits of the

    power conferred, the rules would be invalid and the

    `as if enacted' clause could attach no additional

    sanctity to the rules. The Court observed: "Power to

    frame rules is conferred by the Act upon the State

    Government and that power may be exercised within

    the strict limits of the authority concerned.       If in

    making a rule, the State transcends its authority, the

    rule will be invalid, for statutory rules made in

    exercise of delegated authority are valid and binding

    only if made within the limits of the authority

    delegated. Validity of a rule whether it is declared to

    have effect as if enacted in the Act or otherwise is

    always open to challenge on the ground that it is

    unauthorised".     This comes nearer the Yaffe rather

    than the Lockwood approach. The Supreme Court has

    again considered the matter recently. S.281(2) of the

    <a href="/doc/229158/" id="a_277">Cantonments Act</a> provides that the rules made under

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    182

    the Act, on publication "shall have effect as if enacted

    in the Act." The Appellants argued that the rules in

    question became a part of the statute and, accordingly,

    the question of their contrariety to the Act could not

    arise at all. Rejecting the contention as unsound, the

    Supreme Court observed:
</p>
<p id="p_346">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_175">                       "It is well settled that rules framed
          under the provisions of a statute form part of
          the statute.      In other words, rules have
          statutory force. But, before a rule can have
          the effect of a statutory provision, two
          conditions must be fulfilled, namely; (1) it
          must conform to the provisions of the statute
          under which it is framed; and (2) it must also
          come within the scope and purview of the rule-
          making power of the authority framing the
          rule. If either of these two conditions is not
          fulfilled, the rule so framed would be void."</blockquote><p id="p_347">
</p><p id="p_348">          Thus, the Court ruled that in spite of<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_278"> S. 281(2)</a>,

    "any rule framed under the <a href="/doc/229158/" id="a_279">Cantonments Act</a> has to

    fulfil the two conditions mentioned above for their

    validity". A rule was held ultra vires the Act in the

    instant case.     This means that an ultra vires rule

    cannot be validated by such a formula. It is suggested

    that this is the reasonable and logical approach to

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   183

     take; the courts should apply the ultra vires doctrine

     even when the rules are declared to be effective "as if

     enacted in the Act." The rules constitute delegated

     legislation; the delegate can claim no more power

     than what the ambit or scope of the rule-making power

     conferred by the statute is; the rules ultra vires the

     rule-making power being void ab initio cannot form

     part of the statute. The Supreme Court has recently

     reiterated this ruling in Asstt. <a href="/doc/1912970/" id="a_280">Collector, Central

     Excise v. Ramakrishnan</a>."
</p>
<p id="p_349">Thus, a statutory Rule will not get any added immunity from being

rendered infirm on the score of it being ultra vires the parent

enactment for the mere reason that it is to be treated as part of the

Act. Thus, Rule 140A of the Municipal Building Rules, if it is

held that it does not square with Section 388 of the Municipality

Act which is applicable in the Panchayats from 6.6.2007, then Rule

140A must stand over-whelmed by <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_281">Section 388</a>. Therefore, the

power given under Section 235A of the Panchayat Raj Act to

make Rules cannot enable the delegate to make Rules contrary to

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  184

the provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_350">     83. In view of the provisions contained in Rules 141(1), 141

(4) and 141(8) of the Municipality Building Rules, we are of the

following view:
</p>
<p id="p_351">     Rule 140A(1) which provides that it shall not be necessary to

secure site approval for the construction of a telecommunication

tower, inter alia, would be ultra vires <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_282">Section 235F</a> read with

Section 235H of the Panchayat Raj Act which corresponds to

Sections 387 and 388 of the Municipality Act. However, in view

of Rules 141(1), 141(4) and 141(8) of the Municipality Building

Rules, we hold that no Permit can be granted under Rule 141(8)

unless there is prior site approval. As far as inspection is

concerned, we notice that though Sections 387 and 388 of the

Municipality Act do not expressly refer to the need for an

inspection for the purpose of granting site approval, Rule 11(1) of

the Building Rules mandates that the Secretary shall after

inspection of the site and verification of the site plan and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    185

documents, if convinced of the bonafides of the ownership of the

site and with the site plan, drawing and specifications conforms to

the site and provisions of the Rules or Byelaws under the Act and

any other law, approve the site and site plan. The very concept of

site approval would appear to us, to require inspection of the site.

We can, on this interpretation, uphold the supremacy of the parent

enactment over the Rules. We further hold that once a Permit is

granted under Rule 141(8) to establish a mobile tower, then, if the

permission is granted in the manner aforesaid, that is, after the site

approval is granted, as we have adverted to above, then, no further

permission is required under Chapter XVIII of the Kerala

Municipality Act which corresponds to Chapter XXI of the Kerala

Panchayat Raj Act. This is for the reason that the Building Rules

provide for the manner in which the permission contemplated

under the Act is to be effectuated. Under Section 235F of the

Panchayat Raj Act corresponding to Section 387 of the

Municipality Act, the Act does not prescribe any particular form.

</p><p id="p_352">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    186

In the Rules, the application for permit is to be made as provided in

Appendix A. In Appendix A, Clause 3(vii a) deals with erection of

telecommunication tower or other structure. Once the Permit is

granted as per law, under the Rules, there is no requirement that

there must be again permission granted under the Act.

<p id="p_354">

senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners would also

point out that the component parts in a mobile tower may not be

"machinery". Shri Philip Mathew also would point out that it is

not "machinery". Reliance is placed on the decision of the Privy

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    187

Council in Corporation of Calcutta v. Chairman of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_177">           Generally, the word "machinery" when used in

     with the object in each case of effecting a definite and

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_179">     85. Regarding the question as to whether it is "machinery"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_356">within the meaning of Section 233(1)(b) of the Panchayat Raj Act,

we have already noted that there is absolutely no pleading by any

of the local bodies or private party respondents that the component

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   188

parts of the mobile tower would constitute "machinery" and,

therefore, permission is required. We have already noticed the

contention of many of the petitioners is that actually the

component parts would not constitute "machinery". In particular,

it is contended that <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_284">Section 233A</a> provides for abatement of

nuisance. It reads as follows:
</p>
<pre id="pre_13">           "233A.      Abatement of nuisance caused by

     factory, workshop, etc.- (1)      Where any factory,

</pre><p id="p_357">     workshop, workplace or machinery causes, in the

     opinion of the Village Panchayat, nuisance by reason

     of a particular kind of fuel being employed or by

     reason or the noise or vibration created, or effluent

     discharged or by reason of noxious odour, smoke or

     dust omitted, the Secretary may direct the person in

     charge of such factory, workshop, workplace or

     machinery for the abatement of such nuisance within a

     reasonable time to be specified for that purpose.

</p><p id="p_358">           (2)   The Village Panchayat may, if required,

     obtain expert opinion with regard to the determination

     of the nuisance or its abatement, at the cost of the

     owner or person in charge of the factory, workshop,

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES      189

      workplace or machinery concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_359">            (3)   Where there has been willful default in

      carrying out a direction given under sub-section (1) or

      where in the existing circumstances the abatement of

      nuisance is found impracticable, the Secretary may

      prohibit the working of the factory, workshop,

      workplace or machinery till such time the person

      concerned takes necessary steps to the satisfaction of

      the Secretary for the abatement of the nuisance."

</p><p id="p_360">      86. It is pointed out that the allegations which are leveled

against the type of nuisance that allegedly emanates from the

operation of mobile tower would show that <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_285">Section 233A</a> is not

attracted at all and, therefore, there is a case that the Legislature did

not contemplate component parts           of the mobile tower being

treated as "machinery" under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_286">Section 233(1)(b)</a>. It is contended by

Shri. A. Mohamed Mustaque that if it could be assumed that a

mobile tower started functioning and it did cause the ills, attributed

to it by some of the respondents, then the provisions of <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_287">Section

233A</a> would show that the local body would be totally helpless to

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   190

deal with such a nuisance. That is to say, what is alleged on behalf

of the respondents is that when a mobile tower is operated, it will

give rise to radiation and it can cause sleeplessness, cancer etc.

But such a contingency is clearly not contemplated under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_288">Section

233A</a>. Therefore, it is contended that it clearly establishes that the

scheme of the Act would not take in the component parts of a

mobile tower. Of course, no doubt, it is contended by Shri Vinod

Madhavan on behalf of the respondent that under sub-section (2)

of Section 233A of the Panchayat Raj Act, the Panchayat can get

expert opinion with regard to the determination of the nuisance or

its abatement and, therefore, there is no merit in the contention of

Shri Mohamed Mustaque.
</p>
<p id="p_361">      87. There is a further case for the petitioners that <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_289">Section 233</a>
</p><p id="p_362">(b) of the Panchayat Raj Act providing for permission for

installation of machinery in any premises must be read in

conjunction with Clause (a) and, therefore, no permission is

required for installation of component parts, even if it is

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    191

machinery, unless a mobile tower is a workplace which, it is not.

In this connection, we must remind ourselves that Section 233 of

the Panchayat Raj Act, after providing that no person shall without

permission of the Village Panchayat construct or establish any

factory, workshop or workplace, inter alia, install in any premises

any machinery, inter alia, driven by power, as aforesaid. The

words "as aforesaid" would appear to refer to the types of power

which attracts Sub-section (a), namely steam power, water power

or other mechanical power or electrical power. No doubt, Clause

</p><p id="p_363">(b) is not attracted in respect of machinery exempted by the

provisions of the Act or Rules made thereunder. Undoubtedly,

<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_290">Section 233B</a> provides for exemptions. It is, however, apposite to

refer to sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_291">Section 233</a>. It provides as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_180">           "An application for permission under Sub-

Rule 12 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj (issue of Licence to

as follows:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_365">Sub-rule (2), thereafter, inter alia, provides that the application

shall be accompanied by details of machinery that the Panchayat

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  193

the Kerala Municipality Act, namely <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_292">Section 448</a>. The relevant

portion of <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_293">Section 448</a> reads as follows:

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_189">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    194

Therefore, we may notice that in the Rules provided pursuant to

sub-section (2) of Section 233 of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and

Section 448 of the Kerala Municipality Act itself, the law

contemplates the making of an application "before so constructing

or establishing" in the case of rule 12" and "before beginning such

construction or establishment" in Section 448 of the Municipality

Act clearly relate to Clause (a) of Section 233(1) of the Panchayat

Raj Act and Clause (a) of Section 448 of the Municipality Act. In

other words, the words "construct and establish" appear in

conjunction with the words "factory, workshop or workplace".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_366">The impression that would appear to be generated would be that

even in respect of installation of machinery, there is no separate

application contemplated and the application is contemplated as a

composite one at the time before the construction or establishment

of the factory, workshop or workplace. This would appear to

advance the case that the installation of "machinery" contemplated

in both the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and the Kerala Municipality

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    195

Act, though stated to relate to "any premises" may have to take its

context and colouring from the words "factory, workshop or

workplace".
</p>
<p id="p_367">      88. No doubt, the question could be posed as to what would

happen in a situation where fresh or additional "machinery" is to

be installed after the commencement of the "factory, workshop or

workplace." Could it be said that they could be installed without

obtaining permission ?
</p>
<p id="p_368">      89. However, on the other hand, we may also notice the kind

of machinery which are exempted both under Section 233B of the

Panchayat Raj Act and Section 450 of the Municipality Act. They

would appear to create the impression that the word "premises"is

not limited with reference to the words "factory, workshop or

workplace". For instance, electrical and non-electrical appliances

installed for agricultural purposes and electrical and non-electrical

appliances and machinery intended to be used for domestic or

personal purposes. Quite clearly, it could be said that they are in

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   196

no way relatable to a factory, workshop or workplace.

</p><p id="p_369">     90. Further more, we notice that Rule 133(3) and (4) of the

Municipality Building Rules reads as follows:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_190">           "133 (3): Installation of electricity generator

     may be allowed if the generator is covered with

     insulated sound-proof cabin.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_191">           (4) Every construction or installation ancillary

     or necessary for the telecommunication system shall

     conform to the relevant rules applicable to such

     construction or installation and licence or permit

     required under such rules shall also be obtained."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_370">Are the words "installation, ancillary or necessary for the

telecommunication system" to take in the component parts and

which are the relevant Rules, the rule maker had in mind, are all

not matters which are canvassed before us. It is not even clear that

they have intended to refer to any Rules made under the Central

Legislation. Further, could it not be said that Rule 133(3) of the

Building Rules indicates that generator would, at any rate, be

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     197

"machinery" within the meaning of Section 233 of the Kerala

Panchayat Raj Act and the corresponding Municipal Law.

</p><p id="p_371">       91. As far as Sub-rule (3) is concerned, the rule maker

appears to provide for allowing installation of electricity generator,

if it is covered with insulated sound proof cabin. Would it be a

case of an exemption contemplated in Section 233(1)(b) of the

Panchayat Raj Act and Section 448(1)(b) of the Municipality Act,

even though clearly it does not expressly say that generators (in

conditions mentioned) are exempted which is the expression used

in the parent enactment. Does it contemplate permission being

granted ? If it is a question of permission having to be granted,

will it not be traceable to the power under Section 233(1)(b) of the

Panchayat Raj Act and Section 448(1)(b) of the Municipality Act.

Further, if it is a question of installation of a generator, when it is

not covered with insulated sound proof cabin, does not Rule 133(3)

of the Building Rules further indicate that it would be "machinery'

within the meaning of Section 233 of the Panchayat Raj Act and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    198

corresponding Municipal Law ?
</p>
<p id="p_372">      92. We must remind ourselves that in the state of affairs and

the nature of the pleadings or rather the absence of the same, it may

not be appropriate that we resolve this issue. We reiterate that

there is no local body which has come forward for setting up a case

to the effect that "machinery" with which we are concerned, falls

under Section 233(b) of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and the

corresponding provision of the Kerala Municipality Act and they

require permission.
</p>
<p id="p_373">      93. However, we make it clear that we are leaving this issue

open and this judgment will not stand in the way of any local body

taking the stand that the component parts are "machinery", the

installation of which requires permission under Section 233 of the

Panchayat Raj Act and the corresponding provisions of the

Municipality Act, in which case, it will be open to the

petitioners/operators to challenge the same in properly constituted

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_374">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   199

            Whether Permit is bad for contravening the

      provisions of the Scheme ?
</p>
<p id="p_375">
</p><p id="p_376">     94. One of the questions raised by some of the respondents

including the Corporation of Kochi and the learned Government

Pleader is that under the Town Planning Scheme, establishment of

mobile towers is prohibited in certain Zones. Rule 3A of the

Municipal Building Rules which we have already referred to, is

also pressed into service.     It was inserted with effect from

16.12.2009. It provides that the provisions of the Town Planning

Scheme in force under the Town Planning Acts will prevail over

the respective provisions in the Municipal Building Rules. Rule

140A of the Building Rules provides that telecommunication

towers, inter alia, shall be permitted in any zone or over any

building irrespective of its occupancy. In view of the fact that in

some of the schemes, towers are not permissible in certain zones

under Rule 3A, it is the provision of the scheme which will prevail

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   200

over the Municipal Building Rules. The petitioners counter the

argument as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_377">      95.    Litigation is pending in this Court challenging the

Scheme. Secondly, it is contended that when permits are issued

and they are not challenged, this Court cannot in a Writ Petition

seeking mandamus for police protection, invalidate the Permits

without there being a challenge on the ground of Permit being

issued contrary to the scheme. Particularly, in view of the fact that

there is litigation pending in regard to the legality of the scheme

itself and it becomes a factual issue, we do not think it is

appropriate for us to go into the said question and we leave open

that question.
</p>
<p id="p_378">            Decision on specific contentions raised in

            certain cases:
</p>
<p id="p_379">
</p><p id="p_380">      96. In W.P.(C).No.24384/2009, as already noticed, there is a

case for the respondents that there was no inspection done and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     201

even proceeding on the basis that site approval is there, in terms of

Rule 141(1) (4) and (8) before the Permit was granted, as

contended by Shri Santhosh Mathew, there was no site inspection.

In this context, we notice that Ext.P2 Permit is granted under Rule

11(3) of the Building Rules. In view of the specific pleading in the

Counter Affidavit that there was no inspection which is not denied,

we are inclined to decline jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_381">      97.    In W.P.(C).No.13401/10, the case of the second

respondent is that one Leela is the mother-in-law of one Shri

Madhu who has entered into Ext.P1 agreement and the case of the

petitioner is that the petitioner has entered into an agreement with

one Shri Madhu who is described in the Writ Petition as the owner

of the site. In the Counter Affidavit of respondents 2 to 4, the case

is that Shri Madhu is a contractor and the land belongs to Leela as

per Settlement Deed No.1379/01. There is no Reply Affidavit

filed. Thus, we must take it that the petitioner has approached this

Court without establishing that the licensor had title to the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     202

property. In such circumstances, we are not inclined to exercise

our discretionary jurisdiction in favour of the petitioner and the

Writ Petition is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_382">     98. In W.P.(C).No.14361/10, the contention taken by the

party respondents is that respondents 3 and 4 are neighbours.

Learned counsel for respondents 3 and 4 would bring our attention

to Rule 7(ia) which provides that there must be consent of the

neighbour. It was subsequently omitted by SRO.No.591/10 dated

21.6.2010. It, in substance, provides that in case of earth work

excavations, if the depth of the excavation is greater than the

horizontal distance from the nearest boundary of the place of

excavation, the written consent of the owners of the adjoining

property shall be obtained by the owner and produced along with

such application. There is no Reply Affidavit filed rebutting the

statements made in the Counter Affidavit. In such circumstances,

we are not inclined to exercise our discretionary jurisdiction under

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     203

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_294">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India in favour of the petitioner

and the Writ Petition is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_383">      99. In W.P.(C).No.17009/2010, the case of respondents 4

and 5 is that Ext.P2 Permit was issued to M/s. Indus Towers, but

the petitioner is somebody-else. But the Writ Petition is filed by a

Private Limited Company. We would think that there may not be

much merit in the contention of the respondent. It is to be noticed

that the petitioner has produced Ext.P1 which is purchase order

issued by Indus Towers in favour of the petitioner dated

14.12.2009. Therefore, we reject the argument based on Ext.P2

permit being issued in favour of M/s. Indus Towers, but the Writ

Petition being filed by the Private Limited Company, as under

Ext.P1, petitioner is given the right to carry out the work.



</p><p id="p_384">      Conclusions

</p><p id="p_385">      100. We hold that the provisions of Section 233 of the

Panchayat Raj Act and the corresponding provisions in the

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   204

Municipality Act, in pith and substance, fall under Entry 6 of List

II of the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution and, therefore, are

perfectly within the legislative competence of the State.       We

further hold that Section 233 of the Panchyat Raj Act is not limited

by <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_295">Section 232</a> of the said Act. We also hold that Sub-rule (1) of

Rule 140 A of the Building Rules appears to us to be ultra vires

Section 387 of the Municipality Act which is applicable in the

Panchayats also from 6.6.2007. However, in view of Rules 141(1),

141(4) and 141(8) of the Building Rules, we hold that if the

Secretary approves the site as per law before the permit is granted,

it would be sufficient compliance with the mandate of the parent

enactment and such permits would be valid. There must be site

inspection before approval is granted.
</p>
<p id="p_386">     101. We find that the mobile tower is a building within the

meaning of the word "building" as defined in the Municipality Act

and the Building Rules. However, if a permit has been granted

under Rule 141(8), there need not be a further permission under

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    205

Chapter XXI of the Panchayat Raj Act corresponding to Chapter

XVIII of the Municipality Act. This is, however, subject to the

condition that before the permit is granted, the site is approved in

accordance with law as Rule 140 A of the Building Rules is

subservient to Section 387 of the Municipality Act. We leave open

the issue relating to whether the component parts of a mobile tower

would constitute "machinery" and it will be open to the local

authorities to take proceedings on the basis that the component

parts do constitute "machinery" and nothing contained in this

Judgment will stand in the way of them doing so. We further hold

that the mobile tower would not constitute "workplace" within the

meaning of Section 233(1)(a) of the Panchayat Raj Act.           We

further find that on the basis of the materials on record, it may not

be open to this Court to decline jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_296">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution in cases where permits have been issued under

Rule 141 as per law. But, we further make it clear that it will be

open to the parties to approach any other competent Forum and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES     206

seek remedies in which case, nothing stated in this Judgment will

stand in the way of the competent Forum going into the issue as to

whether there is any nuisance or pollution or health hazard and

granting relief to the parties as the situation may warrant in law and

on facts.
</p>
<p id="p_387">      102. On the above findings, we dispose of the Writ Petitions

as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_388">      There will be a direction to the official respondents (Police

Officers) in all the Writ Petitions that they will afford protection to

the petitioners to carry on the operation of the mobile towers in all

those cases where protection has been sought for, for the operation

of the mobile towers as against the party respondents as claimed in

the Writ Petitions. This, however, will not stand in the way of the

local bodies concerned taking action as per law on the basis that

the component parts used in the towers constitute "machinery".

Necessarily, the order of police protection will remain only as long

as the Permits issued are not set aside or otherwise interfered with.

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES   207

In all those cases where the construction was completed or

permitted on the basis of the interim orders passed by this Court

except otherwise ordered hereunder, we leave it free to the

petitioners to commission the mobile towers in accordance with

law.
</p>
<p id="p_389">      103. We further make it clear that the petitioners shall be

free to install the component parts on the mobile towers in all those

cases where we had restrained the petitioners from putting the

component parts/equipments. We make it clear that if the

petitioners install any component parts, they will be doing it at

their own risk and subject to any proceedings which the local

Authorities may take on the basis that the component parts

constitute "machinery" under Section 233(1)(b) of the Panchayat

Raj Act and the corresponding provisions of the Municipality Act.

In all the cases where proceedings are taken, in any of the matters,

by the local bodies, we leave it open to the petitioners/operators to

challenge the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_390">WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES    208

</p><p id="p_391">      104. We have proceeded in these cases in the absence of

factual dispute being raised that there is a valid permit, but as we

have also made a declaration of the law that without granting site

approval as per law, a Permit cannot be issued under Rule 141 (8)

of the Building Rules, we leave open the rights of the parties in

this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_392">      105. W.P.(C).Nos.13401/2010, 14361/2010 and 24384/2009

will stand dismissed and consequently the mobile towers cannot be

energized. In W.P.(C). No.8321/2009, we direct that the order of

police protection which we have granted will be subject to any

orders that may be passed by the civil court.

</p><p id="p_393">      106. We also make it clear that in all those cases where

protection was given for construction of mobile towers, subject to

the decision of the Tribunal, the aforesaid directions will be subject

to the decision of the Tribunal as ordered.
</p>
<p id="p_394">      107.    We hasten to repeat that if the petitioners/operators

install or have installed component parts, it will be at their risk and

WPC.NO.14094/10 &amp; CONN.CASES  209

without prejudice to the right of the local bodies to take

proceedings against them in accordance with law.

with reference to Ext.R3(c) produced in W.P.(C).No.7312 of 2009,

in view of the fact that the matter appears to be pending

consideration before this Court, we are not pronouncing on the

same and we are leaving open this issue.
