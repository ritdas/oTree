</p>
<p id="p_12">	Facts relevant
for the purpose of deciding this petition may be summarised as under
:
</p>
<p id="p_13">	The petitioners
	are the residents of village Navinal, Taluka Mundra, District Kutch,
	within whose revenue limits respondent nos.10 and 11 have undertaken
	developmental activities on the land so allotted to them within the
	Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone Limited (for short, 'MPSEZ').
</p>
<p id="p_14">	All the
	petitioners are farmers and have brought to the notice of this Court
	by way of this petition that respondent nos.10 and 11 have started
	developing the land and putting up construction of the proposed
	plant situated within the MPSEZ knowing fully well that till this
	date the MPSEZ has not been granted prior environmental clearance by
	the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, as
	required as per the Notification dated 14th
	September 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	In short, the
	case of the petitioners is that without mandatory prior
	environmental clearance under the Environmental Impact Assessment
	Notification, 2006 (for short, 'the
	EIA Notification')
	issued under Rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (for
	short, 'the
	Rules')
	read with <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_2">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (for
	short, 'the
	Act')
	granted to respondent - MPSEZ, the respondent - Alstom Bharat
	Forge Power Limited has started construction of its
	factory for the manufacturing of power plant equipments within the
	very SEZ.
</p>
<p id="p_16">	It is also the
	case of the petitioners that there is another collective venture in
	the form of Kalyani Alstom Power Limited belonging to the same
	respective groups to whom the land is allotted adjacent to the land
	allotted to respondent - Alstom Bharat Forge Power Limited.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	According to the
	petitioners, as the boundaries are common, it is difficult for the
	petitioners to make out which joint venture is doing what and to
	what an extent. However, the fact of the matter is that the
	construction and development activities of the land so allotted
	within the MPSEZ is going on at a time when the MPSEZ itself does
	not have environmental clearance and, therefore, the question of any
	unit therein starting construction and
	development does not arise at all.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	It is the say of
	the petitioners that, if the respective units to come within the SEZ
	also fall within Schedule-A or B industry, then they also
	independently require environmental clearance once the SEZ is
	granted clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	It is the case of
	the petitioners that respondent - MPSEZ at Mundra, which is
	owned by the Adani Group headed by Mr.Gautam Adani is one of the
	largest multi-product Special Economic Zone in India. MPSEZ is still
	waiting for prior Environmental Clearance by the Ministry of
	Environment and Forests, Government of India. Public hearing for
	environment clearance of respondent - MPSEZ was held on 5th
	September 2010. Till date prior environment clearance has not been
	granted
	to the respondent - MPSEZ.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	It is also the
	case of the petitioners that respondent no.1 - Ministry
	of Environment and Forests has issued a detailed show-cause notice
	to respondent no.8 - Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone
	Limited for violation of provisions of CRZ Notification,
	1991 under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_3">Section 5</a> of the Act. However, till date the
	mandatory prior clearance has not been granted by respondent -
	Ministry of Environment and Forests under the EIA Notification.
	Therefore, no developmental activities can take place
	within the SEZ at all either by the Developer of SEZ or an
	enterprise which is seeking to establish its unit within the SEZ.
</p>
<p id="p_21">	It is also the
	case of the petitioners that respondent no.1 - Ministry of
	Environment and Forests, Government of India, issued another
	Notification dated 7th
	July 2011 constituting a committee to inquire into and place report
	on the specific reference. The Committee so constituted is looking
	into the matter. The order passed by Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat
	dated 12th
	July 2011 collectively in PILs and other environment related matter
	contains the entire Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_22">	It is also the
	case of the petitioners that notice was issued upon the respondents
	by the petitioners on 27th
	August 2011 by registered post AD seeking immediate stoppage of all
	the construction activities, but of no avail. Thereafter, a reminder
	was sent on 13th
	September 2011, but same has also not been attended to by the
	respondents including respondent - Ministry of Environment and
	Forests, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the Development
	Commissioner of respondent - MPSEZ. Hence the present petition
	for enforcement of law in order to ensure adherence to the rule of
	law in the interest of environmental protection and to prevent a
	situation of fiat accompli
	being created for grant of environmental clearance to MPSEZ by
	respondent - MPSEZ and respondent - Alstom Bharat Forge
	Power Limited.
</p>
<p id="p_23">	It is the say of
	the petitioners that respondent nos.10 and 11 have started
	developing the land and putting up construction of the proposed
	plant situated within the respondent - Mundra Port and Special
	Economic Zone knowing fully well that till date respondent -
	MPSEZ has not been granted prior environmental clearance. After
	receiving notice and the reminder from the petitioner, they cannot
	say that they are not aware about the issue of environmental
	clearance. However, the development of the land and the construction
	of the plant is going on unabated even after the reminder. The
	extent of construction is not known as petitioners cannot enter in
	the lands in question which are now cordoned off. However, from the
	photographs taken over a period of four months clearly suggest that
	apart from putting up the boundary, much more development and
	construction of the proposed plant is going on in utter violation of
	EIA Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_24">	It is also the
	say of the petitioners that without prior environmental clearance
	granted to respondent - MPSEZ, no unit within the same can
	develop the land allotted to it and put up construction thereupon
	towards setting up the manufacturing plant. However, respondent
	nos.10 and 11, more particularly respondent no.10 has started
	developing the land so allottedd within the respondent - MPSEZ
	and put up construction
	thereupon in addition to putting up boundary wall and kachha
	construction for guards. The photographs taken by the petitioners
	from the outside are evidenced of the fact that developmental and
	construction activities with the help of workers and machines of
	different nature and type are going on at the proposed plant site.
	The development of the land and construction
	of the plant at the site by respondent nos.10 and 11 and more
	particularly by respondent no.10 is in violation of EIA
	Notification, 2006 and therefore, same is absolutely illegal and
	unlawful.
</p>
<p id="p_25">	It is the say of
	the petitioners that the respondents - Government of India,
	Government of Gujarat, Gujarat Pollution Control
	Board, Collector and more particularly the Development Commissioner
	of respondent - MPSEZ have also been served with the notice
	dated 27th
	August 2011 followed by reminder dated 13th
	September 2011 along with necessary details and photographs bringing
	to their notice illegal and unlawful development of land and
	construction of the plant at the plant site by respondent no.10, but
	of no avail. This shows failure to perform statutory and
	constitutional obligation by the respondent - State and its
	respective authorities besides the Department and the Ministry who
	are under obligation to ensure that the law of the land is
	implemented upon. However, their failure to perform their obligation
	followed by stark failure to prevent respondent nos.10 and 11 and
	more particularly respondent no.10 from developing the land in
	question and putting up construction thereupon shows a collusion
	between the private industries and public authorities of worst
	nature, where a multinational company is encouraged by none other
	than the State within the territory of India to setup a plant along
	with Indian Partner in utter violation of environmental laws and
	other laws related to SEZ. This is an example of misrule of law,
	where the respondents are active contributories. Same is, therefore,
	discriminatory, arbitrary, irrational and malafide and hence, it is
	violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_4">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and therefore
	unconstitutional.
</p>
<p id="p_26">	Lastly, it is
	also the case of the petitioners that respondent no.8 is consciously
	encouraging respondent nos.10 and 11 for developing a land and
	putting up construction thereupon in absence of mandatory prior
	environmental clearance and this is nothing but an act which is in
	violation of assurance given to respondent - Ministry of
	Environment and Forests at the time of making application for
	environmental clearance for respondent - MPSEZ. Therefore, the
	terms of reference of respondent - MPSEZ are liable to be
	cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_27">	Notices were
issued to the respondents and in response to the same, the
respondents have appeared through their respective counsel, and
respondent nos.10 and 11 have filed affidavit-in-reply. The stand
taken in the affidavit-in-reply by respondent nos.10 and 11 is as
under :-
</p>
<p id="p_28">	The petition
	filed by the petitioners is not maintainable and deserves to be
	rejected at the threshold. The allegations purportedly made are
	completely vague and without any particulars and have no substance
	whatsoever. The petition is bereft of any acceptable data or
	admissible evidence to substantiate the allegations made in the
	petition.
</p>
<p id="p_29">	The contents of
	the petitioner clearly show that it is merely an attempt to make a
	roving inquiry into the ongoing project without any basis
	whatsoever. The stand of respondent nos.10 and 11 is that the
	petition is a motivated attempt on the part of the petitioners in
	the guise of Public Interest Litigation for spurious causes and
	publicity and is a tool to harass and defame respondent nos.10 and
</p><p id="p_30">	11.
	 


	
	  


	The defence of
	respondent nos.10 and 11 is that the activities to be carried out by
	them would not in any away expose or have an impact on human health;
	natural or man-made resources so as to attract the provisions of the
	Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 which is not
	applicable to the project of the respondents. As the EIA
	Notification does not apply to the project of the respondents, the
	respondents are under no obligation
	to obtain a prior Environment Clearance (for short, 'EC') as per the
	requirement of EIA Notification for carrying out any
	construction/developmental activity on site. According to respondent
	nos.10 and 11, they have been granted the necessary
	approvals required for its project including the consent to
	establish its factory. Therefore, the question of violation of any
	statutory obligations on the part of respondent no.11 as alleged by
	the petitioners does not arise let alone the violation of the
	provisions of the EIA Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_31">	The stand of
	respondent nos.10 and 11 is that respondent no.11 is a joint venture
	company of Asltom Power Holding, S.A. and Asltom Bharat Forge
	Limited in India. Respondent no.11 has acquired leasehold rights
	from Mundra Port Special Economic Zone Limited, the lessor/owner, in
	land situated at Mundra Port Special Economic Zone, part of Revenue
	Survey No.295/1 and part of Revenue Survey No.225 of Mouje Village
	Siracha and Navinal, Taluka Mundra, District Kutch, Gujarat vide
	Lease Deed dated 25th
	June 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_32">	It is the stand
	of respondent nos.10 and 11 that both are sister concern companies
	(being joint venture companies of Alstom Power Holding, S.A. and
	Bharat Forge Limited) and would be undertaking similar manufacturing
	activities. In fact, the activity to be carried out by respondent
	no.11, though of a similar nature, would be on a much smaller scale
	as compared to respondent no.10 and would support the manufacturing
	activities of respondent no.10.
</p>
<p id="p_33">	It is the stand
	of respondent no.11 that it is in the process of setting up a
	manufacturing unit for carrying out fabrication and assembling of
	heat exchangers, pressure vessels, fabricated items of steam
	turbine, generators and other miscellaneous equipments
	on the land. This activity would involve designing, engineering,
	manufacturing, assembling, supplying, erecting and
	commissioning of Heat Exchangers, Condensers and deaerator etc.
	Respondent no.11 would be making an investment
	of approximately Rs.321 crore in this venture. It would manufacture
	equipment, which would include Heat Exchangers, Condensers and
	dearator etc. to support generation of 5000 MW power per annum, with
	super critical steam parameters.
</p><p id="p_34">	As a matter of fact, these equipments are globally proven for
	reducing CO2
	emissions from power plants and allow much superior combustion
	capabilities reducing coal consumption. As per the manufacturing
	process, this plant would not involve any primary or secondary
	metallurgical processes like melting of steel or making of forgings
	or castings etc. Respondent no.11 would instead get castings and
	forgings in semi-finished conditions from various vendors within an
	outside India. The only key processes involved in manufacturing of
	these heat exchangers, pressure vessels and fabrication for turbines
	and generators would be welding, machining and stress relieving,
	other than designing, engineering and procurement etc. Respondent
	no.11 would be carrying out stress relieving operation for the
	fabricated assemblies/ sub-assemblies, wherever applicable as per
	standards for the purposes of which respondent no.11 would be
	utilizing a Bogie Hearth Type Heat Treatment Furnace.
</p>
<p id="p_35">	It is also the
	stand of respondent nos.10 and 11 that on 3rd
	February 2010, respondent no.11 received its Letter of Approval
	under the SEZ Act from the Development Commissioner bearing
	No.F.MPSEZ/IUA/07/2009-10.
</p><p id="p_36">	Respondent no.11, for the purposes of commencing construction of the
	plant besides taking other regulatory approvals, had applied to the
	Gujarat Pollution Control Board in December 2010 seeking consent to
	establish
	(NOC) under the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water
	Act</a>, 1974. Pursuant to such application, the GPCB
	was pleased to grant to respondent no.11 its NOC dated 30th
	April 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_37">	It is the defence
	of respondent nos.10 and 11 that inspite of the aforesaid being in
	place and the EIA Notification not being applicable to the project,
	in view of the petitioners' allegations in a notice issued to Bharat
	Forge Limited, of which the answering respondent was informed, as a
	matter of precaution, respondent no.10, vide its letter dated 12th
	October 2011, sought a clarification from the MoEF regarding the
	need of obtaining EC for its project in terms of the EIA
	Notification giving out a detailed description of the type of
	activity to be carried out along with other relevant facts.
</p>
<p id="p_38">	It is also the
	case of the respondents that since respondent nos.10 and 11 are
	sister concern companies and would be carrying out similar
	activities wherein respondent no.11's activity is to be carried out
	on a much smaller scale, it was felt that a clarification received
	from MoEF for respondent no.10's activity would equally serve the
	purpose for respondent no.11's activity as well. Respondent no.10
	received the MoEF's reply dated
	25th
	October 2011 which clearly stated that the activity proposed to be
	carried out by respondent no.10 did not attract the provisions of
	the EIA Notification and thus prior EC was not required in
	respondent no.10's case.
</p>
<p id="p_39">	As per the say of
	respondent no.11, it has completed fencing, ground-levelling and
	piling work at the project site. Though the land in question of
	respondent no.11 falls within the MPSEZ, the activity to be
	undertaken by it does not attract the EIA Notification or violate
	any of the environmental laws. Therefore, the question of
	stalling/delaying the construction and developmental activities in
	any way does not arise. In so far as any approvals or permissions
	that may be required by MPSEZ are concerned, the answering
	respondent denies the same for want of knowledge.
</p>
<p id="p_40">	According to the
	respondent, without prejudice to the above, the pendency of any
	approvals to be obtained by MPSEZ, however, cannot in any manner be
	a reason for stalling/delaying the construction and developmental
	activities undertaken by respondent no.11 especially when the fact
	remains that the activity to be undertaken by it does not attract or
	violate any of the environmental laws or norms including the EIA
	Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_41">	It is the say of
	the respondents that as long as the individual units falling within
	the SEZ have the requisite independent
	approvals/permissions/clearances from the competent authorities and
	do not attract the provisions of the EIA Notification, an overall EC
	is not a condition precedent for the answering respondent to
	commence its activities. As respondent no.11 has the necessary
	approvals/permissions (NOC) in place from the GPCB and Letter of
	Approval and the activity undertaken by it does not attract EIA
	Notification or violate any of the environmental laws, even if
	Mundra SEZ does not currently have an overall EC, the same cannot be
	a hindrance or obstruction in any of the construction/developmental
	activities being undertaken by respondent no.11 at site.
</p>
<p id="p_42">	It is also the
	stand of respondent no.10 that it did seek clarification from the
	Ministry of Environment and Forests regarding the issue at hand
	giving details of the relevant factual matrix. Since the activities
	of both respondent no.10 and 11 are similar wherein respondent
	no.11's activity would be carried on a smaller scale, the
	clarification received from MoEF to the effect that an EC would not
	be required by respondent no.10 would squarely apply to respondent
	no.11's case as well.
</p>
<p id="p_43">	It is also the
	stand of respondent no.11 that it has come to its knowledge that the
	petitioners are well aware of the past litigation in relation to the
	same issues, some of which are still pending before this High Court
	or other authorities. According to respondent nos.10 and 11, in the
	garb of public interest litigation, identical issues are being
	agitated before the Court, either by using different party names or
	addressing to issues in piecemeal in order to give a new colour to
	the same issues. According to the respondents, all the purported
	issues raised by the petitioners herein have been dealt with in the
	past and, therefore, the petition in the present form is not
	maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_44">I.
</p><p id="p_45">	 Contentions on behalf of the petitioners :
</p>
<p id="p_46">	Mr.Anand Yagnik,
learned advocate appearing for the petitioners vehemently submitted
that in the absence of mandatory prior environmental clearance under
the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 issued under
Rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 read with <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_7">Section
3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 granted to respondent
no.8 - Mundra Port Special Economic Zone Limited, respondent no.10 -
Alstom Bharat Forge Power Limited could not have started construction
of its factory for the manufacturing of power plant equipments within
the very MPSEZ.
</p>
<p id="p_47">	Mr.Yagnik further
submitted that there is another collective venture in the form of 
Kalyani Alstom Power Limited (respondent no.11) of the same group to
whom land is allotted adjacent to the land allotted to respondent
no.10. According to Mr.Yagnik, the construction and developmental
activities of the land so allotted within the MPSEZ is going on at a
time when the MPSEZ itself does not have environmental clearance and,
therefore, the question of any unit therein starting construction and
development does not arise at all.
</p>
<p id="p_48">	According to
Mr.Yagnik, if the respective units to come within the SEZ also fall
within Schedule A or B industry as per the notification, then such
industry also is obliged to obtain environmental clearance
independently after the SEZ is granted the clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_49">	Mr.Yagnik further
submitted that the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 is a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_9">Central

the Rules, first Environmental
Impact Assessment Notification, 1994 and thereafter Environmental
Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 was brought about for imposing
certain restrictions and prohibition on new projects and activities
or on the expansion or modernization of existing projects or
activities based on their potential environmental impact as indicated
in the Schedule to the Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_50">	According
to Mr.Yagnik, the Schedule of EIA Notification provides
category A and B industries. Category A industries require prior
environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
Government of India, whereas Category B industries require prior
environmental clearance from the State Environmental Impact
Assessment authority constituted by the State Pollution Control
Board. According to Mr.Yagnik, as per the Schedule the unit in
question falls within Item No.5(k) and all projects relating to Item
No.5(k) would require prior environmental clearance.

<p id="p_54">	Instances have
come to the notice of this Ministry where the project proponents have
undertaken construction activities relating to the project at site
without obtaining the requisite prior environmental clearance as is
mandated under the EIA Notification, 2006. It is to reiterate that
the EIA Notification, 2006 mandates prior environment clearance to be
obtained in respect of all the activities listed therein following
the prescribed procedure. No activity relating to any project covered
under this Notification including civil construction, can be
undertaken at site without obtaining prior environmental clearance
except fencing of the site to protect it from getting encroached and
construction of temporary shed(s) for the guard(s).

provisions thereof. The project proponent may also note that in case
of any project where TORs have been prescribed for undertaking
detailed EIA study and where construction activities relating to the

<p id="p_59">	Relying
on the contents of the letter referred to above, Mr.Yagnik submitted
that no activity relating to any project including civil construction
can be undertaken at the site without obtaining prior environmental
clearance. According to Mr.Yagnik, in spite of this, respondent
nos.10 and 11 have admitted in their reply that they have completed
fencing, ground-levelling and pilling work at the project site.
Mr.Yagnik invited our attention to a letter dated 30th
July 2010 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and
Industries, under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_12">Information Act</a>, on the basis of which
Mr.Yagnik submitted that respondent nos.10 and 11 are the units
within the Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone. According to
Mr.Yagnik, before grant of environmental clearance public hearing is
mandatory and so far as objection to the grant of environmental
clearance to the MPSEZ is concerned, they have already been lodged
and the final decision in this regard is still awaited, meaning to
say that till this date the
MPSEZ itself has not been granted any environmental clearance
certificate. Thus, according to Mr.Yagnik, learned advocate for the
petitioners, this is a fit case where this Court must issue
appropriate writ, order or direction upon respondent nos.10 and 11 to
immediately stop developing the land in question allotted
to them within the revenue limits of village Navinal falling within
the Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone, in public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_60">II.
</p><p id="p_61">	 Contentions
on behalf of respondent no.8 (Mundra
 Port and
Special Economic Zone) :
</p>
<p id="p_62">	Learned
senior counsel Mr.Mihir Thakore appearing for respondent
no.8 - Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone Limited submitted
that the MPSEZ has been incorporated in 2003 under the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_13">Companies Act</a>, 1956 for the development, operation and
maintenance of the Mundra Port SEZ, this project has also been
approved in principle for setting up of Special Economic Zone from
the Ministry of Commerce, Government of India. Mr.Thakore giving us
more than fair idea about MPSEZ, submitted that only the
infrastructure in the SEZ has to be provided, operated and maintained
by MPSEZ, while the remaining  area shall be laid out into plots for
various purposes like industrial, commercial, residential,
recreational, etc. and will be sold/leased for development. According
to Mr.Thakore, the MPSEZ need to obtain environmental clearance
considering the impact due to all the pollution loads from the
infrastructure facilities to be provided by Mundra Port SEZ Limited
in the Special Economic Zone.
</p>
<p id="p_63">	According
to Mr.Thakore, facilities like treatment of sewage from the SEZ,
common sewage treatment plants (CSTPs) to meet the water waste
disposal standards, construction of common effluent treatment plants
(CETPs) facilities, facilities for recycling and non-recycling
materials, a full-fledged fire station with all the necessary
fire-fighting equipments,
etc. are the few infrastructural facilities which will be provided by
the MPSEZ. According to Mr.Thakore, the SEZ is specified as
Project/Activity - 7(C), Category - A, in Notification
vide S.O. 1533 dated 14th
September 2006 issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and,
therefore, the MPSEZ is required to obtain prior environmental
clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of
India. For this purpose, a Rapid Environmental
Impact Statement has also been prepared and submitted
for perusal of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Thus,
according to Mr.Thakore, so far as the MPSEZ is concerned, the
environmental clearance is
necessary only so far as the infrastructural facilities which are to
be provided by the MPSEZ is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_64">	Mr.Thakore
further submitted that if the industries to be setup in the Mundra
SEZ generate any kind of environmental pollution in the form of air,
water and/or hazardous waste, they shall have to appropriately manage
and handle the same in compliance with the prevailing environmental
norms of the Gujarat State Pollution Control Board and all applicable
local authorities. This responsibility shall entirely lie with the
corresponding industries.
</p>
<p id="p_65">	According to
Mr.Thakore, there may be many such industries which may not be
falling within Schedule A of the Notification and once an industry
does not fall within Schedule A category, then prior environmental
clearance need not be obtained by such an industry. If such an
industry has been set-up within the MPSEZ and if such industry is not
obliged to obtain prior environmental clearance from the appropriate
authority, then in that case, it cannot be said that such industry
can not undertake its operations until environmental clearance
certificate is being accorded in favour of the MPSEZ.
</p>
<p id="p_66">	Mr.Thakore
further invited our attention to the Notification dated
14th
September 2006 issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests
and more particularly a specific condition being attached with the
Schedule providing for list of projects for activities requiring
prior environmental clearance. The specific condition which has been
relied upon and brought to our notice reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_67">"If any
Industrial Estate/Complex/Export Processing Zones/Special Economic
Zones/Biotech Parks/Leather Complex with homogeneous type of
industries such as Items 4(d), 4(f), 5(e), 5(f) or those Industrial
estates with pre-defined set of activities not necessarily
homogeneous, obtains prior environmental clearance, individual
industries including proposed industrial housing within such
estates/complexes will not be required to take prior environmental
clearance, so long as the Terms and Conditions for the industrial
estate/complex are complied with (such estates/complexes must have a
clearly identified management with the legal responsibility of
ensuring adherence to the Terms and Conditions of prior environmental
clearance, who may be held responsible for violation of the same
throughout the life of the complex/estate."
</p>
<p id="p_68">	According
to Mr.Thakore, on plain reading of specific condition, an Economic
Zone with homogeneous type of industries such as 4(d), 4(f), 5(e),
5(f) as mentioned in the Schedule or those industrial estates with
pre-defined set of activities not necessarily homogeneous, obtains
prior environmental clearance, individual industries will not be
required to take prior environmental clearance, so long as the terms
and conditions for the economic zone are complied with. According to
Mr.Thakore, the plain reading of the specific condition would suggest
that any industry other than
mentioned in Item nos.4(d), 4(f), 5(e), 5(f) will have to obtain
environmental clearance if at all the unit is such which is covered
under the Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_69">III.
</p><p id="p_70">	 Contentions
on behalf of respondent nos.10 and  11
:
</p>
<p id="p_71">	Mr.Mihir
Joshi, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent nos.10 and 11
vehemently submitted that the Notification dated 14th
September 2006 relied upon by the petitioners is not applicable so
far as respondent nos.10 and
11 are concerned. According to Mr.Joshi, there is a serious
misconception in the mind of the petitioners that the unit which has
been set-up by respondent no.10 is a unit of a type as specified in
Item No.5(k) of the Schedule appended to the Notification. According
to Mr.Joshi, the unit is not induction/arc furnaces/cupola furnaces
5TPH or more. In short, the contention of Mr.Joshi is that it is not
a power plant but it is an engineering unit. Mr.Joshi explained to us
that respondent no.10 is in the process of setting up a manufacturing
unit for carrying out fabrication and assembling of steam turbines,
generators and other equipments on the land. This activity would
involve designing, engineering, manufacturing, assembling, supplying,
erecting and commissioning of environmentally most advanced turbines
and generators for both super-critical (800/600 MW) and sub-critical
(600/500/300 MW) power plants. According to Mr.Joshi, respondent
no.10 has invested around Rs.2000 crore in this venture and would
manufacture 5000 MW of equipments per annum, including super-critical
technology with possibilities of joint forays into turbines and
generators for nuclear applications in due course of time. According
to Mr.Joshi, these equipments are globally proven for reducing CO2
emissions from power plants and allow much superior combustion
capabilities reducing coal consumption. According to Mr.Joshi, this
plant would not involve any primary or secondary metallurgical
processes like melting of steel or making of forgings or casting,
etc. Respondent no.10 would instead get castings and forgings in
semi-finished conditions from various vendors within and outside
India.  
</p>
<p id="p_72">	Mr.Joshi
submitted that as a matter of fact, his client addressed a
detailed letter dated 12th
October 2011 to the Special Secretary, Ministry of Environment and
Forests, Government of India, requesting to clarify as to whether
there is any need to obtain environmental clearance for the project
they proposed to setup within the MPSEZ in terms of the provisions of
the Gazette of India Notification No.16071 dated
14th
September 2006. Mr.Joshi submitted that in response to the said
letter his client received a reply dated 24th
October 2011, wherein in clear terms it has been informed that the
proposal as put up does not attract the provision of EIA
Notification, 2006. However, the
proponent shall obtain a clearance under the CRZ Notification, 2011,
Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_14">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980, if
applicable in the case of his client.
</p>
<p id="p_73">	According to
Mr.Joshi, when the Ministry of Environment and Forests itself has
clarified that there is no need of any clearance certificate to be
obtained in terms of Notification, 2006, then only because
environmental clearance has not been granted to the MPSEZ by itself
cannot be a ground to stop the project of his client.

on behalf of respondent no.1 - Union  of
India :
</p>
<p id="p_76">	Mr.P.S.Champaneri,
learned Assistant Solicitor General of India appearing for the Union
of India submitted that the issue as regards the need to obtain
environmental clearance in terms of the provisions of EIA
Notification, 2006 has been well explained by the department in its
letter dated 25th
October 2011 (Annexure-G to the petition at p.213). Mr.Champaneri
confirms the contents of the letter dated 25th
October 2011 and submitted that he has nothing more to say in the
matter.
</p>
<p id="p_77">V.	 Reply
by the petitioners :
</p>
<p id="p_78">	In
reply  to the contentions of the respondents, learned advocate
Mr.Yagnik submitted that, whether the unit proposed to be setup
within the MPSEZ needs to obtain an independent environmental
clearance certificate or not, is not an important question in the
present petition but, according to Mr.Yagnik, if the MPSEZ itself has
not been granted
environmental clearance under the Notification of 2006, then in that
case, any other unit setup within the MPSEZ whether requires
environmental clearance or not, cannot proceed with the construction
of the work. The sum and substance of the contention of Mr.Yagnik is
that, so long as the MPSEZ does not get the environmental
clearance, no other unit who has been allotted plots within the MPSEZ
can proceed with the work of construction irrespective of the fact
that whether individually they need to obtain any
environmental clearance or not.
</p>
<p id="p_79">VI.	 Analysis
:
</p>
<p id="p_80">	Having
heard learned counsel for the respective parties and having perused
the materials on record, the short question for our consideration in
this petition is as to whether in the absence of any environmental
clearance certificate granted in favour of the MPSEZ in terms of the
Notification dated 14th
September 2006 issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
Government of India, whether the unit proposed to be setup by
respondent no.10 within the MPSEZ can proceed with the construction
work or not irrespective of the fact as to whether respondent no.10
is obliged to obtain any independent environmental clearance for the
project or not.

	The
undersigned is directed to refer to your letter no. nil dated
12.10.2011 regarding applicability of Environment Impact Assessment
(EIA) Notification, 2006 for fabrication and assembling for steam
turbine, generators and associated equipments.
</p>
<p id="p_87">2.	The matter
has been examined. It is noted that M/s ALSTOM Bharat Forge Power
Limited (ABFPL) would design, engineer, manufacture, assemble,
supply, erect and commission turbine and generators for both super
critical and sub critical power plants at Mundra in District Kutch in
Gujarat. 'Consent to Establishment' under the provisions of Air and
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water Act</a>s and authorization under the Hazardous Waste (Management,
Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 has been obtained.
The cost of the project is Rs.2,000 crores.
</p>
<p id="p_88">3.	It is also
noted that the process of manufacturing of turbines and generators
involves welding, machining and stress relieving on forging or
castings etc. For this purpose, a pit type annealing furnace would be
installed which would operate at a temperature of 7500 C.
The company would obtain casting and forgings in semi finished
conditions from various suppliers within and outside the country. No
melting or primary and secondary metallurgical process is involved.
</p>
<p id="p_89">4.	Under the
EIA Notification, 2006, the new projects or expansion or
modernization of existing projects regarding primary and secondary
metallurgical industry require prior environmental clearance from the
Ministry. As per the EIA Notification amended on 1st
December, 2009, in case of secondary metallurgical process industrial
units, involving operation of furnaces only such as induction and
electric arc furnace, submerged arc furnace and cupola with capacity
more than 30,000 TPA would require environmental clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_90">5.	In view of
the above, the instant proposal does not attract the provisions of
EIA Notification, 2006. The proponent shall obtain clearance under
the CRZ Notification, 2011, Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_16">Forest

</p>
<p id="p_92">	Independently
of the letter too, we have examined the issue as to whether there is

	The amendment as
it stands now as per the Notification dated 1st December
2009 reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_94">"(xi)
item 5(k) and the entries relating thereto shall be omitted."
</p>
<p id="p_95">	As against that,
we have also noticed that even if it is believed that the project of
respondent no.10 involves operation of furnaces, even then,
environmental clearance would not be necessary because the company
would utilize a pit type annealing furnace. The capacity of this
furnace is to handle Rotors weighing upto 120 tonnes with a cycle
time of approximately 4 days. The maximum temperature of this furnace
is 7500 C and the monthly load of stress relieving would
be maximum 120 tonnes. On the other hand, as per the Notification of
2009 what would be the position in case of secondary metallurgical
processing industrial unit involving operation of furnaces has been
made clear. As per Notification of 1st December 2009, the
position would be as under :
</p>
<p id="p_96">"General
condition shall apply.
</p>
<p id="p_97">Note :
</p>
<p id="p_98">	The recycling
	industrial units registered under the HSM Rules, are exempted.
</p>
<p id="p_99">	In case of
	secondary metallurgical processing industrial units, those projects
	involving operation of furnaces only such as induction and electric
	arc furnace, submerged arc furnace, and cupola with capacity more
	than 30,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) would require environment
	clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_100">	Plant/units
	other than power plants (given against entry no.1(d) of the
	schedule), based on municipal solid waste (non-hazardous) are
	exempted."
</p>
<p id="p_101">	Thus,
it is now made abundantly clear by the Notification of 2009 that only
those projects involving operation of furnaces such as induction and
electric arc furnace, submerged arc furnace, and cupola with capacity
of more than 30,000 tonnes per annum would require environmental
clearance. The case of respondent no.10 definitely does not fall
within this category and we have no hesitation in coming to the
conclusion that respondent no.10 independently is not obliged to
obtain environmental clearance from the authority concerned so far as
their project is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_102">	The
second question and the most important question which we shall
now proceed to answer is as to whether respondent no.10 can proceed
further with the construction work in the absence of any
environmental clearance being given to the MPSEZ. This has been the
principal contention of Mr.Yagnik, learned advocate appearing for the
petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_103">	A specific query
in this regard was raised by us and in reply to the same, Mr.Thakore,
learned senior counsel appearing for the MPSEZ submitted that
assuming for the moment that environmental clearance is not being
given to the MPSEZ, then in that case, all infrastructural facilities
which the MPSEZ was to provide in general to all the units within the
MPSEZ will have to be provided by individual units within the MPSEZ.
In the first brush, the reply appeared to be quite attractive and
convincing but if this reply of Mr.Thakore is accepted then, in our
view, the whole object behind seeking environmental clearance would
be frustrated. Not only this, but it will amount to doing violence
with the Notification dated 14th September 2006 issued by
the Ministry of Environment and Forests, in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_104">	The question,
thus, remains to be decided is about environmental clearance. It is
not the stand of respondent no.8 - MPSEZ that environmental
clearance is not necessary before commencement of the construction
for the purpose of providing infrastructural facilities. This fact is
very much evident from the executive summary prepared by the MPSEZ
and placed before the Ministry of Environment and Forests, for the
purpose of obtaining environmental clearance. In the executive
summary in so many words it has been stated as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_105">"Purpose
of Rapid Environment Impact Assessment
 


The Special
Economic Zone is specified as : Project/Activity-7(C), Category -
A, in Notification vide S.O. 1533 dated 14th September,

study of impacts due to all the possible pollution loads from the
infrastructure facilities to be provided by Mundra SEZ Ltd. in the
SEZ. The report has been prepared based on the guidelines recommended
by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF)."
</p>
<p id="p_107">	Before
we proceed further to decide this question, it would be necessary to
set out the relevant statutory provisions and the Notifications.
Relevant portion of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_18">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,
1986 reads as under :-

<p id="p_148">	Considering the
mandatory nature of the environmental clearance, procedure has to be
meticulously followed. Only on environmental clearance, any
construction - preliminary or otherwise, relating to setting up of
the project, can be undertaken. There is an express prohibition that
"no construction work, preliminary or otherwise, relating to
the setting up of the project, may be undertaken till the
environmental and/or site clearance is obtained".
</p>
<p id="p_149">	Having regard to
the mandatory nature of the environmental clearance and the object
behind the Notification dated 14th September 2006, we have
no doubt in our mind that respondent nos.10 and 11 could not have
proceeded ahead with their projects. At the best, respondent no.8 -
MPSEZ could have allotted the plots to the companies desirous of
putting up their own units. In any case, the allottee of a plot (i.e.
the lessee) cannot proceed ahead with the construction of the unit
without the MPSEZ obtaining environmental clearance from the Ministry
of Environment and Forests.
</p>
<p id="p_150">	We are unable to
fathom the idea that all the infrastructural facilities which the
MPSEZ is obliged to provide will have to be taken care of by the
individual allottees in the event if for any reason the authority
concerned refuses to grant environmental clearance in favour of the
MPSEZ. The MPSEZ has acquired approximately 18000 hectares of land
from the Government for the purpose of developing a port, which is
going to be one of the Asia's biggest port. The Government has
allotted approximately 18000 hectares of land for the purpose of
developing a port. If the MPSEZ itself is not accorded environmental
clearance, then the question will be as to who will develop the port
and whether the port can be developed by the allottees who have been
allotted land by the MPSEZ. This area of 18000 hectares includes 14
villages of Mundra Taluka and the MPSEZ has to provide for
infrastructural facilities on a large scale, which include gardens,
playgrounds, dwelling units, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries,
schools, colleges, market places, hostels, hotels, restaurants,
cafeterias, theaters, auditoriums, libraries, public entertainments,
clubs, public utilities, service building and such other facilities,
conveyances and amenities as the MPSEZ may deem it necessary or
expedient for carrying out the objects of the MPSEZ and/or Mundra
SEZ. For any reason, if the environmental clearance is not granted in
favour of the MPSEZ, then how will the allottees be able to provide
for such infrastructural facilities or infrastructure on their own,
which the MPSEZ has agreed to provide as per the terms of the
agreement. One cannot forget or overlook the fact that environmental
clearance is required to be obtained by the MPSEZ because it has the
obligation of providing the infrastructural facilities as referred to
above and while providing such infrastructure, it will definitely
have some impact on the environment and that is the reason why, after
extensive study of the entire project, the authority has to decide as
to whether environmental clearance must be granted or not. Under such
circumstances, it is very difficult for us to accept the submission
of Mr.Thakore that the individual allottees will take care of the
infrastructural facilities. However, taking into consideration the
infrastructural facilities which are required on a port, it is
humanly impossible for an individual allottee or a unit holder to
provide all such facilities on its own.
</p>
<p id="p_151">	Over and above
this, we are also of the view that if the MPSEZ has already allotted
plots to different companies for setting up of the industrial plants
and if such allottees have proceeded ahead with construction of their
individual plants in the absence of any infrastructural facilities
available at the port, then that by itself will lead to a very
disastrous situation.
</p>
<p id="p_152">	When law requires
a thing to be done in a particular manner, the same must be done in
the same manner or not done at all. The law envisages that no
construction, preliminary or otherwise, can be undertaken without
environmental clearance and the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of T.N.Govindavarman Thirumulkpad v/s. Union of India, reported
in (2002) 10 SCC 606, also holds that it is impermissible to
undertake construction of project before such a clearance, therefore,
there is no reason why we should permit respondent nos.10 and 11 to
go ahead with their project.
</p>
<p id="p_153">	It appears to us
that respondent nos.10 and 11 have taken this issue very lightly. No
doubt, being allottees they would be more interested in going ahead
with their venture. But, the question is, at what cost. We cannot
overlook the fact that public hearing precedes environmental
clearance. Law envisages that before the environmental clearance is
granted, the objections in this regard must be considered by giving
public hearing.  One cannot lose
the sight of the fact that the persons who lodge their objections or
make suggestions before the committee are not only entitled to get
copies of the minutes of the meeting at the public hearing, but
ultimately if the Central Government grants the environmental
clearance, under S.11 of the National Environmental Appellate
Authority Act, 1997, they also have a right to prefer an appeal to
the Appellate Authority against the order granting environmental
clearance. <a href="/doc/79889043/" id="a_23">Section 11(2)</a> of the said Act also defines "person"
as any person who is likely to be affected by the grant of
environmental clearance or any association of persons (whether
incorporated or not) likely to be affected by such order and
functioning in the field of environment. Therefore, grant of
environmental clearance is not just an empty formality but the
authority has to threadbare consider each and every aspect relating
to the environment. We have noticed that in the present case also,
public hearing had taken place and series of objections have been
raised by various people. We have also noticed that the objections
are of a very serious nature and cannot be brushed aside lightly.
</p>
<p id="p_154">	Our attention has
been drawn to the objections placed in writing in this regard, which
we would like to incorporate thus :
</p>
<p id="p_155">"1. The
project for which the public hearing is going on has already
completed 75% of the construction activities. The venue for the
public hearing has been selected away from the project location such
that the public hearing committee does not see the construction that
has taken place. I am ready to show you the location where the
construction activities are taking place without permission. The
videography of the construction must be taken before the end of the
public hearing and only then the public hearing must be concluded.
</p>
<p id="p_156">	The company
	has constructed parts of West port and laid a railway line on forest
	land without getting the necessary permissions. If the clearance has
	been obtained, then the company may produce the documents by the end
	of the public hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_157">	If the SEZ is
	given clearance, then the company will construct a boundary wall
	thereby blocking the fishermens' access to their traditional
	settlements. Also, there are several creeks which are important for
	fishermen, these will be rendered unusable. Nearly 10,000 fishermen
	depend on traditional fishing and if their occupation is affected,
	then it will have a direct impact on their families. Why should the
	company be allowed to establish at the cost of the fishing
	community.
</p>
<p id="p_158">	The company is
	in possession of Government land meant for rehabilitation of
	displaced persons. The company has also taken possession of Gauchar
	lands. In Luni village there is no Gauchar land left at all. Nearly
	5000 cattle depend on the Gauchar land and if the project is allowed
	then the animal husbandry in the area will be severely affected.
	What steps will the company take in this regard ?
</p>
<p id="p_159">	The company
	has taken possession of nearly 18,000 Ha. of land in the Mundra
	area. However, as per the central government notification, only
	6472.8684 Ha. of land has been notified as SEZ. All the excess land
	in the possession of the company has to be given back to the
	Government and the lease must be cancelled. Why has the company
	acquired excess land ?  Is the company ready to give the land back
	to the Government ?
</p>
<p id="p_160">	There are
	several temples and mosques within the SEZ area. If the SEZ is
	allowed then these monuments will be destroyed and also the access
	road to these areas of religious importance will be blocked. What
	steps will the company take in this regard ?
</p>
<p id="p_161">	The company
	has defrauded the public as well as the Government authorities. The
	company acquired forest land for the purpose of the Mundra Port and
	Special Economic Zone and destroyed mangroves in the area. As per
	rules, the company is supposed to do compensatory afforestation in
	another area. But the company has given land near Kori Creek, which
	is under the control of the BSF and also it is an area which already
	has dense mangroves. No new mangroves are grown. What is the
	company's response to this ?
</p>
<p id="p_162">	The company
	says that it is being established so that industrial development can
	take place. For this, the annual tax subsidy given by the government
	to the Mundra SEZ amounts to nearly 1765.65 Cr. However, consider
	the fact that the Central and State Government announced a package
	of Rs.8,500 Cr. After Kutch earthquake. In just five years, so much
	development has taken place in Kutch. When the company is getting so
	many subsidies from the Government and there is no benefit for the
	public, how can this be called as development ?
</p>
<p id="p_163">	The Mundra
	coast has a vast intertidal zone. This area falls under CRZ I as per
	Government records. The company is filling such area with soil and
	using it for port backup/SEZ area and establishing industries over
	it. The hydrology of the area will be affected and the water that is
	blocked in this area will enter into other areas. What steps are
	being taken by the company to mitigate this ?
</p>
<p id="p_164">	Nearly 20
	companies have already been established in the Mundra SEZ. Because
	of this, already the marine pollution is increasing. If the SEZ is
	permitted then more industries will be allowed and there will be
	significant impact on agriculture and animal husbandry. What is the
	response of the company to this issue ?
</p>
<p id="p_165">	The company
	has acquired land at a price of Rs.2 to Rs.10 from the state
	government and then sold it back to Government companies like IOC,
	<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a>L at exorbitant rates of around Rs.600/-. This is misuse of
	taxpayers' money and only the company is making profits. The Mundra
	SEZ should not be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_166">	The Waterfront
	development project of the company was given environment clearance
	inspite of people's opposition and it is causing great damage to the
	environment. The workers employed by the company are cutting
	mangroves and using it as fuel wood. The mangrove cover is reducing
	day by day. This will affect marine life in a significant way. What
	does the company say in this regard ?
</p>
<p id="p_167">	The forest
	department has done afforestation and mangrove plantation at a cost
	of nearly 50 lakhs and now this area has been given to the Mundra
	SEZ. This is not acceptable. The Mundra SEZ must not be given
	clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_168">	There is
	significant horticulture in the area, which will be affected if the
	Mundra SEZ is allowed, therefore the Mundra SEZ should not be given
	Environmental Clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_169">	The company
	has not enclosed any ToR given by the MoEF for the EIA of the Mundra
	SEZ. No ToR compliance report has been submitted. It is not clear
	whether the EIA is complete or not.
</p>
<p id="p_170">	The EIA is
	based on data collected between 2006 and 2008. However, several
	changes have taken place in the meantime. Why has the EIA report
	containing latest data not been submitted for the public hearing ?
</p>
<p id="p_171">	Eight CFS
	terminals are under operation without permission in the Mundra SEZ.
	The Kandla SEZ has also raised this issue. This is a violation of
	environmental laws. Now the public hearing is being held so that the
	violations can be regularized. Will the company clarify in this
	matter ?
</p>
<p id="p_172">	In view of the
above objections, I demand that :
</p>
<p id="p_173">	The Adani
	Mundra SEZ must not be given Environment Clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_174">	Construction
	has already taken place in the area notified for the SEZ. The
	environment public hearing committee may visit these areas and take
	videography of the construction that has taken place and submit it
	to the authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_175">	The
	construction that is going in the SEZ area must be stopped
	immediately and heavy fine imposed on the Adani group for the
	violations."
</p>
<p id="p_176">	If respondent
nos.10 and 11 are permitted to go ahead with the construction so far
as their units are concerned on the assumption or hope that
environmental clearance would be granted to the MPSEZ in recent
future, and in the same manner if other units also identically
situated like respondent nos.10 and11 proceed ahead, then practically
the right of appeal which has been provided under the Act against
grant of environmental clearance to any aggrieved person would also
stand frustrated. 
</p>
<p id="p_177">	In view of what
has been discussed above holding that action of respondent nos.10 and
11 in implementation of the project without environmental clearance
being accorded in favour of the MPSEZ under the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_25">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, the rules framed thereunder and
the Notification, is illegal, it is not permissible for respondent
nos.10 and 11 to proceed ahead with the implementation of their
project till the MPSEZ obtains the environmental clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_178">	We dispose of
this writ-petition with a direction to respondent nos.10 and 11 not
to proceed ahead in implementation of their project and not to
undertake any further construction work, whether preliminary or
otherwise, till the MPSEZ is granted environmental clearance. The
writ-petition to that extent is allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_179">Per:
</p><p id="p_180">  Shri. Bhaskar Bhattacharya, Acting C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_181">	I had the advantage of going
through the judgment just delivered by my Brother Pardiwala, J. in
advance. I fully agree with the detailed discussion of the facts,
lucid analysis of the law and the relief granted by His Lordship to
the petitioner. However, in view of importance of the question
involved, I propose to add a few words of my own.
</p>
<p id="p_182">	The moot question that falls
for determination in this Public Interest Litigation is, if the MPSEZ
itself has not been granted environmental clearance under the
Notification of 2006 by the Central Government, whether any unit
setup within the MPSEZ, as a Lessee of the MPSEZ, can proceed with
the construction work irrespective of the fact whether such
individual unit is required to obtain separate environmental
clearance or not.
</p>
<p id="p_183">	Mr Thakore and Mr Joshi, the
learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of MPSEZ and respondent
No.10 respectively, submitted that even if, ultimately, the
environmental clearance is not given to the MPSEZ, the
infrastructural facilities which the MPSEZ is required to provide to
all the units within the same, will have to be arranged by the
individual unit itself within the MPSEZ, after obtaining direct
permission from the Central Government.
</p>
<p id="p_184">	There is no dispute that
although MPSEZ has applied for environmental clearance as required
under the law, till date, the same has not been conferred and
notwithstanding such fact, MPSEZ has already executed separate lease
deeds in favour of different units like respondent No.10.
</p>
<p id="p_185"> It appears from the Lease Deed
executed between MPSEZ and respondent No.10 that there is clear
mention of the fact that the Government of India has permitted MPSEZ,
the Lessor, vide
a Letter of Approval dated April 12, 2006 to establish a
Multi-Product Special Economic Zone at Mundra and the Lessee, i.e.,
the respondent No.10,
was desirous to take on lease a plot of land in the processing area
of the MPSEZ for setting up a unit for manufacture of Turbine,
Generator and other spares and auxiliaries related to those products
and also for providing services of erection and commissioning of
above mentioned products. According to the terms of the lease-deed,
the Lessee is required to pay Annual Lease Rent at the rate of Rs.20
a square meter payable annually in advance and the same shall be
escalated every five (5) years at the rate of twenty percent (20%)
and the first escalation of Annual Lease Rent shall be made in the
year 2015-16 with effect from 1st
April 2015. According to the terms of the lease,
in addition to the Annual Rent indicated above, the Lessee is also
required to pay SEZ maintenance charges at the rate of Rs.18/- a
square meter per annum for the maintenance and upkeep of all the
infrastructural facilities provided to the Land and the determination
of such amount of Maintenance charges shall be done in an open and
transparent manner and would be reviewed by the Development
Commissioner of Mundra SEZ. According to the said term, any upward
revision of the Maintenance Charges with a maximum frequency of once
a year can be made unless a requirement of refurbishment due to
damages to infrastructure caused by natural or man made factor
arises. The said deed further provides that the Lessor shall have
right to charge fifteen percent (15%) towards management and
coordination of Mundra SEZ maintenance and refurbishment as above.
The deed further mentions that in case of failure of the Lessee to
pay the above Annual Lease Rent or SEZ Maintenance Charge  would make
 the Lessee a defaulter and will give right to the Lessor to
terminate the Lease before expiry of the period mentioned therein.
</p>
<p id="p_186">	In the Lease Deed, the Lessor
covenants that it would comply with all the terms and conditions from
time to time which have been mentioned in Letter of Approval under
which it has been permitted by the Government to establish Mundra
SEZ. In clause 3.4, it has been further asserted by the Lessor that
it has obtained all the required permissions and the Governmental
Approvals as required in the name of Lessor for granting lease of the
land to the Lessee and shall be responsible to comply with all the
required terms and conditions and such permissions and approvals
received from the Government and shall keep such approvals and
permissions in force (to
the extent  necessary under applicable Laws) and shall make all its
statutory compliances to keep the Lease in full force and effect
during the entire term.
</p>
<p id="p_187">	From the above clause of the
Lease Deed, it is clear that the Lease has been executed not only for
enjoyment of the land under the SEZ, but also for the purpose of
giving infrastructural facilities provided to the land for which
separate maintenance charge has been provided. It further appears
that the Lessor was conscious that it was required to comply with all
the terms and conditions from time to time which has been mentioned 
in the Letter of Approval and it further asserted that it has
obtained all the required permissions and Governmental Approvals as
required in the name of Lessor and is also responsible to comply with
all the permissions and approvals received from the Government and
shall keep such approvals and permissions in force to keep the lease
in full force and effect during the entire term.
</p>
<p id="p_188">	It is an admitted fact that
environmental clearance required to be taken by the Lessor has been
applied for but has not yet been granted. Nevertheless, the Lessor
has asserted the above fact of getting permission and keeping such
permission alive during the subsistence of lease in favour of the
respondent no. 10. Over and above, it has also decided to accept not
only rent for land but also the maintenance charges for giving
infrastructural facilities in advance as mentioned in the Deed.
</p>
<p id="p_189">	I, therefore, find no
substance in the contention of Mr Thakore or Mr Joshi, the learned
senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 8 and 10
respectively that if in the long run, no environmental clearance is
given by the Central Government, the separate unit holders would be
to make independent arrangements for infrastructural facilities by
taking separate permission of their own from the Central Government
because such provision is not indicated in the lease deed. On the
other hand, the Lease Deed casts a duty upon the Lessor to provide
for such facilities in lieu of rent and maintenance charge. 
</p>
<p id="p_190">	I have already pointed out
that the Lease is executed not only for the enjoyment of the
possession in the land but also for enjoyment of infrastructural
facilities to be arranged by the Lessor and if required permission
for such infrastructural facilities has not yet been given by the
Central Government, the Lessor, in my opinion, was not even competent
to create a Lease for the above purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_191">	I, thus, find substance in the
contention of the petitioner that so long the Lessor itself is not
vested with the right to have establishment of various
infrastructural facilities by taking environmental clearance, it
cannot confer the right of enjoyment of such facilities to its
Lessee.
</p>
<p id="p_192">	It is now well known that
Lease is a doctrine of separation of title from actual enjoyment of
the subject matter. Before execution of a Lease in favour of a
Lessee, the Lessor retains both the title and the right of enjoyment
of the property.  Once a Lease is executed, the Lessor retains only
the title to the property but loses its right of enjoyment thereof by
conferring the same in favour of its Lessee. According to the 2006
Notification, in order to have such right of creation of
infrastructural facilities over the land allotted, prior approval of
the Central Government is necessary before making any construction
and thus, without having acquired such right, the MPSEZ, the allottee
from the Government, could not convey such right to its Lessee. In
other words, a Lessee cannot have better right than that of his
Lessor in the property. Law is also well settled that there cannot
any valid Lease for enjoyment of a property, which is not in
existence and not capable of being put into possession of the Lessee
at the time of execution of the Lease.
</p>
<p id="p_193">	I, thus, find that so long the
environmental clearance is not granted by the Central Government in
favour of MPSEZ for creation of infrastructural facilities on the
land so allotted and consequent to such permission, such facilities
have been actually created by the allottee, the latter cannot
lawfully lease out the right of enjoyment of the infrastructural
facilities to its Lessee.
</p>
<p id="p_194">	I, consequently, agree with my
learned Brother as regards the relief granted to the petitioner in
this application ordered by His Lordship.

 FURTHER ORDER
 


 


 


	After this
judgment is pronounced, Mr. Mihir Thakore, the learned Senior Counsel
appearing on behalf of the respondent No.8 and Mr. Parikh, learned
Advocate appearing on behalf of respondents Nos. 10 and 11 pray for
stay of operation of our above order.
</p>
<p id="p_196">	In view of what
have been stated above, we do not find any reason to stay our order. 
The prayer, therefore, is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_197">	We, however, make
it clear that we have not gone into the question whether in the facts
of the present case the respondent No.9 is entitled to get
environmental clearance within the narrow scope of this petition.
