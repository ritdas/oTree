     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                               ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      By filing this public interest litigation, the appointment of

the Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is

impugned on the ground that the person, who had been

appointed, lacks the requisite qualification.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.      Our attention is drawn to <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_1">Section 4</a> of the Water

(Prevention    and   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control   of Pollution) Act</a>,   1974, which

prescribes the qualification for the Chairman.


</p><p id="p_3">      3.      Mr.K.G.Sadashivaiah, learned advocate appearing

in support of the writ petition, submits that a proposal was

mooted for appointment of more suitable persons, but the

government has ignored the proposal and appointed the

present Chairman.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      4.      Certain proposals were mooted, but it was the

responsibility of the government to appoint the Chairman.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    3</span>
</p><p id="p_6">       5.    We do not find any material on record to show

that   the   person,   who   had       been   appointed,   lacks   the

qualification. There is, therefore, no merit in the writ petition.


</p><p id="p_7">       6.    The writ petition stands rejected.


</p><p id="p_8">       7.    We make no order as to costs.
