                         JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This appeal challenges the directions dated 12.4.2012 issued by
the Goa State Pollution Control Board, the First Respondent herein
under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention Control
Pollution) Act 1981. Thereby the First Respondent has
cancelled/revoked consent to operate dated 24.2.2012 and further
directed the Appellant to stop business activities forthwith and
report compliance within a period of seven days.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     Necessary facts for the disposal of this appeal can be stated
thus. The Appellant purchased a plot measuring 510 sq.m in survey
No. 202/1A of village Calangute along with an existing house therein.
The said house bearing No. 5/212/C has been in existence since
1970. The Appellant converted the said old house into a small guest
house consisting 20 rooms. After obtaining "No Objection
Certificate" from the Village Panchayat, the Appellant commenced a
Guest House business under the name and style of Sea Shore Hotels.
The Appellant has made a substantial investment of Rs. 21 lakhs. He
has no other business or source of income other than the said
business. Though originally the Appellant obtained establishment
licence (Trade) from the Village Panchayat with an intention of
operating the Restaurant the same was not renewed and the
Appellant did not operate the Restaurant. While the Appellant was
carrying on the said business a neighbour Mr. Anthony D' Souza who
was running another Guest House by name and style of Horizon
Hotel due to business rivalry was making false complaints to various
authorities to initiate action against the appellant's business. There
was a strange incident of discharge of sewage from the septic tank of
the Appellant. On the complaint of D'Souza, the Health Officer
issued a Show Cause Notice dated 9.7.2011 and the first respondent
issued a notice on 12.8.2011. Both notices were replied. After
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                              Page 2 of 10</span>
 carrying out the necessary repairs and rectifying the overflow, the
appellant informed the authorities on 25.7.2011 and 18.8.2011 and
that there was no discharge of sewage thereafter. Both the Health
Officer and the officials of the first respondent made a site
inspection in the presence of D'Souza and recorded that there was
no overflow of sewage from the septic tank of appellant. Pursuant
to the communication from the First Respondent, the Appellant
applied for consent to operate on 21.9.2011 by paying necessary
fees therefor. Despite the application, the first respondent issued
directions to the Appellant under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act dated
20.1.2012. The Appellant informed to the First Respondent that
steps were taken for getting consent to operate and hence the
directions could be withdrawn. Following the necessary inspection
and also examining the application made by the appellant as well as
the detailed plans submitted by the appellant and being satisfied,
the first Respondent issued the consent to operate dated 24.2.2012
under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a> and also <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a> and the said consent to operate
dated 24.2.2012 was granted for a period upto 20.10.2014 and the
same was inforce.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      While the matter stood thus, D'Sousa made complaint through
his Advocate. Being misled by the same, the Second Respondent
issued a show cause notice dated 13.9.2011 to the Appellant. The
Appellant filed his reply on 28.9.2011 inter-alia stating that the
structure of the Appellant was an old one and he has not violated
any provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 and CRZ
Notification, 1991. He further stated that the Second Respondent
had already gone through the very same issue in the year 2004 and
after being satisfied with the documents of the Appellant had not
pursued the matter further. While the Second Respondent resorted
to drastic measure of directing disconnection of electricity and water
to the Appellant's structure through a notice dated 10.12.2004, the
Appellant approached the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay at Goa and
filed WP 103 for 2005 challenging the same. The Hon'ble High Court

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                              Page 3 of 10</span>
 by an order dated 9.3.2005 set aside the notice dated 10.12.2004
with a further direction to Second Respondent to consider the reply
of the Appellant after hearing the Appellant.          The Second
Respondent did not pursue the matter any further since it was set
aside about the non-violation of the CRZ Notification. The said Mr.
D'Souza had set up one Mr. Antony Fernandes to file another
complaint against the Appellant. Following the same, the Block
Development Officer after making the inspection has recorded that
the said house of the Appellant was in existence from the year
1970. The Appellant had received an exactly identical show cause
notice from the Second Respondent dated 13.9.2011. While the
Second Respondent was satisfied about the legality of the
Appellant's structure did not pursue the earlier show cause notice
dated 23.7.2007. Though, the said show cause notice was issued on
13.9.2011, a reply was sent by the appellant and the Second
Respondent has not pursued further. Even in an inspection held on
28.3.2012, the Respondent no.1 has not found any discharge of
sewage from the Appellant's septic tank.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     While the matter stood as above, to the shock of the Appellant,
impugned directions dated 12.4.2012 were served on 13.4.2012
cancelling/revoking the consent to operate and further directing the
Appellant to stop the business activities forthwith. The directions
referred to a communication dated 12.3.2012 made by the Second
Respondent to the First Respondent calling upon the First
Respondent to keep the consent to operate issued to the Appellant
in abeyance.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The impugned directions are void and have been issued in gross
violation of natural justice since no show cause notices were issued
to the appellant before revoking/cancelling the consent to operate.
The First Respondent is not the authority to decide the legality or
illegality of the structure. The First Respondent has acted without
jurisdiction and authority of law. The First Respondent, a statutory

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                             Page 4 of 10</span>
 authority has not acted independently but has acted under the
dictation of the Second Respondent. No reasons have been assigned
for passing the impugned directions. The Second Respondent was
not the appellant authority of the First Respondent and hence the
First Respondent should not have acted on the directions of the
Second Respondent. There was no reason to cancel or revoke the
consent to operate given to the Appellant. And thus, the directions
were arbitrary and unconstitutional and hence the impugned
directions are liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    The First Respondent has filed an affidavit with the following
averments.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       It is true that the Consent to Operate order dated 24.2.2012
was granted to the Appellant to run his Sea Shore Hotel under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>, 1981. Subsequently, the
First Respondent Board was in receipt of a letter dated 14.3.2012
from the Member Secretary of Goa Coastal Zone Management
Authority wherein the said authority informed the Board that it had
issued a show cause notice dated 13.9.2011 to the Appellant and as
such requested the First Respondent Board to keep its
Permission/Consent to Operate order dated 24.2.2012 in abeyance
till such a time the show cause notice dated 13.9.2011 issued was
decided by the Coastal Zone Management Authority. In the light of
the said directions of the Coastal Zone Management Authority, the
First Respondent Board issued the impugned directions dated
12.4.2012 under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_10">section 33A</a> read with <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_11">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_12">26</a> of the Water
Act and under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Section 31A</a> read with <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_14">section 21</a> of the Air Act and
has cancelled/revoked the consent to operate to the Appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     Despite sufficient service of notice, the Second Respondent did
not appear. And hence the Second Respondent was set ex-parte.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     The following questions arise for consideration in this appeal:
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                               Page 5 of 10</span>
<p id="p_10">      1. Whether the impugned directions are liable to be set aside
        since they have been issued in gross violation of the
        principle of natural justice?
</p><p id="p_11">     2. Whether the impugned directions are to be quashed as they
        are arbitrary and legally not sustainable?
</p>
<p id="p_12">    The Counsel for the Appellant and also for the First Respondent
Board put forth their contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_13">    The Tribunal paid its anxious consideration on the submission
made and also made scrutiny of the documents available.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      Admittedly, the Appellant purchased a plot in survey No.
202/1A together with a house bearing No. 5/212/C in village
Calangute. After getting necessary NOC dated 27.9.2007 from the
village Panchayat, the Appellant commenced his hotel business after
converting the old existing house into a small Guest House with 20
rooms with the name and style 'Sea Shore Hotels'. The NOC given to
the Appellant is found in Annexure 'B'. A neighbouring Hotel owner
one Mr. Antony D'Souza lodged a complaint to the First Respondent
which resulted in a Show Cause Notice dated 9.7.2011 from the
Health Officer and another notice dated 12.8.2011 from the First
Respondent stating there was discharge of sewage from the septic
tank of the Appellant. The Appellant carried out the necessary
repairs and informed the authorities who made inspections on
different dates and recorded that there was no overflow of sewage
from the septic tank of the Appellant which is evident from Annexure
'D'. The First Respondent has also categorically admitted in its
counter that a consent to operate order dated 24.2.2012 was
granted to the Appellant. Needless to say, the said consent to
operate should have been given by the First Respondent to the
Appellant after making necessary site inspection and following
necessary procedural formalities. It is pertinent to point out that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                             Page 6 of 10</span>
 the said Consent to Operate Order dated 24.2.2012 was for a period
upto 20.10.2014 and thus it remained in force. A reading of
Annexure 'G' will make it clear that the Second Respondent had
issued the directions disconnecting electricity and water supply to
the structure of the Appellant by a notice dated 10.12.2004 which
was set aside by the High Court of Bombay at Goa in WP 103/2005
holding that the said notice was vitiated by violation of principles of
Natural Justice. Though, the Second Respondent could have
proceeded with the same after giving opportunity to the Appellant
but did not do so. It has to be taken that the Second Respondent
was satisfied that there was no violation of CRZ Notification by the
Appellant and hence did not pursue the same. The Appellant has
also produced the necessary documents found in Annexure 'I' to
indicate that on a complaint made by one Antony Fernandes, the
Block Development Officer made an inspection and has recorded
that a house was in existence in the Appellant's property from 1970
onwards. This would also support the case of Appellant that there
was an old structure in the site and was in existence from 1970 and
thus there was no violation of CRZ Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     The directions of the first Respondent dated 12.4.2012 reads as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_16">      "AND WHEREAS, subsequently the Board, is in receipt of letter
No. GCZMA/GEN-COMPL/11-12/1356 dated 14.03.2012 from the
office of the Goa Costal Zone Authority, stating therein that the
Authority has issued a Show Cause Notice dated 13.09.2012 to Shri
Joseph Coutinho and Shri Sohil Patgel owner of M/s Sea Shore Hotel
regarding illegal construction of the structure within 200 mts from
high tide line and further requested the Board to keep the
permission granted by the Board in abeyance till the show cause
notice is decided. A copy of said letter enclosing therewith a copy of
the show cause notice dated 13.09.2011 is enclosed herewith and
marked as Annexure 'A' Colly."
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                               Page 7 of 10</span>
<p id="p_17">       The very reading of the above would clearly indicate that the
first Respondent Goa State Pollution Control Board has acted only on
a letter of the Second Respondent namely the Goa Coastal Zone
Management Authority dated 14.3.2012. The First Respondent on
the strength of the said letter has passed the drastic order
cancelling/revoking the Consent to Operate Order which was
originally granted by the first respondent to the Appellant on
24.2.2012 which would be valid till 20.10.2014. The impugned
direction is a glaring example of the gross violation of the principles
of natural justice. Not even a notice was given to the appellant by
the first Respondent nor an opportunity of being heard was offered
to the Appellant as required in Law before the order of cancellation
of Consent to Operate Order. The first Respondent is an
independent statutory authority and it has to exercise its powers
vested on it by the Statute.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     In the instant case the First Respondent has not acted
independently or has exercised powers vested upon it by following
the procedure envisaged in Law. On the contrary, it has acted on the
dictation and direction of the second Respondent which was not
expected of. The Second Respondent was neither the Appellate nor
the Superior authority of the First Respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      What are all stated in the reply affidavit which necessitated the
first Respondent to make an order of cancellation of the Consent to
Operate is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_20">     "I state that subsequently, the Respondent no. 1 Board, was in
receipt of a letter dated 14.03.2012 from the Member Secretary of
the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), wherein the
said Authority, informed the Board that it had issued a Show cause
notice dated 13.09.2011 to the present Appellants Hotel Unit,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                               Page 8 of 10</span>
 namely M/s Sea Shore Hotel, and as such requested the Respondent
Board to keep its permission/Consent to operate order dated
24.02.2012, in abeyance, till such time as the Show cause notice
dated 13.09.2011 issued was decided by the Authority."
</p>
<p id="p_21">      The very reading of the above makes it explicit that the first
respondent who on being satisfied issued consent to operate order
dated 24.02.2012 had no reason to cancel the same but has acted
pursuant to the directions of the second respondent. The first
respondent thus has not only violated the principles of natural
justice in passing the order but was also arbitrary. It is pertinent to
point out that the first respondent was not the authority to decide
the legality or otherwise of the structure of the appellant. The fact
that the Second Respondent had received a complaint against the
Appellant cannot by itself vest an authority or power on the second
Respondent to issue such a direction as found in its letter dated
14.3.2012 to the First Respondent. The First Respondent at no
stretch of imagination can issue such directions revoking or
cancelling the Consent to Operate. The Second Respondent had
already issued directions disconnecting electricity and water supply
in the year 2004. Though the said Notice was set aside by the
Hon'ble High Court of Bombay in the year 2005 itself the second
respondent had not pursued the same. Even the Show Cause Notice
referred to in the directions to the First Respondent was dated
13.9.2011. After a period of nearly six months, the Second
Respondent has addressed a letter to the First Respondent in the
month of March 2012. If really, there was any violation of the CRZ
Notification there was no impediment for the second respondent to
proceed against the Appellant. But the Second Respondent has not
done so. Instead it has directed the First Respondent to keep the
Consent to Operate the Order in abeyance which was highly illegal.
This will be quite suggestive that the second Respondent who could
not proceed on the Show Cause Notice dated 13.9.2011 to the
Appellant for lack of grounds has attempted to achieve its end of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                               Page 9 of 10</span>
 cancellation indirectly through the First Respondent. All the above
would adumbrate that both the Authorities have acted arbitrarily.
The impugned order was an outcome of the non-application of mind
and the mechanical approach of the First Respondent. The Second
Respondent as a statutory authority, despite service of Notice a
number of times has not cared to appear. The Second Respondent
cannot have any reason for non-appearance. It is a statutory Body
which is expected to strictly apply and follow law. Having issued
directions to the First Respondent arbitrarily to cause consent to
operate order in abeyance, that too after number of months of show
cause notice, the nonappearance of the second Respondent before
the Tribunal would show its reluctance, carelessness and the
recalcitrant attitude of the officials of the Second Respondent which
has got to be viewed seriously.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      For all the reasons stated above the impugned directions of the
First Respondent are to be set aside as legally unsustainable and
accordingly they are set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_23">    In the result, appeal is allowed along the direction to
Respondents to pay a cost of Rs. 10,000/- each to the Appellant
towards the costs of this Appeal.</p><pre id="pre_2">
