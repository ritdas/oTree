            of the brick-kiln, being run by respondent No.6, as according

            to him, the Emission Consent Order, granted to him by the

            Board for running the brick-kiln, is in conflict with the said

            statutory notification, dated 26.03.2009, inasmuch as there

            is a government school located within the radius of 200

            meters from the said brick-kiln.

<p id="p_18">                        4. Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

            Board, wherein there is no denial of the fact that the location

            of the said school is within 200 meters from the said brick-

            kiln, which is said to be 186 meters away from the brick-kiln

            run by the respondent No.6.

            Assistant Environmental Engineer, Bihar State Pollution

            Control Board, Bihar, Patna, are personally present and have

            filed an affidavit, bringing on record an order, passed under

            the    signature      of    the    Chairman   of   the   Board,   dated

            29.09.2015, whereby the Emission Consent Order, granted

            earlier to respondent No.6, has been cancelled, after giving

            him opportunity of hearing, on the ground that grant of

            Emission Consent Order was contrary to the said statutory

            notification, dated 26.03.2009.           With the passing of the

            order, dated 29.09.2015, in our opinion, grievance of the

            petitioner in the present PIL, stands substantially redressed.

</p><p id="p_20">                        6. Learned counsel, appearing on behalf of the

            respondent        No.6,     has,     however,   submitted   that   the

            petitioner was earlier granted Emission Consent Order, after

            due verification, and the present writ application has been

            filed by the petitioner out of vengeance, because of the

            dispute between respondent No.6 and the petitioner at local

            level.    He has also submitted that when the petitioner had

            earlier established brick-kiln over the land, bearing Khata

            No.493, Survey Plot Nos.931 and 934 (Thana No.573) and

            Khata No.306, Survey Plot No.933, Tauzi No.5974, the said

            school was located beyond 200 meters from the said plot.

            Subsequently, certain additional constructions were made for

            the school, which lessened the distance from brick-kiln to the

            school.     It is, however, not his contention that respondent

            No.6 ever raised any objection over construction of school

            building, within 200 meters from the said brick-kiln.

</p><p id="p_21">                        7. We do not find much substance in submission

            made on behalf of the respondent No.6, for the purpose of

            present Public Interest Litigation, keeping in view that he has

            statutory remedy of preferring an appeal against the order

            passed by the Board, dated 29.09.2015.               In view of the

            facts, aforementioned, and the fact that the petitioner's

            grievance has substantially been redressed, we do not intend

            to proceed any further in the present matter.

                     29.09.2015, brought on record by way of Annexure-F to the
