     This Petition coming on for admission this day,
the Court made the following:-

                      ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard Sri Sajan Poovayya, the learned Senior

Advocate, appearing on behalf of Sri Anind Thomas

learned counsel for the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">2.   The learned counsel for the respondent has

failed to appear. The matter has been adjourned on

three occasions expecting his appearance as the facts

and circumstances, are such that the petition could

be disposed of on merits even at this stage.

</p><p id="p_3">3.   Therefore, even in the absence of counsel for

the respondent, the petition is considered for final

disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.   The petitioner is said to be an U S National. It is

alleged by the complainant that the petitioner is the

Manager of M/s. Federal Mogul Goetze India Limited.

The allegation that the Company owns and operates a

Factory situated at Yelahanka, Bengaluru, is an

incorrect statement. The petitioner does not even
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3</span>


reside in India and he is not an employee of the

company concerned, but he is a permanent resident

of the United States of America, where he is gainfully

employed and specializes in Environmental Health

and Safety Practices in the United States of America.

It is on the other hand, stated that the present

management of the company had entered into a

share     purchase   agreement   with   the   erstwhile

shareholders of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.      The complaint is by the respondent - Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board. It is alleged by the

complainant, which is a statutory body, that accused

No.1, namely, M/s. Federal Mogul Goetze India

Limited is a company within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_2">Section

47</a> of The Water Act and has established two

industrial units,    M/s. Federal Mogul Goetze India

Ltd., and M/s. Federal Mogul TPR India Ltd., located

adjacent to each other in the same premises at

Yelahanka Bangalore Urban District and are engaged

in the manufacture of Piston Rings of capacity of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>


19,00,000 per month Pistons of capacity 3,00,000

per month and Pistons pins of capacity of 2,40,000

per month and Steel Piston Rings of capacity

42,00,000      per    month,         respectively.    The

manufacturing     process       involves   casting,   heat

treatment, trimming, binding, turning, machining

degreasing,    phosphating,      Chrome     plating   and

packing etc.

</p><p id="p_6">6.   Accused No.2      namely one Rajesh Sinha is

working as the Director (operations) in the Industry of

the accused No.1 and accused No.3 is working as the

Manager in the Industry of accused No.1. Accused

No.2 viz., Rajesh Sinha, Director (Operations) &amp;

Manager of M/s. Federal Mogul Goetze India Ltd.,

was working in that capacity and accused No.3, who

is the petitioner herein was visiting as a consultant.

However, it is alleged in the complaint that he was

the Manager of the Industry, which is incorrect. The

petitioner as well as accused No.2 are in the

management and in charge of the Company and in

the conduct of the business are sought to be accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            5</span>


of causing water pollution. In view of the complaint,

samples of sewage were drawn and analyzed in the

laboratory and it is said to have tested positive

regarding    sewage   affluent   and   therefore,   these

proceedings proceeded against the petitioner before

the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7. It is in this background, that the petitioner is

before this Court to emphasize that he is not the

Manager of the Company and in this regard, he has

produced Form No.2 in terms of Rules 4(1), 7(2) and

12 of the Factories Rules, which is the application for

registration and grant of license and         notice of

occupation specified under <a href="/doc/1276470/" id="a_3">Sections 6</a> and <a href="/doc/1757882/" id="a_4">7</a> of the

Factories Act, which would clearly disclose that

accused No.2 is indeed the Manager of the factory

and that petitioner does not figure in the said

application as the Manager. It is based on the said

application that consent has been obtained for

commencement of manufacture and therefore, on the

basis of the same the mere presence of the petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            6</span>


at the premises on the date, when an inspection was

carried out and the petitioner being named as the

manager, is an abuse           of process of law and

proceedings are hanging fire against the petitioner,

though he is permitted to return to his country. The

present petition is filed claiming that the proceedings

be quashed as he has no truck with the Company

and he was merely visiting as a consultant and has

no further business with the respondent Company.

The claim of the petitioner is not disputed by the

respondent,    who   has failed    to appear   through

counsel.    Though the counsel for the respondent has

been named, none has appeared and objected to the

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    Accepting the contention of the petitioner that

he is a Foreign National and has nothing to do with

accused No.1 or accused No.2, the present petition is

summarily allowed.      Proceedings pending against

the petitioner in CC No.8343/13 on the file of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           7</span>


Chief   Metropolitan   Magistrate   Bangalore   stands

quashed.
