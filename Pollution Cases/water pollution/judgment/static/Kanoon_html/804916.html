<p id="p_1">            Challenge in the present petition is to the order dated 11.5.2007

(Annexure P.21) passed under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short `the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>').

</p><p id="p_2">            The petitioner is engaged in manufacturing of life saving bulk

drugs and drug intermediates at various locations, including one at Bhai

Mohan Singh Nagar, Toansa, District Nawanshahr. The petitioner was
 CWP No. 7668 of 2007                                (2)

established in India in the year 1984-85 as a public limited Company to

manufacture pharmaceuticals i.e. antibiotic and intermediates at its newly

acquired premises at Bhai Mohan Singh Nagar, Village Toansa, District

Nawanshahr (Punjab). The petitioner took over from "Max" in the year

2001, its said life-saving bulk drugs manufacturing facility. It was on

17.8.2005, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, granted

environment clearance to the petitioner for expansion of its bulk drug unit

on the basis of the petitioner's Environment Impact Assessment Report. The

said clearance recommended, inter-alia, that the effluent should be

segregated into high and low TDS streams. The low TDS effluent after

primary and secondary treatment and meeting the norms shall be used for

green belt development. The high TDS effluent shall be evaporated in

Multiple Effect Evaporator. The residues from the Multiple Effect

Evaporator shall be incinerated; the treated effluent in the ETP shall be

treated in Reverse Osmosis (RO) Plant; permeate from the RO plant shall be

recycled and that the domestic effluent shall be treated in septic tanks. Later

on 16.1.2007 (Annexure P.11), the petitioner was granted clearance by the

Ministry of Environment and Forests, for further expansion of its

manufacturing capacity after the petitioner has communicated that it shall

change its manufacturing route from synthetic to enzymatic technology.

The petitioner was advised, inter-alia, to take following steps:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   ➢     The Company shall install solvent recovery system

                       by installation of high efficiency condensers and traces

                      the form of solvent vapours emitted from purification

                      tanks during purification process as far as possible.

                      The recovered solvent shall either be reused in the

                      manufacturing process or spent scrubber solution is

                      sent to the ETP for treatment. Use of toxic solvents

                      like Methylene Chloride (M.C.) etc. shall be minimum

                      and Benzene should be replaced with alternate

                      solvents. All venting equipment shall have vapour

                      recovery system.

                      provided as per PPCB guidelines. ETP sludge shall be

                      used as bio-fertilizer after drying."</blockquote><p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">            The petitioner was issued a show cause notice under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_4">Section 33</a>

of the Water Act on 18.1.2007 by the Board for the reason that the

petitioner has failed to install adequate and appropriate effluent treatment
 CWP No. 7668 of 2007                                (4)

plant to contain the pollutants in its trade effluent within the standards

prescribed by the Board. After considering the objections filed, an order

was passed by the Board on 11.5.2007 (Annexure P.21), the order

impugned in the present writ petition, whereby the closure of the industry

was ordered till the industry takes the following steps:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                   "1.   Provides arrangement of segregation of different
                   waste streams.

</p><p id="p_6">            The other facts and the developments from time to time need

not be given as the same are not necessary in view of the affidavit filed by

the Chairman of the Board dated 14.1.2009. The petitioner has earlier filed

an additional affidavit dated 12.1.2009 to the effect that the petitioner has

substantially complied with the measures of emptying out Solar Evaporation

Ponds (for short `SEP') and has achieved total compliance with respect to

the directions of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (for short `the Board').
</p><p id="p_7"> CWP No. 7668 of 2007                               (5)

The petitioner is also addressing the common issue of ground water

contamination in the area through the Programme Management and

Monitoring Group constituted under the aegis of the Board. It has been

pointed out in the said affidavit that the petitioner has phased out the use of

SEPs for discharge of effluent in the month of June, 2008, pursuant to the

installation and commissioning of additional equipment, namely, Multi

Effective Evaporator and a drier. Out of five SEPs, the petitioner has

emptied out three SEPs and the sludge at the these three SEPs has also been

scrapped out and transported to the common Treatment Storage and

Disposal Facility (for short `TSDF') at Nimbua, District Mohali. The work

of emptying out the fourth SEP is near completion and the work of scraping

the sludge from the bottom of this SEP shall also commence in January,

2009, whereas the work of emptying out the last SEP shall commence and

would be achieved by the April, 2009. The petitioner has also placed an

order with Tetra Tech India Limited for providing consultancy for

recapping of the SEPs and for containment of contamination below the

SEPs. It is averred that no hazardous waste is lying, stored or otherwise at

the petitioner-industry. All such waste has already been transported for

disposal and treatment to the TSDF at Nimbua. The Multi Effective

Evaporation residue generated presently at the petitioner's facility is

simultaneously transported to the TSDF Nimbua and the sludge scrapped

from the SEPs is also transported regularly to the TSDF, Nimbua. The

petitioner has also sought consent to operate under the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> as the petitioner has

achieved total compliance of the order dated 29.11.2007 passed by the

Appellate Authority as well.
</p><p id="p_8"> CWP No. 7668 of 2007                                (6)

            The petitioner has also filed an affidavit dated 15.1.2009 of its

Site Manager undertaking to dismantle all the SEPs by April 15, 2009. It

has also been approved by the Board vide the Minutes of the PMMG

(Programme Monitoring and Management Group) dated 24.12.2008. In

view of the said minutes and the undertaking given by the petitioner, we

grant time to the petitioner to dismantle all the SEPs on or before April 15,

2009.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            Shri D.S. Patwalia, learned counsel appearing for the Board has

pointed out that the effluent discharged by the petitioner has high COD

waste, which is required to be treated by RO plant only. On the other hand,

it is the stand of the petitioner that such RO plant was a condition, while

granting permission to the petitioner to expand its manufacturing capacity

on 17.8.2005 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. However, there

was no such condition when the petitioner was granted permission to

further expand its capacity on 16.1.2007. It is contended that earlier the

industry was using synthetic process, but now the manufacturing process

has been shifted to enzymatic technology. With the change of technology

and installation of ETP, there is no necessity of installation of RO plant.

The petitioner has also undertaken in the affidavit that the treated water

discharged from its ETP shall continue to meet the prescribed norms and

standards consistently. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also stated

that the synthetic manufacturing route shall be stopped in all the plants of

the petitioner by the end of January, 2009 and on account of use of

enzymatic technology and ETP erected by the petitioner, the COD

discharge shall be within the permissible limits.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            The Ministry of Environment and Forests while considering the
 CWP No. 7668 of 2007                              (7)

proposal of the petitioner to expand its bulk drugs Unit, has not imposed

any condition of RO plant in the said permission dated 16.1.2007. It is also

admitted in the affidavit dated 14.1.2009 filed by the Board that the

petitioner is in the process of complete shifting of manufacturing route from

synthetic to enzymatic for manufacturing of Ampi/Amoxicillin.

</p><p id="p_11">            In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the petitioner

has complied with the conditions imposed in the order impugned in the

present writ petition. The said order dated 11.5.2007 (Annexure P.21)

directing the closure of the petitioner Unit no longer survives and is, thus,

set aside. However, the setting aside of the said order will not absolve the

petitioner of keeping the COD waste within the permissible limits and it

shall be open to the Board to test the effluent discharged by the petitioner

after complete cessation of synthetic manufacturing route so as to ensure

that the effluent discharged by the petitioner does not violate any statutory

provisions. It shall be open to the Board at that stage to arrive at an

independent opinion in respect of requirement of RO Plant.

</p><p id="p_12">            Annexure P.48 (collectively) are the proceedings in respect of

re-charge of ground water in village Toansa, District Nawanshahr. On

9.1.2008, respondents No. 6 and 7 and the petitioner were directed by this

Court to sit together under the Chairmanship of the Chairman of the Board

to sort out the problem of shifting of hazardous waste/hazardous chemicals

so as to improve the quality of ground water and to take effective steps to

solve   the position resulting into the ground water to be polluted.      In

pursuance of said directions, the representative of respondent No.6 has

undertaken to remove 200 drums lying in the premises of the Company to

TSDF. However, the same were not removed. But now an affidavit dated
 CWP No. 7668 of 2007                                (8)

16.1.2009 of Bhai Manjit Singh, Chairman cum Managing Director, M/s

Montari Industries Limited, has been filed undertaking to remove 200

drums to TSDF within three months' time. In view of the said undertaking,

respondent No. 6 - M/s Montari Industries Limited, is granted three months'

time i.e. on or before April 15, 2009, to remove the said drums to TSDF.

It shall be open to the Board to take such other steps against respondents

No. 6 and 7, for discharging pollutants, if any, and for contamination of the

ground water level or its re-charge.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                     It also came to the notice of this Court during the course

of hearing that TSDF is not fully functional as the incineration facility is

yet to be made operational. The hazardous waste is being stored at TSDF

at Nimbua, waiting incineration plant to be operational. Therefore, we

deem it appropriate to direct the Chairman of the Board to ensure that

incineration facility is made operational at the earliest so that hazardous

waste does not remain stored in the said premises for a long time.

</p><p id="p_14">               With the said direction and liberty, the writ petition stands

disposed of.
