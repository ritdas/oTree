ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	present Criminal Revision Application, under <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_1">section 401</a> of the Code
	of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is directed against the judgment and
	order dated 16.01.1998 passed by the learned  Judicial Magistrate,
	First Class, Palitana,  in Criminal  Case No. 1315 of 1992, whereby
	the learned Magistrate was pleased to discharge all the respondents
	  accused from the charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The
	brief facts of the prosecution case is that the respondent No. 1 is
	the company, opponent No.2 &amp; 3 respectively are the Chairman and
	Managing Director  of the said company and respondents No.4 to 9 are
	the Directors and respondent No.10 is the Production Manager of the
	said company. It is alleged that the respondent No.1 company is
	manufacturing industrial alcohol. It is also alleged that the
	appellant Board by its consent order dated 21.2.1986 and 22.7.1991
	had laid down conditions for the discharge of effluent and the
	respondents were required to follow the conditions. It is alleged
	that on 26.02.1992 the Officers of the Board visited the respondent
	No.1   company and in presence of respodnent No.10   Production
	Manager, as per the provisions of the Act, collected the two samples
	of water being discharged, viz. One from the effluent coming out of
	the oxidation ditch and the other from the effluent coming out of
	the dilution tank, and sent the same for analysis. On analysis the
	Analyst found that the said samples were not conforming to the
	standards laid down by the Board. Therefore, after obtaining
	sanction complaint has been filed against the respondents  
	accused. Thereafter, the trial issued summons to the respondents  
	accused. After the evidence of the prosecution was recorded under
	<a href="/doc/1830754/" id="a_2">Section 244</a> Cr.P.C. The trial Court heard both the sides for framing
	of the charge against the accused and after hearing the parties the
	learned Magistrate has discharged all the accused from the offences
	alleged against them vide order dated 16.01.1998. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.	It
	was contended by learned Advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the appellant
	that  the judgment and order of the learned Magistrate is not
	proper, legal and it is erroneous. He has also contended that the
	opponents were discharging the polluted water of their company into
	the open field in contrvention of the directives of the Board and
	that this effluent was affecting the soil adversely and was
	injurious to the cattle. He also contended that at the stage of
	framing of the charge the learned Magistrate was required to
	consider whether there was any prima facie case and whether the
	evidence adduced so far was sufficient to frame charge against the
	accused. He has contended that the Board Officers have followed the
	rules prescribed by law and the Officer of the Board have also
	followed the procedure of taking the sample. The sample was seized
	and sealed properly. Yet, the learned Magistrate has not considered
	the evidence of prosecution. Therefore, the order impugned in this
	appeal passed by the learned Magistrate requires to be quashed and
	set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Learned
	Advocate, appearing for the respondents   original accused,  has
	supported the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the trial
	Court and contended that the trial Court has rightly acquitted the
	respondents   accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">I
	have gone through the order passed by the trial court. I have also
	perused the oral as well as documentary evidence led by the trial
	court and also considered the submissions made by learned Advocate
	for the appellant. The trial court while considering the oral as
	well as documentary evidence has clearly observed that there is
	contradictory version in the evidence of witnesses. The trial Court
	has also found that the Board Officer has not followed the proper
	procedure while sending the sample to the Board Analyst. The trial
	Court has also observed that samples were taken on 26.2.1992 while
	the same were received by the Board Analyst on 3.3.1992 and,
	therefore, there is breach of provisions of the Rules. The trial
	Court has also found that the Board has committed the breach of
	<a href="/doc/1322063/" id="a_3">Section 21(3)(d)</a> and <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_4">27</a> of the Water Pollution Act and, therefore,
	prima facie the case is not proved against the accused  
	respondents. The trial Court has also considered the various
	decisions of this Court as well as of the Hon'ble Apex Court and
	discharged the accused from the offences alleged them. Even in the
	present appeal, nothing is produced or pointed out to rebut the
	conclusion of the trial Court. Thus, from the evidence itself it is
	established that the prosecution has not proved its case beyond
	reasonable doubt. Looking to the above observation and findings of
	the trial Court, I am of the opinion that the trial Court has not
	committed any error or illegality while passing the order of
	discharge.
</p>
<p id="p_6">At
	the out-set it is required to be noted that the principles which
	would govern and regulate the hearing of appeal by this Court
	against an order passed by the trial Court have been very succinctly
	explained by the Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of decisions. Thus,
	the powers which this Court may exercise against an order of
	acquittal are well settled. Thus, in case the appellate Court agrees
	with the reasons and the findings given by the lower Court, then the
	discussion of evidence is not necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_7">I
	have gone through the Judgment and order passed by the trial Court
	and also perused the oral as well as documentary evidence produced
	before me and also considered the submissions made by the learned
	Advocate for the applicant. On going through the Judgment and order
	passed by the trial Court and the papers placed before me, I am of
	the opinion that the trial Court has not committed any error while
	discharging the respondents   accused from the alleged offences. I
	find that the findings recorded by the trial Court are absolutely
	just and proper and in recording the said findings no illegality or
	infirmity has been committed by it. The learned Judge has rightly
	come to the conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to
	prove the case against the respondent   accused.
</p>
<p id="p_8">I
	am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
	conclusion and the resultant order of discharge recorded by the
	Court below and hence find no reason to interfere with the same.
	Hence, the Revision Application is hereby dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">In
	view of above the Revision Application is dismissed. The Judgment
	and order dated 16.1.1998 passed by the learned Magistrate in
	Criminal Case No.1315 of 1992, discharging the respondents  
	accused from the offences alleged against them, is hereby confirmed.
	Rule is discharged. Bail bond, if any, shall stands cancelled.
