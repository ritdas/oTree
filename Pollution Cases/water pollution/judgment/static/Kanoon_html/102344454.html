7   21-10-2014                  The present litigation is the result of conflict in

                    priorities. The appellant, before us, questions not only the

                    priorities of the Government in cancelling an allotment of

                    land in larger public interest, but also whether the

                    procedure, prescribed by law, in this behalf, permits such

                    a cancellation of allotment, which, according to the

                    appellant, is arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational and not

                    sustainable        in     law?    Thus,    when,    and   under      what

                    circumstances, can public interest supervene the tangible

                    rights of an individual forms one of the core issues of the

                    controversy in this appeal? Equally important are the

                    questions as to whether the law, applicable to the case at

                    hand, permits the impugned cancellation of allotment and,

                    above all, whether <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of India

                    permits a legislation, which does not take care of the

                    provisions, embodied in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_2">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of

                    India, while depriving a person of his „property‟?

                    Authority (hereinafter referred to as "the Authority"),

                    which is a statutory body created under the Bihar

                    Industrial Area Development Authority Act, 1974 (in short,

                    "BIADA Act"), inviting participation in auction of plots in

                    the Patliputra Industrial Area, the appellant herein, a

              Private Limited Company, registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies

              Act</a>, 1956, had surfaced as the highest bidder of Plot No.C-

              34, appellant‟s bid amount being Rs.2,32,20,000/-. The

              appellant was accordingly allotted Plot No. C-34, though

              the appellant had to pay total sum of Rs.3,38,98,000/-,

              when the final measurement of the said plot of land, at the

              time of delivery of possession, turned out to be 2.55 acres.

              The order, dated 19.06.2007, issued by the Authority,

              contained the terms and conditions of the allotment and

              the ground on which the allotment could be cancelled. On

              allotment of the land, the appellant started raising

              construction for developing a multiplex-cum-mall on the

              said plot.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                          3. The appellant was also asked by letter, dated

              09.01.2008, to construct staff quarters, at its own cost,

              covering an area of around 7,000 square feet involving a

              total cost of Rs.45 lacs for New Government Polytechnic

              Institute, Patna, situated adjacent to the land, which

              stood allotted to the appellant, where the appellant had

              been raising construction for the purpose of a multiplex-

              cum-mall.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                          4. On allotment of the land, the appellant made

              huge investment by way of construction of boundary

              walls, excavation of land, preparation of site plan, etc.,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                   4</span>




              the total investment being, according to the appellant,

              close to a sum of Rs.5 crore.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                          5. However, while the construction was in

              progress, the appellant was served with a letter, dated

              29.03.2008, issued by the Authority restraining the

              appellant from making any further construction till a

              decision was taken with regard to the recalling of the

              order of allotment of Plot No. C-34.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                          6. The State Government, referring to the

              opinion of the then Advocate General, Bihar, directed, on

              16.09.2008, the Authority to act in accordance with the

              opinion of the Advocate General, with regard to the

              cancellation of the allotment of the said land in favour of

              the appellant, the refund of the amount, which the

              appellant had paid to the Authority, and negotiation with

              the appellant on the rate of interest to be paid.

</p><p id="p_13">                          7. On 10.11.2008, the appellant was asked to

              show cause as to why the allotment of the industrial plot

              be not cancelled and possession thereof be not resumed

              in the larger public interest inasmuch as the Indian

              Institute of Technology (commonly known as "IIT"),

              Patna,      stood      temporarily        established   on   the   land

              adjacent to the plot of land, which had been allotted to

              the appellant, but was required to be used as a

              playground by the IIT, Patna.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                          8. The appellant filed, on 12.03.2009, a reply to

              the said notice of show cause stating therein, inter alia,

              that BIADA Act does not empower the Authority to cancel

              and resume possession of the land, which stood allotted

              to the appellant, inasmuch as there was, according to

              the appellant, no public interest involved in restraining

              the appellant from coming up with the said project in an

              industrial area demarcated for the said purpose and that

              setting up of a multiplex-cum-mall is an industrial

              activity as defined under the Industrial Incentive Policy,

              2006, and there could be no restraint order to the setting

              up of an industry in an industrial area, which subserves

              public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                          9. Having given notice to the appellant that the

              plot of land, which stood allotted to the appellant, was

              required       by     the    State        Government       for    providing

              additional       space      to   IIT,     Patna,    for   its    use   as   a

              playground, the IIT having been temporarily established

              adjacent to the plot allotted to the appellant and which

              was expected to shift, in five to seven years, to its new

              place,     where construction              of the    IIT campus was

              underway, and notwithstanding the objection, which had

              been raised by the appellant to the proposed cancellation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                      6</span>




              of allotment and resumption of possession of the land by

              the Authority, an order was passed, on 04.04.2009, by

              the Authority cancelling the said allotment and refunding

              a sum of Rs.3,38,98,000/- as cost of the land along with

              interest at the rate of 5 per cent, which the appellant

              received under protest. While so awarding interest,

              learned Advocate General‟s advice was not acted upon

              that the rate of interest should be in accordance with the

              prime lending rate.

<p id="p_16">                          10. Aggrieved by the order, dated 04.04.2009,

              aforementioned, the appellant filed a writ petition under

              <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, which gave rise

              to C.W.J.C. No.4532 of 2009.

              status quo as on the date of making of the impugned

              order, dated 10.04.2009, in respect of Plot No.C-34.

              amicable settlement of the dispute, a meeting, at the

              instance of the learned single Judge, was convened, on

              05.09.2011, under the Chairmanship of the Principal

              Secretary, Industries Department; but the Authority

              refused to reconsider even enhancement of the amount

              of compensation paid to the appellant.

              petition has been, eventually, dismissed on the ground

              that there was no mala fide or extraneous consideration

              in making the order, dated 04.04.2009, aforementioned

              cancelling the allotment of Plot No.C-34 and that the

              decision to cancel the allotment of the plot, in question,

              was for compelling reasons arising out of larger public

              good inasmuch as setting up of an IIT, at Patna, was not

              in the horizon, when the decision to auction the land, in

              question, and allotment thereof to the appellant had

              been reached and, thus, the respondents were forced to

              resort to cancellation of the allotment of the said plot of

              land made in favour of the appellant and resumption of

              possession thereof in order to enable the IIT, Patna,

              which had been running on a makeshift basis from

              temporary campus, to use Plot No.C-34 as a playground.

              upholding the power exercised by the Authority on the

              ground of larger public interest inasmuch as the learned

              single Judge took the view that the cancellation of the

              order of allotment, made in favour of appellant, was

              permissible and well within the ambit of the BIADA Act.

              petitioner is, now, in appeal, before us.

</p><p id="p_23">                          16. We have heard Mr. Jitendra Singh, learned

              the Authority. We have also heard Mr. Dhananjay Kumar,

              learned Assistant Counsel to Government Pleader No.6,

              appearing for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_24">              SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT:

</p><p id="p_25">                          17. Presenting the case on behalf of the

              appellant, Mr. Jitendra Singh, learned Senior Counsel,

              submits that the order of cancellation of allotment of the

              plot is, in the present case, without any sanction of law

              inasmuch as the order of cancellation, passed by the

              Authority, is de hors the provisions of the BIADA Act as

              well as the terms and conditions of the order of

              allotment.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                          18. It is abundantly clear, submits Mr. Singh,

              that the order of cancellation was made at the diktat of

              the State, though no such power is vested in the State

              Government inasmuch as Section 9 of the BIADA Act

              envisages        restoration       of     possession   only   of   such

              plot/shed to the State Government, which is at the

              disposal of the Authority and not when the plot of

              land/shed stands already allotted to an entrepreneur.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                9</span>




              Upon allotment, the cancellation of allotment, adds Mr.

              Singh, is permissible only as a punitive measure, when

              the allottee fails to take necessary effective steps to

              establish his industry within the period specified.

</p><p id="p_27">                          19. In the case at hand, the appellant, points

              out Mr. Singh, had, admittedly, taken effective steps to

              establish the industry and, more particularly, when it is

              not the case of the respondents that no effective steps

              had been taken by the appellant to establish the industry

              and/or that the impugned order of cancellation of

              allotment was punitive. This apart, submits Mr. Singh,

              even the respondents admit that the cancellation of the

              allotment was not punitive. Thus, the cancellation of

              allotment was, admittedly, not for any default on the

              part of the appellant; so contends Mr. Singh.

</p><p id="p_28">                          20. Cancellation of the allotment, in a case of

              present        nature,      contends      Mr.   Singh,   is   wholly

              impermissible, arbitrary, unreasonable and untenable in

              law, when the Authority concedes that the cancellation of

              the allotment, in the present case, was not as a penal

              measure but on the ground of supervening public

              interest. No cancellation of allotment, according to Mr.

              Singh, is sustainable within the scheme of the BIADA Act

              on the ground of greater public interest or supervening
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                             10</span>




              public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                          21. A reading of the relevant provisions of the

              BIADA Act would reveal, submits Mr. Singh, that BIADA

              Act does not provide for cancellation of an allotted plot of

              land for the purpose of restoration of possession thereof

              to the State Government nor does the BIADA Act vest in

              the Authority the power to acquire the allotted land by

              taking recourse to the provisions of cancellation so as to

<p id="p_30">                          22.       Assailing       the   impugned   order   of

              cancellation, Mr. Singh submits that the law is well

              settled that the State or its Executive Officers cannot

              interfere with the right of the citizens unless they can

              point out to some specific provisions of law authorizing

              the act of the State or its Executive Officers, which

              comes to be challenged. Reference, in support of these

              submissions, has been made by Mr. Singh to the case of

              to as "1981 Rules") vis-à-vis <a href="/doc/1549225/" id="a_7">Section 9(3)</a>, Mr. Singh

              submits that Section 6(2) of the BIADA Act is not a

              general power of cancellation and when the provisions,

              embodied in Section 6(2) of the BIADA Act, are read with

              <a href="/doc/1483642/" id="a_8">Section 6</a>(2- a), <a href="/doc/1483642/" id="a_9">Section 6</a>(2-b) and Rule 6 (ii) of 1981

              Rules, it becomes clear that the ground of exercise of

              power of cancellation of allotment or lease is subject to

              the conditions mentioned in <a href="/doc/1483642/" id="a_10">Section 6</a>(2-a) of the BIADA

              Act, when an allottee fails to take necessary effective

              lease in larger public interest is, therefore, contends Mr.

              Singh,      not envisaged           by the BIADA Act   and   the

              the BIADA Act by the learned single Judge upholding

              thereby the impugned order of cancellation amounts to

              or use in accordance with the provisions of the BIADA

              Act and not such a plot of land, which has already been

              allotted, in exercise of power of allotment conferred on

              the Authority, for the purpose of development or use in

</p><p id="p_34">                          26. With regard to the above, Mr. Singh points

              out that a Court cannot read anything into statutory

              provisions,        when       the         provisions   are   plain   and

              unambiguous. Legislative causus omissus cannot be

              supplied by judicial interpretative process and what is

              permissible is only to iron out the creases. References

              have been made, in this regard, by Mr. Singh to the

              cases of Padma Sundara Rao (DEAD) and Others v.

              State of T.N. and Others, reported in (2002) 3 SCC

</p><p id="p_35">                          27. It is the submission of Mr. Singh that in

              order to uphold the interpretation of the provisions of the

              BIADA Act by the learned single Judge, one is required to

              add to Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act, the expression,

              such as, "after cancellation of such allotment and

              resuming possession", which would amount to reading
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                         13</span>




              words into the Statute, which is not permissible and

              would amount to doing violence to the provisions of the

              BIADA Act and run contrary to the very purpose with

              which the legislation has been made.
</p>
<p id="p_36">                          28. Thus, the only possible interpretation, which

              can be attributed to Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act is,

              according to Mr. Singh, that only such plot of land can be

              restored to the State Government by the Authority,

              which is at the disposal of the Authority and which has

              not been allotted for any industrial use by the Authority.

              read with Rule 6(ii) of 1981 Rules, which contains the

              ground on which the allotment of the land can be

              cancelled by the Authority under Section 6(2) of BIADA

              Act and it cannot be interpreted to an extent as

              interpreted by the learned single Judge enabling the

              Authority to cancel allotment without satisfying the

              of India, Mr. Singh submits that <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_23">Article 300A</a> of the

              Constitution of India proclaims that no person can be

              deprived of his property save by authority of law,

              meaning thereby that a person cannot be deprived of his

              property merely by an executive fiat, without any specific

              legal authority or without the support of law made by a

              competent legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_40">                          31. The expression „property‟, appearing in

              <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_24">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of India, is, contends Mr.

              Singh, not confined to land alone; rather, the expression

              „property‟ includes intangible like copyright and other

              property        and      embraces         every   possible   interest

              recognized by law.

<p id="p_41">                          32. The allotment order, which contains the

              terms and conditions of the allotment, is, thus, according

              to Mr. Singh, a property within the meaning of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_25">Article

              300A</a> of the Constitution of India. Reliance, in support of

              this proposition, is sought to be derived by Mr. Singh

              from the decisions in <a href="/doc/1147949/" id="a_26">M. M. Pathak v. Union of India</a>

</p><p id="p_43">                          33. Mr. Singh, learned Senior Counsel, also

              points out that the BIADA Act is a legislation relatable to

              Entry 24 of List II (Industries subject to the provisions of

              Entry 7 and 52 of List I) and is not a legislation under

              Entry 42 of List III (Acquisition and Requisition of

              Property). Hence, words, such as, „cancellation and

              resumption of possession of land for its restoration to the

              State Government‟ cannot but be regarded as indirect

              acquisition or requisition, which is wholly alien to the

              object and scheme of the BIADA Act.
</p>
<p id="p_44">                          34. It is also of some significance to note, points

              out Mr. Singh, that the BIADA Act is completely silent as

              to what would or would not be the norms and procedure

              for compensation, which is inherent in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_29">Article 300A</a> of the

              Constitution of India, if an allottee is deprived of its

              „property‟ and the interpretation, given to the BIADA Act

              by the learned single Judge, would, if accepted, render

              the BIADA Act invalid and ultra vires the Constitution

              inasmuch as it would amount to permitting deprivation of

              property without making any payment of compensation

              for the „property‟ acquired or sought to be acquired. It is

              further submitted by Mr. Singh that the right to claim

              compensation is inbuilt in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_30">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution

              of India. A reference, in this regard, is made to the case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                16</span>

<p id="p_45">                          35. It is the contention of the respondents,

              points out Mr. Singh, that when the power is vested in

              the Authority to allot a plot of land, this power of

              allotment, under <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_31">Section 21</a> of the General Clauses Act,

              1897, includes the Authority‟s power to cancel such

              allotment. This contention, submits Mr. Singh, is wholly

              incorrect inasmuch as <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_32">Section 21</a> of the General Clauses

              Act, 1897, has no application to the case at hand, when

              the decision is quasi judicial.
</p>
<p id="p_46">                          36. Explaining his above contention, Mr. Singh

              submits that <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_33">Section 21</a> of the General Clauses Act,

              1897, does not come into play, when an authority is

              required to exercise quasi judicial power. In this regard,

              it needs to be borne in mind, points out Mr. Singh, that

              the power of punitive cancellation of allotment is a quasi

              judicial     power      and,     hence,   this   power   cannot   be

              exercised by the Authority by taking recourse to <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_34">Section

              21</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897.
</p>
<p id="p_47">                          37. The expression „order‟, employed in <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_35">Section

              21</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897, shows, submits Mr.

              Singh, that such an order must be in the nature of

              notification, rules, bye-laws, etc., whereas the impugned

              order is neither a legislative nor an executive order, but

              a quasi judicial order. Reference may be made, in this

              regard, submits Mr. Singh, to the cases of <a href="/doc/1158072/" id="a_36">Indian

              National Congress (I) v. Institute of Social Welfare

              and Others</a>, reported in (2002) 5 SCC 685, and K.P.

              Khetan v. Union of India (AIR 1957 SC 676).

</p><p id="p_48">                            38. Mr. Singh submits that the impugned order

              of cancellation is projected to have been passed after

              considering the appellant‟s reply to the notice of show

              cause issued to the appellant. This contention of the

              Authority, submits Mr. Singh, is ex facie sham and

              stands vitiated, when the decision with regard to

              cancellation had already been taken by the State

              Government on the basis of the opinion of the learned

              Advocate General of the State and this position is not in

              dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_49">                            39. in fact, Annexure-D clearly shows, points

              out Mr. Singh, that the decision for cancellation of the

              allotment of the plot of land was based on the opinion of

              the learned Advocate General and the State‟s direction to

              the Authority was to act in accordance with the opinion

              of the learned Advocate General, where the opinion of

              the learned Advocate General has incorrectly said that it

              was in larger public interest to cancel the allotment and

              resume possession after issuing show cause notice.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                     18</span>
</p><p id="p_50">                            40. Mr. Singh submits that when the Authority

              had already been directed to act on the said opinion,

              issuance of notice to show cause was a mere formality

              and had no meaning in the context of facts of the

              present       case.      Such       a      pre-determined     order    of

              cancellation, on the basis of the decision already taken,

              is, emphasizes Mr. Singh, wholly illegal and may not be

              sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_51">                            41.     The     impugned        order    of   cancellation,

              submits Mr. Singh, raised a false bogey of larger public

              interest inasmuch as the decision has been taken on the

              whims of the Law Officers of the Department concerned

              without there being any decision of the Government on

              record inasmuch as a decision of a Government has to be

              expressed in terms of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_37">Article 166</a> of the Constitution of

              India and no Government decision is in existence on

              record to justify the bogey of public interest and what

              has been revealed to the Court is that a team,

              comprising of learned Advocate General, Commissioner,

              Industries       Development              Department    and    Managing

              Director of the Authority, was satisfied, on their visit to

              the site, that it should not be permitted to be developed

              as a commercial establishment and that IIT would

              require the campus for many of its activities, like

              question, has remained unutilized till date and IIT would

              be shifted to the new campus within a year.

              pointed out, by way of rejoinder to the counter affidavit

              of respondent Nos. 2 to 4, that at least, 5 to 7 acres of

              land is existing in and around the IIT and Polytechnic

              campus,        which      had     remained          unutilized,       and     the

              appellant had also made an offer to put its project on

              hold till IIT shifts to its new campus; but this offer, too,

              was declined, which demonstrates that a false plea of

              larger public interest has been raised under the cover of

              the IIT.

              show, contends Mr. Singh, that the cancellation of the

              allotment       of    the    plot       of   land    is   not     a    punitive

              cancellation, but akin to acquisition of rights or their

              deprivation, more particularly, when the Authority‟s

              opinion itself is that the impugned cancellation of

              allotment       is    not    as     a     penal     measure.          In    these

              circumstances, according to Mr. Singh, compensation

              amount ought to have been specified simultaneously

              with the deprivation; whereas even after more than five

              years of deprivation, no compensation has yet been

              decided and what has been refunded to the appellant is

              the principal amount with interest @ 5 per cent and not

              even the commercial rate of interest. In this regard, Mr.

              Singh also points out that payment of 5 per cent interest

              is not even the return of the original value of money

              inasmuch as the admitted investment, like construction

              of    staff     quarters       for    Polytechnic,   construction   of

              boundary wall, site development, architect fees, have not

              been refunded.

              the case at hand, exists with the Authority under the

              of the appellant, it is contended by Mr. Lalit Kishore,

              learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the

              Authority, that Section 6(2) of the BIADA Act contains

              general power of the Authority to allot and lease out

              industrial land to entrepreneurs and also to cancel the

              same after its allotment and the power to do an act

              entails the power to undo the act, subject to any

              limitation provided by law, customs, etc. In other words,

              according to learned Senior Counsel, the power of

              allotment and lease, in the present case, carries with it

              the power to cancel the allotment and lease. Reference,

              in this regard, is made to the cases of <a href="/doc/1867676/" id="a_40">Union of India v.

              submitted by Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Senior Counsel,

              that though the only ground for cancellation of allotment,

              under <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_42">Section 6</a>(2-a) of the BIADA Act, is failure, on the

              part of the allottee, to take necessary effective steps to

              set up industry within the fixed period, yet the fact

              remains that making failure, on the part of the allottee,

              to take necessary effective steps to set up industry

              within the fixed period, embodied in <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_43">Section 6</a>(2-a) of

              the BIADA Act, as a ground for cancellation of allotment,

              which the Authority, otherwise, has under <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_44">Section 6</a> (2)

              of the BIADA Act, for, the rules, framed under the BIADA

              or restrict its meaning and, secondly, had such been the

              particularly, <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_46">Section 6</a> (2) of the BIADA Act would have

              provided that the cancellation of allotment and lease

              legislature, by adding <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_48">Sections 6</a> (2-a) and 6(2-b), has

              made its intention clear that failure to take necessary

              the only ground for exercise of power of cancellation of

<p id="p_59">                            48. In order to lend support to the above

              submission, it is contended by Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned

              Senior Counsel, that the object and aim of 1991

              Amendment of Section 6 of the BIADA Act would show

              that the said amendment was necessitated on account of

              the fact that the Authority, despite having the power to

              cancel allotment, had been facing difficulties in taking

              back possession of land without taking recourse to civil

              courts of competent jurisdiction, especially, where lease

              had been executed, because of the principle of tenancy

              by sufferance and, secondly, 1991 Amendment was with

              retrospective effect, i.e. with the date of coming into

              force of the BIADA Act, showing thereby the intention of

              the legislature that even if the allotment or lease was

              cancelled before the BIADA Act underwent amendment in

              the year 1991, the Authority can take back possession

              without facing the bar of tenancy by sufferance and,

              hence, reading of the said retrospective Amendment of

              1991 to the contrary would mean that in any other case,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                    24</span>




              had the Authority cancelled the allotment or lease on a

              ground other than what has been mentioned therein,

              i.e., failure to take necessary effective steps to set up an

              industry within a fixed period; such cancellation would be

              impermissible; Consequently, resumption of possession,

              according to Mr. Lalit Kishore, upon such cancellation,

              would become unauthorized by law requiring, in turn, the

              Authority to restore the land back to the allottee, though

              the     Authority,       before       the   BIADA       Act   underwent

              amendment           in   the    year      1991,   had    cancelled   the

              allotment. Such cannot, submits Mr. Lalit Kishore, be the

              object of the 1997 Amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_60">                            49. It is also submitted by Mr. Lalit Kishore,

              that whatever cancellations of allotment has been done

              by the Authority since 1997 on any ground other than

              what has been mentioned in <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_49">Section 6</a>(2-a) read with

              Section (2-b) would become illegal. This certainly,

              according to Mr. Lalit Kishore, could not have been the

              intention of the legislature, while making Bihar Industrial

              Area Development Authority (Amendment) Act, 1991,

              and, thirdly, the amendments, carried out, in the year

              1991, by way of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_50">Sections 6</a> (2-a) and 6(2-b), cannot be

              read to restrict the general power of cancellation of

              allotment or lease under <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_51">Section 6</a> (2) of the BIADA Act,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                       25</span>




              because it is well settled law that where a statute confers

              particular power without prejudice to the generality of

              the general powers already conferred, the particular

              powers are only illustrative of the general powers and do

              not, in any way, restrict the general power and also

              because such a restrictive meaning would be against the

              aims and objects of the BIADA Act, i.e., to promote

              industrialization in the State, and also because the

              legislature cannot foresee all the grounds, which would

              arise after 1974 requiring exercise of powers, under

              Section 6(2) of the BIADA Act, by way of punitive

              measure and the intention of the legislature to add

              <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_52">Section 6</a> (2-a) providing for the ground of cancellation

              of allotment or lease, as provided under Rule 6(i) and (ii)

              of 1981 Rules, was to make the ground mentioned

              therein a part of substantive law than to let it remain a

              part of delegated legislation in the form of Rules,

              because of the difficulty being faced by the Authority in

              resumption of the cancelled land due to tenancy in

              sufferance.

<p id="p_61">                            50. It is the further submission of Mr. Lalit

              Kishore that had it been the intention of the legislature

              to restrict the general power of cancellation, conferred

              on the Authority, to the above ground as provided under

              Rule 6 (i) and (ii) by the 1991 Amendment, then, it

              would have made the said amendment in the form of a

              proviso to <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_53">Section 6</a> (2) restricting its general power; on

              the contrary, the legislature, having added <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_54">Sections 6</a> (2-

</p><p id="p_62">              a) and 6(2-b), independently of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_55">Section 6(2)</a>, has made

              its intention clear that the act of providing specific

              ground of cancellation, i.e. failure to set up industry

              within the fixed period, does not divest the Authority of

              its general power of cancellation, which the Authority has

              under <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_56">Section 6(2)</a>.

              industry,       on    obtaining       permission   from   competent

              authority; but, later on, it is found that the discharge

              from the industrial premises is being absorbed by the soil

              and by mixing with its contents, it is producing a

              chemical, which is poisonous or harming the ground

              water adversely affecting thereby people, farm lands,

              cultivation, then, such entrepreneur could claim that the

              and Rule 6(ii), did not exist and even if there is any

              Authority that in the present case, it did not cancel the

              <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_58">Section 6</a> (2-a) of the BIADA Act inasmuch as it also

              was never the case of the Authority that it was relying

              upon <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_60">Section 21</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897, in

              order to cancel the allotment in the present case

              inasmuch as the Authority, in this regard, places reliance

              on the provisions of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_61">Section 6</a> (2) itself that even if it has

              not been provided in so many words in <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_62">Section 6</a> (2), yet

              the Authority has the general power to cancel allotment

              of land and lease inasmuch as the same would be an

              incidental and ancillary power to the power of allotment

              and lease and, therefore, reference made to the case of

              Indian National Congress (I) (supra) is not applicable

              could exercise power of review, the Supreme Court held

              expression „at any time‟, appearing in Section 9(3) of the

              BIADA Act, Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Senior Counsel,

              submits that it is incorrect to contend that the power of

              the Authority to restore possession of a plot/shed is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                           29</span>




              limited to a stage before                 allotment is made and

              possession is handed over to an entrepreneur inasmuch

              as the expression „at any time‟ shows, according to Mr.

              Lalit Kishore, that the intention of the legislature is that

              the restoration of the plot/shed by the Authority to the

              State Government is permissible both, either before

              allotment or lease, or, as the case may be, after

              allotment has already been made and possession of the

              plot/shed has already been handed over to the allottee.

              Points out, Mr. Lalit Kishore, in this regard, that the

              expression „at any time‟ would become redundant if the

              expression „at any time‟ is not given the meaning, which

              it demands, and is kept excluded, while interpreting

              Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act.
</p>
<p id="p_70">                          56. The contention of the appellant, based on

              the application of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_67">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of

              India, is also, according to Mr. Lalit Kishore, wholly

              misplaced inasmuch as the deprivation, if any, is not by

              executive act, but under a given legislation. Mr. Lalit

              Kishore submits that the Authority has the power to

              cancel allotment of land under Section 6(2) of the BIADA

              Act if the State Government decides that the land, which

              may have been allotted, be restored to the State

              Government. The Authority in this regard, is required to

              act, submits Mr. Lalit Kishore, in accordance with the

              decision, which the State Government may take, under

              Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act as regards restoration of

              the land to the Government and, hence, the impugned

              order would fall outside the provisions of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_68">Article 300A</a> of

              the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_71">                          57. With regard to the appellant‟s contention of

              absence of provisions of compensation under the BIADA

              Act and, therefore, inability to read into the scheme of

              the BIADA Act process of acquisition of property without

              payment of compensation, it is submitted by Mr. Lalit

              Kishore that in <a href="/doc/1515136/" id="a_69">Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of

              Gujarat</a>, (AIR 1995 SC 142), the Supreme Court has

              explained the meaning of „property‟ to be everything,

              which is subject of ownership; the right to possess, use

              and dispose; free use and disposal of all of one‟s

              acquisition; something created out of one‟s own labour.

</p><p id="p_72">                          58. It is the submission of Mr. Lalit Kishore, that

              in the case at hand, as there was no lease, the appellant

              did not acquire the right to possess and enjoy the land

              as may be available to a lessee and it would not be,

              therefore, property of the appellant within the meaning

              of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_70">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_73">                          59. The appellant was, emphasizes Mr. Lalit

              Kishore, merely an allottee and the order of allotment

              can, at best, be construed, as a licence in favour of the

              appellant and, therefore, its right to use the land, in

              question, would be subject to the conditions provided in

              the license, i.e. the allotment letter.

</p><p id="p_74">                          60. In a case of present nature, according to Mr.

              Lalit Kishore, the appellant did not have any right in the

              land, but had, if at all, a right arising out of the land,

              which was to put up a mall.
</p>
<p id="p_75">                          61. It is, thus, contended, on behalf of the

              respondents, that inasmuch as the appellant had not

              started actual construction works of the building of the

              said mall, the appellant‟s right, if any, was at a stage

              prior to its fructuation into a right arising out of the land

              and, at such a stage, no indefeasible right, within the

              ambit of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_71">Article 300A</a>, can be treated to have been

              acquired       by     the     appellant   on   the   allotted   land,

              particularly, when he was not the owner of the land.

</p><p id="p_76">                          62. Thus, compensation paid to the appellant, in

              the form of 5 per cent interest per annum, on the

              amount deposited towards the cost of the allotted land

              vis-à-vis its right to use the land, as a licensee, and also

              the return of the entire money paid by it to the Authority

              towards the cost of lands were sufficient, which should,

              now, be seen in the light of the fact that as per the

              appellant‟s own case, after receiving the total amount

              i.e. Rs.3,64,82,775/-, on 06.04.2009, it has placed it in a

              fixed deposit and, thus, has also earned further interest

              for five years, which would be substantial amount,

              somewhere close to Rupees One Crore. Apart, therefrom,

              in order to ensure that the appellant is not put to suffer,

              because it had constructed staff quarters, etc., of the

              Polytechnic Institute as had been directed by the

              respondents, the impugned order itself directs, points

              out Mr. Lalit Kishore, that assessment of damages, in

              this regard, would be made separately. Reference, in

              support of his submissions, is placed on by Mr. Lalit

              Kishore on the decision in <a href="/doc/1882779/" id="a_72">Amar Singh and others v.

              Custodian, Evacuee Property Punjab and Another</a>,

              (AIR 1957 SC 599), wherein the Court has held that a

              quasi permanent allotment of land does not fall within

              the meaning of „property‟ as under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_73">Article 31</a> of the

              of Section 6(2) of the BIADA Act on the ground that

              <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_74">Section       6(2)</a>      does       not    specifically   provide   for

</p><p id="p_78">                          64. Lastly, it is submitted, on behalf of the

              respondents,           that        this   Court,    in    exercise   of   its

              discretionary power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_75">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

              of    India,      may        not     hold   the     impugned     action    of

              cancellation of the allotment as bad in law, because the

              allotment         of    land        was     cancelled      for   facilitating

              establishment of the IIT, Patna. Thus, the said impugned

              action, submits Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Senior Counsel,

              was in public interest and this public interest would

              override private interest of the appellant. In this regard,

              reliance is placed on the decision, in <a href="/doc/1732840/" id="a_76">Sales Tax Officer

              and another v. Shree Durga Oil Mills and another</a>,

</p><p id="p_91">                          74. A combined reading of the provisions of

              Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 9 of the BIADA Act

              show that so long as a plot of land, which the State

              Government may have transferred to the Authority,

              remains at the disposal of the Authority, the land can be

              utilized for the purpose of development or use in

              accordance with the provisions of BIADA Act, the object

              of the BIADA Act being development of the land for

              industry,        promotion           of     industries   and       matters

              appurtenant thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_92">                          75. Naturally, therefore, so long as a plot of

              land,      allotted      to    the        Authority   from   the     State

              Government, remains with the Authority, the land cannot

              be used for a purpose other than what the BIADA Act

              envisages.
</p>
<p id="p_93">                          76. A careful reading of Sub-section (3) of

              Section 9 of the BIADA Act, now, shows that any land,

              which has been placed at the disposal of the Authority,

              shall be restored, „at any time‟, to the State Government

              if the State Government so requires.
</p>
<p id="p_94">                          77. If analyzed cautiously, it would, as a

              corollary, clearly follow that the restoration of a land to

              the State Government, in exercise of the power under

              Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act, is legally permissible if a

              third party right has not been created on the land.

</p><p id="p_95">                          78. What, thus, Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act,

              in simplest of words, conveys is that a plot of land, which

              has been placed at the disposal of the Authority and

              which has remained at the disposal of the Authority, can

              only     be     restored      to    the   State   Government.    The

              expression „at any time‟, appearing in Section 9(3) of the

              BIADA Act, does not alter this position inasmuch as the

              expression „at any time‟ cannot be read to mean a stage,

              where the land no longer remains at the disposal of the

              Authority, the same having already been allotted to an

              entrepreneur for establishment of an industry and if the

              entrepreneur, who has been so allotted the plot of land,

              has already established his industry.
</p>
<p id="p_96">                          79.     The      expression     „at   any   time‟   would

              necessarily, therefore, mean the „stage‟ between the

              date, when State Government leaves the land at the

              disposal of the Authority, and the date, when the

              Authority, in turn, allots the land to an entrepreneur and,

              upon allotting the land in favour of the entrepreneur, the

              land would cease to remain at the disposal of the

              Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_97">                          80. Consequently, until the time a land remains

              at the disposal of the Authority and no third party right

              has been created by allotment of the land to an

              entrepreneur,         possession          of   the   plot/shed   can   be

              restored to the Government if the Government so

              requires.
</p>
<p id="p_98">                          81. The above inference gets strengthened,

              when one microscopically analyzes the words used in the

              statute inasmuch as the land, which the Authority has

              already allotted in favour of an entrepreneur for the

              purpose of establishment of an industry and when an

              entrepreneur has already established the industry on the

              allotted land, it can no longer be said that the land has

              still remained at the disposal of the Authority for the

              purpose of making allotment to any entrepreneur under

              the scheme of the BIADA Act.
</p>
<p id="p_99">                          82. The question, therefore, of possession of a

              land being restored to the State Government does not

              arise merely because the Government requires the land

              if the land already stands allotted to a third party, who

              may have establishment his industry on the allotted

              land.
</p>
<p id="p_100">                          83. Mr. Jitendra Singh, learned Senior Counsel,

              appearing for the appellant, is, in our considered view,

              correct, when he submits that if Section 9(3) of the

              BIADA Act is read alone, what Section 9(3) of the BIADA

              Act conveys is plain and its plain meaning is that Section

              9(3) of the BIADA Act does not envisage cancellation of

              allotment of land already made to a third party,

              resumption of possession thereof by the Authority and,

              then, restoration of such a land to the State Government

              inasmuch as the power to cancel an allotment made to a

              third party, resumption of possession thereof and, then,

              restoration of the land, whose possession has been

              resumed, to the State Government would require reading

              into sub-Section (3) of Section 9 of the BIADA Act,

              "restore the land after cancelling the allotment and

              resuming possession thereof". Mr. Singh is also correct

              that reading of so many words into sub-Section (3) of

              Section 9 of the BIADA Act will be impermissible

              inasmuch as what is not available in Sub-section (3) of

              Section 9 of the BIADA Act cannot be read into it.

</p><p id="p_101">                          84. Interpretation of statute requires a Court

              not to read anything in statutory provisions, which is,

              otherwise, plain and unambiguous. Legislative causus

              omissus cannot be supplied by judicial interpretative

              process. What is permissible is merely to iron out the

              creases. References made, in this regard, to the cases of

              Padma Sundara Rao (supra) K.T. Plantation (P) Ltd.

              (supra), are not wholly misplaced.
</p>
<p id="p_102">                          85. Situated thus, it is clear that the only

              feasible and permissible interpretation attributable to

              Section 9 of the BIADA Act, more particularly, sub-

              Section (3) thereof, is that Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act

              permits restoration of only such land to the State

              Government, which, at the time, when the Authority

              requires restoration of possession of the land, must be at

              the disposal of the Authority and has not been allotted to

              any third party.
</p>
<p id="p_103">                          86. It would, therefore, do violence to the

              provisions of Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act if one reads

              into sub-Section (3) of Section 9 of the BIADA Act that

              the land, which already stands allotted to a third person

              by the Authority and which is no longer at the disposal of

              the Authority, can be restored to the State Government

              by taking recourse to the provisions of sub-Section (3) of

              Section 9 of the BIADA Act.
</p>
<p id="p_104">                          87. The expression "placed at the disposal of the

              Authority" would, we reiterate, mean a land, wherein no

              third party right has been created. Logically extended,

              this would mean that if the land has already been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                       42</span>




              allotted by the Authority to any third person, such a land

              shall no longer be treated to have remained at the

              disposal of the Authority and cannot, therefore, be

              restored to the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_105">                            88. However, passionately Section 9(3) of the

              BIADA Act is read, it does not provide for cancellation of

              allotment of a land for the purpose of restoration of the

              land to the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_106">                            89. In fact, it is not even contended by the

              respondents that Section 9 of the BIADA Act, if read as a

              whole, empowers the Authority to cancel an allotment for

              the purpose of restoration of the land to the State

              Government.
</p>
<p id="p_107">                          90. Interestingly, not even the respondents

              contend that a land, which has already been allotted to a

              third party, can still remain at the disposal of the

              Authority. In order to, therefore, comply with sub-section

              (3) of Section 9 of the BIADA Act and enable the

              Authority to restore possession of such a land to the

              State Government, what is contended, on behalf of the

              respondents, is that the provisions of Sub-section (2) of

              Section 6 of the BIADA Act can be resorted to for the

              purpose of cancellation of the allotment already made by

              the Authority to a third person irrespective of the fact as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                 43</span>




              to whether the allottee is at fault or not inasmuch as

              Section 6(2) of the BIADA Act empowers cancellation of

              the allotment made by the Authority, resumption of

              possession         thereof      and,      on   such   resumption   of

              possession, the land comes at the disposal of the

              Authority and, thereafter, restoration of the land would

              be permissible no matter whether the allotted is at

              default or not.
</p>
<p id="p_108">                            91. Situated thus, what becomes clear is that

              sub-Section (2) of Section 6 of the BIADA Act empowers

              the Authority to cancel allotment or lease, which has

              already been made in favour of a third party.

</p><p id="p_109">              WHETHER    THE  POWER    OF   CANCELLATION,
              EMBODIED IN SECTION 6(2) OF THE BIADA ACT,
              CAN BE EXERCISED IN ORDER TO RESTORE AN

</p>
<p id="p_110">                            92. Whether the power of cancellation, under

              Section 6(2) of the BIADA Act, can be exercised in order

              to restore the allotted land to the State Government is

              the predominant question.
</p>
<p id="p_111">                          93. While considering the above aspect of the

              present case, one has to also keep in mind that the

              interpretation, which the respondents seek to attribute to

              <a href="/doc/1353686/" id="a_79">Section 9</a> (3) of the BIADA Act, would have been

              possible, had there been something available in sub-

              Section (3) of Section 9 of the BIADA Act to indicate that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                              44</span>




              if required, the Authority, which may not have, at its

              disposal, a plot of land, because of the land having

              already      been      allotted     to a third   party, would   be

              empowered to cancel the allotment for the purpose of

              restoration of the land to the State Government, bring

              the land under its disposal and, then, restore the land to

              the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_112">                          94. Thus, adding to sub-section (3) of Section 9

              of the BIADA Act the power of the Authority to cancel the

              allotment of land in order to restore possession thereof

              to the State Government would be wholly impermissible

              unless the power of cancellation of the allotment,

              embodied in <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_80">Section 6(2)</a>, can be justifiably linked to

              sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/1353686/" id="a_81">Section 9</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_113">                          95. The question of all questions, therefore,

              which falls for determination, is: whether cancellation of

              allotment is permissible merely for the purpose of

              restoring the allotted land to the State Government?

</p><p id="p_114">                          96. There can be, no doubt, that legislation has

              meaning.

              cancellation, embodied in Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of

              the BIADA Act, is generic power of cancellation and only

              one of the grounds for such cancellation has been

              mentioned in Sub-section (2-a) read with Sub-section

              Sub-section (2-a) read with Sub-section (2-b) of Section

              attractive. However, on a closer look, the submissions,

              so made on behalf of the respondents, does not stand

              scrutiny of law. If the power of cancellation under Sub-

              section (2) is relatable to general power of cancellation,

              the power given by Sub-section (2-a) would have been

              implicit in Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_84">Section 6</a> and no specific

              provisions, in the form of Sub-Section (2-a), would have

<p id="p_122">                            102.       Since      the   State   Government   was

              conscious of the fact that the power of cancellation for

              omission to take necessary steps to establish an industry

              is not available in Sub-section (2-a) of Section 6 of

              BIADA Act, such a provision has been made meaning

              thereby that though there was a general power of

              cancellation, the legislature was conscious of the fact

              that the exercise of this power shall not be arbitrary

              unless the reason enabling such cancellation is made

              explicit.

              down as to when the power of cancellation is possible

              that Sub-section (2-a) has been added, which lays down

              that if the allottee does not take necessary effective

              steps to establish industry within the period specified,

              the allotment shall be cancelled.

              provides, namely, that an allottee has failed to take

              necessary effective steps to establish his industry within

              the specified period. A contrary view is not possible

              inasmuch as the respondents have not been able to

              explain as to why the legislature deemed it necessary

              that incorporation of Sub-section (2-a) of Section 6 of

              BIADA Act is required.                Inability, on the part of the

              respondents, to explain, as to why incorporation of sub-

              Section (2) of Section 6 of the BIADA Act, had become

              imperative,        where      even        without   incorporating   Sub-

              Section (2-a), it was possible to cancel the allotment of

              land if effective steps were not taken within the fixed

              period to establish an industry, for, this power is,

              otherwise, also traceable to Section 6(2) of the BIADA

              already available with the Authority by taking recourse to

              <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_86">Section 6(2)</a> and, hence, it would have been enough for

              the     legislature       to    make         provisions,       by      way    of

              amendment,            enabling        the         Authority     to     resume

              possession of the land, whose allotment had been

              cancelled. Instead of providing for merely resumption of

              possession of the land, whose allotment had been

              cancelled, the legislature has deemed it fit to incorporate

              <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_87">Section 6</a> (2-a) too.
</p>
<p id="p_128">                            107. With regard to the above, we may hasten

              to add that it is sub-section (2-a) of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_88">Section 6</a>, which

              provides for resumption of possession of land, whose

              allotment has been cancelled; whereas sub-section (2-b)

              of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_89">Section 6</a> provides for cancellation of allotment. When

              the power of cancellation of allotment was, as the

              respondents         contended,            already       available    with    the

              Authority under sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_90">Section 6</a>, it was not

              necessary to incorporate, once again, <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_91">Section 6</a>(2-a)

              making therein provisions for cancellation of allotment;

              rather,      mere     incorporation          of     sub-section      (2-b)    of

              <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_92">Section 6</a> would have sufficed in order to enable the

              <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_93">Section 6</a>(2-a) of BIADA Act leaves the Authority with no

              discretion, but to cancel allotment of land if an allottee

              does not take necessary effective steps within the fixed

              period to establish his industry; whereas the power of

              cancellation, under <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_94">Section 6</a> (2) of the BIADA Act, is

              discretionary        inasmuch as a reading of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_95">Section 6</a>(2-a)

              shows that it is not necessary but mandatory on the part

              of the Authority to cancel allotment of land made to an

              allottee, who has not taken necessary effective steps to

              establish the industry within the specified period subject

              to the condition if the allottee can reasonably justify the

              delay in taking necessary effective steps and that is why,

              itself, against the cancellation of the allotment. This is

              upon the Authority by <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_98">Section 6(2)</a>, is discretionary,

              establish his industry within the specified period. No

              other rational interpretation is possible to be attributed

              Authority to appropriate to itself the power of doing any

              act, which would deprive a person of his „property‟ and

              thereby denying to him the constitutional protection,

              which <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_108">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of India provides.

</p><p id="p_145">                            118. It has been contended, on behalf of the

              respondents, that what an allottee, in the land allotted,

              has, is merely an interest and such interest would not

              amount to „property‟ and, hence, when cancellation of

              allotment of a plot of land takes place, a person is not

              deprived of his „property‟; rather, what he is deprived of,

              if at all, is an interest in the allotted land.

</p><p id="p_146">                            119. The argument, so advanced, loses sight

              of the fact that mere allotment of land to an allottee

              stands on a footing different from the other allottee,

              who, on receiving the allotment, has raised his industry

              on the allotted land and has been running the industry

              and taking care of the land in accordance with law and in

              terms of the allotment of lease. While such an allottee

              may have interest only in the land, the fact remains that

              the industry would be the allottee‟s                property and no

              one, not even the Authority, can deprive such an allottee

              of the enjoyment of such                  a   property without there

              being any mechanism for payment of compensation.

              Cancellation of an allotment of a plot of land, where no

              property exists, is different from cancellation of allotment

              of a land, where property of an allottee stands.

</p><p id="p_147">                            120. In the case at hand, there is no dispute

              that some constructions, such as, boundary wall, etc.,

              have been made on the allotted land by the appellant.

              Whatever construction has been done on the allotted

              land cannot but be construed as the property of the

              allottee and, in such circumstances, when there is no

              mechanism for compensation available in the BIADA Act,

              the power of cancellation, depriving allottee of his

              property, without his fault or default, cannot be said to

              be available with the Authority.

<p id="p_148">                            121. With regard to the above, it is also of

              immense importance to note that an allottee, who has

              his property on the allotted land, commits a fault or is on

              default, cancellation of his allotment by taking recourse

              to sub-section (2) to <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_109">Section 6</a> would be permissible, for,

              such cancellation would be penal in nature. This case of

              cancellation is wholly distinguishable from the case of an

              allottee, who has his property on the allotted land and

              has committed no fault or default. In the latter case, it

              would not be possible to cancel allotment, when the

              BIADA Act does not provide for compensation to the

              allottee, who is deprived of his property.

</p><p id="p_149">                            122. Logically, therefore, one cannot read into

              sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/84142018/" id="a_110">Section 6</a> the Authority‟s power to

              cancel allotment and thereby deprive an allottee of his

              property if the allottee is not at fault and has not

              committed         any     breach      of   any   law   or   terms   and

              conditions of the allotment and/or lease.

</p><p id="p_150">                            123. When <a href="/doc/1353686/" id="a_111">Section 9</a> (3) of the BIADA Act is

              read independent of other provisions of the BIADA Act, it

              clearly follows that Section 9(3) of the BIADA Act does

              not conceive of restoration of possession of a plot of land

              to the State Government by cancelling, if necessary, the

              allotment already made in favour of a third party. Even

              the respondents do not boldly contend that the power to

              cancel the allotment of a plot of land made by the

              Authority in favour of an entrepreneur, who has made

              investment to set up his industry, is available to the

              Authority merely for the purpose of restoration of

              possession of such land to the State Government.

              However, what has been contended, in order to cancel

              the allotment of the plot of land in the present case, is

              that cancellation, for the purpose of restoring possession

              of a plot of land to the State Government, is possible

              even if the plot of land is no longer at the disposal of the

              Authority if the State Government so requires in larger

              public interest and support for that purpose is sought to

              be derived from sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the

              BIADA Act.

<p id="p_151">              CANCELLATION OF ALLOTMENT: PUBLIC INTEREST

</p>
<p id="p_152">                            124. The question, therefore, is: whether

              cancellation of an allotment is possible merely in larger

              public interest than the interest of the allottee if the

              allottee has not committed any fault or default and who

              has made huge investment, on the allotted land, by

              establishing an industry and has been running the

              industry so established.
</p>
<p id="p_153">                            125.         The question, framed above, bring us

              back to the scope of power of cancellation of the

              Authority under Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the

              BIADA Act.
</p>
<p id="p_154">                            126. So far as Section 6 of the BIADA Act is

              concerned,         it   clearly      shows   that   the   power   of

              cancellation, which has been conferred on the Authority

              by <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_112">Section 6</a>(2-a) of the BIADA Act, is punitive in nature

              inasmuch as this power is, admittedly, exercisable only

              and only when an allottee does not take necessary

              effective steps within the fixed period to establish
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                       59</span>




              industry. Even if the ground mentioned in <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_113">Section 6</a>(2-a)

              of the BIADA Act may not be the sole ground for

              cancellation of an allotment, is it permissible to cancel

              allotment, made in favour of a third party for a purpose

              other than penal, is the question and needs to be, now,

              answered.

<p id="p_155">                            127. Our search for an answer to the above

              question brings us to the object with which the BIADA

              Act has been enacted. There is no dispute that the

              Authority has been created, under the BIADA Act, to

              provide for development of land in industrial area,

              promotion of industries and matters appurtenant thereto.

</p><p id="p_156">                            128. The Authority, which State Government

              can create under <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_114">Section 3</a>, has been empowered to

              acquire, hold and dispose of properties, both movable

              and immovable, and to contract.
</p>
<p id="p_157">                            129. Section 6 of the BIADA Act vests, in the

              Authority, the responsibility to plan development of

              industrial area, promotion of industries in the industrial

              area and other amenities incidental thereto.

</p><p id="p_158">                            130. Sub-Section (2-a) of Section 6 of BIADA

              Act, as already pointed out above, makes it obligatory

              for the Authority to cancel allotment of the allotted

              plot/shed if necessary effective steps are not taken
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                 60</span>




              within the fixed period to establish industry and forfeit

              the amount deposited with the Authority. <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_115">Section 6</a>(2-b)

              of the BIADA Act makes it incumbent upon the Authority

              to take possession of the plot/shed on cancellation of the

              allotment of the plot/shed. There is nothing in Sub-

              Section       (2-b)     empowering        the   Authority   to   take

              possession, on cancellation of the allotment of the

              plot/shed, any property of the allottee except the allotted

              plot/shed. Obviously, when cancellation of allotment

              under <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_116">Section 6</a>(2-a) is on the ground that the allottee

              has not taken necessary effective steps to establish

              industry within the fixed period, the question of the

              allottee having „property‟ on the allotted land, in the

              form of industry, does not arise at all.
</p>
<p id="p_159">                            131. Nowhere, therefore, the Authority is

              empowered to take possession of the property of the

              allottee. While, thus, the Authority can cancel the

              allotment and take possession of the plot/shed, it does

              not have power to take possession of the property of the

              allottee. If Sub-Section (2-b) is read as the adjunct of

              Sub-Section (2-a), then, the cancellation of allotment

              can be only as a penal measure, when the allottee fails

              to take necessary effective steps to establish industry

              within the fixed period and, upon such cancellation, the

              the power to cancel allotment and deprive an allottee of

              the property, which the allottee may have on the allotted

              plot or under the allotted shed.
</p>
<p id="p_161">                            133. Without providing for any mechanism for

              payment of compensation, if the Authority is treated to

              have the power to deprive an allottee of his property, it

              would obviously dissuade an allottee to seek allotment of

              land for the purpose of establishing an industry. If an

              investor knows that at any time, the Government may

              choose to take back the plot of land and if the State

              Government so requires, the Authority would be bound

              to cancel the allotment and take back the allotted plot of

              land, depriving the allottee of his right to enjoy his

              property without having been compensated for such

              acquisition, no investor would come forward to seek

              allotment of land from the Authority and/or to establish

              industry        by      making            investment.     Such   wholly

              unreasonable,           illogical,    irrational    and    unjustifiable

              meaning cannot be attributed to the scheme of the

              BIADA Act.

              established, the allottee cannot be deprived of his

              industry without payment of compensation; whereas no

              mechanism of compensation has been embodied in the

              BIADA Act.

<p id="p_185">                         153. Since the BIADA Act has to be read as a

              reasonable and realistic piece of legislation, it would

              logically follow that the BIADA Act cannot be held to

              empower cancellation of an allotment without any fault

              or default on the part of the allottee and deprive him of

              his property.

              noteworthy, as has been correctly submitted by Mr.

              Singh that in the case at hand, the show cause notice,

              which had been issued to the appellant, was merely a

              formality and carried no meaning, when the decision had

              already been taken that the allotment of the land, in

              question, be cancelled. There is, therefore, considerable

              force, in the submission of Mr. Singh, that entire process

              of cancellation by giving the notice of show cause is

              sham.

<p id="p_190">                           157. Though it has been contended, on behalf

              of the respondents, that the power to make allotment

              also includes the power of cancellation, the appellant

              submits that such power is exercisable under <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_128">Section 21</a>

              statutory authority is required to act quasi-judicially.

              There can be no doubt that when cancellation of

              allotment is penal in nature, the exercise of this power is

              quasi judicial; hence, the principle, underlined 21 of the

              cancellation of the allotment cannot be at the whims and

              fancies of the Authority or the State Government and

              every cancellation has to be made within the scheme of

              the BIADA Act and not otherwise and, hence, general

              power of cancellation of the Authority, in a case of

              popular sense. Where, however, the words, used in a

              statute,       are     capable       of    bearing     two    or   more

              construction of statutory provisions, one has to answer

              following questions, namely, (i) What is the purpose for

              which the provision is made? (ii) What was the position

              before making the provision? (iii) Whether any of the

              constructions proposed would lead to an absurd result or

              would render any part of the provision redundant? (iv)

              representation made by another, alters his position, the

              doctrine of promissory estoppel estops the person making

              the representation from going back on his words to the

              detriment of the one, who has altered his position. The

              doctrine of promissory estoppel was evolved, in England,

              as a principle of equity to mitigate the rigours of strict law

              and to prevent injustice taking place from strict adherence

              to law. The development and expansion of this doctrine,

              particularly,       in    the   realm       of    its   application      against

              Governments, in India, in the post-independence era of

              of this doctrine, the first limitation being that the parties

              must have a contractual or legal relationship in order to

              apply the doctrine and the second one being that this

              doctrine can operate only as a shield and not as sword.

              not bound by some contractual or legal relationship and

              that the doctrine could have been applied only as a

              defence and could not have formed the basis of a cause of

              action against anyone. Both these limitations imposed on

              the operation of this doctrine have, as we shall indicate

              shortly, been dispensed with in its application in India.

              the predecessor-in-title of the Municipal Corporation of

              Bombay to remove old markets from a certain site and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                               80</span>




              vacate the same. On the application of the Municipal

              Commissioner,           the    Government   passed   a   resolution

              approving and authorizing the grant of another site to the

              Municipality. The resolution adopted by the Government

              further stated, "the Government do not consider that any

              rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets

              will be, like other public buildings, for the benefit of the

              whole community". Although possession of the site was

              made over to the then Municipal Commissioner, no formal

              grant was, in fact, executed as required by the relevant

              statute. Acting, however, on this resolution, the Municipal

              Corporation gave up the site on which the old markets

              were situated and spent a sum of Rs. 17 lakhs in erecting

              and maintaining markets on the new site. In 1940, the

              Collector of Bombay assessed the new site to Land

              Revenue and the Municipal Corporation, thereupon, filed a

              suit for a declaration that the order of assessment was

              ultra vires and it was entitled to hold the land forever

              without payment of any assessment. The suit was

              dismissed, for, notwithstanding the said resolution, the

              fact remained that no formal grant, in terms of the

              relevant statute, had been made by the Government. An

              appeal was preferred before the High Court. The High

              Court of Bombay held that the Government had lost its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                         81</span>




              right to assess the land, in question, by reason of the

              equity arising out of the facts of the case in favour of the

              Municipal        Corporation.        The    High    Court    accordingly

              reversed the decision of the trial Court and held the

              Corporation entitled to hold the land forever without

              payment of any rent. The Collector preferred an appeal

              before the Supreme Court. There was no dispute that by

              reason of non-compliance with the statutory formalities,

              the Government's resolution of 1865 was not a formal

              grant passing title in the land to the Corporation. There

              was also no dispute that there was, legalistically speaking,

              no     formal      enforceable        contract     between   the        State

              Government and the Municipal Corporation. Of the five

              Judges, Das. J., speaking for the majority, observed that

              the possession of the Corporation, not being referable to

              any legal title, was adverse to the legal title of the

              Government and the right acquired by the Corporation to

              hold the land in perpetuity included immunity from

              payment of rent. Patanjali Sastri, J., expressed a contrary

              view holding that the express provisions of the statute

              could not be overridden by considerations of equity.

              Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J., concurred with the conclusion of

              Das, J., but based his reasoning on the fact that by the

              resolution,       representations          had   been   made       to    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                     82</span>




              Corporation by the Government and the accident that the

              grant was invalid did not wipe out the existence of the

              representation.           The       observations,     so    made       by

              Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J., in Municipal Corporation of

              the City of Bombay (supra), have been treated as the

              single     most      exposition       of   law   on   the   doctrine   of

              promissory estoppel involving Governments. The relevant

              observations may, therefore, be taken note of, which read

              as follows:

                                      meaning that the grant was of rent-free land,
                                      the case would come strictly within the
                                      doctrine of estoppel enunciated in <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_142">Section

                                      themselves to fulfil it. Whether it is the equity
                                      recognised in Ramsden's case [1866] L.R. 1
                                      H. L. 129: 14 W. R. 926, or it is some other
                                      form of equity, is not of much importance.
                                      Courts must do justice by the promotion of
                                      honesty and good faith, as far as it lies in
                                      their power. As pointed out by Jenkins, C.J.

              doctrine was applied in the Municipal Corporation of

              the City of Bombay                 (supra), without there being any

              formal contractual or legal relationship existing between

              Corporation of the City of Bombay (supra), was legally

              invalid inasmuch as the representation had not been made

              in the manner as the statute had prescribed. This apart,

              the doctrine was resorted to not merely as a shield for

              defence, but for founding the cause of action against the

              Government. To this extent, the decision in Municipal

              Corporation of the City of Bombay (supra), deviated

              from the traditional views of the English Courts and can be

              treated as the path-breaking judgment on the doctrine of

              promissory estoppel.

<p id="p_210">                            172. What also needs to be emphasized is that

              in Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay

              (supra), that the expressed provisions of a statute could

              not      be     overridden          by        considerations     of        equity,

              Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J., opined, "....The invalidity of the

              observations, made in Century Spinning &amp; Mfg. Co.

              Ltd. (supra), would mean that if the statute prescribes a

              particular manner, which has to be followed by the

              Government for the purpose of enabling it to keep to its

              promises, law is not powerless, in appropriate cases, to

              compel the Government to act in such a manner as would

              be necessary to enforce the contract. Logically, therefore,

              when the statute does not bar making of a promise or the

              statute does not bar the Government from granting

              exemption from sales tax, the Government must, acting

              upon its industrial policy, bring out a notification in terms

              of the taxing statute in order to keep to its promises

              rather than resile therefrom on the pretext that unless

              exemption is granted in the manner in which the statute

              has prescribed for granting of exemption, no enforceable

              contract can be made out.

              which the doctrine can be resorted to, it also lays down as

              the equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel, to abide by,

              and carry out, its promises, and as to when this doctrine

              may not be allowed to prevail upon and shall succumb to

              seemed to suggest that the doctrine of promissory

              estoppel is limited in its operation to the cases, where the

              parties are already contractually bound and one of the

              parties induces the other to believe that the strict rights

              under the contract would not be enforced, made it clear

              the Supreme Court, speaking through Bhagawati, J., in

              "The doctrine would seem to apply even where there is no

                                      one party has by his words or conduct made
                                      to the other a clear and unequivocal promise

<p id="p_221">                           182. In short, what the decision, in Motilal

              Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. (supra), lays down is

              that where the Government makes a promise knowing or

              intending that it would be acted upon by the promisee

              and, in fact, the promisee, acting upon the promise, alters

              his position, the Government would be held bound by the

              promise and the promise would be enforceable against the

              Government            at     the     instance   of   the   promisee,

              notwithstanding the fact that there was no consideration

              for the promise and the promise was not recorded in the

              form of a formal contract as required by <a href="/doc/1084525/" id="a_147">Article 299</a> of the

              Constitution. The doctrine of promissory estoppel would

              be attracted in such a case, because, on the facts, equity

              would require that the Government should be held bound

              by the promise made by it. When the Government is able

              to show that public interest would be prejudiced if the

              Government were required to carry out the promise, the

              Court would have to balance the public interest vis-a-vis

              the position of the one, who has altered his position, and

              it is the Court, which has the duty to determine which way
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                  92</span>




              the equity lies. It would, however, not be enough for the

              Government merely to say that public interest requires

              that the Government should not be compelled to carry out

              the promise or that the public interest would suffer if the

              Government           were      required   to   honour   it.   If   the

              Government wants to resist the liability, it will have to

              disclose to the court what are the facts and circumstances

              on account of which the Government claims to be

              exempted from the liability and it would be for the court to

              decide whether those facts and circumstances are such as

              to render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the

              Government. Mere claim of change of policy would not be

              sufficient to exonerate the Government from the liability;

              the Government would have to show what precisely is the

              changed policy and also its reason and justification so that

              the court can judge for itself which way the public interest

              lies and what the equity of the case demands. The court

              would not act on the mere ipse dixit of the Government,

              for, the Government cannot be the judge of its own cause

              and it is the court, which has to decide and not the

              Government, whether the Government should be held

              exempt from liability. This is, as Bhagawati, J., in Motilal

              Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. (supra), observes, "the

              essence of the rule of law".

              Ltd. (supra),a two-Judge Bench in (supra)), has pointed

              out that the Court, in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co.

              Ltd.      (supra),       has     reiterated   the   two   well-known

              preconditions for the operation of the doctrine, namely,

              that (1) a clear and unequivocal promise knowing and

              intending that it would be acted upon by the promisee ;

              and that (2) such acting upon the promise by the

              promisee so that it would be inequitable to allow the

              promisor to go back on the promise.

<p id="p_224">                           184. The Court, in Nestle India Ltd. (supra),

              also pointed out the limitations placed on the doctrine laid

              down in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. (supra),

              namely, that (1) The doctrine of promissory estoppel,

              being an equitable doctrine, must yield, when the equity

              so requires, means that the doctrine would yield only if

              the court is satisfied, on proper and adequate materials

              placed by the Government, that overriding public interest

              requires that the Government should not be held bound

              by the promise, but should be free to act unfettered by it :

              and that (2) No representation can be enforced, which is

              prohibited by law, means that if the person or authority

              making the representation or promise has the power to

              carry out the promise, then, subject to the preconditions

              and     the     two     limitations        indicated   hereinbefore,   the

              doctrine must be applied.

              observed        the    Court     in       Nestle   India   Ltd.   (supra),

              "....Thus, if the statute does not contain a provision

              enabling the Government to grant exemption, it would not

              be possible to enforce the representation against the

              Government,           because         the     Government     cannot    be

              compelled to act contrary to the statute. But if the statute

              confers power on the Government to grant the exemption,

              the Government can legitimately be held bound by its

              promise to exempt the promisee from payment of sales

              tax."

<p id="p_226">                           186. What emerges from the above discussion is

              that when the statute does not contain a provision

              enabling the Government to grant exemption, it would not

              be possible to enforce the representation against the

              Government,           because         the     Government     cannot    be

              confers power on the Government to grant the exemption,

              promissory          estoppel         from      enforcing       a    statutory

              prohibition. It is equally true that promissory estoppel

              cannot be used to compel the Government or a public

              authority to carry out a representation or promise, which

              is contrary to law or which was outside the authority or

              power of the officer of the Government or of the public

              doctrine      of    promissory        estoppel        being    an   equitable

              doctrine, it must yield when the equity so requires ; if it

              having regard to the facts as they have transpired, it

              would be inequitable to hold the Government or public

              authority to the promise or representation made by it, the

              Court would not raise an equity in favour of the person to

              whom the promise or representation is made and enforce

              the promise or representation against the Government or

              public authority. The doctrine of promissory estoppel

              would be displaced in such a case, because on the facts,

              equity would not require that the Government or public

              authority should be held bound by the promise or

              representation made by it. This aspect has been dealt with

<p id="p_232">                           190. The principles, governing the application of

              promissory estoppel against the Government, flowing from

              the decision in Godfrey Philips India Ltd. (supra), are

              that if the Government possesses a power, it is bound to

              wield that power to enforce its promise, the limitation on

              the enforcement of the promise being when the statute

              prohibits the exercise of powers necessary for carrying out

              the representation made by the Government or when the

              overriding public interest permits the Government not

              keep itself within the bounds of the promise made by it. In

              short, as long as, by asking the Government to keep to its

              promise, the court does not force the Government to act

              contrary to law or against supervening public interest, the

              court will not be doing anything wrong.

              bound by the representation that it has made if a person,

              acting on the representations made by the Government,

              has altered his position to his detriment. In such a case, it

              will be no defence for the Government to say that no

              brought out to give effect to the representations made by

              the Government, the Government is not bound by the

              to carry out the representations that it had made. Any

              notification, issued under the relevant statute, which runs

              contrary to the Government's representation, may be

              interfered with. A mere claim by the Government that

              larger public interest permits the Government not to abide

              by its representation will not be enough to free the

              Government from the commitments that it had made, for,

              the Government cannot be the judge of its own cause and

              the Government would have to lay bare all the facts and

              circumstances, which had induced the Government not to

              carry out the representation that it has made, and if, on

              balancing between the two competing equities, that is, the

              commitment made to the promisee, on the one hand, and

              the public interest, on the other, the court finds that the

              public interest has the overriding effect, the promise

              would not be enforced, for, the doctrine of promissory

              Court took the view that while issuing the notification, in

              any representation made to the importers, in general, on

              the basis of which they could insist, on the strength of the

              exemption granted earlier by the first notification could

              not be reduced by the second one and since the said

              notification was issued in public interest, it could be

              imported product was substantial, for, no importer could

              have been expected to import PVC resins after paying

              duty and incur losses. The said notification was, therefore,

              according to the Supreme Court, issued with a view to

              offsetting the losses to the extent possible. The said

              notification, in the view of the Supreme Court, was not

              issued as a potential source of extra profit for the

              importer. In fact, the specific finding of the Court in

              Kasinka        Trading        (supra),    was   that    the   exemption

              notification did not, in reality, hold out to the appellants

              any enforceable promise.

<p id="p_242">                           199. Coupled with the above, the specific finding,

              recorded in Kasinka Trading (supra), was that the

              Government had presented sufficient materials before the

              Court to show that it was, in the larger public interest,

              that the exemption be withdrawn. It was, thus, on the

              basis of twin factors, namely, that there was no promise

              held out by the notification, in question, and also that

              larger public interest justified the withdrawal of exemption

              that the decision in Kasinka Trading (supra), was

              rendered.

              wherein the correctness of the decision in Kasinka

              Trading (supra), came to be re-examined by a Bench of

              three Judges of the Supreme Court and the decision

              reached in Kasinka Trading (supra), came to be affirmed

              therein. In Shrijee Sales Corporation (supra), too, the

              specific finding of the Court was that "there is a

              supervening public interest and hence it should not be

              mandatory for the Government to give a notice before

              withdrawing         the     exemption"       and    it   was,      in   these

              circumstances,          that     the      Court,   in    Shrijee        Sales

              Corporation          (supra),      declared    that      the   decision    in

              Kasinka Trading (supra), has been correctly reached. In

              Shrijee Sales Corporation (supra), the Supreme Court

              has reiterated its earlier decision that in case there is

              supervening public equity, the Government would be

              allowed to change its stand; but the Court must satisfy

              itself that such a public interest exists. The three-Judge

              Bench in Shrijee Sales Corporation (supra), approved

              the position of law propounded in Motilal Padampat

              Sugar Mills Co. (supra), to the effect that "it is only if the

              court is satisfied, on proper and adequate material placed

              by     the    Government,          that    overriding     public    interest

              requires that the Government should not be held bound by

              the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it, that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                 106</span>




              the court would refuse to enforce the promise against the

              Government."
</p>
<p id="p_244">                               201.       What          crystallizes   from   the   above

              discussions is that Kasinka Trading (supra) is a case

              involving application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel,

              wherein the Supreme Court, apart from laying down as to

              why the facts of the case did not invite the application of the

              doctrine of promissory estoppel, has also made it clear that

              the Government may be allowed to resile from his promise

              in supervening public interest, that is to say, when there is

              clash of equity and it is the dominant equity, which would

              be allowed to prevail.
</p>
<p id="p_245">                             202. The case at hand is not at all a case

              involving application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

              It is not in equity that the Authority has cancelled the

              allotment, in question. The respondents seek to submit that

              the cancellation is in exercise of their statutory power. When

              resort to       statutory powers is taken to contend that the

              power is available to cancel the allotment, in the present

              case, the question of withdrawing or resiling from a promise

              made does not arise a at all. Hence, the case of Kasinka

              Trading (supra) was not at all applicable to the facts of the

              present case.
</p>
<p id="p_246">                           203. It is of paramount importance to note that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                                  107</span>




              while cancellation amounts to annulling what had existed or

              to abolish what had prevailed                  or to obliterate what was

              present or to destroy what had survived; withdrawal implies

              drawing back, taking back and to move away. Thus, the

              expression `cancellation‟ is miles away from the expression

              `withdrawal‟.

<p id="p_247">                           204. In Kasinka Trading (supra) the Court,

              quoted, Prof. S. A. De Smith‟s observations in his celebrated

              treatise "Judicial Review of Administrative Action", 3rd Edn.

              at p. 279, which the respondents rely upon, read thus,

              "Contracts and Covenants entered into by the Crown are not

              to be construed as being subject to implied terms that would

              exclude the exercise of general discretionary powers for the

              public good : On the contrary they are to be construed as

              incorporating an implied term that such powers remain

              exercisable. This is broadly true of other public authorities

              also. But the status and functions of the Crown in this

              regard are of a higher order. The Crown cannot be allowed

              to tie its hands completely by prior undertakings is as clear

              as the proposition that the Courts cannot allow the Crown to

              evade       compliance         with       ostensibly   binding   obligations

              whenever it thinks fit : If a public authority lawfully

              repudiates or departs from the terms of a binding contract in

              order to have been bound in law by an ostensibly binding

              contract because the undertaking would improperly fetter its

              general      discretionary        powers     the    other        party    to   the

              agreement         has      no    right    whatsoever        to    damages       or

              compensation under the general law, no matter how serious

              the damages that party may have suffered."

</p><p id="p_248">                           205. So far as Prof. S. A. De. Smith‟s comments on

              "Judicial Review of Administrative Action", which is quoted in

              Kasinka         Trading         (supra)    and     relied        upon     by   the

              respondents,         are     concerned,     we     may      point        out   that

              comments of Prof. S.A. De Smith on the question of judicial

              review of administrative action" in a case of contract entered

              into by the State is concerned, Prof. S. A. De. Smith‟s

              comments do not deal with the statutory powers of the

              State or any of its instrumentalities. What the observations,

              made by Prof. S.A. De. Smith, convey is that the discretion

              is available to the State or its instrumentality to resile from

              its contractual obligation. The observations of Prof. S.A. De.

              Smith cannot be made applicable to a case, where                               the

              statute did not give discretion to the State and its

              instrumentalities to opt out of, or resile from, its promise,

              particularly in a case of present nature, wherein it is not the

              contention of the public authority that it is departing from a

              binding contract in the larger public interest; rather, the

              contention of the Authority concerned is that it is, indeed,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108"> Patna High Court LPA No.335 of 2014 (7) dt.21-10-2014                        109</span>




              empowered, under the relevant legislation, to exercise the

              power of cancellation of the allotment, which it had made.

              CONCLUSION:
</p>
<p id="p_249">                          206. What emerges from the above discussion is

              that since the object of BIADA Act is to develop industry,

              it follows that the object of the BIADA Act is enacted to

              attract and invite investment. If the BIADA Act is read

              and interpreted in such a manner that it would dissuade

              investment, the very purpose/object of the BIADA Act

              would stand defeated. Such a wholly unrealistic and

              unreasonable approach of the interpretation of the

              statute, in question, needs to be eschewed.

</p><p id="p_250">                          207. In the result and for the reasons discussed

              above, this appeal succeeds. The impugned order, dated

              24.01.2014, passed in CWJC No. 4532 of 2009, is hereby

              set aside. We also set aside and quash the order, dated

              04.04.2009, which stood impugned in CWJC No. 4532 of

              2014. The respondents are hereby accordingly directed

              to take necessary consequential steps, which may be

              warranted as a result of the fact that the order, dated

              04.04.2009, which stood impugned in CWJC No. 4532 of

              2009, has, now, been set aside and quashed.
