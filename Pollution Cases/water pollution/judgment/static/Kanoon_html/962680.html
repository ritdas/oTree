	Heard

</p>
<p id="p_2">	We
have also perused the Report of the Expert Committee, constituted by
this Court vide orders dated 22nd September and 6th
October 2005 and in Special Civil Application No.2922 of 1995. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">	In
paragraph No.6.3 of the Report, the Committee has opined as under:
</p>
<p id="p_4">?S6.3
The Committee reviewed the relevant information made available by the
Board and the concerned industrial units to ascertain whether there
has been degradation of Environment and damage caused to the
environment by each of the units by not observing norms of the Board.

				It was discharging
				large quantity of the trade effluent into the Nala which met the
				River Tapi.  Though the industry has claimed for adequate
				treatment but in fact it had been exceeded several time higher
				than the permissible limit of the Norms during 1993-97.  This
				violation of the norms cannot be condoned.  Further more, that
				the water of River Tapi has been used as only source of drinking
				water for Surat City, located downstream of discharge point thus
				causing possible difficulties to water supply source of Surat. 
				This mode of disposal is not desirable, from the environmental
				point of view.

It was discharging
large quantity of effluent into the River Mini and was not observing
the Norms, because of inadequate pollution treatment facilities
provided at that time, polluting the River Mini.  This mode of
disposal into River Mini is not acceptable.  The degradation caused
to the environment in the past cannot be condoned.

It is a milk
processing unit and was discharging huge quantity of effluent without
meeting the norms.  This unit is surrounded by densely populated area
and it had not provided adequate pollution control system at that
time. The Board had also initiated legal actions for the violation of
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>, 1974.  The unit has now provided
adequate pollution control systems, but earlier violation cannot be
condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_10">			 Gujarat Torrent
			Bio-tech Ltd., Vadodara
		
	

 


It is a pharmaceutical
bulk drugs manufacturing industry and was discharging large quantity
of effluent into the Effluent Channel, Vadodara, where relaxed norms
are applicable.  The industry was not meeting even the relaxed norms
in view of inadequate treatment facilities provided and operated at
that time.  It has now updated effluent treatment facilities and
shown improvement in meeting the norms.  However, the unit has caused
environmental pollution during the years under reference.

The industry was
established without the consent of the Board and was discharging
effluent on the land which caused stagnation and percolation and
deteriorated the quality of ground water.  It had violated norms of
the Board simply because no pollution control facilities were
provided at that time.  This unit has ceased production later on. 
Now, new management has taken over this industrial unit.
</p>
<p id="p_12">			 Sushma Textiles,
			Bharuch
		
	

 


This is a small scale
textile processing industry and was discharging about 8000 litres/day
of effluent without providing any treatment to its trade effluent. 
Initially it had carried out bleaching and dyeing process and
generated effluent with high pH value and high colour units without
obtaining required consent of the Board.  The Board has also
initiated legal action at that time.  It has now changed to low
pollution process but earlier violation cannot be condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	6.4	 Compensation
for Damage
 
	 
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 
							 


							All the six
							units, have caused significant environmental pollution ? 
							degradation, and therefore these units must compensate for
							such damage on the accepted principle ?SPolluter Pays??.  In
							the absence of the feasibility of quantification of the damage
							to the environment by each unit, during the period under
							reference separately, the Committee considers that the damage
							and degradation to the environment by each industrial unit can
							be based on the quantity of the industrial waste water
							discharged by the unit and characteristics of the effluent
							violating the norms prescribed by the GPCB and other factors
							discussed earlier.  In the absence of any other method, the
							degradation of the environment by each unit can quite
							reasonably be linked to the production capacity ?  turnover
							of the unit during the period under reference and the
							percentage of the said turnover which could be levied from the
							industrial unit towards fine for damaging the environment. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">The Committee
therefore recommends that all the units under reference should pay
the compensation based on the yearly production capacity ?  turnover
during the period under reference causing environmental pollution ? 
degradation.??
</p>
<p id="p_15">	Learned
counsel appearing  for the petitioners has submitted that the Expert
Committee Report could not specifically indicate as to what extent
actual damage to the environment is being caused by the Industries in
question, and therefore, it may not be appropriate for this Court to
award compensation at the rate of 1% of the turnover, as it is not an
appropriate formula. He, therefore, submits that the Report cannot be
accepted as it is.    
</p>
<p id="p_16">	Considering
the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel it appropriate to
direct the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to examine the
issue as to whether the industries in question are complying with the
required standards set out by the GPCB, and whether they are causing
any pollution and resultant damage to the environment. The GPCB shall
conduct on the spot inspection of all the units in question and
submit a report within a month from today.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	Post
this matter on 20th October, 2008.
