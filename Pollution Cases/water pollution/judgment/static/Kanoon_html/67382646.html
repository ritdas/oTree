                             JUDGEMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">(Judgement delivered by bench)

      This appeal has arisen from an order dated 17.8.2012 passed by the
Karnataka State Appellate Authority, Bangalore (hereinafter referred to as Appellate
Authority) under Water and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>s, 1974 and
1981, respectively, whereby the Appeal Nos. 01 of 2012 and 05 of 2012 were
dismissed by a common order.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2) Short facts necessary for the disposal of the appeal can be stated thus:
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3) The 1st appellant is a society registered in 1987 under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_2">Societies
Registration Act</a> whose members are residents of Nandikur and other neighbouring
villages in the district of Udupi. The society has evinced interest to protect the
villages from the activities of Government and private agencies for exploitation of
environment. The 2nd to 5th appellants are residents of villages neighbouring to the
Udupi Thermal Power Plant. Despite violation and grave impacts of Udupi Thermal
Power Plant which adversely affected the livelihood and human health, the 1st
respondent Board granted consent order on 19.12.2011 without considering the
damages already caused and also not providing mitigating measures to control or to
prevent pollution to air and water. The Udupi Thermal Power Plant began its
operations in May 2010. The 1st respondent issued number of notices and objections
to the 2nd respondent. Following number of inspections and reports, personal
hearings were held on different dates. Despite the complaints with regard to the
grave damages caused by the 2nd respondent, a combined consent was granted by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            3</span>


the 1st respondent to the 2nd respondent on 9th December 2011. This combined
consent order was challenged by the appellants before the said Appellate Authority
in appeal Nos. 1 and 5 of 2012 which was dismissed by the Appellate Authority by a
common order dated 17.8.2012 and the same is the subject matter of this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4) Advancing the arguments on behalf of the appellants, the learned counsel
Shri T. Mohan would submit that the Appellate Authority has erroneously dismissed
the appeal on the ground that the same was not maintainable. The said finding that
the appellants were not aggrieved persons is perverse and based on flawed
interpretation of the statutes. The 1st respondent is an organisation of persons
affected by the Udupi Thermal Power Plant and has been highlighting the adverse
impact of the project and has also filed a Writ Petition challenging the project on
various grounds. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th appellants living in the locality were victims
of large scale damage to the agricultural lands, surface water, wells in particular,
environment in general and the health of the people. Hence under the
circumstances, all the appellants have to be termed only as aggrieved persons and
they are competent to prefer an appeal under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_3">Section 31</a> of Air Act and <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_4">Section 28</a> of
Water Act. The appellants made so many complaints to the 1st respondent and no
doubt they were aggrieved persons, by the action of the 1st respondent, namely the
impugned order. The Appellate Authority has erroneously held that the appellants
were not persons aggrieved. Only a person who has sought for consent from the
Board and no one else can prefer an appeal under the Acts, is only a wrong
interpretation of the said Acts. It is also not correct that the appellants were not
aggrieved persons since the provisions state that a person might prefer an appeal
within 30 days from the date of communication of the order. The consent order dated
9th December 2011 was not communicated to the appellants and hence they could
not prefer an appeal. Equally, the Appellate Authority has erroneously relied upon
the Form No. 7 of the Karnataka (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules 1983 to
sustain its above interpretation. The Appellate Authority has not considered the
judgements relied on by the appellants to the effect that the expression "aggrieved
person" includes any person affected by the order apart from the appellants who
sought for the consent order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5) The learned counsel for appellants would further urge that the Appellate
Authority has erroneously relied upon the judgements which were not applicable to
the facts and circumstances of the case. The findings of the Appellate Authority that
the person aggrieved can only be the one who sought consent is unsustainable
since the very object of the Act is to serve the public interest by preventing pollution
and thus the persons who are affected are certainly entitled to prefer appeals before
the Appellate Authority. The phrase "persons aggrieved" in environmental statutes
should give a purposive and liberal interpretation. The denial of rights to file an
appeal for the appellants would virtually defeat the legitimate intents of the
enactment. The impugned order was not in consonance with the principles of natural
justice since it has held that the affected people did not have the right to appeal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           4</span>


though the impact of pollution was clear and evident, even in the face of official
records. The conclusion taken by the Appellate Authority that an appeal is a creature
of statute and that only if the statute expressly gives a person a right to appeal, he
alone can do so and not others, though affected is thoroughly erroneous. In the
instant case, a proper, harmonious and constructive interpretation of both water and
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>s make it clear that the aggrieved person would not only include who seeks
the consent but every person affected by the grant of consent and hence the appeal
has to be allowed by setting aside the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       6) In order to strengthen his arguments, the learned counsel for appellants
relied on the following rulings:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1) The District Collector, Nellai Kattabomman Dist,
          Tiruneveli and another Vs. The Rajapalayam
         Cement and Chemicals Ltd.,
          reported in 1997 Writ L.R. P.157
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2) The Perundurai Citizens Welfare Society
         Vs. Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board
         reported in (2005) 1MLJ252

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        7) Vehemently opposing all the contentions putforth by the leaned counsel for
appellants, Shri Udaya Holla, the learned senior counsel appearing for the
Respondents would submit that the Appellate Authority was perfectly correct in
coming to the conclusion that the appellants were not aggrieved persons who could
prefer appeal since the provisions relating to appeal in both the enactments are clear
and unambiguous and appeal could be preferred only by the person who sought for
the consent order or the respondent Board and no one else. An appeal is a creature
of statute and hence to prefer an appeal, the statute should expressly provide a
person the right to appeal. The appellants who were not expressly provided with the
right to appeal cannot prefer an appeal. In the instant case, the appellants are
unable to point to any provision which conferred them the right to appeal against the
orders of the 1st respondent.</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">       8) Pointing to <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_6">Section 28</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974, the learned senior counsel would submit that any person aggrieved by an
order made by the 1st respondent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_9">26</a> or 27 can prefer an appeal
within 30 days from the date the order is communicated to him. This would clearly
indicate the person to whom the order, which is sought to be challenged, should
have been communicated and he alone can prefer an appeal and the appellants are
third parties, who were not communicated with the orders in question and hence they
cannot call themselves as aggrieved persons. Relying on sub-<a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_10">section 4</a> of <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_11">section 28</a>
of the said Act, the learned senior counsel would argue that an opportunity of being
heard should be given only to the appellant or the State Board by the Appellate
Authority before disposing of the appeal and to no one else. The appeal provisions
under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_12">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 stands
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             5</span>


pari materia with the appeal provisions in the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The learned senior counsel pointed out that even the reading of
form No. 7 of the Karnataka (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules 1983 would
show that the appellant who comes before an authority in the appeal should be the
person who has been granted consent under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_15">Section 25</a> and not any other person
and the rules make it clear that the appellant should be a person aggrieved by the
order made by the Board under <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_16">Section 20</a>, <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_17">21</a> or 22 of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Air Act</a>. Thus, the
appellant cannot have an inherent right of appeal from the impugned order unless an
appeal is expressly provided for by the concerned enactment. If the contention of the
appellant that an appeal can be preferred by any person calling himself an
aggrieved person, there would be all possibilities of black mailing the industry by
threatening to prefer an appeal against the order of consent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       9) The contention put forth by the learned counsel for appellant that any
person in whose favour the consent order is made will not come forward to prefer an
appeal has to be rejected for the reason that in any given case the consent order is
given stipulating conditions to be fulfilled by the proponent and if aggrieved, he could
prefer an appeal challenging the imposing of such conditions. It is not that the
appellant has got no alternative remedy if aggrieved by an order of consent given to
the 2nd respondent. He could well make a revision application under <a href="/doc/423562/" id="a_19">Section 29</a> of
the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 or under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_21">Section 31A</a> of
the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The <a href="/doc/159582911/" id="a_23">sections 29</a> and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_24">31A</a> of
the respective Acts above make it clear that when any person is aggrieved by an
order made under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_25">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_26">26</a> or 27 of the Board, he can make revision
application and the State Government should not pass an order without affording a
reasonable opportunity of being heard to the State Board and the person who sought
to be affected by such an order. Thus, there could not be any impediment for making
application under the revisional provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        10) It is true that the appellants attempted to raise questions with regard to the
validity of the consent order and so long as the right to appeal is not specifically
provided, the appellant could not make an appeal and the Appellate Authority is
correct in dismissing the appeal and hence the impugned judgement of the Appellate
forum has got to be sustained.
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      12) The questions that arise now for consideration are:</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">        i) Is the appeal made in appeal Nos. 1 and 5 of 2012 by the appellants
against the combined consent order of the Board issued by the 1st respondent
before the Appellate Authority is maintainable? and

</p><p id="p_12">      (ii) To what relief the appellants are entitled for?
</p>
<p id="p_13">        13) Admittedly, the appellants herein challenged before the authority below a
combined consent order dated 9.12.2011 granted by the 1st respondent to the 2nd
respondent under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_27">Water Act</a> 1974 and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_28">Air Act</a> 1981 for the coal based Udupi
Thermal Power Plant Unit No. I at Yellur with ash dumping at Santhur in Udupi
District, in appeal Nos. 1 and 5 of 2012, whereby the Appellate Authority dismissed
the appeals on the ground of maintainability. Hence the legality or otherwise of the
combined consent order on merits does not arise for consideration in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      14) The Tribunal paid its anxious consideration on the submissions made by
the counsel on either side on the maintainability of the appeals made before the
Appellate Authority as recorded above.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       15) At the outset, it would be more appropriate to reproduce the relevant
provisions in the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_16"> <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_29">Section 28</a> of the Water Act states as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_17">      (1) Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Board
          under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_30">section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_31">section 26</a> or <a href="/doc/30564828/" id="a_32">section 27</a> may, within thirty
          days from the date on which the order is communicated to
          him, prefer an appeal to such authority (hereinafter referred to
          as the Appellate Authority) as the State Government may
          think fit to constitute:

           Appellate Authority, shall, after giving the appellant and the
           State Board an opportunity of being heard, dispose of the
           appeal as expeditiously as possible.
</p>
<p id="p_19"> <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_33">Section 31</a> of the Air Act states as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_20">       (1) Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Board
           under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_34">section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_35">section 26</a> or <a href="/doc/30564828/" id="a_36">section 27</a> may, within thirty
           days from the date on which the order is communicated to

           State Board an opportunity of being heard, dispose of the
           appeal as expeditiously as possible.
</p>
<p id="p_22">       16) As seen above, the authority below has dismissed the appeal as not
maintainable since the appellants were not persons aggrieved as envisaged under
the above provisions. The conclusion arrived at by the Appellate Authority that the
appeals can only be preferred by the persons who have sought for the consent of the
respondent Board cannot stand the scrutiny of law. In a given case, when the
proponent applied for grant of consent order, if denied or granted, then there is no
need for the Board to prefer an appeal. The proponent who sought for the consent
order for a project can maintain an appeal if there was a denial or he could challenge
the conditions stipulated along with the consent order granted to him. Needless to
say that if he is satisfied with the grant of the consent along with the conditions
stipulated, there is no need to prefer an appeal. It is pertinent to point out that the
words employed in both the provisions of the Acts speaking of appeal by any person
aggrieved will make it abundantly clear that not only the proponent who is aggrieved
over the denial of grant or the stipulation of conditions but also any person aggrieved
over the grant of such consent orders. If, really the intention of the Legislature was to
give right of appeal only to the proponent or applicant, the necessary words to that
effect could have been employed, but it is not done so. The contention putforth by
the learned senior counsel for the respondent that the appeal should be preferred
within 30 days from the date on which the order was communicated to him and the
appellant should be given an opportunity of being heard as per <a href="/doc/80084128/" id="a_37">section 28</a> (4) and
<a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_38">section 31</a> (4) of the relevant Acts before disposal of the appeal cannot be
countenanced for the simple reason that, when an order is made by the Board on an
application made by the proponent for the grant of consent order, the order made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                          8</span>


thereon cannot but be communicated only to him and equally sub-<a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_39">section 4</a>
mandates that an opportunity should be given to the appellant who prefers an appeal
being aggrieved by the order of the Board.

<p id="p_23">       17) A Green Bench of the Madras High Court consisting of Hon'ble Chief
Justice and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Raju in the matter of the District Collector, Nellai
Kattabomman Dist, Tiruneveli and another Vs. The Rajapalayam Cement and
Chemicals Ltd., reported in 1997 Writ L.R. P.157 had an occasion to consider the
interpretations of the phrase any person aggrieved in <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_40">section 28</a> of the Water Act
1974 had held "any person aggrieved" would include objectors. Paragraph 14 of the
said judgement reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             "14. In this background when the fourth respondent
      preferred an appeal before the Appellate Authority, we shall have
      to consider whether the Appellate Authority, in the light of the
      provisions contained in S.28 of the Act was required to accord
      an opportunity of hearing. We have already indicated that the
      petitioner, who represents the interest of the villagers of the
      villages, surrounding the cement factory, cannot be held to be a
      person, having no interest in the proceeding. That being so, the
      Appellate Authority ought to have given an opportunity to the
      petitioner. We may also approach this issue from another angle.
      S. 28(4) of the Act provides that on receipt of an appeal preferred
      under sub-section (1), the Appellate Authority, shall after giving
      the appellant and the State Board an opportunity of being heard,
      dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible. Sub Sec (1)
      of S.28 of the Act provides that any person aggrieved by an order
      made by the State Board under S.25, S.26 or S.27 may within
      thirty days from the date on which the order is communicated to
      him, prefer an appeal to such authority. In the event the
      Application seeking for consent is rejected, applicant will be
      entitled to come up in the appeal. In the event, the Application is
      allowed and the consent is granted and if any person has
      objected to it, he cannot be considered to be the person not
      aggrieved. <a href="/doc/182088762/" id="a_41">Section 28(1)</a> of the Act specifically provides that
      "any person aggrieved". If the words "any person aggrieved" are
      confined only to the appellant, who has sought for consent, there
      cannot be any other person, except the appellant. When the
      object of the Act is to subserve the public interest by preventing
      pollution and maintaining and restoring of wholesomeness of
      water, naturally persons who are going to be affected by the
      proposed industrial unit as a result of the water and air pollution
      are entitled to file their objections, as such they fall under the
      category of "any person aggrieved". Therefore, we are of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                            9</span>


       view that the words contained in sub-s(4) of the Act take into fold
       the persons who had objected and failed in the matter of grant of
       consent. The Appellate Authority ought to have issued notice to
       the appellants in W.A. 1221 of 1995 and afforded an opportunity
       of hearing. In fact, he should have made them a party to the
       appeal. Hence point No. 1 is answered in the affirmative."</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">       A reading of the above decision will make it abundantly clear that "any
aggrieved person" would include also the complainants or objectors, who were
appellants in the instant case and no impediment is felt in applying the above
decision in the present case to hold so.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      18) It is not in controversy that in the instant case the appellants had preferred
a number of representations and objections pursuant to which reports were
submitted by the authorities to the Board following their inspections. The learned
counsel for appellants took the Tribunal to different parts of the reports where the
inspecting authorities noted deficiencies and violations. Under such circumstances,
when the Board has given consent order to the proponent, the appellants are indeed
aggrieved persons and an opportunity to ventilate their grievances cannot be denied.
</p>
<p id="p_26">       19) Much reliance was placed on the findings of the Apex Court reported in
A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 520 (Vol. 41, C.N.123) in the matter of Durga Shankar Mehta Vs.
Raghuraj Singh and others and the learned senior counsel would urge an appeal is a
creature of statute and there can be no inherent right of appeal from any judgment or
determination unless an appeal is expressly provided for by the law itself. There
cannot be any quarrel on this settled proposition of law. As pointed out above, the
appellants fall within the phrase "aggrieved persons" as envisaged in <a href="/doc/80084128/" id="a_42">section 28</a> and
<a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_43">31</a> of the respective enactments.
</p>
<p id="p_27">         20) The contention put forth by the learned counsel for the respondents that
the applicants do not have statutory right to appeal and hence they can avail the
provision for making the revision under the enactments, though attractive at the first
instance, cannot be countenanced, as it does not stand the scrutiny of law. Since the
phrase "aggrieved person", would no doubt include the appellants, who were the
original complainants and the objectors, they could well maintain appeals under
appeal provision of the said enactment. The appellants, even if they file writ petition
by invoking writ jurisdiction of the High Court, they would be directed to approach the
National Green Tribunal to ventilate their grievance. The appellants, in the instance
case, cannot approach the National Green Tribunal at this stage for two reasons:
firstly, the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_44">National Green Tribunal Act</a> does not confer right on the appellants to
approach National Green Tribunal directly, if aggrieved by the consent order as done
in the instance case. Secondly, if the appellants are allowed to directly approach the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                           10</span>


National Green Tribunal, it would be allowing them to prefer appeal directly
bypassing a statutory remedy available to them before the Appellate Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_28">       20) Apart from the above, as could be seen from the report, some of the
appellants are having their landed properties such as agricultural lands, wells, etc.,
near to the plant in question and had complained that there would be large scale
damages to the agricultural lands, surface water, wells in particular and the
environment in general and the health of people and if the allegations were true, they
were directly affected by the environmental pollution from the plant. The appellants
are interested persons in the environment and ecology of the area. Under these
circumstances, they can be called, no doubt, as aggrieved persons since they
apprehend danger to human lives and their properties. The Tribunal is of the view
that the person aggrieved" in environmental matters must be given a liberal
construction and it needs to be flexible. The above view is also strengthened by the
provisions of the Constitution of India in Articles 48A and 51A (g) which read thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">            "<a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_45">Article 48</a> A. Protection and improvement of environment
      and safeguarding of forests and wild life: The State shall endeavour
      to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the
      forests and wild life of the country.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15"> <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_46">Article 51A.</a>Fundamental duties: It shall be the duty of every citizen
      of India --
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">            (g)  to protect and improve the natural environment
      including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have
      compassion for living creatures;</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">         21) The reading of the above provisions would make abundantly clear that the
State should endeavour to protect and safeguard the environment and it is also the
fundamental duty of the citizen to improve natural environment which would include
fertile land and forests also. While the protection and improvement of environment is
the fundamental duty of the citizen, any person who is really aggrieved should be
allowed to agitate his grievance in order to get protection and also for the
improvement of environment. Needless to say that the statutory provisions are
always subservient to the mandate of the Constitution. Thus any person aggrieved
as occur under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_47">section 28</a> of the Water Act or <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_48">Section 31</a> of the Air Act cannot be
placed above "every citizen" as appearing in <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_49">Article 51</a> A of the Constitution of India.
In that view also, the appeals preferred by the appellants before the Appellate
Authority should have been entertained. Thus, after considering the submissions and
looking into the provision of law and also the decisions relied on by the learned
counsel of either side, the Tribunal is of the considered view that the appellants who
preferred appeals before the Appellate Authority are aggrieved persons who can
maintain appeal.

<p id="p_30">       22) In view of the above, the appeal is allowed setting aside the combined
order dated 17.08.2012 in Appeal No. 01 of 2012 and 05 of 2012 of the Karnataka
State Appellate Authority, under Water and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_50">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>s, 1974 &amp; 1981 and the matter is remanded to Appellate Authority with directions
to take the appeals on file, enquire and pass suitable order on merits and in
accordance with law. No order as to costs.
