</p><p id="p_2">1.     This is an application filed by the defendants for modification of order
dated 24.11.2011 and 22.12.2011 and for further direction that rent and
conversion charges to be paid to the plaintiff be suspended till the
applicants/defendants get license from the statutory authority.

<p id="p_3">2.      The present suit is filed by the plaintiff for declaration, permanent
injunction, recovery of possession, recovery of arrears of rent, mesne profits

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                     Page 1 of 21</span>
 Road, Najafgarh Road, Industrial Area, New Delhi-110015 measuring 700
sq. yards comprising basement, ground, first, second and third floors. As
per the plaint, the plaintiff had entered into a registered lease agreement
dated 3rd August, 2010 whereby the basement, entire ground floor, entire
first floor and 3rd floor with terrace as elaborated in the said agreement was
let out to the defendants for the purpose of running a Banquet Hall w.e.f.
1st October, 2010. As per the lease agreement, the monthly rent of
Rs.7,49,742/- and monthly sum of Rs. 1,42,500 towards annual conversion
charges plus other dues were payable to the plaintiff for demised premises.
It is stated in the plaint that on account of various reasons, the defendants
were in violation of the terms of the lease agreement. Hence, legal notice
dated 15.09.2011 was sent to the defendants stating that the lease agreement
stands cancelled on account of breach Clause „8‟of the lease agreement and
calling upon the defendants to deliver vacant physical possession of the
demised premises to the plaintiff. As defendant did not vacate, the present
Suit was filed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.     On 24.11.2011, a consent order was passed by this Court, relevant
portion of which reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "After extensive arguments, it has been agreed between the
      parties that with effect from 21st December, 2011, the defendants
      will not run or operate any banquet hall in the suit premises
      without obtaining all statutory permissions including consent
      from DPCC, licence from MCD and registration/licence under
      <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_1">Delhi Police Act</a>. It has been further agreed that the defendants
      will be at liberty to install only the effluent treatment plant on
      the roof of the third floor of the suit property without any
      hindrance from the plaintiffs. It has also been agreed that the
      defendants will pay all the arrears of rent and conversion




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                    Page 2 of 21</span>
       charges and will also issue TDS Certificates in respect of the
      income-tax already deducted by them at source within two
      weeks from today and will continue to pay an amount equivalent
      to the agreed rent and conversion charges, regularly, to the
      plaintiffs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      This consent order is being passed without prejudice to
      the respective rights and contentions of the parties. It is made
      clear that the defendants will be at liberty to resume the running
      of banquet hall, after they obtain all the statutory clearances in
      terms of this order. This order is to remain operative during
      pendency of this suit. Wherever required, the plaintiffs will give
      the requisite NOC to the defendants in order to enable them the
      statutory clearances. The plaintiffs will also provide proof of
      deposit of service tax to the defendants within two weeks. The
      defendants will furnish an undertaking to this Court today itself,
      to pay the arrears in terms of this order within two weeks
      from today."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">4.     The next material order is dated 22.12.2011 passed by this Court on
IA No. 20767/2011 which was filed by the defendants under Section 151
CPC seeking directions for depositing arrears of rent without prejudice and
for extension to run the Banquet Hall. The following order was passed.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "Vide consent order dated 24th November, 2011, it was directed
      that with effect from 21st December, 2011, the defendants would
      not run or operate any banquet hall in the suit premises without
      obtaining all statutory permissions including consent from
      DPCC, licence from MCD and registration/licence under <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_2">Delhi
      Police Act</a>. It was also agreed that the defendants would pay all
      the arrears of rent and conversion charges and would also issue
      TDS Certificates in respect of the income-tax already deducted
      by them at source within two weeks from the date of the
      order and would continue to pay an amount equivalent to the
      agreed rent and conversion charges, regularly, to the plaintiffs. A
      pay order of Rs.52,58,452/- has been handed over to the learned
      counsel for the plaintiffs today in the Court. The learned counsel




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                     Page 3 of 21</span>
       for the defendants states that the pay order covers arrears of rent
      and conversion charges upto November, 2011 and admits that
      rent and conversion charges which were payable on 2nd
      December, 2011 have not been paid. He undertakes to pay those
      charges to the plaintiffs within a week.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      The defendants are also seeking extension of time upto which
      they can run or operate the banquet hall without obtaining
      statutory permissions in terms of the consent order dated 24th
      November, 2011. The request is vehemently opposed by the
      learned counsel for the plaintiffs. The contention of the learned
      counsel for the defendants is that the defendants had made
      certain bookings which inadvertently could not be brought to the
      notice of the Court on 24th November, 2011 and the defendants
      are seeking extension of time in order to honour those bookings.
      However, the fact remains that no application was filed by
      the defendants soon after 24th November, 2011 for extension of
      time to run the bookings without statutory permissions. Since the
      request for extension of time has been opposed and running of a
      banquet hall in the suit premises would not be in conformity
      with the statutory provisions of Water(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of
      Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, Air(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution)
      Act</a>, 1981, Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act and <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_5">Delhi Police
      Act</a>, I cannot grant extension sought by the defendants.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">5.     By the present application, the defendants are seeking suspension of
rent till the applicants get the license from the statutory authority and
modification of the above orders dated 24.11.2011 and 22.12.2011 to that
extent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     It is the contention of the defendants that the property in question was
let out for running a Banquet Hall. It is stated in the application that the
defendants have applied for Health Trade License and fire NOC but the
authorities have apprised the defendants that it will take substantial time and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                     Page 4 of 21</span>
 for this reason, running of the Banquet Hall would be jeopardised and
livelihood of the defendants‟ employees would be at stake. It is stated that in
compliance of order dated 24.11.2011, the defendants are depositing the
arrears of rent and issuing the TDS certificates. It is further stated that the
defendants have already made bookings up to April 2012 for the Banquet
Hall which were made in the month of October, 2011 and when IA No.
20767/2011 was moved earlier, inadvertently the defendants did not mention
this fact. It is further stated that order dated 22.12.2011 was passed and
permission to run the Banquet Hall without necessary compliance was
denied by this Court on account of vehement opposition by the plaintiff.
Hence, it is prayed that the said orders dated 24.11.2011 and 22.12.2012 be
modified and the rent be suspended for the period Banquet Hall has not run.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.     It is noteworthy that this application was filed on 02.01.2012 but it
was lying in objection. It has been re-filed on 28.08.2012. Hence, along with
this application IA No. 16250/2012 was filed under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of the
Limitation Act for condonation of delay in re-filing of the application. It is
stated that there is a delay of 206 days and the said delay be condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.     To further buttress the contention of the defendants in this application,
an additional affidavit dated 20.09.2012 has also been filed by one of the
partners of the defendant No. 1. In the additional affidavit reliance is placed
on Clause 1 and Clause 5 of the lease deed. Clause 1 of the lease deed states
that the lessors are the absolute owners. Clause 5 states that there is no
impediment, legal or otherwise for letting the suit property. It is stated that
these clauses imply representations and undertakings of the lessor which




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                     Page 5 of 21</span>
 tantamount to representation stating that the property is fit to be used for
running a Banquet Hall,         meaning thereby that property in question was
legally and validly constructed after getting the building plans sanctioned
from Municipal Corporation of Delhi and complying with all the norms of
fire safety measures and other statutory compliances as prescribed by law. It
is stated that pursuant to the objections from the Chief Fire Officer, the
defendants called upon the plaintiffs to handover certified copy of the
sanctioned building plans as sanctioned by the MCD. It is stated that a
reminder was sent to the defendants vide letter dated 02.03.2012 calling
upon the plaintiffs to expedite giving of the sanctioned plans. Subsequent
reminders were also sent. However, the plaintiffs have never given the
sanctioned building plans on account of which the defendants could not
obtain requisite „No Objection‟ from the Fire Department. Consequently, the
Trade Health License could not be given by the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi. Hence, it is claimed that the plaintiffs miserably failed to perform
their obligations under the lease deed. It is also stated that despite directions
vide order dated 24.11.2011 of this Court, the plaintiffs failed to file the
NOC in the form of furnishing sanctioned building plans and hence, the
defendants could not get the requisite permission. Hence, it is claimed that
the Banquet Hall could not be continued resulting in huge financial loss to
the defendants and consequently, failure of the defendants to pay the
monthly rent as well as conversion charges to the plaintiffs. It is stated that
the defendants have invested huge amount of Rs. 3 crores for carrying out
renovation of the building. The closure of the Banquet Hall is directly
attributable to the inactions and deliberate omissions on the part of the
plaintiffs. It is hence stated that the defendants are entitled for directions for




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                       Page 6 of 21</span>
 suspension of rent from 1st December, 2011 onwards.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.     I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.    Learned counsel for the defendant/appellant has relied upon <a href="/doc/660882/" id="a_7">Section
108</a> (a) of the <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_8">Transfer of Property Act</a> which provides that the lessor is
bound to disclose to the lessee any material defect in the property with
reference to its intended use to submit that the fact that the plaintiffs did not
possess sanctioned build plan and completion certificate is a fact hidden
from the defendants which has resulted in the defendants suffering huge
losses. It is argued that the property, as per the lease deed was rented out for
running a banquet hall. In terms of Clauses 1 and 5 of the lease deed, the
plaintiffs were obliged to provide the necessary sanctioned plans and
completion certificates to enable the defendants to get the requisite
sanctions. Reliance is placed on letter dated 21.02.2011 issued by the
Deputy Health Officer, MCD where the MCD has informed the defendants
that for grant of health trade license, the NOC from Fire Department is
mandatory. Reliance is also placed on a letter dated 15.03.2011 from the
said Department which repeats the said contention. Reference is then made
to the letter dated 02.06.2011from the said Health Department rejecting the
request for grant of health trade license. It is argued that MCD took the step
on account of non-supply of sanctioned plans and completion certificate by
the plaintiffs. It is also argued that the plaintiffs did not let the defendants
install the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). Reliance is placed on the lease
deed which provides that the leased premises include terrace rights for
installations of generator or Effluent Treatment Plant, etc. It is stated that the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                       Page 7 of 21</span>
 plaintiffs illegally blocked the defendants from putting the said ETP.
Accordingly, legal notice dated 02.06.2011 was sent to the plaintiffs
whereby the counsel for the defendants had requested the plaintiffs to allow
his clients/defendants to install the ETP as per the lease deed failing which
the defendants would be constrained to take legal action in accordance with
law. The plaintiff is stated to have given a reply to the said legal notice dated
08.06.2011 where it is submitted that the defendant has tried to twist the
clauses of the lease agreement. It is stated that because of this conduct of the
plaintiff, the ETP could not be installed and the Statutory Authorities took
appropriate action. It is stated that on account of the said conduct of the
plaintiff, the defendant no.1 was forced to file CS(OS) 1720/2011 for
permanent and mandatory injunction against the plaintiffs. Reliance is also
placed on a show cause notice issued by the Delhi Pollution Control
Committee dated 11.02.2011 under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974. The notice stated that the defendants were discharging waste water
directly into the sewer/drain and no ETP was found installed. Reliance is
also placed on a closure notice dated 24.03.2011 passed under the said Acts
directing closure of the unit of the defendants. Direction was also issued to
NDPL and DJB to disconnect water and electricity supply. A
communication was also issued by the said DPCC to DJB and NDPL on
09.05.2011 to disconnect water and electricity supply. Learned counsel for
the defendants has also relied on the letter dated 24.01.2012 which is
attached to the additional affidavit issued by Delhi Fire Service where
various objections to the building plans have been pointed out. Reference is
also made to a letter dated 27.02.2012 where the Delhi Fire Service




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                      Page 8 of 21</span>
 demanded building plans duly approved by the MCD. Reference is made to
a letter dated 02.03.2012 written to the plaintiffs stating that for letting out
complete building plans are mandatory and the same may be provided.
Thereafter, the learned counsel submits that several reminders have been
sent to the plaintiffs but to no effect.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.    It is further argued that the plaintiffs have instead started writing to
the authorities that the defendants have been functioning from the premises
without appropriate sanctions and requesting the authorities to take action
against the defendant. Hence, it is stated that the plaintiffs were instrumental
in getting the unit of the defendants closed. On the basis of the above facts,
it is submitted that the orders dated 24.11.2011 and 22.12.2011 are liable to
be modified and the payment of rent be suspended.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.    Learned counsel for the defendants has also relied upon judgment in
the case of <a href="/doc/832385/" id="a_11">Surendra Nath Bibra vs. Stephen</a> Court Ltd., AIR 1966 SC 61,
<a href="/doc/1522525/" id="a_12">N.K. Baslas vs. Krishan Lal</a>, 1973 RLR 14 and <a href="/doc/461176/" id="a_13">Hakim Sardar Bahadur vs.
Tej Parkash Singh</a>, AIR 1962 P and H 385 to argue that the court has
power to issue direction for suspension of payment of rent.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.    Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs has on the contrary
argued that the present application is nothing but an attempt by the
defendants to wriggle out of the consent order dated 24.11.2011. He submits
that after order of this Court dated 24.11.2011, the defendants have initiated
various proceedings in none of which they got any relief. It is pointed out
that IA No. 20767/2011 was filed seeking extension of time up to which




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                     Page 9 of 21</span>
 they can run or operate the Banquet Hall without obtaining statutory
permission in terms of the consent order dated 24.11.2011. This application
was dismissed on 22.12.2011. In IA No. 20767/2011, the only contention
that was raised by the defendants was that they have applied for health trade
license and Fire NOC but that authorities have stated that it will take
substantial time and therefore this would jeopardise the running of the
Banquet Hall.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.    It is stated that against order dated 22.12.2011 an appeal being FAO
(OS) 623/2011 was filed. The said FAO (OS) was dismissed as withdrawn
on 02.01.2012 with liberty to the defendants to approach the appropriate
authorities for obtaining necessary permission. Similarly, an IA No.
584/2012 was also filed by the defendantsseeking modification of order
dated 22.12.2011 stating that order dated 24.11.2011 be modified by
granting extension of time to run the Banquet Hall up to 26.04.2012. It is
pointed out by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that even in this
application the defendants have stated that they have bookings up to April
2012. It is further stated that MCD has stated to the defendants that issuance
of license is a lengthy process and that though the applicants have submitted
"all the relevant documents required for issuance of a license" but it is a
very cumbersome process. In the application, the defendants further stated
that all the relevant documents required for issuance of the licence have
been submitted by the defendants but it is a cumbersome process. This
application was dismissed as withdrawn on the request of the defendant in
view of the order of the Division Bench dated 02.01.2010, on 13.01.2012. It
is further stated that a third application i.e. IA No. 1091/2012 was filed by




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                    Page 10 of 21</span>
 the defendants for permission to run the Banquet Hall in view of the
bookings already made. In this application, contradictory stands are taken by
the defendant. In para 4, for the first time an allegation is made that the
building plan is not submitted to the MCD as the plaintiff has failed to
supply the same. For NOC from the Fire Department it is stated that the
same could not be approved as various documents were not given by the
plaintiffs on time. In para 40, it is further stated that after getting papers
from the plaintiff, the defendant has again applied for licence which is
pending approval to run the banquet hall. It is further stated in the
application that the defendant has submitted all the relevant document
required for issuance of licence.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.    It is urged that the averments clearly show that the defendants were
fully aware of the factual situation. They have at no stage ever sought from
the plaintiffs copies of the completion certificate or sanctioned building
plans. For the first time that such demand was made was only an
afterthought with an attempt to try to wriggle out of the consent order passed
on 24.11.2011. For the first time such a request has been made much after
the order dated 24.11.2011. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs also relies
upon an application form which is placed on record by the defendants along
with the additional affidavit which is submitted by the defendant to MCD. In
the said application form in Column 12, the defendants filled the form
stating that the premises is not approved/regularised as per the building bye-
laws. This application form is dated 16.02.2010 (probably should read
16.02.2011). Relying on this, it is submitted that this unequivocally shows
that the defendants knew the exact status of the building. The present




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                    Page 11 of 21</span>
 demand for sanctioned building plans and for completion certificate etc.
which is now being raised after order dated 24.11.2011 is only an
afterthought. Learned counsel also relies upon a report regarding adequacy
of the effluent treatment plan set up by the defendant in the suit property
which is filed by the defendant which is stated to be dated 27.04.2011 where
it is stated that the defendants have set up the effluent treatment plant.
Reliance is also placed on various portions of the said report where a
submission is made that the plant is adequate and in order. On the basis of
this report, it is argued that the contention of the defendants that there was
hindrance on the part of the plaintiffs in allowing the defendants to set up
the ETP is misconceived and an erroneous argument which is contrary to the
document filed by the defendants themselves.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.    Learned counsel also relies upon the certificate issued by the
Chartered Accountant of the defendants dated 04.05.2011 which states that
the defendants have spent a sum of Rs. 35,82,700/- in renovation of the suit
premises. Hence, it is stated that the contention of the defendants in the
additional affidavit that they have spent a sum of Rs. 3 crores in renovating
the building is completely false and a mischievous argument contrary to the
documents placed on record by the defendants themselves.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.    Learned counsel has pointed out that after the lease dated 03.08.2010
between the parties, the defendants have started running the Banquet Hall in
January 2011. It was the obligation of the defendants to procure necessary
clearances. Reliance is placed on Clause „8‟ of the lease deed (internal page
No. 13) where it is categorically stated that the defendants shall not indulge




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                    Page 12 of 21</span>
 in any illegal activity which is against law. It is further stated that the
obligation of the lessors was only confined to providing an NOC to the
lessee as clearly stipulated in Clause 11 (internal page 13) of the lease deed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">18.    Reliance is also placed, apart from order of the Division Bench dated
02.01.2012, upon an order of this court dated 22.05.2013 and 12.07.2013 in
the execution petition.
</p>
<p id="p_20">19.    In rebuttal, the learned counsel for the defendants has tried to stress
that the reliance of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs on the report to state
that ETP has been installed is incorrect as this was only an attempt by the
defendants to get the necessary license. Similarly, it is pointed out that the
certificate issued by the Chartered Accountant which is relied upon by the
learned counsel for the plaintiffs is erroneous and is a document manipulated
and procured.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.    The admitted fact is that the defendants paid the arrears of rent up to
November, 2011. The premises were vacated on 19.11.2012. Hence, rental
and other dues are unpaid for the period December, 2011 to 19.11.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_22">21.    Firstly, as far as the consent order dated 24.11.2012 is concerned, this
Court while dismissing review in the execution petition on 12.07.2013 has
categorically confirmed that the order dated 24.11.2011 has to be read as a
whole and as per the order the defendants were not only to pay the arrears of
rent, conversion charges and TDS certificates but also the future rental.

<p id="p_23"> 22.    Now I come to the demand of the defendants for remission of the rent
for the period post December, 2011. The admitted fact is that till 24.11.2011,
there is no document or letter or communication placed on record whereby it
can be said that the defendants have ever demanded from the plaintiffs the
sanctioned building plans. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel
appearing for the plaintiffs, even in IA No. 20767/2011 and IA No.
584/2012 filed by the defendant, the defendants have nowhere stated that
there is default on the part of the plaintiffs. IA No. 20767/2011 is dated
20.12.2011. In this application, the defendants have pleaded that they have
applied for the health trade license and fire NOC but there is likelihood that
it will take some time. The said application further in para 9 states that
though the defendants have applied for the trade health license and fire NOC
but the same could not be approved as various documents were not given by
the plaintiffs on time. IA No. 584/2012 is dated 13th January, 2012. In this
application the defendants make a categorical averment in para 39 that they
have submitted all the relevant document required for issuance of license but
that it is a very cumbersome process. It is also stated in para 37 that after
getting the papers from the plaintiffs the defendants have again applied for
health license which is pending. There is no averment that the plaintiffs were
obliged to supply the sanctioned building plans. IA No. 1091/2012 is dated
18th January, 2012 where for the first time in para 4 a submission is made
that though the defendants have applied for license but the building plan has
not been submitted as the plaintiff despite several requests failed to supply
the same. This is very casual averment made in a small para in an
application which has 46 paras. In fact in para 40 of the application, it is
reiterated that the defendants have again applied for the trade health license




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                    Page 14 of 21</span>
 after getting the papers from the plaintiffs. Admittedly, as submitted by the
learned counsel for the plaintiff, for the first time that the defendants asked
the plaintiffs for a sanctioned building plan was as per the defendant vide
letter dated 02.03.2012 i.e much after the lease deed dated 03.08.2010 and
much after the defendant had started the banquet hall. This is also much
after the consent order passed by this Court on 24.11.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_24">23.    One also cannot help noticing the application placed on record by the
defendants along with their additional affidavit i.e., a copy of the application
to obtain trade license. Clause 12 of the said application with its answer
reads as follows:-
</p><p id="p_25">       "12. Whether the premises is approved/regularized as per the Building
       Bye-laws          No."
</p>
<p id="p_26">24.    This application is duly signed by the defendants and is dated
16.02.2010 (probably 16.02.2011). This document clearly demonstrates that
the defendants stand is false. The document clearly shows that the
defendants are fully aware of the full picture right from the beginning.
</p>
<p id="p_27">25.    Even otherwise, the submission of the defendant does not appear to be
plausible. The defendants claim themselves to be in the business of the
hospitality services and running of banquet hall and restaurants. They claim
to have taken a premises on rent at the rate of about Rs.10,00,000/- per
month and claim to have spent Rs.3 Crore on renovation of the banquet hall.
Given the experience of the defendants and the nature of the transaction, it is
difficult to believe that the defendant would not have fully satisfied
themselves about the building and various aspects before taking the said




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                     Page 15 of 21</span>
 premises on rent. Clearly, in view of the above facts, the submission of the
defendant that the defendants were misled by the plaintiff and that the
defendants were not aware that the plaintiffs do not have a sanctioned
building plan or a completion certificate appears to be a manufactured
argument only with a view to wriggle out of their liability to pay the rent.
</p>
<p id="p_28">26.    One cannot also help noticing that the defendant has filed the present
application in January 2012 and the same has been refilled after a delay of
more than 200 days. The application, for the first time, appears to have been
listed before the Court on 24.09.2012. Clearly the defendants were not
serious about this application. One cannot help feeling that this application
is only an attempt to try and delay the claim of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_29">27.      In view of the above, it is obvious that the demand for sanctioned
building plans has been raised by the defendants for the first time after the
consent order dated 24.11.2011. Clearly, this is an afterthought and the basis
of which appears to be nothing but an attempt to wriggle out of the said
consent order. Hence, the contention and submission of defendant that the
rent is liable to be suspended as the plaintiffs suppressed vital facts from the
defendant is a contention entirely without merits. The facts and documents
placed on record by the defendant do not show that the plaintiff has
suppressed material facts from the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_30">28.    The next argument of the learned counsel for the defendant relates to
interpretation of the terms of the lease deed dated 03.08.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_31">29.    Reference may be had to the clauses of the lease deed which are relied




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                      Page 16 of 21</span>
 upon by the defendants, namely, Clauses 1 and 5. The same reads as
follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "1.    That the First Party/lessors are absolute owners and have
      power and authority to lease the Second Party/lessees the demised
      premise for the purpose stated herein.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      ........
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      5.      That there is no impediment, legal or otherwise, for letting
      the scheduled demised premises."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">30.      A bare reading of the aforesaid Clauses of the lease deed does not in
any way show that the plaintiffs have in any way represented regarding the
legal status of the suit property which was being let out to the defendants.
All that Clause 1 states is that the plaintiffs are the absolute owners and
have powers to lease out the property. There is no dispute regarding title of
the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_33">31.      All that Clause 5 states is that there is no impediment on letting out
the suit premises. The absence of the sanctioned building plans as stated by
the defendants cannot be said to be an impediment for letting out the said
premises.
</p>
<p id="p_34">32.      In fact there is merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the
plaintiffs that as per the lease deed the requisite sanctions were to be
obtained from the statutory authorities by the defendant. The only obligation
of the plaintiffs was as provided in Clause „11‟ (internal page 13) of the
lease deed which reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "11. That the Lessors shall give the required N.O.Cs. to the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                      Page 17 of 21</span>
       Lessees, if required by any Government Departments i.e. by
      DDA/MCD/Excise department/sales tax Department/Fire
      department etc. The LESSEE represents and confirms that it shall
      at all times obtain and maintain all necessary permissions and
      sanctions from the concerned authorities including the Central
      and State Excise, Food Department, Police, DDA, MCD,
      Pollution department or any govt. body, so as to enable to use
      the "Demised Premises" for running Banquet Hall and that such
      permissions and sanctions shall be in full force and effect during
      the terms of this Lease Agreement and such permissions shall be
      arranged by the LESSEE himself at its own costs and expenses
      for making the use of "Demised Premised" for the banquet
      purposes."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">33.     On the contrary, the above clause clearly states that the lessees
(defendants) confirm that they will take all necessary permissions and
sanctions from the concerned authorities to enable them for running the
Banquet Hall. There is no mention of any document to be provided by the
plaintiffs. The plaintiff has to only provide an NOC. The interpretation of
the lease, as claimed by the defendant cannot be accepted. The terms of the
lease deed, as argued by the defendant, do not warrant any suspension of
rent, as claimed by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_36">34.    I will now deal with one more contention of the defendant i.e.,
regarding setting up of ETPs. It is on account of this controversy that
defendants have sent a legal notice to the plaintiffs on 02.06.2011 and on
account of the same, the defendants had filed Suit No. 1720/2011. These are
events which have taken place prior to consent order dated 24.11.2011. The
defendants were fully aware about this controversy which appears to have
been sorted out inasmuch as that is why the defendants had agreed to a




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                    Page 18 of 21</span>
 consent order dated 24.11.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_37">35.      The reliance of learned counsel for the defendant on <a href="/doc/1879190/" id="a_14">Section 108(a)</a> of
the Transfer of Property Act is also misplaced inasmuch as they have failed
to show application of said provision in the facts of this case.
</p>
<p id="p_38">36.      In view of the above, there are no grounds made out whatsoever by
the defendant for remission of rent. The present application is nothing but an
afterthought by the defendants to somehow wriggle out order dated
24.11.2011. Earlier such attempts have been struck down by the court but
this is yet another attempt of doing the needful.
</p>
<p id="p_39">37.      What cannot be ignored is that there was a relationship of lessor and
tenant      inasmuch as the defendants continued to enjoy the physical
possession of the suit property. The defendants have surrendered possession
on 19.11.2012. In case the property was of no use to the defendants, nothing
prevented the defendants to handover the possession earlier without
prejudice to their rights and contentions to claim damages from the plaintiff.
The defendants cannot continue to retain possession of the suit property and
also seek remission of rent on the ground that they were not being able to
utilize the premises on account of their inability to obtain statutory
permissions.
</p>
<p id="p_40">38.      I may refer to the judgment of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1829599/" id="a_15">Sanjay Gupta
vs. Cottage Industries Exposition Ltd</a>., 2008 (102) DRJ 234 where the
court was dealing with the same request regarding remission/suspension of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                      Page 19 of 21</span>
 arrears of rent. Though the court had accepted that in certain circumstances
rent can be suspended but the Court held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "39. In a landlord tenant dispute where their relationship is
      admitted, the obligation of the tenant to pay rent for the tenanted
      premises during the period that the tenant is in occupation of the
      premises cannot be disputed. Inherent in this admission is
      embedded an obligation to pay the rent/occupation charges,
      because the admission of the said relationship excludes a claim
      based on any other title to the property. The relationship between
      a landlord and a tenant is one where the tenant agrees to pay the
      rent/occupation charges in consideration for the right granted to
      him by the landlord to use and occupy the premises. Therefore,
      he cannot, while being in use or occupancy of the premises, not
      pay the rent/occupation charges therefore. However, the tenant
      may set up defences to justify suspension of his obligation to
      make payment of rent, of the kind raised in the present case.
      Once those defences have been considered and rejected by the
      court, it necessarily follows that the obligation of the tenant to
      pay the rent is established and the tenant holds the money due on
      account of rent on behalf of landlord."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">39.    Reference may also be had to the judgment of Supreme Court in the
case of <a href="/doc/27098883/" id="a_16">Union Carbide Corporation v. Union of India</a>, AIR 1992 SC 248,
where observations were made that a consent order is wholly dependent
upon the legal validity of the agreement on which it rests. The consent order
can be impeached only on the ground of fraud or any other grounds which
invalidates the agreement. In the present case, the defendants have failed to
establish any ground of fraud or any other ground which would justify the
invalidating of agreement in the consent order.
</p>
<p id="p_42">40.    Reliance of the learned counsel for defendants on the judgments in the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">IA No. in CS(OS)No.2400 /2011                                     Page 20 of 21</span>
 case of <a href="/doc/832385/" id="a_17">Surendra Nath Bibra vs. Stephen</a> Court Ltd., AIR 1966 SC 1361,

Tej Parkash Singh</a>, AIR 1962 PH 385 is misplaced. The Court would have
powers to remit the rent or suspend the rent in appropriate cases. On the
facts of the present case, there are no grounds for remission of rent.
