</p>
<p id="p_2">           An industry by name Canon Granites Private Limited,

Perumpilavu, Thrissur District of which one 'Mr.Simon K.Francis'

is a Director, had applied for the consent of the Pollution Control

Board (hereinafter referred to as Board)for installation of two

additional secondary Crushers. The said application was rejected

by the Board. It appears from the records that the said industry

proceeded to install the additional crushers, even though the

Board declined consent.        The Board initiated action against the

said industry. The industry approached this Court by way of Writ

Petition. The full particulars of the same may not be necessary,

except to state that by order dated 08.04.2005, this Court gave

certain directions to the Pollution Control Board to examine

whether the functioning of the above industry is causing any

pollution beyond the limits permissible under the law.              It is

alleged against one Surendren            that he demanded from the

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010

above mentioned Simon K.Francis an illegal gratification of an

amount of `15 lakhs for giving a favourable report.      The said

Simon K.Francis complained to the vigilance authorities of the

State who in turn laid a trap on 23.05.2005 at about 7.00 P.M.

and vigilance case No. 07/05 was registered, the investigation of

which was eventually entrusted to CBI by virtue of an order of

this Court dated 24.02.2006 in W.P. (C)19759 of 2005 filed by

Mr.Simon K.Francis. It appears, from the records, that the CBI

completed the investigation in the said matter and filed a final

report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1">Section 173</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code on the

file of Special Judge of CBI Court, Ernakulam, opining that the

above mentioned Surendran committed offences under <a href="/doc/1737367/" id="a_2">Sections

7</a>, <a href="/doc/1889786/" id="a_3">13</a> (2) r/w 13 (1)(d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_4">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988.

</p><p id="p_3">            2. Based on another complaint given by one

Muraleedharan, the petitioner in W.P(C) 36185 of 2007, another

vigilance case No. 21 of 2000 on the file of Vigilance Department

Kozhikkode is registered against the above mentioned Surendran

and in that case also a trap was laid and final report was filed

before   the     Enquiry    Commissioner,  Vigilance  Department,

<p id="p_4">             3. A charge memo dated 31.10.2008, came to be

issued by the State of Kerala framing certain charges against one

Mr.Jeyaprasad, who was working as the Member Secretary of the

Kerala State Pollution Control Board in connection with sordid

episode mentioned earlier. The substance of the allegation in the

charge memo is that Jeyaprasad created some false documents

with an intention to protect Surendran, who was working as

Environmental Engineer in the Pollution Control Board at Trichur,

who was facing criminal cases under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">Prevention of Corruption

Act</a> mentioned earlier. The relevant portion of the charge memo

is as follows:

         said letter in which you have falsely and with the intention to

         support the false claim of Shri Surendran and others that the

         said letter was dispatched on 28.5.2005 , put your initial and

         3.6.2005.

<p id="p_7">
         That you, Shri S.D. Jeyaprasad thereby failed to maintain

         absolute integrity and violated Rule 3 of Kerala Government

         Servants Conduct Rules, 1960".
</p>
<p id="p_8">


The Government thought it fit not to conduct any detailed enquiry

against the above mentioned Jeyaprasad with regard to the

allegation contained in the above mentioned charge memo but

decided to impose a minor penalty of censure as the same could

be imposed without resorting to a regular departmental enquiry

but by following a summary procedure contemplated under Rule

16 read with Rule 11 of the Kerala Civil Services (Classification,

Control and Appeal) Rules, 1960. In view of the decision of the

Government to impose such minor penalty, a further notice dated

14.06.2010 came to be issued to Jeyaprasad calling upon him to

explain as to why his appointment as Chairman of the Pollution

Control Board should not be terminated. Challenging the order

imposing punishment of Censure dated 24.03.2010 and notice

dated 14.06.10 Jeyaprasad filed W.P. (C) No.20211 of 2010.

</p><p id="p_9">            3A. It can be noticed from the above extract that the

allegations against Jeyaprasad are very grave in nature whatever

be the truth of the       allegations.   If the said allegations are

proved, Jeyaprasad, according to us, would be guilty of various

offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7"> the Indian Penal Code</a> such as offence under

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_8">Section 192</a> of fabricating false evidence etc.     However, in spite

of such grave allegations, the State of Kerala never thought it fit

to register any crime against said Jeyaprasad, on the other hand

rested content with initiation of a departmental proceeding of

disciplinary action, which also was closed by awarding a minor so

called punishment of Censure.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            4.   Mr.S.D.Jeyaprasad      was   working   as   Member

Secretary of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, a statutory

board constituted under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Prevention of Water Pollution Control

charge.    Subsequently, by a letter dated 27.03.2010 of the

Secretary to Government, Government of Kerala, Environment

(A) Department, the said Jeyaprasad was informed that the

Government proposes to make his tenure as the chairman of the

Pollution Control Board co-terminus with the date of his

retirement from the Board service i.e.,      31st March, 2010 and

called upon Jeyaprasad to show cause, if any, as to why such a

decision should not be taken.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            5.   Challenging      the   said communication   dated

27.3.2010, Mr.Jeyaprasad filed a Writ Petition No. 11235 of 2010.

Along with the said Writ Petition he also sought for an interim

order seeking to stay all the operations of the above mentioned

proceedings.     On 31.3.2010, an interim order as sought for by

the petitioner was granted. Subsequently, by filing I.A. 10950 of

2010, the above mentioned Jeyaprasad also sought for a positive

direction to continue him in the office of Chairman for a period of

3 years. The said prayer was rejected by this Court by order

dated 18.08.2010. Aggrieved by the said order Mr. Jeyaprasad

filed W.A. No. 1436 of 2010. By interim order dated 20.10.2010

in the above mentioned appeal, a Division Bench of this Court

ordered "stay against termination of the appellant until disposal

of the said Writ Appeal".

<p id="p_12">             6.  Two Writ Petitions, viz. W.P.(C) Nos. 36185 of

2007 and 36205 of 2007, came to be filed by two persons; (1)

Mr.Muraleedharan and (2) Mr.Simon K.Francis respectively. The

latter is the defacto complainant in Crime Nos. 21 of 2000 and 05

of 2007 registered against the above mentioned Surendran,

Environmental Engineer at Trichur on the file of the CBI.

</p><p id="p_13">             7. The two writ petitions came to be heard together

and allowed by common judgment dated 09th October, 2009 with

certain directions as follows :

Earlier of the two proceedings is a Government Order, GO(Rt)

No.22/10/Envt. by which the Government decided to award the

punishment of censure to Jayaparasad for the misconduct alleged

in the memo of charges dated 31.10.2008 referred to earlier. It

is already noticed that such a punishment was awarded following

a summary procedure contemplated under Rule 16 of the Kerala

Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1960

without a regular departmental enquiry.             The second of the

abovementioned proceedings is a show cause notice consequent

said proceedings, the Government called upon Jeyaprasad to

</p><p id="p_25">            13.    The allegations contained in the charge memo

dated 31.10.2008, if proved against Jeyaprasad, would render

Jeyaprasad guilty of an offence (fabricating false evidence) under

<a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_22">Section 192</a> of the Indian Penal Code at the least and may also

establish the commission of other offences like abetment etc. We

make it clear that we are not recording any conclusive finding

that Jeyaprasad is guilty of any such offence but only indicate

that allegations made against him, if proved, are likely to result

in such a consequence. In spite of the gravity of the allegations

the State of Kerala never thought it fit to register a crime against

Jeyaprasad much less investigate the same.

administration (in our opinion) squarely demands a proper

investigation in accordance with law into such allegations and

more particularly when the allegations are made by the State

itself in a departmental proceedings. The primary responsibility

of the State is to maintain law and order and also the

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010

constitutional obligation to provide a rational and clean

governament oblige the State to investigate allegations of

commission of crime whenever they come to the notice of the

State. The State cannot act arbitrarily by selectively applying the

law. That would be negation of the Rule of law. The background

in which the allegations of fabrication of false evidence is made

against Jeyaprasad is already noticed.      The two cases against

Surendran under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_23">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> are already

being investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment

[popularly known as Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI)]

pursuant to an order of this Court dated 24.02.2006 in W.P.(C)

No.19757 of 2005.          In the context of the said case, the

allegations against Jeyaprasad, in our opinion, may also give rise

to a charge of abetment. The State does not come forward with

any explanation as to why such allegations are never subjected to

any investigation in accordance with law. On the other hand, the

State of Kerala which had initiated a departmental proceeding

against Jeyaprasad by issuing the charge memo                dated

31.10.2008 strangely thought it fit to appoint him to be the

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010

Chairman of the Pollution Control Board by the order dated

31.08.2009 (some ten months after the initiation of the

disciplinary proceedings), without concluding the same. <a href="/doc/1001185/" id="a_24">Sections

8</a> and <a href="/doc/1556142/" id="a_25">6</a> of the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Pollution Control Act</a>s positively

disqualify persons found guilty of offences involving moral

turpitude.      The State cannot ignore the existence of such

allegations which if proved would result in the conviction of a

person for offences involving moral turpitude, while choosing

people to hold a responsible public office.   We are therefore of

the opinion that this is a fit case where the State should be

directed to register a criminal case in accordance with law on the

basis of the allegations made in the memo of charges dated

31.10.2008 framed against Jeyaprasad. We direct accordingly.

</p><p id="p_27">            15.    It is surprising to notice that while making

appointments even to Class IV posts under the State the

antecedents of the candidate are invariably verified, but in the

instant case the State chose to ignore serious allegations existing

on record      in deciding the desirability of Jeyaprasad     to a

statutory high office. The statutory authority conferred on the

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010

State to appoint members of the Pollution Control Board

necessarily implies an obligation on the part of the State to

exercise that authority in good faith and the larger public

interest. When the law prescribes definite disqualifications which

render people suffering from such disqualifications unfit to hold

public offices, the State cannot ignore the allegations which

indicate the doubtful suitability of the person who is being

considered for filling up a public office. Such conduct of the State

would not be consistent with its constitutional obligations.   It is

that failure on the part of the State which gives rise to the

present exorbitant claims of Jeyaprasad.          Our Constitution

designed with the high ideal of protecting the citizens from unfair

and arbitrary exercise of State power can also be taken

advantage of by citizens of doubtful credentials;        when the

various organs of the State wittingly or otherwise collaborate.

</p><p id="p_28">            16.    The learned counsel appearing for Jeyaprasad

very strenuously argued that though the CBI filed a charge sheet

against Surendran, it did not choose to make any indictment

against Jeyaprasad and therefore the mere allegation in the

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010

charge memo may not be used as a factor for declining the

exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

India.
</p>
<p id="p_29">            17. We regret our inability to accept the submission.

The fact that the CBI did not choose to make any indictment

against Jeyaprasad in the final report is for an obvious reason

that the case which was investigated by the CBI was a case of

definite allegations of violations of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_28">Prevention of

Corruption Act</a> against Surendran.         Such an investigation was

taken up by the CBI pursuant to an order of this Court. There

was never any occasion or authorization for the CBI to examine

the conduct of Jeyaprasad.
</p>
<p id="p_30">            18. The order of this Court entrusting investigation of

the case by the CBI against Surendran came to be passed in W.P.

(C) No.19757 of 2005 and same remained unchallenged by the

State. The circumstances under which such an order came to be

passed are explained in the common judgment dated 09.10.2009

in W.P.(C) Nos.36185/07 and 36205/07 which are the subject

matter of the appeals, viz. WA Nos.211/10 and 181/10 and the

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "Suspecting foul play by the VACB, the petitioner filed W.P.(C)

      No.19757/2005, seeking a C.B.I investigation, which was

      ordered by a Single Judge of this Court by judgment dated

      15.7.2005, which was set aside by a Division Bench, on the

      ground that the 4th respondent was not heard before passing

      that order, directing the Single Judge to hear the matter afresh.

      The writ petition again came up before another learned Single

      Judge, who by judgment dated 24.2.2006, after hearing the 4th

      respondent also, directed the C.B.I. to take over the

      investigation, accepting the contention of the petitioner that the

      investigation by the VACB is not proceeding in the right

      direction, after referring also to the fate of the earlier case

      against the 4th respondent at the hands of the VACB. Pursuant

      to the same, the C.B.I. has charge sheeted the 4th respondent,

      which case is also pending."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">            19.     The second submission made on behalf of

Jeyaprasad that a mere allegation of wrong doing cannot

disentitle him to seek the constitutional remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a>

requires an examination.          In the normal circumstances the

submission would be unexceptionable.               But the consistent

reluctance of the State in dealing with Jeyaprasad and Surendran

in accordance with law, and in fact that at every stage this Court

had to intervene to compel the State to act in accordance with

and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010

law are factors which distinguish Jeyaprasad for a separate

treatment. Apart from that the manner in which Jeyaprasad dealt

with Surendran in spite of the serious allegations against him is

also a strong factor that should weigh with the Court in deciding

whether the discretion should be exercised in his favour.        We

desist from explaining those factors for the reason that any

observation in that regard is likely to have an adverse effect on

the investigation of the crime to be registered against

Jeyaprasad. Exercising the discretion under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> in a case

with such factual background in our view is likely to promote a

misconception that the judicial branch of the Constitution is not

different from the other branches. No misconception could do

more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of law. It is

immaterial whether justice is done or not to Jeyaprasad.</blockquote><p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">            20. In the background of the facts narrated above the

question arises whether this Court should really exercise the

extraordinary jurisdiction vested in it by the Constitution under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a> to issue writs or orders in the nature of mandamus or

certiorari. It is well settled that both the writs are discretionary

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                   -:20:-</span>


in nature but not writs of right. The extraordinary jurisdiction is

created for the protection of the fundamental rights of the

subjects and to prevent the abuse of the State's power.          The

jurisdiction is to be exercised either for the enforcement of a legal

right of the subject or the enforcement of the legal obligations of

the State. Courts have recognised a number of exceptional

circumstances which justify the refusal to exercise the jurisdiction

even in those cases where there is a clearly established legal

right or obligation.
</p>
<p id="p_33">            21.     We are of the opinion that exercising the

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> in favour of a person whose

credentials to hold a public office are highly doubtful and who

would be disqualified to hold the public office in question if the

allegations made against him are investigated and proved before

a competent criminal court, would be not a sound exercise of the

discretion vested in this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_34">            22.     For the above mentioned reasons, W.P.(C)

No.20211 of 2010 is dismissed. For the same reasons, W.P.(C)

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010

No.11235 of 2010 is also dismissed.              W.A. No.1436 of 2010

which arises out of an order passed in I.A. No.10950 of 2010 in

W.P.(C) No.11235 of 2010 should naturally stand dismissed

consequent upon the dismissal of W.P.(C)No.11235 of 2010.

</p><p id="p_35">            23. We are left with W.A. Nos.211 and 181 of 2010

filed by the State of Kerala, aggrieved by certain observations

made in the judgment at paragraphs 5 and 11, which read as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">               "5. Since, the facts disclosed in these writ petitions

        point at the appalling attitude of the Government and the

        Pollution Control Board in the matter of dealing with

        allegations of corruption against an engineer in the Pollution

        Control Board Service.</blockquote><p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">               11. The whole history of the case, without doubt, is a

        standing    testimony   of   the   enormous   clout  the    4th

        respondent has in the higher echelons of power, regardless

        of political colour of the Government. The 4th respondent,

        who eminently deserves suspension for the grave offences

        he is charged with in two criminal cases, the second one

        committed after the revocation of the suspension pursuant

        to the first criminal case, had not only been not suspended,

        but was rewarded with a promotion, even contravening the

        Rules applicable.     A Government which claims to have

        declared war against corruption in the services of the State,

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                   -:22:-</span>


        vehemently defends a person who is accused of corruption,

        that too, a person who has been allegedly caught red

        handed accepting bribe and who has, unmindful of the first

        case pending against him, had got himself involved in

        another more serious case of corruption.       Government's

        stand in defending him in this case would put doubt into the

        minds of the public regarding the sincerity of the

        Government about their professed commitment to fight

        corruption, which is presently the cancer eating into the

        body of our democracy.     If their professed fight against

        corruption is not mere lip service to pull the wool over the

        eyes of the public, the Government would do well to cancel

        the promotion of the 4th respondent and place him under

        suspension, like any well-meaning Government, who have

        their priorities right."
</p>
<p id="p_38">


The above extracted observations are observations in the

judgment under appeal which is a common judgment disposing

of two writ petitions filed by two defacto complainants in the two

criminal cases registered under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_34">Prevention of

Corruption Act</a> against Surendran (the details of which are

already noticed earlier in this judgment). The grievance of the

two writ petitioners is that in spite of the fact that Surendran was

being investigated for charges under Prevention of Corruption

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                   -:23:-</span>


Act, during the pendency of such investigation though initially

Surendran was kept under suspension, the suspension was

revoked by the State Pollution Control Board and Surendran was

also granted a promotion. The petitioners therefore approached

this Court seeking directions to the Pollution Control Board to

take appropriate action against Surendran.        By the judgment

under appeal, in the abovementioned two appeals the writ

petitions were disposed of with certain directions.            The

correctness or otherwise of those directions is not the question

before us in these appeals.          For the purpose of determining

whether the observations which are the subject matter of these

appeals are justified or not, we would only state that by the

judgment under appeal, the learned Judge after elaborate

consideration of the material came to the conclusion that the

entire episode requires at least a departmental enquiry against

Surendran. It is in that background the observations made by

the learned Judge are required to be examined.           The facts

narrated above, in our opinion, clearly demonstrate a very

unsatisfactory state of affairs in the administration.      In the

W.A. Nos. 181, 211 and 1436 of 2010
and W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 &amp; 20211 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                   -:24:-</span>


circumstances we do not see any reason to interfere with the

observations made in the judgment under appeal, or we find

anything unwarranted in the said observations.          These two

appeals are therefore dismissed.
