    petitioner and Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned senior counsel

    appearing for the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and its

    authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               By the order impugned at Annexure-10 dated 29.8.2013

    passed by the Chairman, Bihar State Pollution Control Board

    (hereinafter referred to as 'the Board') in purported exercise of

    powers vested under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

    of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>') that
 Patna High Court CWJC No.11617 of 2014 dt.22-09-2017                             2




         the petitioner has been directed to close his industrial plant for non-

         compliance of the provisions of the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>'.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                     The petitioner is also aggrieved by the order passed by the

         Member Secretary of 'the Board' dated 7.2.2014, whereby he has

         rejected the application filed by the petitioner on 27.9.2013 seeking

         'Consent to Operate' under the provisions of the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>' and the

         Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter

         referred to as the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a>') inter alia, on receipt of a public

         complaint, a copy of which is impugned at Annexure 14.

</p><p id="p_13">                     The short facts leading to the matter in contest is that the

         petitioner is a proprietorship firm established in the year 1978 for

         operating Rubber Washer and Rubber Products Manufacturing Unit

         in the name of India Rubber Product Industry at Mohalla- Chalital,

         P.S. Alamganj, Patna City. The unit was subsequently shifted to

         Vishwakarma Mandir, Dadar Mandi, Patna in the year 1984 after

         seeking due permission from the District Industries Centre, Patna.

         The petitioner filed an application on 25.5.2012 under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">section 21</a> of

         the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>' and the provisions of the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Act</a>' for obtaining

         'Consent to Establish' before the respondent-Board, a copy of which

         is present at Annexure-4. It is accepting the prayer that the

         respondent Board vide order bearing Memo No.13489 dated

         8.8.2012 granted 'Consent to Establish' (NOC) to the petitioner
 Patna High Court CWJC No.11617 of 2014 dt.22-09-2017                                3




         subject to certain stipulations present in the order one of which

         required him to obtain 'Consent to Operate' under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_11">section 21</a> of the

         '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a>' prior to commissioning of the plant. The note found at the

         foot of the order also stipulated that the NOC would be valid for a

         period of six months. Meaning thereby it was valid until 8.2.2013.

</p><p id="p_14">                     It is not in dispute rather it is the admitted position that the

         petitioner did not bother to file any application under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_13">section 21</a> of

         the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a>' seeking 'Consent to Operate' and thus by virtue of the

         stipulations present in the 'Consent to Establish' order at Annexure-

         5, the permission lost its validity.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                      In the meantime, some kind of public complaint was

         received in 'the Board' complaining against the functioning of the

         petitioner-Unit without ensuring compliance of the pollution

         measures and which has led to the passing of the order dated

         29.8.2013 by the Chairman of 'the Board' under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">section 31A</a> of 'the

         <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a>', whereby the Chairman while taking notice of the fact that

         the petitioner-Unit was operating without obtaining a 'Consent-to

         Operate' from 'the Board' as required under the law, has also taken

         note of consequential penal provisions which stood attracted and

         issued restraint order against the petitioner from operating the plant

         with immediate effect.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                     It is after the order as contained in Annexure 10 was
 Patna High Court CWJC No.11617 of 2014 dt.22-09-2017                            4




         passed that the petitioner woke up from slumber to inform the

         Chairman of 'the Board' about the lapse in obtaining 'Consent to

         Operate'. In the process of rectifying the error that the petitioner

         again applied for obtaining 'Consent-to- Establish' (NOC) in terms

         of <a href="/doc/813302/" id="a_17">section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1004117/" id="a_18">26</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water Act</a>' read alongside <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_20">section 21</a> of

         'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a>', a copy of which is present at Annexure-12 and which

         was filed on 20.09.2013. Alongside the petitioner also filed an

         application for 'Consent to Operate' on 27.9.2013, a copy of which

         is present at Annexure 13. Even before the application of the

         petitioner filed before 'the Board' for obtaining 'Consent to

         Establish' could be considered and disposed of that it is proceeding

         on a public complaint that the Member Secretary of 'the Board' by

         the order impugned dated 7.2.2014 at Annexure 14 has proceeded to

         reject his application seeking 'Consent to Operate' present at

         Annexure-13 to the writ petition. It is feeling aggrieved by this

         action of the respondents that the petitioner is before this Court.

</p><p id="p_17">                     I have heard learned counsel for the parties and I have

         perused the records.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                     In so far as the order at Annexure-10 passed by the

         Chairman is concerned, no apparent infirmity can be found in view

         of the admitted circumstances where the petitioner after obtaining

         'Consent to Establish' vide Annexure 5 has failed in applying for
 Patna High Court CWJC No.11617 of 2014 dt.22-09-2017                                5




         'Consent to Operate' as per the stipulation present in the 'Consent to

         Establish' order and which position has been accepted by him vide

         his letter present at Annexure-11. The order as contained in

         Annexure-10 would confirm that it is simply on the failure of the

         petitioner to abide the stipulations present in the 'Consent to

         Establish' order present at Annexure-5 that has led to the issuance of

         the restraint order present at Annexure 10 which confirmingly does

         not require any interference at the present stage.

</p><p id="p_19">                     The issue is whether in view of the fact that the petitioner

         has filed a fresh application for 'Consent to Establish' in terms of

         the statutory provisions, a copy of which is present at Annexure-12

         and which remains pending before 'the Board' since 20.9.2013 and

         even before any order can be passed thereon, the Member Secretary

         was justified to reject the application filed by the petitioner seeking

         'Consent to Operate' present at Anenxure-13 to the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_20">                     In my opinion, the Member Secretary of 'the Board' has

         committed a serious illegality in rejecting the application of the

         petitioner seeking 'Consent to Operate' even when his application

         seeking 'Consent to Establish' remains pending before 'the Board'

         for disposal. Although it was submitted by Mr. Kishore, learned

         counsel for 'the Board' that a 'Consent to Establish' order is a one

         time exercise but this submission would have to be tested against the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.11617 of 2014 dt.22-09-2017                              6




         stipulation present at Note (3) of the 'Consent to Establish' order at

         Annexure 5 which carried a validity of 6 months.

</p><p id="p_21">                     It is further submitted by Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned

         senior counsel appearing for 'the Board' that the Member Secretary

         who passed the order at Annexure-14, is also competent to dispose

         of the application of the petitioner seeking 'Consent to Establish' at

         Annexure-12. He also informs that since there is a change in the

         office of the Member Secretary, the petitioner should have no

         apprehension on a fair disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                      Having heard learned counsel for the parties and in the

         circumstances so discussed, I am of the opinion that the applications

         of the petitioner filed for obtaining 'Consent to Establish' at

         Annexure 12 submitted on 20.9.2013 together with his application

         seeking 'Consent to Operate' filed on 27.9.2013, both required a

         disposal in accordance with law by the competent authority of 'the

         Board' but until such time that a positive decision was taken on

         those applications by the competent authority, the Member Secretary

         ought not to have entertained the public complaint to reject the

         application of the petitioner seeking 'Consent to Operate'.

</p><p id="p_23">                     For the reasons aforementioned the order dated 7.2.2014 of

         the Member Secretary of 'the Board' present at Anenxure-14 is

         patently illegal and is accordingly quashed and set aside.
         Patna High Court CWJC No.11617 of 2014 dt.22-09-2017                       7




                              The writ petition is allowed with a direction to the

                  Member-Secretary or the competent authority of 'the Board', to

                  consider the applications filed by the petitioner for obtaining

                  'Consent to Establish' present at Annexure 12 as well as his

                  application for seeking 'Consent to Operate' afresh and with an

                  independent mind without being prejudiced by the earlier order

                  passed by the predecessor in office on 7.2.2014 and dispose of the

                  same in accordance with law and with opportunity of hearing to the

                  petitioner within a period of six weeks from the date of

                  receipt/production of a copy of this judgment.
