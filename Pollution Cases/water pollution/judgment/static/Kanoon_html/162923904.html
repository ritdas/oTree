2003


Dear Sri Arun Jaitley ji,

         I have great pleasure in forwarding the 186th Report of the Law Commission on 'Proposal to
constitute Environment Courts'.

         Pursuant to the observations of the Supreme Court of India in four judgments, namely, <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_1">M.C. Mehta
vs. Union of India</a>, 1986 (2) SCC 176; Indian Council for Environmental-Legal Action Vs Union of India:
1996(3)SCC 212; A.P. Pollution Control Board Vs M.V. Nayudu:1999(2)SCC 718 and A.P. Pollution
Control Board Vs M.V. Nayudu II: 2001(2)SCC62, the Law Commission has undertaken a detailed study of
the subject of "Environmental Courts". In the 3rd of the above judgments, reference was made to the idea of
a "multi-faceted" Environmental Court with judicial and technical/scientific inputs as formulated by Lord
Woolf in England recently and to Environmental Court legislations as they exist in Australia, New Zealand
and other countries. Having regard to the complex issues of fact of science and technology which arise in
environmental litigation and in particular in the elimination of pollution in air and water, it is now
recognized in several countries that the Courts must not only consist of Judicial Members but must also
have a statutory panel of members comprising Technical or Scientific experts. We may in this context refer
to the recent Report of Dr. Malcolm Grant in UK(2000) and also to the Report of the Royal Commission
(23rd Report , March 2002).

        With Judicial and Technical inputs on the Bench, the Environmental Courts in Australia and New
Zealand function as appellate Courts against orders passed under the corresponding <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>s, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>s
and <a href="/doc/117232455/" id="a_4">Noise Act</a>s and various Environment related Acts and also have original jurisdiction. They have all the
powers of a Civil Court. Some have even powers of a Criminal Court.

          The Commission has, therefore, prepared a Report (copy enclosed) containing Chapters I to X
reviewing the Laws on "Environment Courts" in each State (or for group of States) and suggested in
Chapters IX and X that these Courts must be established to reduce the pressure and burden on the High
Courts and Supreme Court. These Courts will be Courts of fact and law, exercising all powers of a civil
court in its original jurisdiction. They will also have appellate judicial powers against orders passed by the
concerned authorities under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974; Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 with an enabling provision
that the Central Government may notify these Courts as appellate courts under other environment related
Acts as well. Such a law can be made under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_8">Art. 253</a> of the Constitution of India, read with Entry 13A of
List I of Schedule VII to give effect to decisions taken in Stockholm Conference of 1972 and Rio
Conference of 1992.

          The proposed Environment Courts at the State level will, in the Commission's view, be accessible
to citizens in each State.
                                                      3



         It has been, however, reported in the press recently that Government has taken a decision that there
will not only be regional authorities constituted under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
(for which there can be no objection) but that there will be a single appellate body (consisting inter alia, a
Supreme Court Judge) at Delhi. It is also reported that the Union Cabinet has approved this proposal.

          The Commission is of the view that if there is a single appellate authority as proposed, at Delhi, it
will be almost inaccessible to the citizens of the country in remote parts and serious issues relating to
environment will remain un-addressed since there will not be an effective right of access to Courts. The
appeal, it will be noticed, is the first opportunity for affected citizens to question decisions taken by the
authorities. Further, in the proposal of the Government, there is no provision for technical/scientific inputs
in the centralized Appellate Authority. Moreover, the proposal does not make the said Court at Delhi an
appellate authority under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Water Act</a> or <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a> but it remains an appellate authority only for purposes
of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. As at present, the appellate authorities under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a>
and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a> are government officials and there are neither Judges nor Technical personnel involved in the
decision making process under those Acts and orders passed thereunder are being questioned only under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Art. 226</a> or <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_16">Art. 32.</a> There is no reason why the appeals under these two Acts should not go before a
Judicial body within each State.

         The scheme proposed by the Law Commission in this Report, on the other hand,
         is very comprehensive. The Judicial body will be an Environment Court at State
         Level consisting of sitting/retired judges or members of the Bar with more than 20
         years standing, assisted by a statutory panel of experts in each State. It will be a
         Court of original jurisdiction on all environmental issues and also an appellate
         authority under all the three Acts, viz., <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_18">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_19">Environment
         (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and will reduce the burden of High Courts/Supreme Court.
         There will lie a further statutory appeal direct to the Supreme Court against the
         judgment of the proposed Environment Court. In our view, this scheme is
         preferable to the Government's proposal of a single appellate Court at Delhi,
         which will be beyond the reach of affected parties.
          We, therefore, request you to kindly take up the matter with the Ministry of Environment for
further discussion at your earliest, before any law is passed in this behalf.
                  With regards
                                                                                       Yours sincerely,

                                                                                        (M. Jagannadha Rao)

                                  Chapter I


                             INTRODUCTORY



      In the Judgment of the Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_22">A.P. Pollution
Control Board vs. M.V. Nayudu</a>: 1999(2) SCC 718, the Court referred to the
need for establishing Environmental Courts which would have the benefit of
expert advice from environmental scientists/technically qualified persons, as
part of the judicial process, after an elaborate discussion of the views of
jurists in various countries. In the subsequent follow-up judgment in <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_23">A.P.
Pollution Control Board vs. M.V. Nayudu</a>: 2001(2) SCC 62, the Supreme
Court, referred to the serious differences in the constitution of appellate
authorities under plenary as well as delegated legislation (the reference here
is to the appellate authorities constituted under the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_25">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981), and pointed out that except in one State where the
appellate authority was manned by a retired High Court Judge, in other
States they were manned only by bureaucrats. These appellate authorities
were not having either judicial or environment back-up on the Bench. The
Supreme Court opined that the Law Commission could therefore examine
the disparities in the constitution of these quasi- judicial bodies and suggest
a new scheme so that there could be uniformity in the structure of the quasi-
judicial bodies which supervise the orders passed by administrative or
public authorities, including orders of the Government. For instance, these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      6</span>


appellate bodies can examine the correctness of the decision of a pollution
control board to grant or refuse a no-objection certificate to an industry in
terms of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Act</a>.       Environmental Courts were advocated in two
earlier judgments also. One was <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_27">M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India</a>: 1986(2)
SCC 176 (at page 202) where the Supreme Court said that in as much as
environment cases involve assessment of scientific data, it was desirable to
set up environment courts on a regional basis with a professional Judge and
two experts, keeping in view the expertise required for such adjudication.
There should be an appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision of the
environment court. The other judgment was Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_28">Enviro-
Legal Action vs. Union of India</a>, 1996(3) SCC 212, in which the Supreme
Court observed (see p. 252) that Environmental Courts having civil and
criminal jurisdiction must be established to deal with the environmental
issues in a speedy manner.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      We may also state that the National Environmental Appellate
Authority constituted under the National Environmental Appellate
Authority Act, 1997, for the limited purpose of providing a forum to review
the administrative decisions on Environment Impact Assessment, had very
little work.     It appears that since the year 2000, no Judicial Member has
been appointed. So far as the National Environmental Tribunal Act, 1995 is
concerned, the legislation has yet to be notified despite the expiry of eight
years. Since it was enacted by Parliament, the Tribunal under the Act is yet
to be constituted. Thus, these two Tribunals are non-functional and remain
only on paper.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        7</span>
<p id="p_3">      In view of the observations of the Supreme Court in the above said
judgments, and having regard to the inadequacies of the existing appellate
authorities, - which neither contain judges nor have the assistance of experts
</p><p id="p_4">- and their limited jurisdiction, - the Commission proposed to review the
position with a view to bring uniformity in the constitution of these bodies
and the scope of their jurisdiction.       These bodies must, in our view, be
called 'Environmental Courts' and should consist of judicial members
assisted by technical experts. Our scheme as proposed in Chapter IX is that
there should be an Environmental Court in each State (or in some cases for
one or more States) which should be able to take on the burden of the
environmental cases from the High Courts and at the same time decide these
cases with the help of experts. An Environmental Court at the level of each
State is proposed so as to be accessible to the litigants in each State. The
said Court must have appellate jurisdiction over the authorities under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_29">Water
Act</a>, 1974, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_30">Air Act</a>, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_31">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.           It
is proposed that the Environment Court should exercise original as well as
appellate jurisdiction. It should be able to grant all orders which a Civil
Court could grant, including the grant of 'compensation' as visualized by
the National Environmental Tribunal Act, 1995.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The alternative suggestion for having a single appellate Court at
Delhi over the statutory authorities has not appealed to us inasmuch as
practically no person or groups of persons residing in any local area who are
aggrieved by orders of these authorities will be able to come all the way to
Delhi to raise their grievances. If the Court is a single Court in Delhi, it will
not be accessible and several environmental issues will remain stagnant,
may not be pursued and will remain unadjudicated by a Court of law.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         8</span>
<p id="p_6">Access to justice, particularly, in matters relating to environment, is an
essential facet of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_32">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. The proposals for
constitution of Environmental Court is dealt with in detail in Chapter IX.
</p>
<p id="p_7">         While dealing with this subject of Environmental Courts, which is of
great importance for the millions of our country, we have to keep in mind
several aspects such as the following:
</p>
<p id="p_8">   (a)      The uncertainties of scientific conclusions and the need to provide,
            not only expert advice from the Bar but also a system of
            independent expert advice to the Bench itself.
</p><p id="p_9">   (b)      The present inadequacy of the knowledge of Judges on the
            scientific and technical aspects of environmental issues, such as,
            whether the levels of pollution in a local area are within
            permissible limits or whether higher standards of permissible
            limits of pollution require to be set up.
</p><p id="p_10">   (c)      The need to maintain a proper balance between sustainable
            development and control/regulation of pollution by industries.
</p><p id="p_11">   (d)      The need to strike a balance between closure of polluting
            industries and reducing or avoiding unemployment or loss of
            livelihood.
</p><p id="p_12">   (e)      The need to make a final appellate view at the level of each State
            on decisions regarding 'environmental impact assessment'.
</p><p id="p_13">   (f)      The need to develop a jurisprudence in this branch of law which is
            also in accord with scientific, technological developments and
            international treaties, conventions or decisions.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      9</span>
<p id="p_14">(g)      To achieve the objectives of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_33">Art. 21</a><a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_34">, 47</a><a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_35">, 48A</a> and <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_36">51A(g)</a> of the
         Constitution of India by means of a fair, fast and satisfactory
         judicial procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      In this context, several important questions arise for consideration:
</p>
<p id="p_16">(a)      In as much as the proposed changes in law, in some respects, (like
         water) relate to entries in List II of the VII Schedule to the
         Constitution, can Parliament enact a law under Art 253 of the
         Constitution for constituting Environmental Courts both in the
         States as well as the Centre, without the need for legislation by
         States or even resolutions of State legislatures under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_37">Art. 252?</a>
</p><p id="p_17">(b)      Should there be one Environment Court in each State?
</p><p id="p_18">(c)      Should these Courts oust the jurisdiction of the High
         Courts/Supreme Court or should it be left to the discretion of these
         superior Courts to direct parties to first exhaust (seek) the effective
         alternative remedy before the proposed Environmental Courts?
         Should the jurisdiction of normal civil and criminal courts be
         totally ousted?
</p><p id="p_19">(d)      Is there need for a further Environmental Appellate Court at Delhi
         exercising jurisdiction over the State Environmental Courts or
         should there be a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from the
         State Environmental Courts?
</p><p id="p_20">(e)      What should be the nature of the jurisdiction of the State
         Environmental Courts, - should it be only appellate jurisdiction
         against orders of administrative or public authorities and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     10</span>


         government but also original jurisdiction, so as to reduce the
         burden of PILs in the High Courts?
</p><p id="p_21">(f)      What should be the composition of the Courts and qualification of
         the Members?
</p><p id="p_22">(g)      What should be the procedure of these Environmental Courts?
</p><p id="p_23">(h)      Should public interest or class actions cases be allowed before the
         these Courts?
</p><p id="p_24">(i)      What relief these Courts should be able to grant - ad interim, final,
         injunctions (permanent and mandatory), appointment of receivers,
         grant of compensation/damages etc.?
</p><p id="p_25">(j)      Should they exercise civil as well as criminal jurisdiction?
</p><pre id="pre_2">(k)      What is the mode of execution of the orders?
(l)      Should the Court have power to punish wilful disobedience of its
         orders by exercising power of contempt of Court?
(m)      <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_38">Should the National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995 and the
</pre><p id="p_26"> <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_39">National Environment Appellate Authority Act</a>, 1997 be repealed
         and powers and jurisdiction of the tribunals thereunder be vested
         in the proposed State Environmental Courts?
</p>
<p id="p_27">      These and various other aspects concerning Environmental Courts are
      proposed to be discussed in the following Chapters.

            UNCERTAINTY OF SCIENCE AND PROBLEMS OF
                        ENVIRONMENTAL COURTS


      While the advances in science and technology in the last few decades
have been extraordinary, the fact remains that in certain areas concerning
environment, where the data play a crucial role, results of experiments
conducted by scientific institutions have remained tentative. The results are
accurate in proportion to the accuracy of data and to the extent that
experiment by use of technology has been able to eliminate all chances of
inaccurate conclusions. In a recent book, it is stated:

      on epidemiological studies are flawed by the scientists' inability to
      control or even accurately assess past exposure of the subjects.
      Moreover, these studies do not permit the scientists to isolate the
      effects of the substance of concern. The latency period of many
      carcinogens   and     the   toxins   exacerbates   problems   of   later
      interpretation. The timing between exposure and observable effect

<p id="p_35">      From the above survey of views, it is quite clear that the opinions as
to science which may be placed before the Court keep the Judge always
guessing whether to accept the fears expressed by an affected party or to
accept the assurances given by a polluter.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      In an earlier case, namely, <a href="/doc/1305721/" id="a_40">Vincent vs. Union of India</a>: (AIR 1987 SC
</p><p id="p_37">990), a direction was sought in public interest, for banning import,
manufacture, sale and distribution of certain drugs as recommended by the
Drugs Consultative Committee. In this case the Supreme Court did not
think of referring the matter to an independent scientific body but felt
compelled to accept the Committee's Report. It said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "Having regard to the magnitude, complexity and technical nature of
      the enquiry involved in the matter and keeping in view the far-
      reaching implications of the total ban of certain medicines for which
      the petitioner has prayed, we must at the outset clearly indicate that a
      judicial proceeding of the nature initiated is not an appropriate one
      for determination of such matters."</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">      The Court felt that once the experts had approved or disapproved the
drugs, the Court will not go into the correctness of their decision.
</p>
<p id="p_39">      But, in a latter case, the Supreme Court made an effort to refer the
issues to an independent committee of experts. <a href="/doc/344886/" id="a_41">In Dr. Shivrao vs. Union of
India</a>: AIR 1988 SC 953, 7500 cartons (200 MT) of Irish Butter were
imported into India under the EEC Grants-in-Aid for Operation Flood

butter was challenged on the ground that the butter was contaminated by
nuclear fallout. The Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition relying
on the report of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, a statutory body. The
Report however referred to 'permissible limits'.       Fortunately, when the
matter came to the Supreme Court, the Court 'thought it desirable' to
appoint a committee of three experts (1) Prof. M.G.K. Menon, (2) Dr. P.K.
Iyengar and (3) G.V.K. Rao to go into the correctness of the so called
'permissible limits' and to give its report on the following question:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "Whether milk and dairy products and other food products containing
      man-made radio-nuclides within permissible levels by the Atomic
      Energy Regulatory Board on 27th August, 1987, are safe and /or,
      harmless for human consumption."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">The Committee of Experts gave a Report stating that the 'permissible limits'
laid down by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board were arrived at after due
consideration of 'ICRP limits for the General Population', that the said
Board had, in fact, allowed a further safety margin and that the levels fixed
were 'safe and harmless'. The Court accepted the Report of Experts and
confirmed the dismissal of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      In like manner, in <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_42">A.P. Pollution Control Board vs. M.V. Nayudu</a>
1999(2) SCC 718, the Court proceeded to have the claims of the party tested
by experts. There the question was whether the industry was a hazardous
one and whether, in case it became operational, the chemical ingredients
produced would sooner or later percolate into the substratum of the earth,
get mixed up with the underground waters which flow into huge lakes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                     16</span>


which are the main sources of drinking water to two metro cities. The issue
was whether the oil derivatives such as hydrogenated castor oil, 12-
hydroxystearic acid, dehydrated castor oil, methylated 12-HAS, DCO, fatty
acids and by-products like glycerine, spent bleaching earth, carbon and
spent nickel catalyst would enter the underground water streams flowing
into the water lakes. Nickel, which was part of the residue, it was common
ground, would be poisonous, if it percolated into the lakes.   The industry
filed a report of an expert which was accepted by the appellate authority
constituted under sec. 28 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_43">Water Act</a>, 1974 manned by a retired High
Court Judge. The learned Judge, basing his decision on the opinion of a
single scientist which was produced by the industry, came to the conclusion
that if the industry became operational, it would not pose any hazard to the
drinking water. This decision was affirmed by the High Court in writ
jurisdiction under Art 226 of the Constitution of India. The High Court too
simply went by the opinion of the expert scientist which was produced by
the industry. But the Supreme Court felt that the opinion of the scientist
was not tested or scrutinized by any expert body and required it to be
thoroughly examined. The Supreme Court sought expert advice from the
National Environmental Appellate Authority (NEAA), which consisted of a
retired Judge of the Supreme Court and other experts. The NEAA was
permitted to take evidence and obtain technical help from other scientific
institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_42">       The NEAA visited the site, took oral evidence, examined various
technical aspects and gave an elaborate report, containing vast scientific
data, as to why the industry should not be permitted to operate. It also
consulted the Central Ground Water Board.        The NEAA Report went
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                      17</span>


against the industry. When the matter again came before Court, the industry
relied upon an earlier order of the A.P. Pollution Control Board that the
industry could be permitted to function if certain safeguards were complied
with. The industry sought a further opportunity on this limited contention.
The Court then referred the matter to the University Department of
Chemical Technology, Bombay, to be assisted by the National Geophysical
Research Institute, Hyderabad (NGRI). This was done. The reports of these
institutions contained an exhaustive detailed discussion of the scientific data
which they freshly procured. The NGRI which is the highest scientific body
on geology examined the flow of the underground water streams, and its
final conclusion


      "from results     of   multi-parameter    investigations      (i.e. field
      investigations, hydrogeological studies, geophysical investigations,
      electric resistivity investigation, magnetic survey and tracer studies)
      carried out in the areas, is that hydraulic connectivity exists across the
      dolerite dyke located between Choudergudi and Sirsilmukhi
      facilitating the groundwater movement..... In the post-monsoon
      scenario, the groundwater table will go up and thereby may result in
      more groundwater flow across the dyke."
</p>
<p id="p_43">It stated that there was sufficient scope for poisonous residual substitutes
like nickel percolating underground and reaching the drinking water
sources. On that basis, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the
High Court and the order of the Authority given under sec. 28 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_44">Water
Act</a> and refused permission for the industry to operate. (<a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_45">A.P. Pollution
Control Board vs. M.V. Nayudu</a>: 2001(2) SCC 62). The case is a clear
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                        18</span>


example of the benefit of extensive scientific investigation. If this scientific
investigation was not done, the life of millions of citizens in the two cities
could have been endangered. The precautionary principle clearly applied
here. Because the Appellate Authority and the High Court did not have the
benefit of the opinion of any scientific bodies to test the correctness of the
report of the single scientist whose report alone was there available to the
appellate authority and the High Court, the decision went in favour of the
Industry. But, as the Supreme Court had the benefit of the Reports of these
institutions, it could arrive at a different conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_44">      As stated earlier, scientific conclusions are based on the 'data' and
'procedures' applied by the scientific institutions concerned.              The
conclusions are correct to the extent of the data available or to the extent of
the efficacy of the procedure or technology adopted for analysis. With more
data and by application of better scientific procedures, or better technology,
a more accurate conclusions can always be arrived at.
</p>
<p id="p_45">      Instead of leaving it to the discretion of the Courts to refer or not to
refer scientific issues to independent experts, we propose to provide a
statutory mechanism to provide scientific advice to the Court concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_46">      Complex issues of science and technology arise in court proceedings
concerning water and air pollution. For example, we have serious problems
of cleansing our rivers, streams and lakes, and cleansing, disposal or
recycling of waste and sewage, disposal of toxic waste, hospital waste,
nuclear waste, radio active material, removal of the effect of detergents,
waste-oils, dealing with genetically modified organisms, adverse effects of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                       19</span>


pesticides, asbestos etc. A variety of industries like steel, textiles, leather
pose different types of problems of pollution. Air pollution from industries
and from traffic today is quite grave. Then we have problems of climatic
changes, depletion of ozone etc. We have serious problems of noise both at
the work place and in residential areas. There are no proper systems for
Environment Impact Assessment. There are problems faced in the matter of
protection of forests and wild life. The list of issues is unending.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      Technical and scientific problems today arise in a variety of ways and
at various stages before the Courts. Some questions arise at the stage of
initial establishment of an industry. Other issues arise when the effluent-
prevention/cleansing mechanisms or the pollution-prevention or pollution-
reduction systems are installed by the industry. The industry would say that
these safeguards are sufficient but the Pollution Control Boards may say
that they are not sufficient. Even where both may agree that the safeguards
are sufficient, members of the public may still find water pollution or air
pollution unbearable to bear. Then the question would arise whether the
running industry has to be closed or be allowed to continue with better
safeguards.   There would be need for short-term as well as long term
remedies. The point here is that if the industry is closed, it may lead to
unemployment of hundreds of employees. It may also result in loss of
excise duty or sales tax to the Government. If the industry is to be shifted
out, land elsewhere may have to be provided, though for a price. In many
cases, the plant itself may have to be shifted. Enormous costs will be
involved. If the polluting industry is not shifted, there could be serious
danger to the health and well being of citizens in that locality. The Supreme
Court in several cases has been going into all these aspects and giving
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                      20</span>


directions for shifting of industries outside the cities, by framing schemes
for payment of compensation for workmen, and for their re-employment and
providing land for the industry elsewhere etc.


         Prevention of pollution and environmental damage is one side of the
story.    But, we cannot, at the same time, lose sight of the need for
development of our industries, irrigation and power projects. Nor can we
ignore the need to improve employment opportunities. There is also the
need for generation of revenue by way of excise duties or sales tax and
increase our exports to other countries. The Courts must therefore be able
to perform a balancing task. That cannot be done effectively, unless the
Court gets judicial as well as scientific inputs. The Courts cannot simply
close down industries based on the evidence produced by the industry
concerned


         We may here advert to another problem. There are also many who
file public interest cases (PILs) against industries as a measure of black-
mail.     There are industrialists who would think of abusing the legal
procedures for their own gain. Some polluting industries would like to
close down under Court orders and would thereby want to escape the
statutory procedures which otherwise have to be followed for "closure" of
industries as contained in the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_46">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 and want to
escape paying compensatory wages to workmen. Some others would like to
close down or dismantle the plant and sell away prime land to builders.
Some others would want concessions from government for shifting their
industries to other places. These problems which are like under-currents,
should also be taken care of by the proposed Environmental Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                      21</span>
<p id="p_48">       It is true that the High Court and Supreme Court have been taking up
these and other complex environmental issues and deciding them. But,
though they are judicial bodies, they do not have an independent statutory
panel of environmental scientists to help and advise them on a permanent
basis. They are prone to apply principles like the Wednesbury Principle and
refuse to go into the merits.   They do not also make spot inspections nor
receive oral evidence    to see for themselves the facts as they exist on
ground. On the other hand, if Environmental Courts are established in each
State, these Courts can make spot inspections and receive oral evidence.
They can receive independent advice on scientific matters by a panel of
scientists.
</p>
<p id="p_49">       These Environmental Courts need not be Courts of exclusive
jurisdiction. However, the High Courts, even if they are approached under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_47">Art. 226</a> either in individual cases or in PIL cases, where orders of
environmental authorities could be questioned, may refuse to intervene on
the ground that there is an effective alternative remedy before the specialist
Environmental Court. As of now, when we have consumer Courts at the
District and State level, the High Courts have consistently refused to
entertain writ petitions under Art 226 because parties have a remedy before
the fora established under the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_48">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986. We have
also the example of special environmental courts in Australia, New Zealand
and in some other countries and these are manned by Judges and expert
commissioners. The Royal Commission in UK is also of the view that if
environmental courts are established, the High Courts may refuse to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                       22</span>


entertain applications for judicial review on the ground that there is an
effective alternative remedy before these Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_50">      It is for the above reasons we are proposing the establishment of
separate environmental courts in each State. In Chapter IX, we propose to
give the details of the constitution, power and jurisdiction of these Courts.

  THE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE AND SURVEY OF SUPREME
       COURT'S JUDGMENTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES:
</p>
<p id="p_52">      In a very significant manner, the Supreme Court of India observed in
<a href="/doc/964102/" id="a_49">Tarun vs. Union of India</a> (AIR 1992 SC 514) in regard to the importance of
environmental issues as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "A great American Judge emphasizing the imperative issue of
      environment said that he placed Government above big business,
      individual liberty above Government and environment above all."

<p id="p_53">Such is the importance of the subject under consideration. We shall first
refer to the constitutional provisions relating to environment and then to the
judgments of the Supreme Court only to show the range of environmental
issues that are today being handled by our constitutional Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_54">Constitutional provisions:
</p>
<p id="p_55">      The Indian Constitution contains several provisions which require the
State and the citizens to protect environment. Though in the Constitution as
it stood on 26.1.1950, there was no specific provision for environmental
protection, there were other significant provisions.          The following
provisions in the Constitution as it originally stood, have a bearing on
environment:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                     24</span>

     deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure
     established by law.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     Art 42:   Provision for just and humane conditions of work and
     maternity relief: The State shall make provisions for security just and
     humane conditions of work and for maternity relief.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8"> <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_50">Art. 47 :</a> Duty of the State to raise the level of nutritional and the
     standard of living and to improve public health: The State shall
     regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living
     of its people and the improvement of public health as among its
     primary duties and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to bring
     about prohibition of the consumption for medicinal purposes of
     intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9"> <a href="/doc/9107/" id="a_51">Art. 49:</a> Protection of monuments and places and objects of national
     importance: It shall be the obligation of the State to protect every

     by or under law made by Parliament, to be of national importance,
     from spoliation, disfigurement, destruction, removal, disposal or
     export, as the case may be."</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">     The Stockholm Declaration of 1972, however, resulted in several
amendments to the Constitution.     Under the Constitution (Forty-second
Amendment) Act, 1976 (which came into force on 3.1.1977), <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_52">Art. 48A</a> was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                      25</span>


introduced in Part IV which is the chapter dealing with Directive Principles.
It read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       "<a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_53">Art. 48A.</a>      Protection and improvement of environment and
       safeguarding of forests and wild-life: The State shall endeavour to
       protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and
       wild life of the country."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_57">Art 51A(g) was brought into Part IVA of the Constitution which deals with
'Fundamental Duties'. That Article reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       "<a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_54">Art. 51A:</a> Fundamental Duties: It shall be the duty of every citizen

animals and birds were brought into the Concurrent List as entries 17A and
17B.
</p>
<p id="p_59">Judgments of the Supreme Court:
</p>
<p id="p_60">       The Supreme Court of India has made immense contribution to
environmental jurisprudence of our country. It has entertained quite a lot of
genuine public interest litigation (PIL) cases or class-action cases under Art.

<p id="p_61">32 of the Constitution. So have the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_55">Art. 226</a> of the
Constitution. These Courts have issued various directions on a number of
issues concerning environment as part of their overall writ jurisdiction and
in that context they have developed a vast environmental jurisprudence.
They have used <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_56">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution of India and expanded the
meaning of the word 'life' in that Article as including a "right to a healthy
environment".
</p>
<p id="p_62">      We shall refer to some of the important decisions of the Supreme
Court of India.
</p>
<p id="p_63">      The first case of considerable importance is the one in <a href="/doc/440471/" id="a_57">Ratlam
Municipality vs. Vardhichand</a> AIR 1980 SC 1622 where the Supreme Court
gave directions for removal of open drains and prevention of public
excretion by the nearby slum dwellers. The matter came up by way of a
criminal appeal. The Court relied upon Art 47 which is in the Part IV of the
Constitution relating to the Directive Principles.   That Article refers to
'improvement of public health'. In that judgment, the Supreme Court gave
several directions to the Ratlam Municipality for maintenance of 'public
health'. That judgment was followed in <a href="/doc/1980462/" id="a_58">B.L. Wadhera vs. Union of India</a>
AIR 1996 SC 2969 and directions were issued to the Municipal Corporation
of old Delhi and New Delhi, for removal of garbage etc.


      Long before the Court enlarged its levels of scrutiny, the Supreme
Court, in <a href="/doc/497388/" id="a_59">Sachidanand Pandey vs. State of West Bengal</a>: AIR 1987 SC
1109, laid down rules which unfortunately sound like Wednesbury rules
applied in administrative law. It said:

Litigation &amp; Entitlement Kendra vs. State of UP</a> AIR 1987 359. There the
exploitation of limestone from the Himalayas and its adverse effect on the
ecology and environment came up for consideration. The Supreme Court
stated: "Over thousands of years, man had been successfully exploiting the
ecological system for his sustenance but with the growth of population, the
demand for land has increased and forest growth has been and is being cut
down and man has started encroaching upon Nature and its assets.
Scientific developments have made it possible and convenient for man to
approach the places which were hitherto beyond his ken.                    The
consequences of such interference with ecology and environment have now

growth on the mountain range should be left uninterfered with so that there
may be sufficient quantity of rain. The top soil may be preserved without
being eroded and the natural setting of the area may remain intact. .....
tapping of (natural) resources have to be done with requisite attention and
care, so that ecology and environment may not be affected in any serious
way, (and) there may not be any depletion of the water resources and long
term planning must be undertaken to keep up the national wealth. It has
always to be remembered that these are permanent assets of mankind and
are not intended to be exhausted in one generation.... Preservation of the
environment and keeping the ecological balance unaffected is a task which
not only Governments but also every citizen must undertake. It is a social
obligation and let us remind every Indian citizen that it is his fundamental
duty as enshrined in <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_63">Art. 51A(g)</a> of the Constitution." The Supreme Court

<p id="p_71">      In 1987, the Court laid down principles of strict liability in the matter
of injury on account of use of hazardous substances. Under the rule in
Rylands vs. Fletcher (1868) LR 3 HL 330, absolute liability for negligence
could be imposed only for non-natural use of land and for 'foreseeable

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      "The traditional concept that development and ecology are opposed to
      each other is no longer acceptable. 'Sustainable Development' is the
      answer. In the international sphere, 'Sustainable Development' as a
      concept came to be known for the first time in the Stockholm
      Declaration of 1972. Thereafter, in 1987 the concept was given a
      definite shape by the World Commission on Environment and
      Development in its report called 'Our Common Future'.             The
      Commission was chaired by the then Prime Minister of Norway, Ms.
      G.H. Brundtland and     as such the report is popularly known as
      'Brundtland Report'. In 1991, the World Conservation Union, United
      Nations Environment Programme and Worldwide Fund for Nature,
      jointly came out with a document called "Caring for the Earth" which
      is a strategy for sustainable living. Finally, came the Earth Summit
      held in June 1992 at Rio which saw the largest gathering of world
      leaders ever in the history- deliberating and chalking out a blueprint
      for the survival of the planet. Among the tangible achievements of
      the Rio Conference was the signing of two Conventions, one on
      biological diversity and another on climate change.             These
      Conventions were signed by 153 nations.          The delegates also
      approved by consensus, three non-binding documents, namely, a

<p id="p_80">The Court further observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      "During the two decades from Stockholm to Rio, 'Sustainable
      Development' has come to be accepted as a viable concept to
      eradicate poverty and improve the quality of human life while living

      'Sustainable Development' as defined by the Brundtland Report
      means 'Development that meets the needs of the present without
      compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own
      needs."    We have no hesitation in holding that 'Sustainable
      Development' as a balancing concept between ecology and

deal with this case in some detail. In that case there was a final award by
the Tribunal constituted under the <a href="/doc/309835/" id="a_149">Inter-State Water Disputes Act</a>, 1956
published on 12.12.79. The Dam was to be of the height of 455 feet. The
Tribunal gave its directions regarding submergence, land acquisition and
rehabilitation of displaced persons. It stipulated that no submergence of any
area should take place unless the oustees were rehabilitated. The Tribunal
allocated the utilizable water stream to four States. The Narmada Control
Authority (NCA) was directed to be constitute for implementation of the
award. Eight years later, on 24.6.1987, the Ministry of Environment and
Forests granted 'environmental clearance' to the Sardar Sarovar Project
subject to the following conditions:
</p><p id="p_116">   1.     NCA will ensure that environmental safeguards are planned and

to stop the construction of the dam and prayed for not opening the sluices.

in May 1995 and the case was finally decided in the year 2000. (<a href="/doc/1938608/" id="a_150">Narmada
Bachao Andolan vs. Union of India</a>: 2000(10) SCC 664.            The project
involved construction of a network of over 3000 large and small dams. The
three learned Judges were unanimous that the PIL of April 1994 was belated
and could not be allowed to seek to stop the project itself. Two learned
Judges found that Environmental Impact Assessment Notification under the
Rules made under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_151">Environment (Protection Act</a>), 1986 was issued much
later on 27.1.94 and was not retrospective and applicable for the purpose of
grant of clearance by the Ministry earlier on 24.6.87. The clearance given
on 24.6.1987 in fact required that the NCA could ensure that 'environmental
safeguard measures' be taken and therefore the project did not require any
further environmental impact assessment to be done.        Adverting to the
Precautionary Principle laid down in Vellore Citizens' Welfare forum vs.
Union of India 1996(5) SCC 647 and distinguishing <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_152">A.P. Pollution Control
Board vs. M.V. Nayudu</a>: 1999(2) SCC 718, the Supreme Court said that the
Precautionary Principle and the Burden of Proof rule - (which shifted the
burden to the person or body which was interfering with the ecology, to
prove that there is no adverse impact) - would apply to a polluting project
or industry where the extent of damage likely to be inflicted, is not known.
But where the effect on ecology or environment on account of the setting up
of an industry is known, what has to be seen is whether the environment is
likely to suffer, and if so, what mitigative steps have to be taken to efface
the same.   Merely because there will be a change in the environment is no
reason to presume that there will be ecological disaster. Once the effect of
the project is known, then the principle of sustainable development would
come into play and that will ensure that mitigative steps are taken to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                      49</span>


preserve the ecological balance. Sustainable development means what type
or extent of development can take place which can be sustained by
nature/ecology with or without mitigation. In the present case, the dam is
not comparable to a nuclear establishment nor to a polluting industry. No
doubt, the construction of a dam would result in the change of environment
but it will not be correct to presume that the construction of a large dam like
this will result in an ecological disaster. India has an experience of 40 years
in construction of dams. Those projects did not lead to environmental
disasters but have resulted in upgradation of ecology. On the above
reasoning, two learned Judges (out of three) felt that inasmuch as
rehabilitation was provided by the award, there was no violation of Article
</p><p id="p_121">21. The court issued directions as to allotment of land to oustees. There was
no need to have another authority to monitor rehabilitation. The NCA could
itself do this. Its decision could be reviewed by the Review Committee.
(One of the three Judges however felt that environmental impact assessment
was necessary and the construction work should stop till such assessment
was made).

Summary
      The above judgments of the Supreme Court of India will show the
wide range of cases relating to environment which came to be decided by
the said Court from time to time. The Court has been and is still monitoring
a number of cases. It will be noted that the Court constantly referred
environmental issues to experts, and the Court has been framing schemes,
issuing directions and continuously monitoring them.          Some of these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                     53</span>


judgments of the Supreme Court were given in original writ petitions filed
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_179">Art. 32</a> while the others were decided in appeals filed under Art 136
against judgments of the High Courts rendered in writ petitions filed under
Art 226.
</p><p id="p_135">      These cases have added tremendous burden on the High Courts and
the Supreme Court. The proposal for Environmental Courts is intended to
lessen this burden, as already stated. But that as it may, the Supreme Court
has, in the various cases referred to above, laid down the basic foundation
for environmental jurisprudence in the country.

           ENVIRONMENTAL COURTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES



      We had referred to the need for establishing environmental courts in
Chapter II. In this Chapter, we shall refer to the constitution or proposals
for constitution of environmental Courts in other countries. Australia and
New Zealand have taken the lead in establishing Environmental Courts
which are manned by Judges and Commissioners. The Commissioners are
generally persons having expert knowledge in environmental matters.

and Environment Court Act 1979. (At the same time, the Environmental
Planning and Assessment Act, 1979 was also enacted.) It is a superior court
of record and is composed of Judges and nine technical and conciliation
assessors. Its jurisdiction combines appeal, judicial review and enforcement
functions in relation to environmental and planning law. Proceedings can
be commenced by anyone.
</p>
<p id="p_139">          We shall refer to the provisions of the NSW Act of 1979 in some
detail.     The broad outlines of that Act, rather than certain details, are
important for us. We find that, in certain respects, the classification of
various classes of cases and the mode prescribed for filing appeals is quite
complicated under the NSW law. We would however be only adopting the
broad scheme of the NSW Act.

New Zealand's Town and Country Planning Act, 1977 which was based on
the British Model. (A detailed account by Mr. Mark Southgate is available
from the Supplementary Memorandum published by the Royal Society (UK)
(2000) for the protection of Birds (PI. 19(a)) and is adopted hereunder (with
minor changes) in view of its precise and correct assessment of the
provisions of the New Zealand Act).

<p id="p_175">      The Environmental Court in New Zealand under the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_218">Amendment Act</a>
of 1996 is an independent specialist Court consisting of Environment
Judges (who are at the level of the District Judge) and the Environment
Commissioners (technical experts). They are appointed for a period of five
years each time by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the
Minister of Justice.   In appointing the Judges and Commissioners, the
Governor-General is to have regard to the need to ensure a mix of
knowledge and experience - including commercial and economic affairs;
local government; community affairs; planning and resource management;
heritage protection; environmental science; architecture; engineering;
minerals; and alternative disputes resolution processes.
</p>
<p id="p_176">      The Environment Court encourages mediation and arbitration and a
high proportion of cases are resolved by such agreement, usually presided
by an Environmental Commissioner alone. However, all such agreements
are not given effect unless they have been looked at by the Court, which
may alter the settlement.     Where adversarial processes do occur in the
Court, they are primarily aimed at developing high quality information to
allow the Court to reach a decision.
</p>
<p id="p_177">      The New Zealand Environment Court usually consists of one
Environmental Judge and two Commissioners, - except in enforcement
proceedings which are matters of law and are presided over by a Judge
alone. (Even under the NSW Act of 1979, enforcement is always by the
Judge or with his consent).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                      65</span>
<p id="p_178">      The New Zealand Environment Court is not bound by rules of
evidence and it is free to establish its own rules of procedure.
Consequently, the proceedings are often less formal than those in other
Courts. Lawyers do normally represent the parties but anyone may appear
in person and the Court encourages individuals and groups to represent
themselves.
</p>
<p id="p_179">      The right of appeal, on resource-consent decisions, to the
Environment Court extends to any person who makes a submission on that
consent, i.e. to third parties, and to applicants. Third parties may also apply
to the Court for an order to enforce the RMA against anyone else. The
Environmental Court decisions may be appealed to the High Court on
questions of law only.
</p>
<p id="p_180">      The Environment Court of New Zealand also hears references on
regional and district statements and plans (development plan equivalents)
and appeals from resource-consents (planning application equivalents); it
can make declarations, i.e. interpret the law; and it can enforce the RMA
through Civil or Criminal proceedings. Local authorities are obliged to
make necessary amendments in the plans to give effect to the Court's
decisions. Decisions by the Court on consents given by local authorities
can be taken afresh, after taking new evidence. The Court's duties include
avoiding, remedying or mitigating adverse effects on the environment and a
general duty to promote sustainable management, in accordance with the
RM Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                       66</span>
<p id="p_181">      Even policy judgments and decisions are the 'daily diet' of the New
Zealand Environmental Court as stated by Mr. B. Birdsong in his Oxford
Fellowship Report (1998), Auckland, on "Adjudicating sustainability (1998)
New Zealand's Environment Court and the Resource Management Act."
</p>
<p id="p_182">      On the positive side, the N.Z. Environment Court provides
environmental expertise, both legal and technical, and a track record of
environmental decision-making, in public interest. The Court has also a
duty to promote sustainable management when hearing cases afresh, as
stated in the Act. The environmental expertise would help address the need
for greater environmental expertise within the Inspectorate also in certain
planning cases.
</p>
<p id="p_183">      Another advantage is that the Court itself hears cases relating to
enforcement and views breaches of environmental legislation seriously. It
can impose and does impose significant fines. It can also hear enforcement
cases referred to it by third parties, - enforcement is not at the discretion of
the local authorities, as it is in the UK.      In fact, the criticism of the
Magistrate's Courts in UK and other Courts is that sometimes they fail to
impose appropriate punishment for breaches of planning control or
environmental legislation. The seriousness of environmental offences are
better appreciated by Environmental Courts in New Zealand.
</p>
<p id="p_184">      The NZ Act encourages alternative dispute resolution - e.g.
Mediation, conciliation or other procedures to facilitate the resolution of
disputes before the initial hearing of the case.       These provisions have
proved very successful.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                      67</span>
<p id="p_185">      However, there is some criticism of the Court's power to impose
costs against unsuccessful parties but imposition of costs is a normal feature
of litigation except where plans or policy statements or public interest is
involved. It is however pointed out by critics as to why costs could go as
high as $8,500 upto $20,000, and that for that reason threats by developers
about costs could discourage genuine objections. The criticism against
taking a vast range of evidence is not correct because the experts on the
Bench could always cut short unnecessary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_186">      The 1999 Amendments to the New Zealand Act of 1991, have been
summarized as follows: (See Angelo Rego). The Bill was aimed to address
several components of the law.         Firstly, it was designed to reduce
unnecessary delays and costs in the procedure without undermining the
objectives. Secondly, there are a number of provisions relating to heritage
and archaeology, which recognize the protection of historic heritage as a
matter of national importance and brings archaeological controls from the
NZ Historic Places Act, 1993.        In addition to this, the Bill aims at
strengthening the national environmental standards and national policy
statement provisions. The Bill introduces a new definition of 'environment'
which focuses more closely on the biophysical environment and narrows the
human element to health, safety, amenity and cultural values.
</p>
<p id="p_187">      Three other important amendments are those relating to the 'resource
consent processing', the 'direct referral to the Environmental Court' and the
'use of Environment Commissioners' to hear cases and take decisions.
These changes allow applicants to choose whether their applications will be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                      68</span>


processed by the Council or by a private consent processor and to have
complex or contentious applications referred directly to the Environmental
Court. Applicants and those who oppose applications will also be able to
choose whether they want the Council or an independent commissioner to
hear the case and make the decision. This was designed to improve the
impartiality of decision-making and remove any appearance of bias or
conflict on the part of the decision-maker.
</p>
<p id="p_188">      The NZ Bill was introduced in the House in July 1999, and the Report
of the Select Committee came on 8.5.2002, and further changes were
suggested by the Report of the Business-compliance-Costs Panel,
Government announced further changes.
</p>
<p id="p_189">      The NZ Resource Management Act, 1991 consists of 433 sections

Environment Court. Sec. 263 deals with remuneration of Environment
Commissioners and special advisors. Sec. 264 refers to Annual Report of
Registrar to be submitted to the Minister concerned in charge of Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_201">      In the NZ Act, procedure of the Environment Court is dealt with
separately. Sec. 265 refers to the sittings of the Court and its quorum.
Quorum will be one Judge and one Commissioner, except in relation to
some sections, where quorum consists of the Judge alone. The decision of
the majority of members of the Court will hold good and if there is no

appear; sec. 275 refers to appearance in person or representative, and
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_232">section 276</a> with 'Evidence'.     It states that the Court may receive any
evidence which it considers appropriate or it may call for any evidence
which it considers will assist in the making of a decision or a
recommendation and call any person before it for that purpose. The Court is
not inhibited by the principles of law about evidence that apply to judicial
proceedings. Sec. 277 states that hearings and evidence has to be public
subject to certain specific exceptions. Sec. 278 states that the Environment
Court to have powers of s District Court; sec. 279 to powers of an

</p>
<p id="p_208">      Offences are dealt with in sec. 338 to 343. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_248">Section 338</a> refers to
'offences against this Act', sec. 339 to 'Penalties' like imprisonment for 2
years or fine up to 200 thousand dollars and if the offence is a continuing
one, upto 1000 dollars per day.       Violation of some sections results in
summary convictions; sec. 339A refers to 'Protection against imprisonment
for dumping and discharges offences involving foreign ships', sec. 339B to
'additional penalty for certain offences for commercial gain' upto three
times the said gain, sec. 339C to the 'Amount of fine or other monetary
penalty recoverable by distress and sale of ship or from agent'; sec. 340
deals with 'liability of principal for acts of agents', sec. 341 refers to strict
liability and defences'.    Subsection (1) of sec. 341 states that, in any
prosecution for an offence in respect of certain sections (<a href="/doc/142112542/" id="a_249">sections 9</a>, <a href="/doc/191581930/" id="a_250">11</a>, <a href="/doc/161635250/" id="a_251">12</a>,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                      74</span>


necessary for saving or protecting life or health or preventing serious
damage to property or avoiding actual or likely adverse-effect on the
environment; and (ii) the conduct of the defendant was reasonable in the
circumstances, and (iii) the effects of the action or event were adequately
mitigated or remedied by the defendant after it had occurred or (b): the
action or event was due to an event beyond the control of the defendant -
including natural disaster, mechanical failure or sabotage and in each case
</p><p id="p_209">(i) the action or event could not reasonably have been foreseen or been
provided against by the defendant; and (ii) the effects of the action or event
were adequately mitigated or remedied by the defendant after it occurred.
Subsection (3) states that the above defences can be raised only by leave of
Court if applied for within 7 days after service or notice. Sec. 341A refers
to 'liability and defences for dumping and storage of waste or other matter'
with similar defences, sec. 341B to 'liability and defences for discharging
harmful substances'.    In the case of discharge of harmful substances,
contaminants, or water in breach of sec. 15B, it is not necessary that
defendant intended to commit the offence.          Defences, in relation to
discharges from shops are similar to those under sec. 341. Sec. 342 to 'fines
to be paid to local authority instituting prosecution'; sec. 342 refers to
'Discharge from ships' (repealed).
</p>
<p id="p_210">      Infringement offences are defined in sec. 343A. Infringement offence
means an offence specified as such in regulations made under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_255">sections 360</a>
(1)(ba). 'Infringement fee' in relation to the above offences means the
amount fixed by regulations made under sec. 300(1)(bb) as the
'infringement fee' for the offence. Sec. 343B refers to 'commission of
infringement offence' and states that any person who is alleged to have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                     75</span>


committed an infringement offence may either be proceeded against for the
offence under the Summary proceedings Act, 1957 or be served with an
infringement notice as provided in sec. 343C; sec. 343C refers to
'infringement notices' and sec. 343D refers to 'Entitlement to infringement
fees' of the local authority.
</p>
<p id="p_211">      These are basically the provisions of the Act relating to
Environmental Courts in Part 11 and 12.
</p>
<p id="p_212">      In New Zealand, the statutes which deal with environment are the
'Water and Soil Conservation Act, 1967; the Clean Air Act, 1972; the <a href="/doc/117232455/" id="a_256">Noise
Control Act</a>, 1982; Marine Farming Act, 1971; Harbour Act, 1950; Forests

      Schedule 1 deals with 'Preparation, changes and review of Policy
statement and Plans', Schedule 2 refers to 'Matters that may be provided for
in Policy statement and Plans; then comes Schedule 3; Schedule 4 with
Assessment of effects on the Environment. (Other Schedules upto 11 deal
with certain other aspects'.
</p>
<p id="p_213">      Summarising the functions of the NZ Environment Court, it is seen
that it consists of Environmental Judges, who are also District Court Judges
in office and of Environmental Commissioners. The Court has a Central
Registry at Wellington and holds sittings throughout New Zealand.
Normally, the panel will consist of one Environment Judge and two
Environment Commissioners (except where enforcement proceedings
involve questions of law). Parties before the Court are usually represented
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                     76</span>


by lawyers, but anyone may appear in person, or be represented by an agent.
The Court is not bound by the rules of evidence and the proceedings are
often less formal than the general Courts.      Most of the Court's work
involves public interest questions. The jurisdiction of the Environmental
Tribunal consists of matters arising under (1) the Resource Management
Act, (2) References about the consents of regional and district statements
and plans; and appeals arising out of applications for resource consent; (3)
The consents applied for may be for a land use, for a sub-division, a coastal
permit, a water permit or a discharge permit or a combination of these.

        Some of the issues that arise before the N.Z. Environment Court are:

<p id="p_227">      In UK, the Department of Environment was set up in Nov. 1970. The
statutes governing environment are the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981,
the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_257">Water Act</a>, 1989, the 1990 Planning Acts and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_258">Environment
Protection Act</a>, 1990 (EPA). The Town and Country Planning Act, 1990
consolidated the legislations for England and Wales and amendments were
made to the Planning and <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_259">Compensation Act</a>, 1990. The Scottish legislation
is the Town and Country Planning Act, 1997. The Scottish Environment
Protection Agency was established in 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_228">      The Environment Agency in England and Wales was established in
1996 to bring together functions previously exercised by the National
Rivers Authority (created in 1989) and Her Majesty's Department of
Pollution.   Then came the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_260">Environment Act</a>, 1995 which deals with the
Agency's powers.
</p>
<p id="p_229">      The House of Lords held in <a href="/doc/861688/" id="a_261">R vs. Secretary of State</a> for Environment,
Transport and the Regions exparte Alconbury Development Ltd. &amp; Others"
2001 UKHL 23 that the role of the Secretary of State, as both policy-maker
and a decision-maker in individual planning cases (such as call inns) was,
(when taken together with the right of Judicial review), compatible with the
requirement under the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>
<p id="p_230">      The above decision of the House of Lords (according to the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution)(23rd Report on Environmental
Planning, March 2002 para 5.33) dealt only with the position of the
Secretary of State, and recognized that planning decisions in general raise
questions of civil rights.   The judgment had significantly left open the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                      79</span>


position of planning inspectors making delegated decisions, the extent to
which third parties have rights, and the extent to which other areas of
environmental regulations are equally subject to such principles.
</p>
<p id="p_231">      The Magistrate Courts, the Crown Courts (Appellate Courts) the
Court of Criminal Appeals; the Country Court and the High Court were and
are dealing with the planning and environmental cases. It was felt that there
should be one Court or Tribunal to deal with the whole range of planning
and appeal and enforcement work, including the levy of penalties. This was
pointed out in the report 'Enforcing Planning Control' (HM SO May 1989)
by Robert Carnworth Q.C. (See "Environmental Enforcement: the need for
a Specialist Court" Journal of Planning &amp; Enforcement, 1992 p. 798).
While some of the other recommendations were accepted in bringing
forward the Planning and <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_262">Compensation Act</a>, 1991, there was no response
in regard to the need for a unified system of Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_232">      At that juncture, Lord Woolf, in his Garner lecture to U.K.E.L.A. on
the theme 'Are the Judiciary Environmentally Myopic' summed up the
problems of increasing specialization in environmental law and on the
difficulty of Courts, in their present form, moving beyond their traditional
role of detached 'Wednesbury' review. (The speech of Lord Woolf is
printed in 1992 J.E.L. Vol 4, No.1, p.) He went on to discuss the benefits of


      "...having a Tribunal with general responsibility for overseeing and
      enforcing the safeguards provided for the protection of the
      environment...The Tribunal could be granted a wider discretion to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                        80</span>


      determine its procedure so that it is able to bring to bear its specialist
      experiences of environmental issues in the most effective way."
</p>
<p id="p_233">The Tribunal, according to Lord Woolf, should have the benefit of
architects, surveyors and a 'multi-disciplined adjudicating panel' with broad
discretion over rights of appearance; power to instruct independent counsel
on behalf of the Tribunal or members of the public; resources for direct
investigation by the Tribunal itself; incorporation into the Tribunals of the
existing Inspectorate to deal with 'cases of lesser dimensions'. Lord Woolf
concluded:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">      "I hope...I have said enough...to indicate that what I am
      contemplating is not just a Court under another name, nor is it an
      existing Tribunal under another name. It is a multi-faceted and multi-
      skilled body which would combine the services provided in existing
      Courts, Tribunals and Inspectorate in the environmental field.          It
      would be a 'one stop shop' which should lead to faster, cheaper and
      the more effective resolution of disputes in the environmental area. It
      would avoid increasing the load on already overburdened lay
      institutions by trying to compel them to resolve issues with what they
      are not designed to deal. It could be a forum in which Judges could
      play a different role. A role which enabled them not to examine
      environmental problems with limited vision. It could however be
      based on our existing experience, combining the skills of the existing
      inspectorate, the lands Tribunal and other administrative bodies. It
      could be an exciting project."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                     81</span>
<p id="p_234">In the article by Robert Carnworth, Q.C., referred to earlier, the author has
dealt with the strength and weakness of the existing jurisdictions in England
in the areas of (i) enforcement procedures, (ii) the public inquiry, (iii)
judicial review and statutory appeals, (iv) local ombudsman, and (v) Lands
Tribunal and stated


      "With the impetus given by Sir Harry Woolf, there is now an
      opportunity to review the structure of the Courts and agencies
      concerned with the supervision of environmental law. Such a review
      should start by a pooling of ideas and experiences of all those
      involved in the practical working of the present system - specialist
      Judges and lawyers; the local ombudsman; the planning inspectorate,
      local authorities and other relevant public agencies; voluntary groups,
      business organizations etc. The aim should be a pragmatic evolution
      towards a logical and simplified structure, incorporating the best of
      existing practice and procedure."
</p>
<p id="p_235">Lord Woolf again, in another lecture in May 2001, suggested that there was
a case for some new form of Environment Court or Tribunal. This was in
his 'Environmental Law Foundations Prof. David Hall Medical Lecture'
while speaking on the subject 'Environmental risk: the responsibilities of
the law and science'.
</p>
<p id="p_236">      It was at that stage that a major study was undertaken by Prof.
Malcolm Grant of Cambridge in what is known as the "Environment Court
Project". The Report on the project was published on February 18, 2000. It
was prepared by the Dept. of Land Economy, University of Cambridge. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                     82</span>


project initiated and supported by the Dept. of Environment Transport and
Regions (IETR) and had the support of the Financial Management and
Performance Review of the Planning Inspectorate made in 1995-96. The
purpose of the project was to study the concept of an Environment Court in
the background of experience in other countries, such as Australia and New
Zealand. The Report identified the following ten characteristics that help
define the concept though it did not firmly recommend such a Court for UK
(see 2000 JPL p 453 'The Case for an Environmental Court'). These are:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">         (a)   a specialist and exclusive jurisdiction;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">         (b)   a power to determine merits appeals;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">         (c)   vertical and horizontal integration - (by which is meant a
               wide environmental jurisdiction which integrates both
               subject matter and different types of legal proceedings);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">         (d)   the hallmarks of a court or tribunal;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_46">         (e)   dispute resolution powers - (even disputes over the
               formulation of policy as well as a more traditional
               adjudication.);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">         (f)   expertise - (the members would be specialists in
               environmental issues);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">         (g)   access - (there would be broad rights of access to the
               Court);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">         (h)   informality of proceeding (such as use of alternative dispute
               resolution procedures);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_50">         (i)   costs (this is linked to the need for access and involves
               means of overcoming the problem of high costs inhibiting
               access); and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                       83</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">         (j)      capacity for information.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_237">Comment has been made that the above ten criteria are quite general and
that they lack clarity.    While it is true that the above criteria may be
common to several types of modern Courts or Tribunals not necessarily
dealing with 'environment', the fact remains that these general criteria are
equally suitable and applicable for Environmental Courts also.
</p>
<p id="p_238">      Prof. Malcolm Grants' Project Report published in May 2000
recommended six possible alternative arrangements ranging from a
'Planning Appeals Tribunal' to an 'Environmental Court' as a division of
the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_239">      As regards discussions within Town and Country Planning systems,
the Royal Commission no doubt stated in its 23rd Report on Environmental
Planning (March 2002) (para 5.35) that what was needed was "a system that
commands public confidence, improves consistency, is effective at reaching
decisions and is not unduly costly. Our main consideration is with merits
appeals. With the Administrative Court now established within the High
Court, we are not convinced that there is any need for a specialist
environmental court dealing with judicial review or statutory appeals on
legal grounds so far as the Town and County planning systems were
concerned.     Criminal offences concerning planning and environmental
matters are probably best left to the ordinary criminal courts, though there is
a case for improved guidance on sentencing and more training, especially
for magistrates".
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                     84</span>
<p id="p_240">      Finally, the Royal Commission recommended establishment of
Environmental Courts so far as environmental matters outside the Town and
County planning systems, for establishment of an Environmental Court, as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">      "...there is a great deal of inconsistency at present, both in whether
      there is a right of appeal on merits and in who decides any such
      appeal. Some appeals are made to the Secretary of State. Others,
      such as those concerning contaminated land or statutory nuisances,
      are made to the magistrate's Courts, which often lack the expertise to
      handle the considerable technicalities involved. In many contexts, for
      example, the granting of consents in relation to genetically modified
      organisms, there is no right of appeal on merits. Procedures have
      grown up haphazardly with no apparent underlying principle, and we
      consider they fail to provide a system appropriate for contemporary
      needs. We recommend the establishment of Environmental Tribunals
      to handle appeals under environmental legislation other than the town
      and country planning system, including those now handled by
      planning inspectors." (para 5.36)


The Royal Commission observed (para 5.37) that establishing an
Environmental Tribunal would be a significant contribution to a more
coherent and effective system of environmental regulation.         As to its
constitution, and scope of appeals from it, the Commission said:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">      "We envisage such a Tribunal would consist of a legal chairperson
      and members with appropriate specialized expertise. It would rapidly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                       85</span>


      develop the authority and understanding needed to handle complex
      environmental cases.       We envisage several tribunals would be
      established to cover England and similar tribunals for Wales,
      Scotland and Northern Ireland. On points of law, there would be
      right of appeal from the Tribunal to the High Court. Applications for
      judicial review or environmental matters would not be considered by
      the High Court unless the applicant had exhausted any remedy
      available from the Environmental Tribunal or from other sources."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">The 'alternative remedy' principle as exercised by our High Courts in India
in jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_263">Art. 226</a> is clearly accepted here.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_241">As to the jurisdiction and powers of the Environmental Courts, the Royal
Commission stated (para 5.38):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">      "The precise jurisdiction of the Environmental Tribunal would be a
      matter for government, but we have indicated in box 5B various areas
      that would be appropriate. We envisage civil litigations will continue
      to be handled by the civil courts and criminal matters by the criminal
      courts. The new Tribunals would take over such functions as the
      present jurisdiction of magistrates' courts on such subjects as
      contaminated land and statutory nuisance. Although, in general, the
      Tribunal should have the final rights of decision on appeals submitted
      to it, there may be cases of acute policy sensitivity where it ought to
      make a recommendation to the Minister rather than the final decision,
      and the Alconbury decision implies that such a mechanism would be
      consistent with the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_264">Human Rights Act</a>. It also would then be similar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                       86</span>


      to that of a planning inspector where a planning appeal is received by
      the Secretary of State. The Tribunal's main concern would be with
      appeals, but it might have some original jurisdiction, for example, in
      deciding statutory nuisance cases currently taken by complaints to a
      magistrate's court."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_242">Thus, the proposal is for the Environmental Court would have 'appellate' as
well as 'original' jurisdiction.   They would not oust the normal civil and
criminal jurisdiction of ordinary Courts but would remain special Courts for
environmental issues.
</p>
<p id="p_243">The Box 5B contains a chart at the bottom of which we have the 'New
Regional    Environmental     Tribunals'   which    will   hear   appeals    on
'environmental matters'.       These are appeals from (a) decisions of
Environmental Agencies (in respect of IPPC, discharge to water courses
waste licences etc.) (b) appeals, currently heard by magistrate's courts, from
notices served by local authorities in relation to contaminated land and
statutory nuisances, (c) designation of sites of special scientific interest and
Habitat Regulations, (d) decision of Secretary of State on licences for
genetically modified organisms and other government decisions where there
is no right of appeal at present other than by judicial review.
</p>
<p id="p_244">      In UK, the Criminal Courts would deal with environmental offences
in the same way as at present; one Court in each County might be
designated to deal with environmental offences.       The Civil Courts would
continue to deal with environmental disputes between private parties on
issues such as nuisance or negligence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                     87</span>
<p id="p_245">      The Commission went on to recommend (see para 5.39) to combine
the Environmental Tribunal with the Planning Inspectorate to establish a
'Planning and Environmental Tribunal' (on the lines of some of the options
considered by Professed Grant). That would resolve the doubts remaining
about the position of planning inspectors in relation to the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_265">Human Rights
Act</a>. It would be an advantage to have a firm institutional linkage between
the appeals system for land use and the procedures for a more specialized
environmental regulation.   Such a development, the Royal Commission
said, may come after some time. But the Commission's view was that it was
preferable for a tribunal to start by taking over and consolidating the wide
variety of other procedures for environmental regulation, rather than risk
being swamped by the much greater volume of appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_246">      As to locus standi, so far as judicial review matters are concerned,
the Royal Commission had a liberal view when it stated (see para 5.40) that
a


      "very important distinction between appeals on merits and judicial
      review is that appeals by way of judicial review are not restricted to
      the applicant. Third parties such as a neighbour or amenity groups
      may also bring judicial reviews against, say, the decision of a local
      planning authority to grant planning permission, the Environmental
      Agency to grant an IPPC licence, or the decision of the Secretary of
      State on a merits appeal. To do so, they have to satisfy the Court that
      they have 'sufficient interest'.... Contemporary practice is far more
      liberal.   Local amenity groups and national environmental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                        88</span>


        organizations have frequently been granted leave to bring judicial
        review, particularly if they made representations concerning the
        original applications."
</p>
<p id="p_247">        The Royal Commission then referred to the 1990 E.C. Directive on
the freedom of access to information on environment as implemented in
U.K. by the Environment Information Regulations 1992 and the 1998
Convention on 'Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision
Making and Access to Justice' on Environmental Matters (see paras 5.41 to
5.47) and to several aspects as to locus standi of individual and
environmental organizations in respect of planning and development as well
as environmental matters.
</p>
<p id="p_248">          U.K. has not yet established Environmental Tribunals for
environmental issues, but it appears to us that the country is in the process
of establishing such Courts soon.

<p id="p_256">      In addition, new offences are created by sections 41 to 50 (Chapter

37 to 46 (Chapter VI) of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_276">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981, <a href="/doc/1756419/" id="a_277">sections 14</a> to <a href="/doc/792919/" id="a_278">18</a> of the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991, sec. 3A,

Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; sec. 15 to 17 of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_280">Environment
(Protection) Act</a>, 1986. All these offences today go for trial before the
ordinary criminal courts. The appropriate criminal court will deal with the
matter and is identified on the basis of the territorial jurisdiction and
depending upon its power to award sentence of imprisonment to any person
for particular number of years.      The appeals on the criminal side are
governed by the laws relating to criminal procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_257">      Obviously, whether the matter is one of civil nature or criminal
nature, once it is taken cognizance by any Court subordinate to the High
Court, it will be dealt with by the said civil or criminal court along with the
other cases before it and environmental cases are not normally given any
priority in the matter of disposal. Of course, if the issue comes before the
High Court or the Supreme Court under writ jurisdiction whether the matter
is one brought by the affected party or parties or in a Public Interest
litigation, these Courts take up these matters faster but the cases are not
taken up day by day as may be done by an Environmental Court dealing
exclusively with such cases.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                                      93</span>
<p id="p_258">      What we mean to say is that none of the above Courts are courts
having exclusive jurisdiction as regards environmental issues and the result
is that there is delay in their disposal as compared to the time within which
any special Environmental Court dealing only with issues relating to
environment could have taken. It cannot be disputed that environmental
matters have to be taken up early, monitored from time to time and be
finally disposed of by a procedure quicker than that obtaining now. Further,
the Courts today lack independent expert advice on environmental matters
by a statutory panel attached to the Court and depend mostly on the expert
evidence that may be adduced by the parties. We have already pointed in
the previous chapters, the need for experts in environment to be associated
with the Courts dealing with these cases.

</p>
<p id="p_280">Summary of the appeal provisions in the above Acts and Rules (Lack of
judicial and expert inputs):
</p>
<p id="p_281">      It will be noticed that several of the special statutes e.g. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_295">Environment
(Protection) Act</a>, 1986, Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974, Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981,
delegate power to the State Governments/Union Government to designate
appellate authorities. The appeals lie generally, as can be seen from the
above paragraphs, to various officers of government or Departments of
Government. Except in one or two cases, the appeals do not lie to a judicial
body comprising a judicial officer. In no case does the appellate authority
have the assistance of experts in the field of environment.
</p>
<p id="p_282">      In the light of the discussion in the earlier chapters and experience of
establishment of Environmental Courts abroad, the Law Commission is of
the opinion that the present system is not satisfactory so far as disposal of
these appeals are concerned. The appeal is practically the first opportunity
for a party or even third parties affected by pollution, to seek relief.   In the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                      99</span>


view of the Commission, such appeals must lie to an appellate Court having
special jurisdiction and must comprise of persons who have or had judicial
qualifications or have considerable experience as lawyers. They must also
be assisted by experts in environmental science. As stated in the earlier
chapters, it is now well recognized in several countries that the appeals must
lie to Court manned by persons with judicial knowledge and experience,
assisted by experts in various aspects of environmental science.

        Two other statutory Environmental Tribunals and Defects therein


<a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_296">National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995:
</p>
<p id="p_284">        This enactment was made by Parliament, as stated in the preamble, to
provide for strict liability for damages arising out of any accident occurring
while handling any hazardous substance and for the establishment of the
Tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of cases arising from such
accidents, with a view to giving relief and compensation for damages to
person, property and the environment and for matters connected therewith
or incidental thereto. Liability under sec. 3 is to be on basis of 'no fault'
and under sec. 4 compensation is payable. Under sec. 9(1), the Tribunal
shall    consist   of   a   Chairperson    and   such   members    as     Vice-
Chairpersons/Judicial Members and Technical members as the Central
Government deems fit. It can sit in Benches but each Bench must consist of
a Judicial and Technical member. Chairman shall be person who is or has
been a Judge of the Supreme Court or High Court, or has at least been Vice-
Chairman for 2 years. A Vice-Chairman should be a person (a) who is or
has been a Judge of a High Court or was a Secretary to Government of India
for at least 2 years or has held any other post in Central or State
Government, carrying a scale of pay which is not less than that of a
Secretary to Govt. of India or (c) held post of Addl. Secretary in Govt. of
India for 5 years and has acquired knowledge of or experience in legal,
administrative, scientific or technical aspects of the problems relating to
environment, or has at least 3 years experience as a Judicial member or a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                                       101</span>


Technical member; or (3) a Judicial Member must be one who is or has been
qualified to be a Judge of a High Court or has been a member of the Indian
Legal Service and has held a post in grade I of that service for at least 3
years. A Technical Member is a person who has adequate knowledge of or
experience in or capacity to deal with administrative, scientific or technical
aspects of the problems relating to environment. No appointment of the
Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson can be made without consultation of the
Chief Justice of India. No appointment of a Judicial or Technical Member
can be made except on the recommendation of a Selection Committee
appointed by the Central Government consisting of
</p><p id="p_285">   (a) Chairperson of the Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_286">   (b) Secretary, Govt. of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests.
</p><p id="p_287">   (c) Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs.
</p><p id="p_288">   (d) Director-General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
</p><p id="p_289">   (e) An Environmentalist to be nominated by the Central Government.
</p>
<p id="p_290">Term of office of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and other Members is 5
years. Appeals lie to Supreme Court on question of law.
</p>
<p id="p_291">      It may be stated that so far as the National Environmental Tribunal is
concerned, since the Act itself has not been notified, the Tribunal has not
been constituted in that last eight years. The fact remains that neither the
Chairperson, nor Vice-Chairman nor Judicial or Technical Members have
been appointed to this Tribunal in the last eight years. Such an important
environmental Tribunal envisaged by Parliament has unfortunately not
come into being. In fact, if there is tragedy like the Bhopal one, there is
now no Tribunal which would grant damages expeditiously.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                      102</span>
<p id="p_292">      There are other aspects concerning the powers of the above Tribunal.
It can only award compensation. It should have been given all powers
which a Civil Court enjoys - so that it can grant declarations, permanent and
mandatory injunctions, possession etc. No doubt, there is provision for the
Tribunal sitting in Benches but the scheme does not envisage Court in each
State. Further, the Members other than Judicial Members, are not always or
necessarily experts in environmental matters. For example, under sec. 10(2)
</p><p id="p_293">(b), if a Secretary to Government is appointed as Vice-Chairman, he need
not possess any experience in environmental matters. It is not clear why
only in the case of an Addl. Secretary who could be appointed as Vice-
Chairman under sec. 10(2)(c), experience in environmental matters is a
condition precedent. Similarly under sec. 10(3)(b), it is not stated that a
member of the Indian Legal Service who can be appointed as a Judicial
member need be person who has done some work in the field of
environment. Again, so far as Technical members under sec. 10(4) are
concerned, they can be persons only with administrative or scientific
knowledge without any experience in problems relating to environment.
</p>
<p id="p_294">      If one looks at the consistent pattern in other countries, as pointed out
in Chapter IV, the Environmental Court should consist of Judicial Members
and Environmental experts. The reason is that if they are expected to
exercise normal judicial function of a Civil Court (as now proposed), or as a
Court of original and appellate jurisdiction, there is no scope for appointing
administrative   officials   or   public   servants    other   than    judicial
officers/members of the Bar with considerable experience.                  The
Commission is of the view therefore that the Environmental Court must be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                       103</span>


manned by persons with judicial experience in the High Court and Members
of the Bar with at least 20 years standing and have to be assisted by
Environmental experts.
</p>
<p id="p_295">The National Environmental Appellate Authority Act, 1997


         <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_297">This Act</a> was, as stated in the preamble, intended to provide for the
establishment of a National Environmental Appellate Authority to hear
appeals with respect to restriction of areas in which any industries,
operation or process (or class of industries, operation or processes) shall be
carried out or shall not be carried out subject to safeguards under the
Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_296">         Under sec. 4 of the Act, the Appellate Authority was to consist of a
Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson and such other Members not exceeding
three, as the Central Government may deem fit.            Under sec. 5, the
qualification for appointment as Chairperson is that a person who has been


</p><p id="p_297">   (a)      a Judge of the Supreme Court
</p><p id="p_298">   (b)      the Chief Justice of High Court


         A person cannot be appointed as Vice-Chairman unless he has (a)
held for two years the post of a Secretary to Govt. of India or any other post
under the Central/State Govt. carrying a scale of pay which is not less than
that of a Secretary to Govt. of India and (b) had expertise or experience in
administrative, legal, management or technical aspects of problems relating
to environmental management law or planning and development.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                                      104</span>
<p id="p_299">      It will be noticed that there is some difference between the above
provisions and those under the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_298">National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995.
But here too, the Secretary to Govt. need not necessarily have experience in
environmental matters to be appointed as Vice-Chairman.
</p>
<p id="p_300">      The term of office is three years.
</p>
<p id="p_301">      It is understood that the Appellate Tribunal did not have much work
in view of the narrow scope of its jurisdiction as per notification issued. It
dealt with very few cases. After the term of the first Chairman was over, no
appointment has been made.
</p>
<p id="p_302">      Thus these two National Environmental Tribunals are today
unfortunately non-functional.      One had only jurisdiction to award
compensation and never actually came into existence. The other came into
existence but after the term of the first Chairman ended, none has been
appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_303">      It is in the background of this experience with the laws made by
Parliament with regard to Environmental Tribunals that we propose to make
appropriate proposals in chapter IX for constitution of environmental courts
which can simultaneously exercise appellate powers as a Civil Court, and
original jurisdiction as exercised by Civil Courts. These proposals will be
contained in Chapter IX.

Technology, New Delhi), recommended that a new entry as 'environmental
protection' be introduced in List III to enable the Central as well as State
Governments to legislate on environmental subjects. This has not been
done so far.
</p>
<p id="p_318">      But, it is undoubted that under various Articles, such as Arts. 252 and
253, Parliament has power to pass central legislations on subjects in the
State List (List II) of the Seventh Schedule, in certain circumstances.

<p id="p_319">      So far as prescribing an appellate Court like the proposed
Environment Court by law to be made by Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_318">Art. 253</a> by
amending the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981, the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_319">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
1986, there is no difficulty because these two laws have also been made by
Parliament in exercise of its legislative powers under the same <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_320">Art. 253.</a>
The issue arises only so far as the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 is concerned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                                       109</span>


which was made by Parliament in exercise of its legislative powers under
<a href="/doc/282696/" id="a_321">Art. 252(1)</a> and not under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_322">Art. 253.</a>    Question is whether it can be amended
only by following the procedure of State Legislatures passing resolutions or
whether, without following such a procedure, the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974
can be amended by Parliament by passing an amending law under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_323">Art. 253</a>
for the purpose of providing appellate jurisdiction to the proposed
Environmental Court under the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974?
</p>
<p id="p_320">The Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 was enacted after some States desired
Parliament to enact law under <a href="/doc/282696/" id="a_324">Art. 252(1)</a> on the subject of 'water' etc.
which are in List II (State List) for the purpose of uniformity. Those State
Legislatures had passed resolutions for that purpose.        After Parliament
passed those laws, several other States adopted the Water (P&amp;CP) Act,
1974.     In view of <a href="/doc/1294039/" id="a_325">Art. 252(2</a>), if such a law is passed by Parliament under
<a href="/doc/282696/" id="a_326">Art. 252(1)</a> in respect of a matter in List II for the purpose of amendment in
the said law, it is necessary to follow the same procedure envisaged by <a href="/doc/282696/" id="a_327">Art.
252(1)</a> by way of State resolutions.     Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_328">Art. 252</a> requires such a
procedure to be followed.
</p>
<p id="p_321">        But, the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981 was, however, passed by Parliament
not under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_329">Art. 252</a> but under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_330">Art. 253</a> which enables Parliament to make
laws in respect of subjects in List II, if it is for the purpose of implementing
"any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or
any decision made at any international conference, association or other
body."

<p id="p_322"><a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_331">The Air Act</a> (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981 in its Preamble, expressly refers to the
"decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on the Human
Environment held in Stockholm in June 1972, in which India participated",
and the decision was that countries should 'take appropriate steps for the
preservation of the national resources of the earth which, among other
things include the preservation of the quality of air and control of air
pollution'.   The preamble further states that 'it is considered necessary to
implement the decisions aforesaid insofar as they relate to the preservation
of the quality of air and control of air pollution'. Thus, Parliament resorted
to <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_332">Art. 253</a> rather than to <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_333">Art. 252</a> while passing the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981.
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_334">That Act</a> can be amended by another law by Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_335">Art. 253.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_323"> <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_336">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 was also passed by
Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_337">Art. 253</a> and the preamble refer to the decisions taken at
UN Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm in June 1972
on the protection and improvement of human environment. The preamble
states that "it is considered necessary further to implement the decisions
aforesaid insofar as they relate to the protection and improvement of
environment and the prevention of hazards to human beings, other living
creatures, plants and property".    The above Act can, therefore, also be
amended by Parliament under another law if passed under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_338">Art. 253.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_324"> <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_339">The National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995 in its preamble
squarely relies on the 'United Nations Conference on Environment and

participated, calling upon States to develop national laws regarding liability
and compensation for the victims of pollution and other environmental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">                                      111</span>


damages.    It also states that it was considered expedient "to implement the
decisions of the aforesaid Conference so far as they relate to the protection
of environment and payment of compensation for damage to persons,
property and environment while handling hazardous substances". <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_340">This Act</a>
can, therefore, be amended or repealed by another law if made by
Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_341">Art. 253.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_325"> <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_342">The National Environment Appellate Authority Act</a>, 1997 is an Act to
provide for the establishment of a National Environment Appellate
Authority to hear appeals with respect to restriction of areas in which any
"industries, operation or process", "or class of industries, operations or

safeguards under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_343">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto". In view of its linkage with the
above Act of 1986, there is thus no difficulty in amending or repealing this
Act by an Act to be made by Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_344">Art. 253.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_326">      Thus, so far as constituting an Environment Courts with appellate
powers, there is no difficulty with regard to amending the Air (P&amp;CP) Act,
1981 (passed expressly for the purpose of implementing the decision taken
at the Stockholm Conference, 1972) or in regard to the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_345">Environment
(Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (passed for the same purposes of the 1972
Conference). These two Acts are also referable to <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_346">Art. 253</a> and the new law
conferring such appellate powers on the proposed Environment Court can
be made by Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_347">Art. 253</a>, by amending or repealing provision
in the three enactments, namely, the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981, the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_348">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1981 and the National Environment

<a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_351">National Environment (Tribunal) Act</a>, 1995 can also be repealed or
amended under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_352">Art. 253.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_327">      Question, however, arises, as stated earlier, with reference only to the
Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 which was expressly passed under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_353">Art. 252</a>,
whether it would require, in view of clause (2) <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_354">Art. 252</a>, passing of fresh
resolutions by the State Legislatures as envisaged by that clause for the
purpose of deleting sec. 28 which enables appellate powers to be conferred
by the State Government and transfer the appellate powers to the proposed
Environmental Court. This has become necessary because, as at present, the
States (except A.P.) have constituted appellate authorities consisting of
bureaucrats.
</p>
<p id="p_328">      This question is, however, not difficult to answer.
</p>
<p id="p_329">      We shall first explain the scope of <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_355">Art. 253.</a>    Parliament chooses to
exercise powers under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_356">Art. 253</a>, where Parliament feels it necessary to make
a law for implementing international agreements, or treaties or decisions
taken at international conferences in which India has participated.      This
power of Parliament is an independent power and is not controlled by Art.
</p><p id="p_330">252. Further, <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_357">Art. 253</a> opens with the words, "Notwithstanding anything in
the foregoing provisions of this Chapter". The non-obstante clause puts the
matter beyond doubt and is applicable not only for making a law by
Parliament on the subject for the first time under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_358">Art. 253 (e.g. Air</a> (P&amp;CP)
Act, 1981) when no law on the subject was made earlier by Parliament
either under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_359">Art. 252</a> or under any other of the foregoing Articles preceding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                      113</span>
<a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_360">Art. 253 (i.e. <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_361">Art. 245</a> to 252</a>), but also where Parliament wants to exercise
its special powers under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_362">Art. 253</a> even where it had passed a law under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_363">Art.
252</a> based on the resolutions of State Legislatures. In other words, where,
under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_364">Art. 252</a> pursuant to desire of the States which passed resolutions
(e.g. the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974), Parliament had passed an Act under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_365">Art.
252</a>, still Parliament if it later feels that such a law requires to be amended
or repealed for the purpose of "implementing international agreements or
treaties or decisions taken at international conferences" in which India has
participated, it is, in the opinion of the Commission, clearly permissible for
Parliament to exercise its special powers under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_366">Art. 253</a> to pass an
amending or repealing Act (under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_367">Art. 253</a>) for the purpose of amending or
repealing such earlier law made by Parliament under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_368">Art. 252</a>, in regard to a
matter falling under List II.   The Parliament's power under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_369">Art. 253</a> is an
independent power and is not confined to a law made for the first time but is
also applicable for the purpose of amending or modifying a law made by
Parliament under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_370">Art. 252.</a> The power of Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_371">Art. 253</a> to do
so is further clearly safeguarded by the non-obstante clause in the opening
part of <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_372">Art. 253.</a>   The words "foregoing provisions of this chapter" in the
opening clause, "Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of
this Chapter" permit <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_373">Art. 253</a> to override Articles 245 to 251 of the Chapter
but also to override both the clauses (1) or (2) of <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_374">Art. 252</a> in that Chapter,
which precede <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_375">Art. 253.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_331">      When <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_376">Art. 253</a> thus overrides clause (2) of <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_377">Art. 252</a>, there is no
difficulty in stating that though the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 was one
expressly passed by Parliament under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_378">Art. 252</a> in respect of a matter in List
II (after resolutions were passed by State Legislatures), the said law made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                     114</span>


by Parliament can be amended or modified or repealed under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_379">Art. 253</a>,
without following the procedure indicated in clause (2) of <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_380">Art. 252</a> for the
purpose of implementing decisions taken in international conferences 'for
protection of environment'. All that is necessary is that while passing such
amending or repealing Act, amending the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974,
Parliament must state in the preamble that Parliament is passing the
amending law for giving effect to international agreements, treaties or
decisions taken at international conferences.   In the present context, such
conferences are the 1972 Stockholm Conference and the Rio de Janeiro
Conference of 1992.
</p>
<p id="p_332">      We have to refer here to another aspect concerning the Water (P&amp;CP)
Act, 1974. The said Act was passed by Parliament pursuant to resolutions
passed by the legislatures of the State of Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana,
Himachal Pradesh, J&amp;K, Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Tripura and West Bengal. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_381">The Act</a> was adopted under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_382">Art. 252</a>
by the States of Sikkim ((1989), Meghalaya (1977), Maharashtra (1989),
Manipur (1988)).
</p>
<p id="p_333">      It appears to us that the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 has not been
adopted in some States as such.
</p>
<p id="p_334">      We are also aware that certain amendments made by Parliament by
Act 53/78 following the procedure under <a href="/doc/1294039/" id="a_383">Art. 252(2)</a> to the Water (P&amp;CP)
Act of 1974 are yet to come into force in some States which had passed
resolutions for enacting the Principal Act or which had adopted it later,
because some of those States have not yet passed fresh resolutions adopting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">                                           115</span>


the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_384">Amending Act</a>s. Such a situation has arisen because the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_385">Amending Act</a>
of 1978 was not specifically passed by Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_386">Art. 253</a> for giving
effect to international agreements, treaties or decisions taken at international
conferences. If Parliament had passed the amending law of 1978 under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_387">Art.
253</a>, there would have been no need for the States to pass resolutions in
their Legislatures or to adopt the amending law of 1978 amending the Water
(P&amp;CP) Act, 1974.        After all, the idea is to have uniform laws in all the
States if they are made to implement decisions taken at international
environment-related conferences.
</p>
<p id="p_335">         Two proposals can be considered here.
</p>
<p id="p_336">   (1)      One is that sec. 28 of the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 be substituted
            under the proposed Act, prescribing an appeal to the Environment
            Court.   The said amendment will then get incorporated in the
            parent Act and will substitute sec. 28 in all those States where the
            <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_388">Water Act</a> is in force, either because of its original resolution or
            because of subsequent adoption.      But, in those States where the
            Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 has not come into force at all, it is
            possible to make a provision in the proposed Act that the proposed
            sec. 28 giving a right of appeal to the Environment Court shall
            alone be applicable whenever the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 is
            adopted in those States, or
   (2)      We may, instead, provide that notwithstanding anything in sec. 28,
            Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974, the person aggrieved by an order of
            Pollution Board passed under sec. 25 or 26 of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_389">Water Act</a>, can
            appeal to the Environment Court. Such a provision would apply
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">                                       116</span>


         to Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 where it is now in force or where it
         will be adopted in future.
</p>
<p id="p_337">      In our view, the second proposal is preferable inasmuch as it will be
referable to <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_390">Art. 253</a> and will have overriding effect over the Act passed
under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_391">Art. 252</a>, even where the States, which have not so far adopted the
Act, would opt to adopt the parent Act of 1974 or the Act as amended in
1978 or in some other manner.
</p>
<p id="p_338">      Summarising our conclusion,- the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981 and the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_392">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 were passed by Parliament with
reference to the Stockholm Conference of 1972 (i.e. under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_393">Art. 253</a>) and the
<a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_394">National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995 was passed by Parliament by
referring to the Rio de Janeiro Conference, 1992 and the <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_395">National
Environment Appellate Authority Act</a>, 1997 was passed specifically for the
purpose of enforcing the safeguards under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_396">Environment (Protection)
Act</a>, 1986. Therefore, there is no difficulty for Parliament passing a law
relating to Environment Courts in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_397">Art. 253</a> to
amend or repeal the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981, The Environmental (Protection)

Act, 1974 which enables the State Government to constitute the appellate
authorities. The power which was given to the State Government under the
Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 in sec. 28 to constitute appellate authorities can be
superceded by fresh provisions of law proposing Environment Courts, as the

under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_401">Art. 253</a> of the Constitution.

<p id="p_339"><a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_402">Art. 253</a> and special law for Environment Courts: Does it flow from any
decision in an International conference to which India is a party?
</p>
<p id="p_340">      The question is whether the constitution of separate Environment
Courts by a statute of Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_403">Art. 253</a> could be justified by
tracing this as an act of implementation of any decision taken at an
International Conference? If it is so, invoking <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_404">Art. 253</a> to make such a law
will be permissible for Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_341">      There are two answers to this question.
</p>
<p id="p_342">   (A)   The fact that the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_405">National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995 and the
         National Environmental Appellate Authority Act, 1997 were
         passed by Parliament (as analysed earlier in this chapter), for the
         purpose of implementing the decisions at the Rio Conference of
         1992 and Stockholm Conference of 1972 show that the proposed
         Environmental Courts Act can also be similarly passed by
         Parliament.    All these Acts are intended to provide speedy
         adjudicatory bodies in respect of disputes arising in environmental
         matters.
</p><p id="p_343">   (B)   The Rio Declaration of 1992 expressly refers to 'remedies' to
         achieve the objects of the Declaration made at the Conference.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">                                        118</span>
<p id="p_344">      Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and
Development, 1992 refers to effective access to 'judicial and administrative
proceedings including redress and remedy' and states that they 'shall be
provided'.
</p>
<p id="p_345">      Principle 10 reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_346">      "Principle 10:     Environmental issues are best handled with the
      participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the
      national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to
      information concerning the environment that is held by public
      authorities, including information on hazardous materials and
      activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in
      decision-making process. States shall facilitate and encourage public
      awareness and participation by making information widely available.
      Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including
      redress and remedy, shall be provided."
</p>
<p id="p_347">Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, clearly requires Judicial remedies to be
provided.    There is, therefore, no difficulty in Parliament invoking its
special powers to make a law on the subject of 'Environmental Courts'
under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_406">Art. 253</a>, even if it be that there is an encroachment into the entries in
List II of Schedule VII relating to 'Water', which is a State subject.

vs. State</a>: (AIR 1972 Cal).         But the words 'additional Courts' have not
come for interpretation. In our view, the words 'additional Courts' must be
construed widely and apply also to special Courts like the proposed
Environment Courts. The word 'additional', in our view, mean additional to
the overall number of Courts existing and it is not necessary that there
should be an existing class of such Courts. In fact, whenever the Central
Government establishes Courts for a particular class of cases for the first
time, this provision is attracted and it is not an argument to say <a href="/doc/874453/" id="a_413">Art. 247</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">                                       120</span>


cannot be invoked unless there are existing Courts for that class of cases.
Otherwise, <a href="/doc/874453/" id="a_414">Art. 247</a> can never be invoked at all.       When such Courts are
and can be established for the first time, it cannot be argued that there were
no such Courts earlier and hence they cannot be established even initially.
Some day or other, they must be established for the first time.

       Environmental Courts to follow certain fundamental principles


      We are of the view that the Environment Court must follow the
following principles. These principles must be part of the proposed statute
dealing with Environmental Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_356">Polluter Pays Principle


      The Polluter Pays Principle was first adopted at international level in
the 1972 OECD Council Recommendation on Guiding Principles
concerning the International Aspects of Environmental Policies. The 1974
principle experienced revival by OECD Council in 1989 in its
Recommendation on the Application of the Polluter Pays Principle to
Accidental Pollution, and the principle was not to be restricted to chronic
polluter.   In 1991, the OECD Council reiterated the Principle in its
Recommendations on the Uses of Economic Instruments in Environmental
Policy.
</p>
<p id="p_357">      The European Council adopted it in its Recommendation 75/436 in
1975 and reiterated in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme and in
the 2001 EC Guidelines and in the Waste Framework Directive 1991 and
<a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_420">Art. 10</a> of the Directive 1999/31/EC and <a href="/doc/813152/" id="a_421">Art. 99</a> Directive 2000/Cr/EC. It
was adopted in single European Act (SEA) by <a href="/doc/1822128/" id="a_422">Art. 130</a> R(Z) (new <a href="/doc/114820/" id="a_423">Article
174(2))</a> and <a href="/doc/1822128/" id="a_424">Art. 130</a> of the EC Treaty.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">                                     122</span>
<p id="p_358">      National laws in Belgium, France, Germany have adverted to this
principle.
</p>
<p id="p_359">      In international law, the principle is incorporated in the 1980 Athen
Protocol, the 1992 Helsinki Convention on the Transboundary Effects
Industrial Accidents, the 1993 Lugano Convention on Civil Liability for
Damage Resulting From Activities Dangerous to Environment. A host of
other treaties and conventions are set out (at pp. 23, 24) in 'Environmental
Principles' (by Nicolas de Sadeler, Oxford 2002).
</p>
<p id="p_360">      This principle was first stated in the Brundtland Report in 1987. This
principle was also adverted to in Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_425">Enviro-legal Action vs.
Union of India</a> 1996(3) SCC 212. It was stated; (p 246 at para 65)


      "...we are of the opinion that any principle evolved in this behalf
      should be simple, practical and suited to the conditions obtaining in
      this country.......... Once the activity carried on is hazardous or
      inherently dangerous, the person carrying on such activity is liable to
      make good the loss caused to any other person by his activity
      irrespective of the fact whether he took reasonable care while
      carrying on his activity".

<p id="p_361"><a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_426">In Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum vs. Union of India</a>: 1996(5) SCC 647,
(at 659), Kuldip Singh J stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">       "The 'Polluter Pays Principle' as interpreted by this Court means that
       the absolute liability for harm to the environment extends not only to
       compensate the victims of the pollution but also the cost of restoring
       the environmental degradation.         Remediation of the damaged
       environment is part of the process of 'Sustainable Development' and
       as such the polluter is liable to pay the cost to the individual sufferers
       as well as the cost of reversing the damaged ecology."</blockquote>
<p id="p_362">       This principle of compensating the victim as well as the environment
is laid down in sec. 3 of the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_427">National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995.
<a href="/doc/105902756/" id="a_428">Section 3(1)</a>, as already stated, refers to the compensation payable and it
will be as per the heads specified in the Schedule. The Schedule contains
items (a) to (n) out of which items (a) to (e) relate to the individual affected
by the polluter while items (f) to (n) relate to the environmental damage,
including that to the flora and fauna.
</p>
<p id="p_363">Hazardous substances - Absolute liability


       Absolute or strict liability is one where fault need not be established.
It is no-fault liability.
</p>
<p id="p_364">       Initiatives such as the 1993 Lugano Convention on Civil Liability for
Damage Resulting from Activities Dangerous to Environment; the European
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                                       124</span>


Commission Green Paper on environmental liability (1993) and the Chapter
on liability for contaminated land of the Swedish Environment Code (2000),
suggest that the polluter pays principle calls for the establishment of a strict
liability regime. There are four Nuclear Conventions, one of 1960, two of
1963 and another of 1971 which lay down strict liability. There are others
dealing with oil spill-overs of 1969, 1971 and 1992 which too impose strict
liability. More recently, in its White Paper on Environmental Liability, the
European Commission stressed that liability independent of fault must be
favoured for two reasons: first, it is very difficult for plaintiffs to establish
fault in environmental liability cases; and secondly, it is the person who
undertakes an inherently hazardous activity, rather than the victim or society
in general, who should bear the risk of any damage that might ensue.
</p>
<p id="p_365">      Our Courts or statutes have, however, not extended the principle of
strict liability to all cases where 'Polluter Pays Principle' applies, but have
confined such absolute liability only to cases where injury to person or
property is occasioned by use of 'hazardous' substances.
</p>
<p id="p_366">      In the Oleum Gas Leak case (<a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_429">M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India</a>) AIR
1987 SC 1086, the Supreme Court laid down that an enterprise which is
engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses a
potential threat to the health and safety of persons working in the factory
and to those residing in the surrounding areas, owes an absolute and non-
delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to any one
on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity
which it has undertaken.       The enterprise must be absolutely liable to
compensate for such harm and it should be no answer to the enterprise to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                                      125</span>


say that it had taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred without
negligence on its part. The larger and more prosperous the enterprise,
greater must be the amount of the compensation payable for the harm
caused on account of an accident in the carrying on of the hazardous or
inherently dangerous activity by the enterprise. The principles laid down in
Ryland vs. Fletcher: LR 3 H.L. 330 were modified.            It is no longer
permissible in the case of injury by use of hazardous substances, to prove
merely that the injury was not foreseeable or that there was no unnatural use
of the land or premises by the factory, as was the position under the law laid
down in Rylands vs. Fletcher. This principle was reiterated in Indian
Council for <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_430">Environ-Legal Action vs. Union of India</a> 1996(3) SCC 212 (see
p 246, para 65) and other cases by the Supreme Court of India.
</p>
<p id="p_367">      The above principle (called 'no fault' principle) was, in fact,
      incorporated in sec. 3 of the National Environmental Tribunal Act,
      1995, read with the special definition of the words 'accident' in sec. 2
</p><p id="p_368">      (a) and 'handling' in sec. 2(e) and 'hazardous substance' in sec. 2(f)
      of that Act. Sec. 2(a) and 2(e) refer to hazardous substances which
      are used or handled and which cause the 'accident'. Sec. 2(f) defines
      'hazardous substance' as any substance or preparation which is
      defined as hazardous in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_431">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and
      exceeding such quantity as specified by the Central Government

<p id="p_377">Precautionary Principle


      The precautionary principle had its origin in the mid-1980s from the
German Vorsorgeprinzip. The decisions adopted by States within the North
Sea Ministerial Conference mark the first use of this principle in
international law. Explicit reference is made to it in the 1984 Bremen
Ministerial Declaration of the International Conference on the Protection of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">                                     127</span>


North Sea, the 1987 London Ministerial Declaration of the Second
International Conference for the Protection of the North Sea, the 1990
Hague Declaration of the Third Conference on the Protection of the North
Sea and the 1995 Declaration of the Fourth Conference on the Protection of
the North Sea.
</p>
<p id="p_378">      It was expanded in the field of marine pollution since 1980 and came
to be set out in the 1990 OPRC Convention and various other Conventions.
It was then extended to protection of coastal areas and fisheries sector and
to atmospheric pollution. (See Environmental Principles, Oxford, 2002 by
Nicolas de Sadeleer p 94-95).
</p>
<p id="p_379">      It soon came to be included as a general principle of environmental
policy in the U.N. Economic Commission of Europe in 1990 (UNECE) in
Bergen; in 1989 by the Governing Council of the UN Environment
Programme (UNEP); in 1990 by the Council of Ministers of the
Organisation of African Unity (CAU); and of the 1990 Ministerial
Conference on the Environment of the UN Economic Commission for Asia
and Pacific (ESCAP) and finally in January 1991 in the Environment
Ministers of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD).
</p>
<p id="p_380">      It then came to be accorded universal recognition in Principle 15 at
Rio in the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development which
resulted in the Declaration on Environment and Development. Similarly,
the 1992 Framework Convention on Climatic Change (UNFCC) also refers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">                                      128</span>

(CBD).
</p>
<p id="p_381">      It has been accepted by the European Court of Human Rights and
applied by WTO Dispute Resolution Bodies, the International Tribunal for
the Law of the Sea, the European Community Law.
</p>
<p id="p_382">      National legislations in the EC Member States (Germany, France,
Belgium, Sweden) have adopted it. It is applied in UK because of Art 174
(2) of EC Treaty. It is applied also by US Courts and in Australia.

Forum vs. Union of India</a> 1996(5) SCC 647 referred to the precautionary
principle and declared it to be part of the customary law in our country.
</p>
<p id="p_384">      The Principle is contained in Principle 11 of the Principles laid down
in the UN General Assembly Resolution on World Charter for Nature, 1982
and was reiterated in the Rio Conference of 1992 in its Principle No. 15. It
reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">      "Principle 15: In order to protect the environment, the precautionary
      approach shall be widely applied by States according to their
      capabilities, where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage,

      provisions, we have no hesitation in holding that the precautionary
      principle and the polluter pays principle are part of the environmental

<blockquote id="blockquote_75">      "There is nothing to prevent decision-makers from assessing the
      record and concluding that there is inadequate information on which
      to reach a determination. If it is not possible to make a decision with
      'some' confidence, then it makes sense to err on the side of caution
      and prevent activities that may cause serious or irreversible harm. An
      informed decision can be made at a later stage when additional data is
      available or resources permit further research. To ensure that greater
      caution is taken in environmental management, implementation of the
      principle through judicial and legislative means is necessary".

      The Prevention Principle takes care of reckless polluters who would
continue polluting the environment in as much as paying for pollution is a
small fraction of the benefits they earn from their harmful acts or omissions.

countries arising out of a foundry. This was treated as a transboundary
obligation under international law.         This principle was engrafted in
Principle 21 of the 1972 Stockholm Declaration on Human Environment
which stressed the 'responsibility (of States) to ensure that activities within
their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other
States or areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction'.        This was
reiterated in Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration.          This principle is
incorporated in the 1979 LRATP Convention, the 1985 Vienna Convention
for the Protection of the Ozone layer and the 1992 (B) and the Preamble of
the UNFCCC. This is also a part of E.C. Law.

<p id="p_400">      In A.P. Pollution Control Board case: 1999 (2) SCC 718 (at p 734) it
was explained that the 'precautionary principle' has led to the new 'burden
of proof' principle. In environmental cases where proof of absence of
injurious effect of the action is in question, the burden lies on those who
want to change the status quo. This is often termed as a reversal of the
burden of proof, because otherwise, in environmental cases, those opposing
the change could be compelled to shoulder the evidentiary burden, a
procedure which is not fair.      Therefore, it is necessary that the party
attempting to preserve the status quo by maintaining a less polluted state
should not carry the burden and the party who wants to alter it, must bear
this burden.

balanced against conservation of environment. Principle 3 of the Earth

be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs
of present and future generations'.         Principle 4 states that in order 'to
achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute
an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in
isolation of it'.   Principle 5 states that all 'States and all people shall
cooperate in the essential tasks of eradicating poverty as an indispensable
requirement for sustainable development, in order to decrease the disparities
in standards of living and better the needs of the majority of the people of
the world'. Principle 6 requires that the special situation and needs of
developing countries shall be given priority.         Principle 7 requires that
developed countries acknowledge the responsibility they bear in the
international pursuit of sustainable development. Principle 8 requires that
in order to achieve sustainable development and a higher quality of life for
all people, States should reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterns of
production and consumption and promote appropriate demographic policies.
Principle 9 requires improvement in capacity building for sustainable
development. Principle 27 requires States and people to cooperate for the
purpose of sustainable development.

<p id="p_403">      In Gabakovo vs. Nagymares: the ICJ ruling on the dam on Danube

of environment. Weeramantry J, went further and observed that the concept
has become a principle of modern international law.

      it is a principle which seeks to eradicate poverty and improve the

UN General Assembly as an inalienable right. The Declaration recognizes
that "Human being is the central subject of the development process and
that the development policy shall make the human being the main
participant and beneficiary of development". "Development" is defined as
"a comprehensive, economic, social, cultural and political process, which
aims at the constant improvement of the well being of the entire population
in development and in the fair distribution of benefits therefrom". The Rio
Conference of 1992 declared human beings as centers of concern for
sustainable development. Human beings are, it is said, entitled to a healthy
and protective life in harmony with nature (Principle 1).      "In order to
achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute
an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in
isolation of it". The 1997 Earth Summit meeting of 100 nations in New
York affirmed these principles.

natural resources such as rivers, forests, sea shores, air etc., for the purpose

a trustee and cannot commit breach of trust. In the above case, the State's
order for grant of a lease to a motel located on the bank of the river Beas

to consist of a retired Supreme Court Judge and Members having scientific

Environment Court, which shall consist (in each State or a group of States)
of three Judicial Members, who are (a) either sitting or retired Judges of a
High Court or (b) experienced Members of the Bar (with not less than 20
years standing). These three Judicial Members have to be assisted by three
environmental experts (to be called Commissioners) in each Environmental
Court. It will be permissible to have one Environmental Court for more

be filed in the said Court. Sec. 28 of the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 and sec.
31 of the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981 must be amended, as stated earlier, stating
that the appeals shall hereafter lie to the Environment Court under the
proposed Act and that pending appeals shall stand transferred to the said
Court.       Similarly, a provision must be inserted in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_456">Environment

Court, in respect of violation of safeguards under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_462">Environment
(Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and the appellate powers contemplated by sec. 11 of
that Act be now granted to the proposed Court.     This will require repeal of
the <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_463">National Environment Appellate Authority Act</a>, 1997 and transfer of
those provisions into the proposed Act.

deals with compensation payable for injury to person or property on account
of hazardous substances) should lie to the proposed Environment Court.
Sec. 8 of that Act contemplates that the compensation payable and paid
under sec. 7 shall go in reduction of any compensation payable "under any
other law".

      The proposed Court shall have original jurisdiction on environmental
disputes with all powers of a Civil Court and shall grant (apart from the
damages contemplated under the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_465">National Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995
in the case of injury on account of use of hazardous substances in its
original jurisdiction) all reliefs which a Civil Court can grant under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_466"> the

including declaration, setting aside of orders by public authorities or the
State, permanent injunction, mandatory injunction, appointing receivers to
manage the property, damages or compensation, possession etc. The Court
can be approached by way of an original petition.         The proposed Court
shall also be entitled to pass all interlocutory orders - both ad interim and
final, pending disposal of the original petitions.      A fixed court fee of
Rs.1000 should alone be payable in the original petitions that may be filed
before the proposed Court.        The Court must have powers to award
exemplary costs if frivolous or vexatious original petitions are filed.

<p id="p_448">Jurisdiction of ordinary Civil Court and conflict of decisions


      We have already stated that we are not ousting the jurisdiction of the
Civil Courts to entertain environment related disputes. As of now, for
example, if a chimney in a neighbour's house is releasing polluted air or a
small sewage channel from one house or land is creating pollution to a
neighbour's house or land, parties in villages are able to approach the
nearest munsif Courts which are quite accessible to these villages.    If we
oust the jurisdiction of these Courts, villagers cannot be expected to go all
the way to the seat of the Environment Court for each adjournment and
contest the same.   (May be, if a large section of people is involved, they
may be able to contest the case in the Environment Court, even if it is
located at a distant place.) In fact, even in Australia and New Zealand, the
jurisdiction of ordinary Courts is not ousted. Proposals in UK are also
likewise.   We are here only proposing to provide special Courts,- like the
Consumer fora - which parties may easily approach, if they want a speedy
or specialist Court. In fact, the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_469">Consumer (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 states that
the Act is in addition to the remedies under ordinary law.
</p>
<p id="p_449">      But, on the question of finality, it has to be provided that if an
adjudication has become final in the Civil Court (or in the Environmental
Court) it should be binding on the parties and parties cannot be allowed to
move the Environmental Court (or Civil Court) which has not yet been
approached.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">                                       148</span>
<p id="p_450">      If a dispute on some subject matter is pending in the Environment
Court and another similar case is filed later in the Civil Court, or vice versa,
parties can always obtain stay of the latter proceeding from the Court where
the latter case is filed by filing an application on the same principle as in
sec. 10 of Civil Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_451">Rules of evidence and Conciliation/Mediation


      The proposed Court will not be bound by rules of evidence and can
lay down its procedure. It can entertain oral and documentary evidence and
consult experts. It shall, however, have to observe principles of natural
justice. The Judicial Members and the Commissioners may, if necessary,
make spot inspections and record oral evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_452">      The proposed Environment Court should encourage Conciliation and
Mediation at any stage of the proceeding - be it an appeal or an original
petition.
</p>
<p id="p_453">Environmental Principles to be applied


      Obviously, the proposed Court will have to apply the fundamental
principles of environmental law as stated in Chapter VIII.
</p>
<p id="p_454">      The statute must state that the Environment Court must keep in mind

<p id="p_455">Repeal of the National Environmental Tribunal Act, 1995 and the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_470">National
Environment Appellate Tribunal Act</a>, 1997


      The National Environmental Tribunal Act, 1995 and the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_471">National
Environment Appellate Tribunal Act</a>, 1997 must be repealed and provisions
relating to the jurisdiction and powers of those Tribunals must be
incorporated in the proposed Act.

<p id="p_456">Amendments to the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974, the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981

      Sec. 31 of the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981 be suitably amended for
providing appeals to the Environment Court and a separate section must be
introduced in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_473">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 that appeals shall lie
to the proposed Environment Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_457">      An extra provision must be made in the proposed Act so far as the
Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 is concerned that, notwithstanding anything in the
Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 appeals shall lie to the proposed Environment
Court, not only in the States where the principal Act is in force but also in
States in which it may be brought in force in future.

<p id="p_458">Power to frame schemes and monitor them
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">                                      150</span>




      The Environment Court, in our view, must have power to frame
schemes and monitor them and also have power to modify the schemes from
time to time. If one looks at the problems raised in several cases and the
directions issued by the Supreme Court, it will be observed that such a
power is necessary to be vested in these Courts. Take the case of air, water
pollution, which are caused by an industry or a group of similar industries
located in an area. Directions may have to be issued for their shifting, for
closure of the industry temporarily and for directing payment of wages to
the employees to cover two or three years of their wages; for directing local
authorities to provide necessary amenities at the new location, like water
and electricity, or to direct the industries to install effluent plants etc. A
variety of issues arise simultaneously, involving several departments of the
Central/State Government or local authorities.      The Environment Court
must be able to provide an "environmental solution" to grave problems like
the one mentioned above and unless it has power to frame comprehensive
schemes which will involve issuing directions to various departments, the
solution cannot be implemented. Such a comprehensive jurisdiction is now
being exercised both by the Supreme Court and High Courts. In our view,
the proposed Courts must have similar powers. They will also have to
monitor the schemes till they are successfully implemented on ground and,
if necessary, modify the schemes from time to time.
</p>
<p id="p_459">Execution of orders and contempt procedure


      It was prescribed in sec. 25 of the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_474">National Environment Tribunal
Act</a>, 1995, that whoever fails to comply with an order of the proposed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">                                      151</span>


Tribunal should be liable for imprisonment upto a term of 3 years or with
fine which may extend upto Rs.10 lakhs or with both. (We are aware that
sec. 19 of the <a href="/doc/79225559/" id="a_475">National Appellate Authority Act</a>, 1997 prescribed
imprisonment upto seven years and fine upto rupees one lakh or both.)
Obviously, the punishment could be awarded only by the normal criminal
courts competent to award such punishment. This could take a pretty long
time.
</p>
<p id="p_460">        So far as execution of its orders are concerned, proposed Courts must
have all powers which a Civil Court has for execution and should also be
able to exercise contempt jurisdiction. There is no difficulty in conferring
such a power on these Courts.     The Commission is of the view that having
regard to the fact that big industries which pollute the environment (or our
streams, lakes and rivers or air) come before the Court, there is need to
invest the Court with contempt powers so that the Court can, by way of
summary proceedings, see that its orders are effectively implemented
instead of taking out lengthy proceedings by way of execution or
proceedings under the criminal law. Parliament can invest these proposed
Courts with such a power by law made under Entry 14, List III of the VII
Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_461">Power to mould appropriate relief


        Normally, Civil Courts do not grant relief which is not prayed for.
But, like Writ Courts, these environment Courts must be able to mould any
relief appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">                                      152</span>
<p id="p_462">      Therefore, we are of the view that, in the original petitions or in
appeals, the proposed Courts should have power to grant any other relief
other than what is sought for, which is suitable in facts and circumstances of
the case.
</p>
<p id="p_463">Locus standi


      So far as locus standi before the proposed Court in original petitions
is concerned, it must be as wide as it is today before High Courts/Supreme
Court in the writ jurisdiction in environment matters.    This is the position
in Australia and New Zealand also. Any person or organization who or
which is interested in the subject matter or in public interest must be able to
approach the Court.     As stated earlier, the Court must be permitted to
impose exemplary costs in case of frivolous or vexatious litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_464">Amicus curiae


      There must be provision for intervention by individuals/organization
and also power in the Court to appoint amicus curiae.
</p>
<p id="p_465">Qualification of Judicial Members


      So far as the persons who man the proposed Environment Court are
concerned, as stated earlier, there will be three Judicial Members assisted by
three expert Commissioners.       In the light of the fact that the proposed
Court will have all powers of a Civil Court, original and appellate, we are of
the view that the Courts should be manned only by Judicial Members drawn
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">                                        153</span>


from the Judiciary or the Bar. We are not dealing here with the constitution
of Tribunals like the Administrative Tribunals or Tax Tribunals which were
established to decide dispute in service matters or tax matters.   We are here
dealing with a Court which is exercising powers of a regular Civil Court in
its original jurisdiction and in its appellate jurisdiction while dealing with
environmental matters. It will not be permissible or appropriate to appoint
members lacking judicial or legal expertise.
</p>
<p id="p_466">Provision relating to qualification must be on the following lines:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_91">         "(1) The qualification for appointment of Chairman and Members
         shall be that they must be persons;
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_7">   (a)      who are or who have been Judges of a High Court ;
   (b)      advocates of a High Court or two or more of such High Courts in
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_92">            succession with a standing of not less than twenty years.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_93">         Explanation: Preference shall be given to those who have had
         experience in environmental matters whether as Judges or lawyers."</blockquote>
<p id="p_467">         We have proposed a three Judge Court, inasmuch as very complicated
and important questions (affecting the entire State in which the proposed
Court is located), would come before the Court and we have felt that it is
not sufficient to empower a Single Member Court to deal with such
important and grave issues. As of now such matters are dealt with by a
Bench of two or more Judges in the High Courts and Supreme Court. There
must therefore be at least two Judicial Members but, in order to deal with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">                                       154</span>


situations where there is a difference of opinion, it will be necessary to have
an odd number of Judicial Members, namely, three.        The quorum must be
two Judicial Members.
</p>
<p id="p_468">      The Court must also be assisted by a statutory panel of
Technical/Scientific personnel called Commissioners as is done in Australia
and New Zealand.     Having regard to the variety of issues that come before
Environment Courts, it will be necessary to have a panel of at least three
such Commissioners.        Their role will be advisory and they have to be
present in the Court during the course of the hearings.          They are not
Members of the Court but are a statutory panel intended to independently
advise and assist the Court in analyzing and assessing scientific or
technological issues. At least one Commissioner must always be present in
the Court. In case the Court feels that any other expert in a different branch
than those in the panel is to be examined, the Court may on its own or in
consultation with the panel of Commissioners, refer the matter for opinion
to other expert/experts in the particular field under consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_469">Qualification of Commissioners


      The Members in the panel of three Commissioners which is advisory
and which is attached to each Environment Court must, in our view, be
qualified in the following manner. Each commissioner must have


      "(1) a degree in environmental sciences together with at least five
             years experience as an environmental scientist or engineer, or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">                                      155</span>


      (2)   adequate knowledge of and experience to deal with various
            aspects of problems relating to environment, and in particular
            the scientific or technical aspects of environmental problems
            including protection of environment and environment impact
            assessment."
</p>
<p id="p_470">      We also recommend an Explanation to be inserted on the model of
sec. 12 of the NSW land and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_476">Environment Act</a>, 1979, with a slight
modification, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_94">      "In appointing Commissioners, it must be ensured, as far as
      practicable, that they are persons who hold qualifications and
      experience across the range of areas in regard to which issues of
      environment or ecology arise"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_471">Criminal and judicial review jurisdiction kept out


      We have deliberately kept criminal appellate jurisdiction and judicial
review jurisdiction exercised today by the High Courts, beyond the purview
of the proposed Courts. In respect of offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_477"> the Penal Code</a> or the
<a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_478">Special Act</a> like the Water (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 or the Air (P&amp;CP) Act, 1981
and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_479">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 or any other offence connected
with environment, parties or the State have therefore to go before the
normal Criminal Courts and to the criminal appellate Courts having
jurisdiction according to the procedural law applicable. We have examined
the matter in detail and felt that, in the abstract sense of power, <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_480">Art. 253</a>
read with Entry 13 of List I (Schedule VII) would enable criminal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_152">                                       156</span>


appeals/revisions from the trial Courts, in so far as they are presently filed in
High Courts, - whether in case of conviction or acquittal - could be shifted
to the Environment Court.       In this context, Entry 13, 95 of List I and
Entries 1, 2, 11A and 46 of List III would be relevant.
</p>
<p id="p_472">       But, we have not come across any special law (except the TADA or
the POTA) where the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court in criminal
matters has been taken away from the High Court and vested in another
Court at the State level, manned by retired judges.          In order to avoid
unnecessary litigation as to the competency of Parliament to make law
transferring the criminal appellate jurisdiction to another Court at State
level, we have decided not to touch the criminal appellate procedure as it
now stands.
</p>
<p id="p_473">       Likewise, we have not thought if fit to enable the Environmental
Courts, to have judicial review powers exercised by the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_481">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution of India. We have felt that it is sufficient to
vest original civil jurisdiction as exercisable by a Civil Court, in the
Environmental Courts. If we vest powers of Judicial review as under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_482">Art.
226</a>, then there may be need to subject the orders to the writ jurisdiction of
High Courts as held in <a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_483">L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India</a>, 1997 (3) SCC
</p><p id="p_474">261.


       No doubt, the Environment Court exercising powers of a Civil Court
or as an appellate Court in civil jurisdiction, may be technically amenable to
writ jurisdiction of the High Court but inasmuch as we are providing an
appeal to the Supreme Court, the High Courts may decline to interfere on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">                                      157</span>


the ground that there is an effective alternative remedy of appeal on law and
fact to the Supreme Court, as explained later in this Chapter.
</p>
<p id="p_475">Appeal to Supreme Court


      We are also of the view that Parliament can, under Entry 13 of List I
read with <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_484">Art. 253</a> or Entry 95 of List I or Entry 11A and 46 of List III,
provide for a statutory appeal direct to the Supreme Court.

<p id="p_476">Remuneration


      Remuneration of Members and Commissioners shall be as may be
prescribed by the Central Government.

<p id="p_477">Method of appointment and other matters


      The method of appointment of the Judicial Members shall be by the
Central Government in consultation with State Government, the Chief
Justice of the State/Union Territory concerned and the Chief Justice of

State Government/Union Territory concerned in consultation with the Chief

</p>
<p id="p_482">      So far as the Commissioners are concerned, the proviso for
resignation may be on the model of sec. 13(1) of the above Act of 1995. So
far as removal is concerned, it shall be on the basis of such rules as may be
prescribed by government, but the inquiry must be by a retired Judge of a
High Court.

<p id="p_487">Appeals to Supreme Court will persuade High Court not to interfere
normally on the principle of 'alternative effective remedy'


      As stated earlier, the proposal for a statutory appeal to the Supreme
Court of India, both on fact and law, will be an important reason as to why
the High Court will not normally interfere with the orders of the
Environment Court. The case in <a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_487">L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India</a>, AIR
1997 SC 1125 referred to earlier, is distinguishable because there the statute
(the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_488">Administrative Tribunals Act</a>) made under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_489">Art. 323A</a> sought to transfer
judicial review power of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_490">Art. 226</a> to a statutory
Tribunal and excluded the power of the High Court to interfere. Further, the
statutes of the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_491">Administrative Tribunals Act</a> did not provide for any
statutory appeal to the Supreme Court in the manner we are now proposing.
It was because of the above scheme of that Act, the Supreme Court felt that
the powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_492">Art. 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_493">, 227</a>, which are part of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_156">                                       160</span>


basic structure of the Constitution, could not be taken away and, therefore,
the orders of the Administrative Tribunal would be amenable to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_494">Art. 226</a>
before our Division Bench.         The above decision does not apply here
inasmuch as our proposal is not to take away any judicial review powers of
the High Court either specifically or remotely, nor to vest such powers in
the proposed Courts.      Firstly, the proposed Court is a Civil Court with
original jurisdiction in environmental matters and an appellate jurisdiction
against orders passed by public authorities under three enactments (or other
enactments to be notified).       Secondly, we are proposing an affective
alternative remedy of a statutory appeal to the Supreme Court on law and
fact. The Court which we are proposing is not a Tribunal under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_495">Art. 323A</a>
nor one under <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_496">Art. 323B</a>, even on the basis that the list of subjects referred
to in <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_497">Art. 323B</a> for constituting such special Tribunals is not exhaustive.
</p>
<p id="p_488">      We may point out that the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade
Practices Act, in sec. 55 provides appeals against the orders of the
Commission to the Supreme Court. Likewise, sec. 130E of the Customs
Act, 1962 and sec. 35L of the Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_498">Salt Act</a>, 1944 provides
for appeal to the Supreme Court. <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_499">The Consumer (Protection) Act</a>, 1986
provides appeal for the District Forum to the State Forum and from the State
Forum to the National Forum. From National Forum judgments in certain
cases, appeal lies to Supreme Court.        The High Courts, within whose
territorial jurisdiction these Courts are located do not normally entertain
writ petitions. Further, it is held that they will not ordinarily interfere under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_500">Art. 226</a> or 227 in respect of order of Consumer fora because the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_501">Consumer
(Protection) Act</a>, 1986 provides an effective alternative remedy of appeal.
(see long list of judgments of High Court referred to in Commentary on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_157">                                       161</span>


Act by J.N. Barowalia (2nd Ed., 2000) (pp. 195 to 206) and Commentary by
Shri Dilip K. Sheth (2001) (pp.66 to 69).
</p>
<p id="p_489">        The Supreme Court has held, in a number of cases, that High Court
will not normally interfere if there is an effective alternative right of appeal:
<a href="/doc/68724/" id="a_502">S. Jagadeesan vs. Ayya</a>, AIR 1984 SC 1512; <a href="/doc/23675/" id="a_503">Titagarh Paper Mills vs. State
of Orissa</a>, AIR 1983 SC 603.
</p>
<p id="p_490">        Apart from this, when issues of environment raise serious disputes of
fact, where oral as well as expert evidence is necessary, the High Courts are
ill-suited to decide the issues on the basis of affidavits alone: <a href="/doc/1369081/" id="a_504">Jai Singh vs.
Union of India</a>, AIR 1977 SC 898; Than Singh vs. Supat, AIR 1964 SC
1419.
</p>
<p id="p_491">        It is, therefore, proposed that appeals against the orders of the
Environmental Court shall lie to the Supreme Court of India. We are here
adopting the appeal procedure that was contained in sec. 24 of the <a href="/doc/885022/" id="a_505">National
Environment Tribunal Act</a>, 1995.        Further, the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_506">Consumer
(Protection) Act</a>, the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act, Customs
and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_507">Excise Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_508">Companies Act</a> and other statutes is similar, where a right
of appeal direct to the Supreme Court is given. Appeals under the proposed
Act must be on fact and law.
</p>
<p id="p_492">        This is a legislation by Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_509">Art. 253</a> of the Constitution
for the purpose of implementing the decisions in regard to protection to
environment taken in the Stockholm Conference, 1972 and the Rio de
Janeiro Conference of 1992 and in national interest. Further, the Courts are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">                                      162</span>


appellate bodies for purpose of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_510">Central Act</a>s, <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_511">Water Act</a>, 1974, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_512">Air Act</a>,
1985, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_513">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 etc. Therefore, it is the duty of
the Parliament to provide for the establishment of additional Courts and the
Central Government has to bear the cost of establishing and maintaining
these Courts under <a href="/doc/874453/" id="a_514">Art. 247</a> of the Constitution of India. <a href="/doc/874453/" id="a_515">Art. 247</a> reads
thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">        "<a href="/doc/874453/" id="a_516">Art. 247.</a> Power of Parliament to provide for the establishment of
        certain additional Courts: Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter,
        Parliament may by law provide for the establishment of any
        additional Courts for the better administration of laws made by
        Parliament or of any existing laws with respect to a matter
        enumerated in the Union List."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_493">These Courts obviously come within the words in the first part of the last
clause of <a href="/doc/874453/" id="a_517">Article 247</a>, namely, "better administration of laws made by
Parliament". (The second part of the clause deals with existing laws as on
26.1.50 which are with respect to matters in List I).        There can be
Environment Court for more than one State as stated earlier.         Union
Territories could avail of the Court in the neighbouring State. Delhi can
have a separate Court.
</p>
<p id="p_494">        We, therefore, recommend that a law be made by Parliament under
<a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_518">Art. 253</a> for constitution of Environmental Courts in each State (or group of
States) having original and appellate jurisdiction as stated in this Chapter
and having jurisdiction on environmental issues.       The Courts will be
manned each by three members with judicial or legal experience as stated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">                                       163</span>


and a panel of expert Commissioners. An appeal against the judgment shall
be to the Supreme Court of India.      The procedure to be followed by the
Court will be as stated in this Chapter.
</p>
<p id="p_495">      Other formal provisions like power of appointment of staff, rule-
making power, laying in the Houses of Parliament, can be made on the same
lines as those contained in the recent amendment to <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_519">Companies Act</a>, 2002 or
as in the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_520">Administrative Tribunals Act</a>, 1985.

<p id="p_496">                               CHAPTER X
                         RECOMMENDATIONS


      On the basis of our discussion in previous chapters, we recommend
the following, namely:
</p>
<p id="p_497">1.    In view of the involvement of complex scientific and specialized
issues relating to environment, there is a need to have separate
'Environment Courts' manned only by the persons having judicial or legal
experience and assisted by persons having scientific qualification and
experience in the field of environment.
</p>
<p id="p_498">2.    In order to achieve the objectives of accessible, quick and speedy
justice, these 'Environment Courts' should be established and constituted by
the Union Government in each State. However, in case of smaller States
and Union Territories, one court for more than one State or Union Territory
may serve the purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_499">3.(a) In view of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_521">Art. 253</a> read with Entry 13 of
List I of VII Schedule to the Constitution of India, Parliament is having
exclusive jurisdiction to enact a law for the purpose of establishment of
Environment Courts, because various decisions relating to protection and
improvement of environment and preservation of natural resources of earth,
were taken in International Conferences held at Stockholm in 1972 and at
Rio-de-Janeiro in 1992, in which India also participated.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_161">                                     165</span>
<p id="p_500">(b)   The following words in <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_522">Art. 253</a>, "Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing provisions of this Chapter", enable the Parliament to enact a law
even on subjects falling in State List. <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_523">Art. 253</a> is having overriding effect
over Arts. 245 to 252.
</p>
<p id="p_501">(c)   In view of the non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_524">Art. 253</a>, Parliament while
enacting a law exercising power under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_525">Art. 253</a>, may touch or enter into an
enactment made under <a href="/doc/282696/" id="a_526">Art. 252(1)</a> without following the procedure
prescribed in <a href="/doc/1294039/" id="a_527">Art. 252(2).</a>      Therefore, the provisions of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_528">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, which were enacted by the
Parliament under <a href="/doc/282696/" id="a_529">Art. 252(1</a>), can be altered by a subsequent law made by
the Parliament under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_530">Art. 253</a> without following the procedure laid under
<a href="/doc/1294039/" id="a_531">Art. 252(2).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_502">4.(a) The proposed Environment Court shall consist of a Chairperson and
at least two other members. Chairman and other members should either be a
retired Judge of Supreme Court or High Court, or having at least 20 years
experience of practicing as an advocate in any High Court. The term of the
Chairperson and members shall be 5 years.
</p>
<p id="p_503">(b)   Each Environment Court shall be assisted by at least three scientific
or technical experts known as Commissioners. However, their role will be
advisory only. The qualifications of the Commissioners is given in Chapter
IX (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_504">5.(a) The proposed Environment Court shall have original jurisdiction in
the civil cases where a substantial question relating to 'environment'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_162">                                       166</span>


including enforcement of any legal or constitutional right relating to
environment is involved. Details of this aspect are given in Chapter IX.
</p><p id="p_505">(b)   The jurisdiction of civil courts is not ousted.
</p><p id="p_506">(c)   The proposed Environment Court shall also have appellate
jurisdiction in respect of appeals under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_96">         (i) <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_532">The Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and rules made
             thereunder;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_97">         (ii)The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_533">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and
             rules made thereunder:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_98">         (iii) The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_534">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and
             rules made thereunder;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_99">         (iv)<a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_535">The Public Liability Insurance Act</a>, 1991.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_100">      The Central and State Governments may also notify that appeal under
      any other environment related enactment or rules made thereunder,
      may also lie to the proposed Environment Court.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_507">6.(a) The proposed Court shall not be bound to follow the procedure
prescribed under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_536"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908, but will be guided by
the principles of natural justice. The Court shall also not be bound by the
rules of evidence contained in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_537">Indian Evidence Act</a>, 1872.
</p>
<p id="p_508">(b)   The proposed Court shall have all powers of civil court including
power to punish for contempt, as discussed in Chapter IX.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_163">                                         167</span>
<p id="p_509">(c)    The minimum quorum for hearing a case, shall be two members
including the Chairperson. At least one Commissioner should also remain
present during the hearing of a case.
</p>
<p id="p_510">       The proposed Court can pass all kinds of orders, final or
interlocutory. It can also award damages, compensation and can also grant
injunctions (permanent, temporary and mandatory).        Details are given in
Chapter IX.
</p>
<p id="p_511">(d)    The proposed Environment Court shall follow the principle of strict
liability in case of hazardous substance, polluter pays principle,
precautionary principle, preventive principle, doctrine of public trust, Inter-
generational equity and sustainable development.
</p>
<p id="p_512">(e)    The locus standi before the proposed Environment Court in original
jurisdiction shall be as wide as it is today before High Court/Supreme Court
in the writ jurisdiction in environmental matters.
</p>
<p id="p_513">(f)    The proposed Environment Court shall also have power to frame
schemes relating to environmental issues, monitor them and modify the
schemes.
</p>
<p id="p_514">7.     The proposed enactment for establishment of these Environment
Courts should also contain other ancillary and miscellaneous provisions
which are necessary, for example provisions regarding other staff, funds,
place of sitting etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_164">                                           168</span>


8(a) In view of the appellate powers of the proposed Environment Court,
            provisions relating to appeals contained in:
</p><p id="p_515">      (i) <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_538">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and rules made thereunder;

               are required to be suitably amended.
</p>
<p id="p_518">      (b)      The proposed enactment should also contain a provision, namely,


            "Notwithstanding anything contained in sec. 28 of the Water
            (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_541">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, any person
            aggrieved by the order passed by the State Board under sec. 25, 26 or

Environmental Appellate Authority Act, 1997 may be repealed and
provisions regarding functions and powers of the Tribunal and the Appellate
Authority contained in those Acts be suitably transferred in the proposed
enactment for establishment of the Environment Court.
</p>
<p id="p_520">10.         Appeal against the orders of the proposed Environment Court, shall
lie before the Supreme Court on the question of facts and law.
