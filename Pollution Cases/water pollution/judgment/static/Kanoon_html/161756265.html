   BEFORE:
</p>
<p id="p_2">   The Hon'ble CHIEF JUSTICE SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR

   The Hon'ble JUSTICE PINAKI CHANDRA GHOSE

   Date : 20th June, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
    The Court : It has been reiterated by Mr. Pal, learned Senior

Counsel appearing for the petitioners, that the appeal was not

maintainable before the Appellate Authority under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_1">Section 28</a> of

The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 as no

cause of action had arisen to the complainant under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Sections 25</a>,

<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_4">26</a> and <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_5">27</a> of the aforesaid Act. It has also been pointed out that

the objection with regard to the maintainability of the appeal was

specifically raised in the objections filed before the Appellate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             2</span>


Authority. In spite of the objections having been taken in writing

and also oral submissions having been made to that effect, the

Appellate Authority totally ignored the aforesaid objections and

did not give any finding on the objections raised.

</p><p id="p_4">       Prima facie it appears to us that the remedy of appeal under

<a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_6">Section 28</a> of the said Act is limited only to <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_7">Sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_8">26</a> and

<a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_9">27</a>    of   the   said   Act.   Since    the     order   passed   by   the   Appellate

Authority is a quasi-judicial order, it is not required to be

defended by the members of the Appellate Authority. We, however,

direct Mr. Kallol Bose to appear for the Pollution Control Board

to assist the Court with regard to the interpretation to be placed

on <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_10">Section 28</a> of the aforesaid Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       Let the matter appear on Friday next (27.6.08).

       Xerox     certified     copy    of   this   order,   if   applied     for,   be

supplied to the parties subject to compliance with all requisite

formalities.
