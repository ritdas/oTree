7/16.06.2016</pre><p id="p_1">     Heard Mr. Avishek Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.
           Rahul Saboo, learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 and learned
           A.P.P. for the State.
</p><p id="p_2">                 The petitioner in this application has prayed for quashing the
           entire criminal proceeding in connection with C/III 311 of 2011
           including the order dated 12.12.2011 passed by the learned A.C.J.M.,
           Ranchi whereby and whereunder cognizance has been taken for the
           offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Sections 25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention
           and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section 21</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_5">22</a> of the Air (Prevention
           and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_3">                 It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner
           that he has falsely been implicated in the present case.            Learned
           counsel submits that the petitioner had already applied for 'no objection
           certificate' from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board and it is
           totally wrong on the part of the Board to contend that the petitioner is
           running his crusher machine without obtaining NOC from the Pollution
           Board. He further submitted that the crusher machine was not running
           in the notified forest area and in fact the opposite party no. 2 in its reply
           has also not stated in details with respect to the said contention of the
           petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the
           entire criminal proceeding deserves to be quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_4">                 Mr. Rahul Saboo, learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2
           relied upon the counter affidavit filed by him and submitted that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            -2-</span>
                  necessary formalities have been completed prior to lodging the case
                  against the petitioner. He further submitted that on 3 occasions, the
                  plant of the petitioner was inspected and the same were found in
                  running condition. He also submitted that the application submitted by
                  the petitioner for grant of NOC has subsequently been rejected and the
                  petitioner was directed to close down the operation of the plant and
                  ultimately the complaint case was instituted.        Learned counsel
                  therefore submits that there has been an apparent violation of the
                  provision of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and Water
                  (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and in such circumstances no
                  interference is necessitated in the order taking cognizance dated
                  12.12.2011.
</p><p id="p_5">                        It is an admitted fact that the petitioner was running M/s. King
                  Stone Works by operating crusher machine without consent to operate
                  from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. It further appears
                  that on several occasions, inspection was made of the premises of the
                  petitioner and the plant was found in a running condition. Such act on
                  the part of the petitioner is clearly violative of the provisions of the
                  Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_11">22</a> of
                  the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.       In such
                  circumstances, therefore, no illegality has been committed by the
                  learned A.C.J.M., Ranchi while passing the impugned order dated
                  12.12.2011.
</p><p id="p_6">                        Accordingly, having found no merit in this application, the same
                  is hereby rejected.
</p>
