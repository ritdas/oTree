to direct the respondents to ensure compliance of the Plastic Waste (Management

plastic carry bags and packaging alleging that the standards of manufacture and

disposal of polythene are not being followed leading to littering on the roads,

<p id="p_6">3.    The petitioner claiming to be a spirited citizen of Gwalior city, averred that

he is aggrieved by the indifferent attitude of the respondents who are not taking

any action to ensure compliance of Plastic Waste (Management and Handling)

Rules, 2011 (for short, 'Rules of 2011' framed by the Government of India,

Ministry of Environment and Forests under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.

Under these 'Rules' the use of coloured plastics has been banned in food items,

and the use of plastic carry bags made of virgin, recycled or compostable plastic

less than 40    microns in thickness is absolutely banned. Even manufacture,

distribution, storing, selling etc. of polythene less than 40 microns is banned

throughout the country. He further contended that plastic carry bags less than 40

microns in thickness are being used indiscriminately creating severe environmental

hazard. The petitioner also highlighted the menace of huge quantity of plastic

waste being generated because of the indiscriminate use and littering of plastic

carry bags not only in the city of Gwalior but all other parts of the State of Madhya

Pradesh causing havoc to the environment and creating health hazard to the human

beings and cattle. It is the case of the petitioner that the authorities concerned who

are vested with the powers to implement the 'Rules of 2011' in the interest of

protection of environment, utterly failed in performance of their duties. He further

contended that as per Rule 4 of the aforesaid 'Rules' the Municipal bodies and the

Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board are the competent authorities to

implement the rules in the interest of the environment but they are not paying heed

to the important aspect of the protection of environment, health of the human

beings and cattle from the plastic menace.

plastic / polythene carry bags and its un-regulated discarding has resulted in

pollution of the environment and is affecting not only human beings but other

living beings for which stringent steps for enforcement of the laws and regulations

in force are required to be implemented. Not only that, in many countries and some

manufacture, sale, distribution and use of poly / plastic carry bags. It was recently

reported in the press that the Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court while hearing

 the matter relating to the problem created as a result of unrestricted discarding and

throwing away of the plastics and carry bags commented that the problem is "a

more serious threat to the future generations than is posed by nuclear weapons".

This has to be understood not only by all stakeholders but also by all duty holders

as they are all governed by Articles 48 A and 51 A(g) of the Constitution. The ill

effects of the pollution as a result there of not only affect human beings but

animals, birds, plants and other living beings so also the lakes, rivers and water

bodies, the air we breath and the soil as well.

affected. While under <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_4">article 48(A)</a> of the Constitution a duty has been cast upon

the State to make an endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to

safeguard the forests and wild animals, under <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_5">Article 51 (A) (g)</a> it is the

fundamental duty of every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment

including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life and to have compassion for all living

creatures. Considering the above provisions in the Constitution, while it is the duty

of the State to make an endeavour for protecting the environment, at the same time

there is a duty cast upon the citizens of this country also to protect and improve

environment not only for the benefit of the human beings and citizens of this

country but having regard to all living creatures and that also needs to be

highlighted. It hardly needs to be emphasised that the environment affects each

living being whether plants, animals or birds and therefore, while each one of us

wishes to live in a pollution free environment we ourselves consciously or

unconsciously tend to pollute the environment by our acts of omissions and

commissions.     Improving the environment and keeping it pollution free is

something which requires the participation and positive action on the part of each

and every citizen along with the State and local bodies.

home which ultimately if not managed, leads to pollution.          If the waste so

generated domestically can be managed properly much of the problem relating to

polluting the environment as a result of such waste including plastic and polythene

can be curbed.    We all have heard about the 3 R's. These relate to 'Reduce'

'Reuse' and 'Recycle' but unfortunately when it comes to practise there are very

few who actually adhere to applying the principle of the 3 R's, particularly

'Reduce'. On the contrary the use of plastic carry bags has increased many fold

over the years. While the 'Rules of 2011' emphasise on the need and method for

recycle no emphasis is found on the first of the R's namely 'Reduce' which in our

opinion is more important.

<p id="p_37">21.   As per some of the statistics which are available on the internet, as a result

of the use of plastic bags "environmental activists estimate that approximately 500

billion to one trillion plastic bags are used each year world vide".       Putting it

differently as stated by Sharon Jacobsen "Every man, woman and child in our

planet uses 83 plastic bags every year" which may be a very conservative estimate.

That is one bag per person every 4½ days. Therefore, if a family of four is looked

at, on an average, it comes to 332 bags per family per year i.e. roughly one

polythene / plastic bag per day per family. With that kind of waste being generated,

without proper management of segregation and disposal, we have come to a point

where, something which was considered to be useful when invented has now

become an uncontrollable monster and threatening the environment world over.

particular reference to Gwalior and Bhopal cities in Madhya Pradesh to apply our

<p id="p_38">22.   What Makes Plastic Bags harmful to the Environment?
</p>
<p id="p_39">      Plastic bags are made of various chemicals such as xylene, ethylene oxide

and benzene which are mainly toxic. Traditional plastic bags are usually made

from polyethylene, which consists of long chains of ethylene monomers. Ethylene

is derived from natural gas and petroleum. The polyethylene used in most plastic

carry bags is either low-density or more often, high-density. Color concentrates

and other additives are often used to add tint to the plastic. Plastic carry bags are

commonly manufactured by blown film extrusion.
</p>
<p id="p_40">      The process of manufacturing the plastic involves various chemical

processes and utilization of variety of chemical compounds and additives including

phenols, amines and esters, antioxidants, UV and light stability improvers,

antistatic agents, and heat stabilizers, which impart the finished product specific

characteristics for its intended use. Consequently, these additives along with the

polymeric material have potential to be released into the environment as a result of

chemical reactions in the process of its degradation and the degraded products on

release cause significant health and environmental hazards.

</p><p id="p_41">      The toxic chemicals that are most frequently released during the production

of plastics include dichloromethane, acetone, ethylene chloride, methyl ethyl

ketone, styrene, toluene and benzene. Other major emissions include sulphur

oxides, nitrous oxides, methanol, ethylene oxide and volatile organic compounds.

The use of chemicals such as plasticisers, antioxidants, colorants, flame-retardants,

heat stabilizers and barrier resins during plastic production cause toxicity of lead,

cadmium, mercury and other carcinogens.

         carry bags

         Besides creating awareness among the general public on the ill effects of

indiscriminate use of plastic carry bags, the authorities should strictly implement

the 'Rules of 2011' and encourage manufacture and use of qualified substitutes to

plastic carry bags by way of granting subsidy to the manufacturers at least to begin

with. The loss of revenue on this account may only be a fraction of the expenses

incurred by the State and individual citizens on curbing the pollution of the

environment and on maintaining sanitation, hygiene and health and curing the

diseases caused as a result there of. Qualified substitutes include biodegradable

plastic bags, cotton bags with carrying function and paper bags made of recyclable

paper.

</p><p id="p_49">       Evolving a tax preferential policy to manufacturer of biodegradable plastic

bags and substitutes to plastic carry bags may also be explored. The totally

biodegradable plastic bag is less competitive than the non-biodegradable or

partially biodegradable ones for its high-tech, high production cost and small scale.

Therefore the government may consider to evolve a policy to encourage production

of totally biodegradable plastic bags.
</p>
<p id="p_50">24. Creating more awareness among the general public on the ill effects of

indiscriminate use of plastic carry bags and encourage them to go for

alternatives

      The efforts made by the respondents by making a good beginning in creating

awareness among the general public in the state of Madhya Pradesh on the harmful

effects of plastic carry bags, are appreciated. Nevertheless, there still leaves much

to be desired. Public awareness on environmental protection by using alternatives

to plastic carry bags has to be enhanced and efforts have to be sustained.

Apprising children in schools and colleges, general people by way of documentary

on television &amp; radio, talks in Gram Sabhas of Panchayats and through banners

and hoardings in towns among others.
</p>
<p id="p_51">      Strict implementation of rule 10 of the 'Rules of 2011' by the local bodies

to make the general public pay the cost of the plastic carry bags will definitely

help in reducing the consumption of the material consequently reducing the

pollution. It may also be considered to impose a kind of tax on the use of plastic

bags to create value for the plastic bags. It makes the public value the product

more. So it can be reused and recycled. Even a sticker on the vehicle to remind

people to carry a bag / basket before leaving home can prove useful.

</p><p id="p_52">      Further, the challenge facing before the authorities is to improve the solid

waste management system and address littering habits of masses by educating


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                          Page 18 of 29</span>
 them and creating awareness on the ill effects of pollution caused as a result there

of. The solution also lies in segregation of waste at source i.e. at home and

arrangement for recycling of all recyclable waste.
</p>
<p id="p_53">25.    Imposition of ban on the manufacture and use of plastic carry bags

       Some of the countries in the world and some States and Union Territories in

India have completely banned the manufacture and use of plastic carry bags.

Governments around the world are dealing with the plastic bag menace in different

ways. Bangladesh imposed an outright ban on all polyethylene bags in the capital,

Dhaka. Bangladesh was the first country to ban plastic bags in 2002 amid worries

that they were blocking drains during the monsoon.
</p>
<p id="p_54">       The ban in Bangladesh has led to a revival of the jute bag industry and other

sustainable and biodegradable alternatives in the country. Other countries have

since moved to ban, discourage or promote the reuse of plastic bags, hundreds of

billions of which are consumed each year. Denmark and Ireland have both

experimented with taxing plastic bags. Imposition of tax, imposed in Ireland, had

reduced usage by more than 95%.
</p>
<p id="p_55">      The term "white pollution" has been coined in China for the tumbleweed of

polythene blowing on the streets. In China about 2 billion plastic bags are used

each day. To combat the growing problem of plastic bags in China, the government

is planning to introduce a "bag tax" in a bid to help cut the demand for plastic bags

and raise more money to tackle the pollution caused by the bags.

</p><p id="p_56">            Denmark employs a general waste tax that has proven to be very

successful. The waste tax is differentiated so that it is most expensive to landfill

waste, cheaper to incinerate it and tax-exempt to recycle it. It has been called a

"green" tax on packaging and plastic bags.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                          Page 19 of 29</span>
</p><p id="p_58">      Taiwan has introduced a ban on the distribution of free single-use plastic bags

by government agencies, schools and the military. The ban was expanded to

include supermarkets and department stores, and to be applied later to street

vendors.
</p>
<p id="p_59">     Some of the States and Union Territories in India such as Tripura,

Chandigarh, NCT of Delhi have imposed total ban on manufacture, store, import,

sale or transport of polythene/plastic carry bags by invoking the powers vested

with them under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. When such ban imposed

by the Union Territory of Chandigarh was challenged, in it's combined judgment

dated 08.08.2013 in O.A. No. 26 of 2013 (THC) in the matter of Goodwill Plastic

Industries Vs. Union Territory of Chandigarh and Others and in O.A. No. 53

of 2013 (THC) in the matter of Jarnail Singh &amp; Anr. Vs. Union Territory of

Chandigarh and Others, the Principal Bench of this Tribunal dismissed the

Original Applications by upholding the notification dated 30th July 2008 issued by

the Administrator, Union Territory of Chandigarh.
</p>
<p id="p_60">      The Tribunal observed that environmental consequences of such plastic

waste in solid waste are well known as it takes hundreds of years to degrade and

fill up landfill sites. Plastic litter can also lead to clogged drains, which result in

sanitation, flooding and sewage problems. Many countries have largely replaced

the use of plastic bags by either switching over to re-usable bags, bio-degradable or

compostable bags, but in India share of plastic waste in total municipal solid waste

has risen from around half per cent in 1996 to over nine per cent in 2005. Almost

half of this waste comprises used plastic bags and packaging material. The

Tribunal further observed as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_61">      "Further in view of our above discussion, we also consider it appropriate to
direct the authorities concerned in all the States to explore the possibility of
introducing use of biodegradable or compostable plastic bags as opposed to
polythene/plastic bags of any thickness".

</p><p id="p_63">       The respondent authorities in this case also shall take cognizance of the

above observations of this Tribunal and prepare and implement a time bound

action plan to completely dispense with the use of non bio-degradable carry bags in

the States of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.

</p><p id="p_64">26.   Looking to the magnitude of the problem there is a necessity now for the

authorities and more particularly, the Pollution Control Boards and the State

Governments in all the three States of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and

Rajasthan to even consider the need for imposing a ban on the manufacture, sale

and distribution of poly carry bags and making certain areas which are highly

polluted to be declared as 'plastic and polythene free zones'. The Union Territory

of Chandigarh and the State of Tripura have already issued notifications to this

effect. Some of the Cantonments in the country are successfully observing the

plastic and polythene free zones. Such examples can be followed even in the

civilian areas.
</p>
<p id="p_65">27.   As we have stated earlier herein above, what we have stated here and

discussed shall apply not only to the city of Gwalior or other cities in the State of

MP but also to the cities and towns situated in the States Rajasthan &amp; Chhattisgarh

over which this Bench exercises its jurisdiction. We would therefore direct the

Registry to send copies of our judgment to all the three State Governments and

Pollution Control Boards in these three States for compliance and putting the same

before the State level Advisory Body constituted under Rule 11 of the 'Rules

2011'.
</p>
<p id="p_66">28.   As already stated under paras 4 to 17 supra, we perused the replies and

compliance report submitted by the respondents. From the compliance report of the

respondent no. 8, we find that steps for implementation of the provision of the

Plastic Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 2011 have been indicated and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                          Page 21 of 29</span>
 directions also issued but we cannot lose site of the fact that in the city like Bhopal

where there is a population of about 20 (twenty) lakh who regularly on a daily

basis generate waste, there are hardly about 2000 (Two thousand) workers

involved in waste removal and sanitation. This is generally so with respect to most

of the municipalities where the population to municipal employee ratio has

increased vastly over the years. It is, therefore, to be considered by the Municipal

Authorities whether with such a meagre work force and limited infrastructure

facility, is it possible to effectively implement the 'Rules of 2011' with regard to

Plastic Waste (Management and Handling). The local authorities must consider

whether there is a need for increase in the infrastructure and resources for the

aforesaid purpose and take action accordingly. The excuse of financial constraints

must be weighed in the light of the expenses to be incurred both by the State as

well as individual citizens on problems of health and disease as a result of

pollution and unhygienic sanitary conditions created as a result of mishandling of

waste and consequent pollution of air, water and soil. It hardly needs to be stated

that the scales shall weigh heavily in favour of protecting the health of the citizens,

as life is more precious and <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">Article 21</a> of the Constitution mandates that.


</p><p id="p_67">29.   Another point that came up during the hearing was the difficulty in carrying

out searches and raids by the municipal authorities who were entrusted with the

aforesaid task of regulating the distribution and sale of prohibited category of poly

/ plastic carry bags under the rules.
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">      We also find that in some cases conducting of searches and seizure of sub-

standard poly carry bags from retailers / wholesalers is taken up after a long gap

and probably only when there is intervention by the Courts. This has to be done on

regular basis. These searches we have found are very few and far in between. The

municipal authorities who are in the saddle with the aforesaid responsibility under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                             Page 22 of 29</span>
 the 'Rules of 2011' must carry out the aforesaid task on a regular basis and even on

surprise basis. As a matter of fact such petitions need not even be filed before us

or the courts if the authorities under the rule i.e. the Municipal Authorities, the

State Pollution Control Boards and the State Level Advisory Bodies were

effectively performing their duty. Also of there was any shortcomings, the Central

Pollution Control Board to whom annual reports are sent under rule 12 of the

'Rules of 2011', could have given its suggestions to the Central Government if

something more was required to be done by way of inclusion in the rules or their

amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_70">
</p><p id="p_71">30.   While we have emphasised the need for implementation of the 'Rules of

2011' it is also necessary that awareness drive must be carried on regular basis for

making the public aware about the hazard as a result of indiscriminate use of

plastic and polythene carry bags and not discarding them in a proper manner. This

is also a statutory duty under rule 6(c) (v) of the 'Rules of 2011'. While we find

from the letters circulated by the Government of M.P., Urban Administration and

Development Department on 17.10.2013 after this matter was taken up by us on

our suggestion for creating awareness amongst the school children, the

Government may consider incorporating a chapter in the subject of 'Environment'

in the syllabus at School / Board level on the hazards of pollution as a result of

indiscriminate use of plastic carry bags and other pollutants as also what is the

substitute and alternative for the same which is biodegradable and cost effective

and environment friendly. We have noted that during the recent festival season of

Diwali on our suggestion some of the Municipal Boards had made available

environment friendly carry bags made out of recycled paper and biodegradable

material and stalls for the same had been put up in some of the markets in the city

of Bhopal. This was a good step and needs to be followed and pursued on a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                         Page 23 of 29</span>
 regular basis in all towns.      The Municipal Authorities along with Local

Administration and Handicraft Boards as well as Department for Small Scale

Industries may take up incorporation of such work in MGNERGS schemes which

may be more useful and constructive by providing raw material for manufacture of

environment friendly biodegradable carry bags and bags made out of recycled

material. This would not only generate employment but also curb the menace

created as a result of the use of polythene carry bags and plastic and ensure

marketing of such environment friendly bags and make them easily available

through such stalls in each market place, as there is a need for the customer to

carry the material purchased from the shop to his home.

 Authorities) have been able to satisfactorily carry out their task of segregation,

collection and disposal of the plastic waste in accordance with the 'Rules of 2011'.

Given the data available and conditions prevailing on ground reality the answer is

in the negative.    In such circumstances, it is surprising that the Municipal

Authorities have failed to discharge their statutory obligations and duties by not

invoking their power and jurisdiction conferred by the 'Rules of 2011' more

particularly with respect to involving the manufacturers in the process.


</p><p id="p_88">33.   The time has come when the concerned Principal authorities and the

respective State Governments and more particularly in the Local self and Urban

Development department as well as the Pollution Control Boards of the States to

apprise the Municipal Authorities to invoke their powers under Rule 4 read with

Rule 6 of the 'Rules of 2011' and direct the Manufacturers to set up a collection

mechanism for the plastic and poly carry bag waste and provide finances as well

under EPR.     We would therefore direct the respective State Governments of

Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh by sending a copy of this order            to

them and the Pollution Control Boards of these three States to ensure compliance

of the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 more particularly

Rules 4 and 6 thereof. The modalities for the same shall be brought into force

within a period of three months from the date of issue of this order. This is apart

from other regular measures to be carried out by the respective authorities as

provided under the 'Rules of 2011'.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">34.   We would also like to emphasise that under the 'Rules of 2011', under Rule

6, the provisions of various rules mentioned therein as well as procedures to be

adopted by the Municipal Authorities are required to be incorporated in the Bye

Laws of the Municipalities. However, we have not been apprised whether the

compliance of the rule 6(g) has been made so far in any of the three States. It shall

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                           Page 26 of 29</span>
 be the responsibility of the respective Sate Governments to ensure the compliance

of the above provisions and apprise the Municipal Authorities in their respective

States to incorporate the above procedures by either amending the existing bye

laws or frame new ones and bring into force the bye laws to this effect so as to

comply the requirement of the 'Rules of 2011' within a period of three months.


</p><p id="p_91">35.   Under rule 9 of the 'Rules of 2011', every manufacturer of plastic carry

bags, multilayer plastic pouches, sachets needs to be registered with the Pollution

Control Board by submitting the information as per Form-I.


</p><p id="p_92">      Under clause (c) of rule 9 no manufacturer can carry out the activity without

prior registration and that requires compliance of the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a>s of 1981

(Act 14 of 1981) and 1974 (Act 6 of 1974) and the rules made thereunder Rule 10

of the rules mandates that no carry bags shall be made available free of cost by

retailers to consumers. It is the duty of the Municipal Authority to determine and

notify the minimum price of the carry bags depending on their size and quality

which also inter alia covers the taking into consideration of the "waste

management costs".
</p>
<p id="p_93">
</p><p id="p_94">      We do not find that sufficient compliance of these provisions has been made.

In case the cost or price of the carry bag is fixed also taking into account the cost

of waste management and particularly collection by the authorities and is made

prohibitive it may discourage the consumers from asking for the supply of carry

bags which are in practice given free of cost. The amount which would include the

cost of waste management and collection in particular should necessarily reach the

Municipal Authorities for being utilized for this purpose.


</p><p id="p_95">      Thus the State Government, the Pollution Control Boards and the Local

Municipal Authorities should work out a mechanism for recovering this cost for

 waste management and is included in the price at the initial stage of the

manufacture itself. This would be simpler as after leaving the place of

manufacturer the plastic carry bags would have changed several hands.


</p><p id="p_96">36.    Considering all the above and the directions already issued by the concerned

authorities of the state of Madhya Pradesh and the initiatives which have been

taken by the MP Pollution Control Board have been conveyed to all the concerned

parties and the District Administration of all the districts in the state and as they

require some time for full implementation of the 'Rules of 2011', we dispose this

petition at this stage.

Development and Administration Department and Pollution Control Boards of all

monitor the implementation of 'Rules of 2011' in their respective states and shall

file affidavit separately on the progress made in this regard on strict
