    Rakesh kumar Dhingra Vs. Madhya Pradesh Pollution
                 Control Board &amp; Others

       Shri Deepak       Khot, learned counsel for the
petitioner/accused.
       Shri Harish Dixit, learned counsel for the respondent</pre>
<p id="p_1">No.1.
</p><p id="p_2">       None for the respondent No.2, which is a formal party in
this petition.
</p><p id="p_3">       Heard on the question of admission.
</p><p id="p_4">      The petitioner/accused has filed this petition under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C for quashing the entire proceedings of
Criminal Case No. 7724/2008 pending before the Court of
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Gwalior wherein the charge
under <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">Section 26</a> read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">Section 44</a> of Water (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974, was framed against the
petitioner on 08.11.2012.
</p><p id="p_5">      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as per the
contents of the criminal complaint, the alleged offence is not
made out against the petitioner/accused. Hence, the said
charge be quashed. Counsel further contends that earlier the
charge under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">Section 44</a> of the said Act
was framed by the trial Court. The said charge was quashed by
this Court vide order dated 04.05.2012 in M.Cr.C No. 2025/12.
Learned counsel further argues that the observation made by
this Court in earlier order dated 04.05.2012 has no significance
in framing the charge against the petitioner under <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_7">Section 26</a>
read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_8">Section 44</a> of the Act because this Court has issued
direction to the trial Court to frame charge against the
petitioner as per the provisions of law.
</p><p id="p_6">      Learned counsel for the respondent opposing the
submissions made on behalf of the petitioner, contended that
the validity and propriety of the impugned order was
                                           MCRC No. 6233/2014

challenged by the petitioner before the Court of Sessions and
the   impugned   order   was     confirmed   vide   order   dated
19.04.2014 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Gwalior in
Criminal Revision No. 08/2013. Apart from this, on perusal of
the findings recorded by this Court in Para 10 to 13, it
transpires that this Court has observed clearly that an offence
under <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_9">Section 26</a> read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_10">Section 44</a> of the said Act is prima-
facie made out against the petitioner/accused. The findings
recorded by this Court in order dated 04.05.2012 had attained
finality because the said findings were not challenged by the
petitioner before the competent Court. Considering the said
findings of this Court, the trial Court was bound to frame
charge against the petitioner/accused under <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_11">Section 26</a> read
with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_12">Section 44</a> of the said Act. Therefore, no illegality has
been committed by the learned trial Court as well as affirmed
by the Revisional Court in framing the aforesaid charge against
the petitioner. Therefore, this petition filed by the petitioner
having no substance be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_7">      Heard the arguments of both the parties.
</p><p id="p_8">      On perusal of the order dated 04.05.2012 passed by this
Court in MCRC No. 2025/12, it transpires that this Court has
observed in Para 10 to 13 that an offence under <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_13">Section 26</a>
read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_14">Section 44</a> of the said Act is prima-facie made out
against the petitioner/accused, because of that, the charge
framed against him under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_15">Section 25</a> read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_16">Section 44</a> of
the Act was quashed. The observation made by this Court in
Para 10 to 13 reads as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      10.   Testing the factual matrix of the present case,
            on the anvil of the above principle, it is crystal
            clear that the allegations alleged by the
            Pollution Board were regarding offence defined
                                          MCRC No. 6233/2014

            in Section 26 whereas the charge has been
            framed      under   Section     25  (1).    The
            requirements of the prosecution to establish
            the offences defined under Section 26 on one
            hand and 25 (1) on other hand, are distinct, as
            the basic ingredient forming the offences
            under both the above said sections require
            different set of evidence to establish and
            correspondingly different defence of accused.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      11.   Thus framing of charge under Section 25 (1)
            read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_17">Section 44</a> Act of the Water Pollution
            and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_18">Control Act</a>, 1974 can not be
            countenanced in law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      12.   Thus prima facie view arising from the material
            available reflects a prima facie case under
            <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_19">Section 26</a> and not under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_20">Section 25</a> (1) as
            alleged.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      13.   Pertinently though the contravention in the
            impugned charge shown to be of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_21">Section 25</a>
            (1) the Act of 1974 which is incorrect in view
            of the findings recorded herein above as the
            allegations and evidence recorded, disclose
            contravention of <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_22">Section 26</a> of the Act of 1974,
            but since the penal provision of <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_23">Section 44</a> is
            common for both the Sections, this Court
            deems it appropriate that this Miscellaneous
            Criminal Case is disposed of with following
            directions :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            1. The impugned charge dated 12.10.2011
                 and Criminal Case No. 7724/2008 is
                 set-aside.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            2. The decision rendered by the trial Court
                 dated 12.10.2011 taking cognizance of
                 the offence along with the Revisional
                 order dated 08.02.2012 the Criminal
                 Revision 538/2011 are set-aside.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             3. The trial Court directed to frame charge
                 under the appropriate provision on the
                 basis of complaint and the evidence
                 adduced in support thereof and proceed
                 ahead with the trial Court"</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">      Indisputably the legality and propriety of the observation
made by this Court was not challenged by the petitioner before
                                                   MCRC No. 6233/2014

       any competent Court. In this manner the said findings had
       attained finality. The submission of the petitioner to the effect
       that the said observations are not binding on the trial Court to
       frame charge, does not appear to be sound. Once the
       observation has been specifically made by this Court, the trial
       Court is bound to accept the findings and to frame charge
       against the petitioner. In this manner the trial Court has not
       committed any error in framing the charge against the
       petitioner as stated earlier.
</p><p id="p_10">             Earlier petition filed by the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_24">Section 482</a>
       of Cr.P.C was disposed of by this Court with the observation
       made in the order. Therefore, this Court does not deems it fit to
       interfere in the impugned order as well as affirmed by
       Revisional Court as stated earlier in invoking the extraordinary
       jurisdiction of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_25">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_11">             On perusal of the record, it is also evident that the
       statement of the witnesses have been recorded earlier and
       almost the trial was completed, at this stage, the charge was
       amended. In the said circumstances, it can be inferred that the
       trial is likely to be completed.
</p><p id="p_12">             Therefore, the petition being merit-less is hereby
       dismissed with the observation that the trial Court will not
       influence the observation made by this Court or by the earlier
       order, at the stage of deciding the case on merit.
</p><p id="p_13">             The effect of the interim order dated 05.05.2015 is
       hereby vacated.
</p><p id="p_14">             Copy of the order be sent to the trial Court immediately.
