                Dated this the 21st day of June 2016


                           J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner, an industrial unit, has approached this Court

challenging Ext.P7 by which an order has been passed by the

Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to as 'the Board')

under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and control of

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') by which

there is a direction to close down the unit of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.    Petitioner is a company having a unit at Edayar,

Ernakulam.      The unit started functioning in the year 1992.

According to the petitioner, they were complying with all statutory

requirements and, in the meantime, directions had been issued

by the Board to close down the unit and to stop discharge of any

effluent into river Periyar. Ext.P1 is the notice dated 04/05/2016.

Petitioner submitted representations clarifying the various issues

raised by the Board and thereafter the Board conducted a proper

study in the matter and finally petitioner was faced with Ext.P7

order, by which, the Board, while pointing out certain infirmities in

the functioning of the unit, directed closure of the unit. It is inter

alia contended by the petitioner that the Board had not

considered various objections raised by the petitioner and the

factual circumstances involved in the matter had not been

properly appreciated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    This Court had granted an interim order staying further

proceedings pursuant to Ext.P7.        In the meantime, counter

affidavits have been filed by persons who had been impleaded in

the case and the Board has also filed a report as per the

directions issued by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.    I have heard the learned Standing Counsel appearing

for the Board as well as the learned Counsel appearing for

additional respondents 7 and 8. One main objection raised by the

additional respondents 7 and 8 is regarding the maintainability of

the writ petition especially on account of the specific statutory

provision by which an alternate remedy is available under <a href="/doc/2583923/" id="a_3">Section

33B(c)</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">Section 33A</a> and <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_5">33B</a> of the Act reads as under:

         writing to any person, officer or authority, and

         such person, officer or authority shall be bound to

         comply with such directions.

         Act, 2010, in accordance with the provisions of

         that Act."
</p>
<p id="p_11">      5.    Learned counsel appearing for the 7th respondent also

placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/70944169/" id="a_9">Gopal Gas

India and Others [(2012) 8 SCC 326] to contend that after

coming into force of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_10">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010, all

matters in which National Green Tribunal (hereinafter referred to

as 'the Tribunal') has jurisdiction should be referred to the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      6.    Learned     senior   counsel  appearing     for the   writ

petitioner submits that though there is a report by the Board that

appropriate steps have not been taken by the unit as provided

under the consent to operate, petitioner is taking earnest efforts

to install the facility ensuring zero discharge of effluent.

</p><p id="p_13">      7.    Be that as it may, in so far as an alternate remedy is

available to the petitioner to challenge the impugned order, I do

not think that this Court will be justified in interfering with Ext.P7

order, at this stage of the proceedings.          It is open for the

petitioner to approach the Tribunal and seek necessary direction.

The petitioner is granted two weeks' time to approach the

Tribunal and seek necessary direction.

</p><p id="p_14">      This writ petition is disposed of as above.
