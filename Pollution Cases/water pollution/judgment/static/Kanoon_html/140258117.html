</pre>
<p id="p_1">[Order of the Court was made by R.SUBBIAH, J.] 
        The petitioner has filed the present Writ Petition seeking for the
issue of a Writ of Mandamus, forbearing the respondents 1 to 3 herein from in
any way allowing the fourth and fifth  respondents to run the industry in the
name and style of Gnanam Ever Silver Pattarai at Door No.9-A E.V.R.Periyar
Street, Nandavanam Palam Station Main Road, Sellur, Madurai and also direct 
the respondents 1 to 3 to take immediate action against the fourth and fifth
respondents for violating the provision of <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_3">Public Health Act</a> and Madurai City
Municipal Corporation Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. The case of the petitioner is that the fourth and fifth respondents
have been carrying on an Industry in the name and style of 'M/s.Gnanam Ever
Silver Pattarai' i.e., manufacturing ever silver products in the petitioner's
street. The fourth and fifth respondents are manufacturing stainless steel
utensils and engaging labourers for the work of welding, cutting, tinkering,
polishing and spinning by using heavy machineries. Due to the usage of heavy
power equipments and machineries, there is a heavy noise to the surrounding
residents and pollution in that locality. Hence, unable to bear with the
hardships, the petitioner has sent a detailed representation to the
respondents 1 to 3 explaining the difficulties that have been faced by the
petitioner and other residents in that locality. However, no action was
taken.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the
third respondent also, vide letter dated 05.11.2015, has informed the second
respondent that he has found that the fourth and fifth respondents have been
running the industry illegally and unauthorizedly. The Joint Chief
Environmental Engineer of Pollution Control Board, vide letter dated
11.09.2015, requested the third respondent to take immediate action on the
basis of the petitioner's representation. But, so far, no action was taken.
Hence, he is before this Court with the present Writ Petition for the above
stated reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. The main grievance of the petitioner is that in spite of his
complaint about the usage of heavy power equipments and machineries, which  
resulted in heavy noise and pollution in that area, no action was taken by
the respondents 1 to 3. It is to be noted that the fourth and fifth
respondents, without having licence to carry on the business, are running the
industry. Hence, he sought for a direction to consider his representation and
pass orders.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. The second respondent has filed a counter-affidavit stating that
notice under Section 41(8), 42(b), 44 and 134(1) of the Tamil Nadu Public
Health Act was issued to the fourth respondent on 29.01.2016, directing the
fourth respondent not to use the machineries after 10.00 p.m., till 06.00
a.m., and also directed the fourth respondent to take steps to reduce the
sound of machineries.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6. The third respondent has also filed a counter-affidavit stating that
the petitioner has given a complaint against the operation of M/s.Gnanam Ever
Silver Pattarai, which is located next to the petitioner's house and because
of usage of heavy machineries, there were severe vibration, noise pollution
and public nuisance. Further, according to the petitioner, the Unit is
running without local body licence and building plan approval. The complaint
of the petitioner was forwarded to the Commissioner of Madurai Corporation to
take action under the Local Body Act and the <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_4">Public Health Act</a>, vide letter
dated 05.11.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7. It is further stated in the counter-affidavit that another petition
was received from the petitioner on 08.02.2016 against the same Unit. Based
on the said complaint, the Unit was investigated on 12.02.2016 by the
Assistant Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Madurai and it was
observed thus:
</p><p id="p_8">   "The unit was under operation.
</p><p id="p_9">             The unit is located in the residential area.
The unit has provided one lathe, one plate turning machine, 4 no's of
spinning/shaping machine, 2 No's of polishing machine and a welding machine

It is reported that the lathe is not under operation for more than 8 months.
</p>
<p id="p_10">It is also reported that 1 no.of spinning/ shaping has been relocated (i.e.
away from Complainant house) based on the request from complainant 4 months   
before.
</p>
<p id="p_11">It was found that the unit has not provided any noise absorbing materials or
any vibration controlling materials to the machinery and in the unit's

</p>
<p id="p_12">                It is further to submit that no action taken reports has been
received from the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation with respect to the
previous complaints forwarded from this office."
</p>
<p id="p_13">        8. Thereafter, the said complaint was again forwarded to the
Commissioner of Madurai Corporation to take action under the Local Body Act
and the <a href="/doc/17873873/" id="a_5">Public Health Act</a>, vide letter dated 16.02.2016.  Again the Unit was
inspected by a team of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board on 21.04.2016 and
it was observed thus:

</pre><p id="p_22">Other than the machineries listed above, one lathe with 5 hp capacity is also
installed in work shed of 2-1, which is reported to be not in operation for

</p><p id="p_23">Totally, the unit has installed machineries with electric motor capacity of

By observation, it is noticed that the unit is located in the residential
area and complainant house is located on northern side of work shed of 2-I
Significant noise is generated during vessel spinning operation and dust
emission is expected from the polishing area.
No dust/noise control measures are provided in the vessel polishing area."
</p>
<p id="p_24">        9. Pursuant to the same, a show cause notice was issued to the Unit
under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a> for running the industry without valid
consent. The Unit, by reply letter dated 07.05.2016, has stated that it has
removed all the machineries installed nearer to the complainant's house and
requested to grant one month time for removal of few of machineries in other
part of the Unit i.e., Shed No.2-II.
</p>
<p id="p_25">        10. Based on the reply of the Unit, it was again inspected by the
Assistant Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, on 20.05.2016 and on
inspection, it was found that the Unit was under operation, but all the
machineries adjacent to the petitioner's house were removed, except 2 numbers
of welding machines and the manual sheet turning machine. 
</p>
<p id="p_26">        11. Thereafter, the Joint Chief Environmental Engineer (Monitoring),
Madurai was requested by the District Environmental Engineer, Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control Board, Madurai, to conduct a personal hearing with the
Unit, vide letter dated 17.05.2016. Pursuant to the same, the Joint Chief
Environmental Engineer  (Monitoring), Madurai has called for a personal
hearing with the  Unit on 11.07.2016, vide letter dated 28.06.2016. Based on
the report, further action would be taken on the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_27">        12. The grievance of the petitioner is that the second and third
respondents  have not taken any action on his complaint to curtail the heavy
noise and pollution, which the fourth and fifth respondents create by running
the industry.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        13. However, a perusal of the counter-affidavits filed by the second
and third respondents would go to show that on receipt of the complaint
preferred by the petitioner, the officials concerned are taking steps
immediately. In fact, the second respondent has directed the Unit not to use
the machineries after 10.00 p.m., till 06.00 a.m., and the third respondent
has also constantly monitored the position of the Unit. When the official
respondents have taken action against the Unit, this Court need not give any
further direction. Therefore, recording the statements made by the  Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board in the counter-affidavit, more particularly,
their undertaking that as soon as they receive the report from the Joint
Chief Environmental Engineer (Monitoring) Madurai, they would take further
action on the complaint of the petitioner, the Writ Petition is closed. No
costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is also closed.
