</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Judgment delivered by the Bench)


     This appeal has been filed by the appellant herein praying for setting aside
the order passed by the first respondent/Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control dated 30.08.2012 in the Appeal Nos. 110 and 111/2010.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. The gist of the case put forth by the appellant herein is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_3">      (1)     The appellant has been running a dyeing unit at S. F. No. 150,
Kancheepuram, Nallur village, Kasipayalaym post, Tiruppur Taluk and District
since 1987 in synchronizing with the directions issued from time to time by the
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, arrayed as the second respondent herein.
While so, as per the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_1">Vellore
Citizen Welfare Forum vs. Union of India</a> reported in 1996 (5) SCC 647 and the
High Court of Madras in W.P. No. 1649 of 1996 inter alia for installing individual
Effluent Treatment Plant ( for short ETP) in all the dyeing and bleaching units,
the appellant had also installed the individual ETP in the year 1998 to abate the
water pollution and consent for discharging 1.50 lakh liter of trade effluent per
day was granted to the appellant on 07.10.2008. After that, as per the directions
of the Madras High Court, in W.P.No.21791 of 2003 filed by an agriculturist, to all
the dyeing and bleaching units to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (for short ZLD)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     Page 2 of 10</span>
 by installing Reverse Osmosis Plant and Multiple Evaporator System, the
appellant became a member of the Eastern Common Effluent Treatment Plant
Limited (for short ECETP) by making necessary contributions and the said
ECETP had achieved ZLD and it is in operation now. Hence, as on today the
unit of the appellant is a ZLD unit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     (2)      The appellant was running the dyeing unit in a rental premises at S.
F. No. 150, Kancheepuram, Nallur village, Kasipalayam, Vijayapuram Post,
Tiruppur Taluk and District and as the landlord insisted the appellant to vacate
the premises for the former's personal use, the appellant had purchased a piece
of land measuring an extent of 1.49 acre by a sale deed dated 12.06.2008 from
which land it could be feasible to lay down pipe lines to carry the treated and
untreated water to and from the proposed site to the ECETP. Since the landlord
exerted much pressure on the appellant to vacate the rental premises, the
appellant made an application on 22.06.2010 to the 3 rd respondent herein for
shifting the unit from S. F. No. 150, Kancheepuram, Nallur village, Kasipalayam,
Vijayapuram Post, Tiruppur Taluk and District to S. F. No. 12/2I, 2J, 2K, and 2L
in Nallur village, Kasipalayam, Vijayapuram Post, Tiruppur Taluk and District.
The application was rejected by the 3rd respondent on 09.07.2010 on the sole
ground that the proposed shifting is located within one kilometer from the Noyyal
river and thus attracted by the G.O.Ms.No.213, Environment and Forest
Department dated 30.03.1989. Challenging the same the appellant herein had
preferred two appeals before the first respondent/Appellate, Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control: (i) Appeal No. 110/2010 as per <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 and (ii) Appeal No. 111/2010 as per <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_4">section 28</a> of
the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974. Both the appeals were
dismissed by the first respondent/Appellate Authority by a common order dated
30.08.2012.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       Page 3 of 10</span>
<p id="p_5"> (3)    In the grounds for this appeal, the appellant contends that the unit of the
appellant is an existing operating unit situated within 200 meters from the river
and the shifting of the unit from the rental premises to the new place as aforesaid
is situated within 372.5 meters from the river. The Government order dated
30.03.1989 prohibits only the establishment of new industries and not the shifting
of an existing unit from one place to another. Further, the unit which is run in a
rental premises is shifted to the own premises and it is feasible to lay down pipe
lines to carry the treated and untreated water to and from the ECETP through the
proposed site and that the first respondent/Appellate Authority has erroneously
passed an order dated 26.07.2006 in Appeal Nos. 16 and 17 of 2006 which dealt
with the purchase of a leather unit and which is attached with the CETP and the
unit was in operation in the period and kept as vacant site. The facts and
circumstances of the case is not applicable to the appeals of the appellant herein
and which is for shifting the existing unit. The appellant has also contended that
the 1st respondent/Appellate Authority has allowed the shifting of the dyeing units
from one place to another after imposing stringent conditions it is orders dated
10.09.2004 in Appeal No.39/2004, dated 11.08.2008 in Appeal Nos. 115 and
116/2008, dated 17.04.2009 in Appeal Nos. 11 and 12/2009, and dated
06.07.2010 in Appeal Nos. 5 and 6 of 2010. The said orders were implemented
by the second and third respondents by granting the shifting of the dyeing units
and the appellant herein is also entitled for the same relief as a similarly placed
unit. The appellant in the Appeal Nos. 5 and 6 of 2010 is attached with the
ECETP, for which shifting was permitted, in which the appellant herein also is a
member, and therefore, the first and third respondents ought not to have rejected
the claim of the appellant for shifting. The appellant herein further pleads that the
appellant's unit was given consent in the year 1999 as the appellant proved the
case in W.P. No. 1649 of 1996 before the Madras High Court for attaching the
unit with the ECETP, also achieved ZLD, is in operation now and the
Government order dated 30.03.1989 prohibits only new industry and not shifting

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     Page 4 of 10</span>
 of the existing unit. The first and third respondents have not looked into the
principle of sustainable development while considering the claim of the appellant
for shifting and that having implemented the order in similar set of facts, the
second and third respondents are estopped from rejecting the claim of the
appellant. The appellant is ready to abide by the stringent conditions that may be
imposed and in the event of granting the shifting the unit, the appellant
undertakes that it will not increase the discharge of effluent over and above the
quantity for which the respondent/Board has already given the consent and the
appellant will not change the nature of industry or vary or alter the operation or
process without consent of the respondent/Board and the appellant will not use
the old premises for running the dyeing unit or any other industry or process and
the shifting will be done under the supervision of the respondent/Board so as to
comply with the above said conditions. Hence, the appellant prays for setting
aside the orders passed by the second and third respondents and for issue of
directions to the second and third respondents to permit the appellant's unit to
shift    from   S.F.   No.   150,   Kancheepuram,    Nallur   village,   Kasipalayam,
Vijayapuram post, Tiruppur Taluk and District to S.F.No. 12/ 2I, 2J, 2K, and 2L in
Nallur village, Kasipalayam, Vijyapuram post, Tiruppur Taluk and District.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        3.      Per contra, in the reply filed by the second and third respondents,
the facts of the case with regard to the establishment and operation of the
appellant's dyeing unit with the Consent Order dated 07.10.1998 upto
31.10.1998 in a leasehold land, setting up of individual ETP and subsequent
membership of the appellant unit in ECETP are not disputed. Thereafter, when
the application was made on 22.06.2010 by appellant to shift the unit to its own
premises, the same was rejected by the order dated 09.07.2010 of the
respondent/Board on the grounds of the Government order dated 30.03.1989 as
no new industry can be established within the prohibited distance of water
bodies/sources. Aggrieved by the same, the appellant preferred Appeals before

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      Page 5 of 10</span>
 the first respondent/Appellate Authority in Appeal Nos. 110 and 111/2010. Along
with the appeal the appellant enclosed the order dated 26.07.2006 passed by the
first respondent/Appellate Authority in Appeal Nos. 16 and 17/2006 whereby the
first respondent/Appellate Authority granted permission of shifting to the
appellants referred to in the above appeals.       However, the first respondent/
Appellate Authority dismissed the same sustaining the Government order dated
30.03.1989.   A detailed counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the second
respondent/Board before the first respondent/Appellate Authority stating that the
shifting of the appellant's unit would attract the Government order dated
30.03.31989 as the Appellate Authority was not inclined to follow the earlier order
passed in Appeal Nos. 16 and 17/2006. The second and third respondents have,
therefore, prayed the Tribunal for passing appropriate orders.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     4.        On the above pleadings, the following points were formulated for
decision in the appeal:
</p>
<p id="p_8">     (1)      Whether the order of the first respondent/Appellate Authority, Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control in the Appeal Nos. 110 and 111/2010 dated 30.08.2012
and the order of the third respondent in Letter No. F.TPR.0301/RS/DEE/
TPR/2010 dated 09.07.2010 are liable to be set aside as alleged by the appellant
and consequently permission can be granted to the appellant to shift the unit as
required by him.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     5.        The Tribunal heard the arguments advanced on either side and
looked into all the materials available, in particular, the order of the first
respondent Appellate Authority and also the third respondent Board.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     6.        Admittedly, the appellant M/s. Perfect Knit Process, a dyeing unit,
was established in the year 1993. The third respondent Board by its proceedings
No.F2/TNPCB/F.2673/CBE//98 dated 07.10.1998 granted Consent to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    Page 6 of 10</span>
 Appellant unit under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1974 and
Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 upto 31.10.1998.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     7.        Pursuant to the direction of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_8">Vellore Citizen
Welfare Forum vs. Union of India</a> (1996 (5) SCC 647), and also the High Court of
Madras, the appellant, after providing its case, installed individual Effluent
Treatment Plant, and a consent for discharging1.50 lakh litre per day of trade
effluent was granted on 07.10.2008. In W.P. No. 21797 of 2003, the High Court
of Madras inter alia issued directions to all the dyeing and bleaching units to
achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (for short ZLD) by installing Reverse Osmosis
Plant and Multiple Evaporator System. Following the directions, the appellant
became a Member of the Eastern Common Effluent Treatment Plant Limited (for
short Eastern CETP) by making the necessary contribution. The said Eastern
CETP achieving the ZLD is in operation and thus the appellant dyeing unit is a
ZLD unit.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     8.        It is not in controversy that the appellant was running its unit in a
rental premises in S.F.No.150, Kancheepuram, Nallur Village, Kasipalayam,
Vijayapuram Post, Tiruppur Taluk and District. In view of the pressure exerted by
the landlord to vacate the premises, the appellant purchased a piece of land
measuring an extent of 1.49 acres in S.F.No. 12/21, 2J, 2K, 2L in Nallur Village,
Kasipalayam, Vijyapuram Post, Tiruppur Taluk and District by a sale deed dated
12.06.2008 and thus there arose the necessity to shift the dyeing unit from the
rental premises to the own premises.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     9.      The appellant made an application to the third respondent/Board on
22.06.2010 for shifting the unit from the rented premises to its own premises,
which was rejected by an order dated 09.07.2010 on the sole ground that the
same would attract G.O. Ms. No. 213, Environment and Forest Department,
dated 30.03.1989 and no new industry could be established within the prohibited


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   Page 7 of 10</span>
 distance of water bodies/source.       Aggrieved appellant preferred appeals in
Appeal Nos. 110 and 111/2010 before the first respondent, which dismissed the
appeals accepting the contentions put forth by the third respondent/Board. Under
the stated circumstances, the appellant has preferred this appeal before the
Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     10.      After paying an anxious consideration and also making scrutiny of
all the materials available, the Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the order
of the first respondent/Appellate Authority under challenge confirming the order
of the third respondent cannot be sustained for more reasons than one. The third
respondent has categorically admitted that a Consent under the under Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 was issued to the appellant's dyeing unit by its
proceedings dated 07.10.1998. The appellant, who originally set up individual
Effluent Treatment Plant and thereafter became a member of the Eastern CETP
and thus as a unit of the same, the appellant unit can be termed as ZLD unit. The
appellant, who has been carrying on the dyeing unit in a rental premises was
compelled to shift to S.F. No. 12/21, 2J, 2K, 2L in Nallur Village, Kasipalayam,
Vijyapuram Post, Tiruppur Taluk and District, purchased and owned by it.
Necessary application made by the appellant therefor was rejected by the third
respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     11.      Perusal of the order of the third respondent would indicate that on
the grounds for rejection that the setting up of the appellant's unit in a different
place cannot be construed as a shifting of the existing unit, but it would amount
to setting up of a new unit at a different place and apart from that it would attract
the prohibition in G.O. Ms. No. 213, Environment and Forest Department, dated
30.03.1989 and accepting the said contentions of the respondent/Board, the
Appellate Authority also dismissed the appeal. In our opinion, the order of the 3 rd
respondent and subsequent confirmation by the Appellate Authority cannot be
sustained in law.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     Page 8 of 10</span>
<p id="p_16"> 12.   The appellant, who has been carrying on its unit by obtaining the
necessary consent from the 3rd respondent from 1998 onwards and it has joined
as unit of the Eastern CETP who has achieved ZLD. There arose the necessity
to the appellant to shift his unit from the existing rental premises to his own
premises. Shifting of an existing unit by the appellant to a new location cannot be
construed as a new industry since the appellant is shifting the unit to the new
location. In the instant case, it is noticed that the appellant unit is a member of
the Eastern CETP who has achieved ZLD. The case of the appellant is that it is
feasible to lay down pipelines to carry the treated and untreated water to and
from the Eastern CETP through the proposed site is not denied by the
respondent/Board. Under such circumstances, it would be highly unreasonable
refusal of Consent to the appellant on an unsustainable grounds that shifting of
an existing industry, which has been originally functioning with the Consent from
the Board all along and also achieved ZLD, to a new location as anew industry.
</p>
<p id="p_17">13.   Hence, the order of refusal to grant Consent made by the 3 rd respondent
has to be set aside. The Tribunal cannot also subscribe to the order of the
Appellate Authority, which has affirmed the said unsustainable order of the 3 rd
respondent. As pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant, the
Appellate Authority in Appeal Nos. 39/2004, 115 and116/2008, 11 and12 /2009
and 9 and10 of 2010 has already taken a view that the shifting of the existing
dyeing unit to another location would not amount to setting up of a new industry.
</p>
<p id="p_18">14.   The Tribunal is unable to notice any reason or circumstance to make a
deviation from the earlier view recorded by the Appellate Authority in those
judgments'. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal has no option than to set
aside the order of the 3rd respondent refusing to grant Consent and the
subsequent confirmation of the said order made by the first respondent/Appellate
Authority. Accordingly, both the appeals are allowed setting aside the order of the
3rd respondent in Letter No. F.TPR.0301/RS/DEE/TPR/2010 dated 09.07.2010

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    Page 9 of 10</span>
 and also the judgments of the first respondent/Appellate Authority dated
13.08.2012 in Appeal Nos. 110 and 111/2010.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     15.       The 3rd respondent/Board is directed to issue Consent for shifting
the dyeing unit of the appellant from S.F.No.150, Kancheepuram, Nallur Village,
Kasipalayam, Vijayapuram Post, Tiruppur Taluk and District to S.F. No. 12/21,
