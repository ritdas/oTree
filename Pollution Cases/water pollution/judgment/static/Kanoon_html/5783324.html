     of   the   Court   to   the   pollution   caused   to   River   Panchaganga   due   to

     concern  regarding  the  pollution  of  river  Panchaganga   due  to  various

     of epidemic of Hepatitis. The third Respondent in PIL No.183 of 2012 is 

     the Maharashtra Pollution Control board (for short "MPCB"). The fourth

     of more than 5,00,000. Both the cities are located on the bank of the

     originates in Western Ghats.  It is a major tributary to the river Krishna. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">     The   Panchaganga   river   starts   from   prayag   sangam   of   four   streams 
                           
     known as Kasari, Kumbhi, Tulsi and Bhogawati. On north of Kolhapur it 

     has a wide alluvial plain.   Thereafter, it resumes its course eastwards.

<p id="p_7">     From   Kolhapur,   it   flows   for   about   65   kilometers   till   it   falls   into   the 

     Krishna River at Kurundvad.   The said proposal of NEERI records that 
      


     increasing pollution of the river has caused serious health hazards to 
   



     the residents in terms of high incidents of jaundice and other deceases. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">     Ichalkaranji town gets water supply from River Panchangaga as well as 





     Krishna.  In the year 2012, more than 500 new cases of jaundice were 

     reported in the city of Ichalkaranji. The main reason for pollution, as 





     stated   by   NEERI,   is   the   inadequate   domestic   waste   water   treatment 

     facilities in the cities and other areas.

     Respondent Municipal Council are not the only areas contributing to the

                      courts   can   serve   as   an   instrument   of   determining 
      

                      legislative intent in the exercise of its powers of judicial 
                      review under the Constitution. But in the absence of any 
   



                      legislation,   the   executive   acting   under   the   doctrine   of 
                      public  trust  cannot  abdicate  the   natural   resources and 
                      convert them into private ownership, or for commercial 
                      use.   The   aesthetic   use   and   the   pristine   glory   of   the 





                      natural resources, the environment and the ecosystems 
                      of   our   country   cannot   be   permitted   to   be   eroded   for 
                      private, commercial or any other use unless the courts 
                      find it necessary, in good faith, for the public good and

               social   life   has   been   "to   live   in   harmony   with 
               nature". Sages and saints of India lived in forests. 
               Their preachings contained in vedas, upanishadas,

               every form of life. It was regarded as a sacred duty 
               of everyone to protect them. In those days, people 
               worshipped   trees,   rivers   and   sea   which   were 
               treated   as   belonging   to   all   living   creatures.   The

<p id="p_13">           60.  The Constitution of India, which was enforced on 
              ig26-1-1950 did not contain any provision obligating 
                the State to protect environment and ecology, but 
                the people continued to treat it as their social duty 
            
                to   respect   the   nature,   natural   resources   and 
                protect   environment   and   ecology.   After   almost 
                three   decades   of   independence,   the   legislature 
                recognised   the   importance   of   protecting   and 
      

                improving   environment   and   safeguarding   forests

                of Part IVA which enumerates fundamental duties

           either through Nalla or through pipeline. The treatment given 

           to 43.5 MLD is also inadequate in terms of the standards laid

           stated that only 12 MLD sewage per day is collected and taken 





           to   STP.     Thus,   it   is   stated   that   28   MLD   of   sewage   is   being 

           discharged without any treatment in the Panchaganga River.  It 

           is   stated   that   as   far   as   pollution   to   the   river   is   concerned,
