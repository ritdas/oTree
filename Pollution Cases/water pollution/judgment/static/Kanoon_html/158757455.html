<p id="p_1">1.             The Applicant has challenged the decision of
Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), through this
Application filed under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_1">Section 14</a> of the National Green
Tribunal Act, 2010, for the prescribed COD standards of
1000 mg/lt for the Small Scale Industries (SSI), which are
members of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP)
at Vapi, Gujarat.

<p id="p_2">(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2013
</p><p id="p_3"> 2.             The Applicant is an entrepreneur and submits
that SSI plays an important role in the economy of the
country and the growth of SSI units has been actively
promoted by the Govt. of India to ensure balanced
economic growth and to distribute benefits of industrial
development in an equitable manner. The Applicant
further submits that Vapi Industrial Estate was started
by Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC),
Respondent No.2, in 1967 and is spread over 11.4
sq.kms. It is further pleaded that the Govt. of India has
introduced a scheme of Common Effluent Treatment
Plant (CETP) in 1991 and further devised a scheme to
provide financial assistance for installation of Common
Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), in organized industrial
areas. This scheme was an innovative technical and
financial support scheme to ensure industrial growth in
an environmentally compatible manner.             The scheme
envisages the provisions of CETP for SSI industries
through liberal financial assistance from the Central and
State Governments.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.              It is further stated that Hon'ble Gujarat High
Court in the matter of "Vapi Industrial Association Vs
State of Gujarat,in Civil Application No.7780 of
1996, in Spl. Civil Application No.6926 of 1994" vide
order dated 27th February, 1997 has already directed the
units at Vapi, which have no secondary treatment plant
and have not become the members of CETP, shall close
their units by March 13, 1997. The Applicant, therefore,
submits that it is duty of GPCB- Respondent No.1, to
ensure that the units have necessary effluent treatment
plant, so as to meet with the norms and also, that they
operate the same continuously and efficiently. The Vapi
CETP operated by the Respondent-4 accepts industrial
effluent from Member industries for the purpose of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                             3</span>
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2013
 further secondary/tertiary treatment, so as to ensure that
effluent is ultimately discharged fully complying with the
disposal parameters prescribed by the GPCB and so the
units          having       inadequate   treatment   facilities   and
discharging untreated effluent into CETP shall not be
permitted by GPCB to carry out manufacturing activities.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.               The Applicant submits that CETP scheme was
developed primarily for SSI industries and as per the
standards defined under the Environment (Protection)
Rules, 1986, effluent standards                for SSI, i.e. total
discharge up to 25 KL/Day, have been prescribed which
do not include Bio-chemical oxygen Demand (BOD) and
Chemical oxygen Demand (COD) parameters. Similarly,
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) parameter is not also
specified. However, all these three (3) parameters have
been stipulated in the treated effluent quality of CETP
through these standards. It is, therefore, claimed by the
Applicant that SSI industries, which are presently defined
as units whose capital cost of Building and Machinery is
valued at less than Rs.5 crores and which also, generate
industrial effluent less than 25 kl per day, are not
required by Law to treat their effluent to achieve certain
BOD/COD/TDS standards. The Applicant submits that
GPCB has stipulated a uniform effluent quality standard
for all types of industries i.e. large, medium and small as
BOD &lt; 400 mg/lt and COD &lt; 1000mg/lt. The Applicant
submits that small scale industries are not in a position
either financially or technically to provide secondary or
any further treatment after primary treatment to achieve
these stringent additional standards. And as far as large
and medium scale industries are concerned, they are
allowed to join CETP only for hydraulic load at CETP and
not for the purpose of giving further treatment in CETP. It
is the case of the Applicant that the specified inlet


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    4</span>
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2013
 standards of CETP are applicable only to SSI units and as
far as treated effluent quality of large and medium scale
industries are concerned, the Environment (Protection)
Rules, 1986, have specified several specific effluent
standards and also the general standards for the treated
effluents. These standards are specific standards and will
be applicable for large and medium scale industries.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.               The Applicant further submits that performance
of CETP at Vapi, is not satisfactory since long and GPCB
as well as Vapi Industries Association, have been taking
several steps to improve the performance, however, in the
process effluent standards for the small scale industries
are being made more and more stringent, making it
difficult, both technically as well as financially, for SSI
industries to achieve the standard, which is hampering
their growth and even existence. It is further submitted
that non-compliance of CETP, is resulting into harsher
actions by GPCB against defaulting units, either by way
of closure or forfeiture of bank guarantee as a penal
measure and therefore, it is pleaded by the Applicant that
arbitrary parameters set out by the Respondent No.1-
Board for SSI units situated at Vapi Industrial area are in
violation of law. The major prayers of the Applicant are as
under:
</p>
<p id="p_7">"a. Issue direction to modify the parameter of
       quality of discharge effluent to COD Present

</p>
<p id="p_10">6.              The Applicant has also prayed for following in his
Application:

<p id="p_12">7.          The Respondent No.3 i.e. CPCB filed affidavit
through Mr. Ajay Agarwal, Scientist-D, wherein, it is
submitted that there is continuous non-compliance of
standards by the CETP at Vapi, which is fact on record.
The Respondent No.3, further submits that minimum
national            effluent      standards    for   CETP        have    been

 prescribed              as        per   Schedule-I,    of   the     Environment
(Protection) Rules, 1986. The note attached to the
standards states that these standards apply to SSIs, i.e.
total discharge up to 25 KL/D and that for each CETP
and its constituent units the State Board will prescribe
standards as per local needs and conditions, which can
be more stringent. It is further submitted that minimum
national effluent standards for CETP, primarily prescribe
limits only for pH and toxic parameters, therefore, CETP
specific primary treatment limits for other parameters like
BOD, COD and TDS, have to be defined and prescribed
based on the design and capacity of CETP at the local
level by the state boards.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.                The Respondent No.1, i.e. GPCB filed the
affidavit through Tushar Shah, on 19th December, 2013.
The Respondent No.1, submits that the Applicant has
prayed for modification of parameters for discharge of
effluents, which is not at all possible, as they are
requesting                  for    discretionary      treatment.     It   further
mentions that there are separate parameters for bank
guarantee. It is submitted that Vapi CETP is one of the
biggest waste water treatment plant in India and it was
designed by the National Environmental Engineering and
Research Institute (NEERI) in 1997.
</p>
<p id="p_14">9.                Somewhere in 1997, Vapi Industrial Association
took charge of CETP from GIDC and constituted a
company named Vapi Waste Water Effluent Management
Company Ltd. (VWWEMCL), to look after the management
and administration of CETP. GPCB further submits that
the       said         CETP         was     designed     for   55    MLD       and
subsequently some domestic waste water from the
residential area was also diverted to the CETP and as of
now 52 to 55 MLD of industrial effluent released by the
member             units          located   in   the    industrial    estate    is

 drifted/sent                to   the   CETP    through   93    km   long
underground pipeline network. GPCB further submits
that CETP receives partially treated waste water from its
725 member industries situated in Vapi Industrial estate
and all the industries having waste water discharge are
the members of CETP.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.                 GPCB further submits that each member
industry of the CETP has to provide adequate treatment
facilities to meet with CETP inlet norms and all the
industries located in GIDC Vapi, are discharging waste
water into the underground drainage line, after treatment
and after achieving inlet norms. GPCB further submits
that there is no separate drainage line for disposal of
waste water of small, medium and large scale industries.
GPCB puts on record that inlet norms given to all
industries in Vapi industrial area are BOD-400 mg/Lt,
COD-1000 ml/Lt. SS-300 mg/Lt and pH-6.5 to 8.5. It is
also submitted by GPCB that though, earlier CETP inlet
was generally having COD of 1700 mg/Lt. which has now
come down to about 1200 mg/Lt due to various actions
taken by GPCB, which has also resulted in improving
treated effluent quality of CETP from COD 700 mg/Lt to
around 450 mg/Lt against the prescribed standards of
COD &lt; 250 mg/Lt.
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.            GPCB further submits that there is no separate
drainage line for disposal of SSI and for medium and for
large         scale         industries   and    CETP     was   designed,
considering BOD 400 mg/Lt and COD 1000 mg/Lt and
CETP was designed and constructed for all the industries
in GIDC Vapi. GPCB has further submitted that it is
taking actions against non-complying units irrespective of
large, medium and small scale industries to ensure that
CETP outlet is as per desired quality. GPCB, therefore,
resisted the Application, and sought dismissal thereof.

</p><p id="p_18"> 12.              Respondent No.4, filed affidavit through Shri.
Rajesh Doshi, CEO. The Respondent submitted that they
have taken over the charge of CETP from GIDC, after it's
commissioning in 1997 and present Respondents are
responsible for taking care of all the aspects of operation
and maintenance of CETP. It is submitted that CETP is
designed to treat partially treated effluent collected from
all industrial units in GIDC industrial estate, through
GIDC owned drainage network. Presently, approximately
677 (0 to 50 KL/542 units, 51-500 kl:108 units and
above 500 kl :27 units) out of 723 registered member
units are discharging effluent into CETP. Treated effluent
from CETP is discharged into tidal zone of river 'Daman-
Ganga' which flows at a distance of 300m from CETP,
before joining Arabian Sea.
</p>
<p id="p_19">13.               The Respondent No.4, further submits that all
through the area of GIDC, common drainage network, is
provided to discharge effluent, so it will be difficult to
monitor whether proper treatment to the effluent is
provided by the individual industry or not. Moreover,
there is no individual water meter (discharge reading) or
isolation valve, installed at the discharge end of the
industry. It is further mentioned that the Respondent
No.4, accepts all the discharge from all the industries and
as such, there are no internal segregation of pipeline,
which can differentiate effluent of small, medium or large
scale industries and treat each one separately. It is
further submitted that all the member industries have
already agreed to discharge effluent of maximum 1000
mg/Lt. of COD after considering the norms set out by the
regulatory Authorities and also design of CETP. It is
further submitted that some of SSI units at times do not
care to provide even primary treatment and discharge
effluent with more than 10,000 mg/Lt of COD. Even they

 do not intimate change in product and accordingly, there
is significant change in the effluent quality and quantity.
The Respondent No.4, therefore, finally submits that any
modification in the standards based on the industry
categorization is not possible and would put CETP
operation in jeopardy.

<p id="p_20">14.              During hearing on 20th December, 2013, CETP
standards as defined under the Environment (Protection)
Rules, 1986,                were    also   discussed   and   considering
footnote and also other standards prescribed for various
types of industries, the Tribunal had specifically asked
GPCB i.e. the Respondent No.1, and Respondent No.4, to
explain in detail fixation of standards for SSI and
medium/large                scale    industries    along     with     detail
justification and powers conferred upon the Authorities.
GPCB further filed an affidavit through Mr. Tushar Shah,
on 3rd March, 2014, which has conveniently scuttled this
particular query and has not filed any supporting
documents, statutory provisions or policy decision, which
have been relied upon by the Respondent No.1- GPCB,
while fixing the standards for individual industries i.e.
small, medium and large scale.

<p id="p_25">           4. Whether the decision of the Board requiring
                industrial units to furnish bank guarantee is
                without jurisdiction and is of penal nature, and
                thus impermissible under the provisions of the

</p>
<p id="p_26">16.            Before proceeding to deal with core issues, we
would like to record the development of CETPs in India.
SSI industries have long been identified as one of the
major pollution source and also difficult to control
pollution.            The         Govt.        of    India,   therefore,   initiated
innovative                  scheme        to        provide    Common      Effluent
Treatment Plant (CETP), which was adopted to achieve
end-of-the-pipe treatment for the common effluents
generated from SSI units for the benefit of scale in the
treatment process and technology.                               SSI units find it
difficult to have full-fledged effluent treatment plant of its
own due to complexity of effluent composition, scale of
pollution load, financial viability and low technical
expertise. This was more relevant in chemical sector as
complexity of industrial effluents is very high and vary
depending on processes and number of stages in
manufacturing, making effluent composition difficult to
treat. MoEF, Govt. of India, therefore, initiated a scheme
to provide financial support to CETP to ensure the growth
of       small              and      medium               entrepreneurs    in     an
environmentally compatible manner in 1991. Though this
scheme was initiated for ten (10) years, considering the
usefulness,                 the   scheme            was    extended,   with     some


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                                  11</span>

 revisions, from time to time. CETP                            also facilitates
restriction of number of discharge points in the industrial
estate for better enforcement and also to make skilled
manpower available for proper treatment of effluent. More
than 130 CETPs have now come up in the country.
However,             CETP      itself   is   a   complex      technical   and
management concern, where significant variations in
terms of effluent quality, effluent quantity, composition,
shock          load,        effluent    treatability   etc.     pose   serious
challenge             in    efficient    management        of    CETP.    The
guidelines for CETP scheme prepared by MoEF, defines
that SSI as unit, whose plant and machinery are valued
at less than 5 crore. This categorization is basically
derived from MSME Act, which is also a standard way of
categorization of SSI industries with institutions like RBI
etc. In the initial stage of this CETP development only SSI
industries were allowed to join CETP, that too with less
than 25 KL/Day effluent. Subsequently, MoEF has taken
a decision to amend the CETP scheme to allow other SSI
units generating more than 25 KL/Day effluent to CETP,
and also, the large and medium scale units, subject to
their meeting individual treatment standards. The recent
revision in CETP scheme stipulates that large and
medium scale industries, other than those belonging to
17 categories of heavily polluting industries, may join
CETP after primary treatment or as considered necessary
by the SPCB for the purpose of hydraulic load and for
techno economic viability of CEPT. However, it has to be
ensured that CETP primarily serves effluent discharge by
SSI.

of the pace of life and we may prefer in this case not to go
merely by a comma followed by 'i.e.' used in Note-1

matter of convenience and of meaningfulness, yet, a more
thoughtful              use     of    commas    and        other    modes   of

follows upon a comma governs every clause that precedes
the comma is a matter not free from doubt. The Tribunal,
therefore, considers it more safe and satisfactory to
discover the true meaning of Note-1 by having regard to
the substance of the matter as it emerges from the object
and purpose of the Act, the context in which the
expression is used and the consequences necessarily
following            upon       the    acceptance     of     any    particular

 which are discharging total effluent up to 25 KL/Day. So
this categorization can be considered as based on
volumetric effluent load generated by the industry. As
mentioned earlier, guidelines and literature available on
CETP categorizes industries into small, medium and large
scale based on the financial capital investment. It is now,
therefore, necessary for this Tribunal to adjudicate on the
particular issue. Similarly, Note-2, stipulates that State
Board will prescribe standards as per local needs and
conditions. This can be more stringent than those
prescribed above. The plain reading of this stipulation
also lead to interpretation that though State Boards are
allowed to prescribe the standards as per local needs and
conditions, these can be more stringent than prescribed
one. This stipulation cannot be interpreted, as State
Board can have the powers to prescribe the standards by
relaxing the standards. Both components of above
sentence of Note-2, need to be read conjointly and
concurrently and cannot be read in isolation.                      Second
part of Note-2, also prescribes that in case of cluster of
units, the State Board with concurrence of CPCB in
writing,          may       prescribe   suitable   limits.   Here    also,
stipulation             envisages   prescription   of   suitable    limits
considering special and unique nature of industrial area
and this cannot be interpreted as authorizing SPCB to
relax the standards for cluster of units.

us to Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index of
Vapi Industrial cluster, whereby Vapi, has been declared
as one of the "Critically" polluted areas in the country.

in 2010, it is observed from the reports of treated effluent
quality at CETP Vapi submitted by GPCB, that even now
treated effluent is not meeting the prescribed standards,
though           there      are   claims    that   there    is   significant
improvement                 in    treated    effluent      quality.    This
demonstrates a need on the part of GPCB, to take
innovative enforcement measures to achieve treated
effluent quality of CETP, which is the final aim of the
entire process.

<p id="p_42">24.            As stated above, it was brought to the notice of
the Tribunal by the Applicant that while stipulating
stringent standards of 1000 mg/Day of COD to SSI
industries, GPCB has also specified similar standards for
large and medium scale industries thereby vitiating and
deviating the basic concept of CETP, which has been
developed for benefit of SSI. This fact of similar standards
for small, medium and large scale units, is also confirmed
in the affidavit of GPCB. We had, therefore, asked GPCB
to put on record explanation regarding fixation of
standards for SSI units and large/medium scale units,
however, during last hearing on March 7, 2014, the
Counsel fairly admits that this aspect has not been dealt
with in the affidavit filed on that day and also, makes
statement that he does not have any specific instructions
on the above aspect.

 more than 25 KL/Day, are strictly outside the standards
prescribed in the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986,
for CETP inlet standards.                     Accordingly, we find that
primary treatment standards, as defined in inlet effluent
quality          standards        of   CETP      stipulated    under      the
Environment                 (Protection)   Rules,    1986,     cannot     be
uniformly applied to all types of industries contributing to
CETP for their treated effluent quality standards. Hence,
the Issue No.1, is answered in Negative.

<p id="p_44">26.            As stated above, the above CETP inlet standards
under Entry No.55 of the EP Rules, 1986, are not
applicable to large and medium scale industries, on
volumetric load basis, which are generating more than 25
KL/Day             effluent     and    also    the   Rule     3(2)   of   the
Environment (Protection)                   Rules, 1986, empowers the
State Boards only to make more stringent standards, it is
clear that GPCB does not have necessary legal powers to
relax treated effluent quality standards for the industries
generating more than 25 KL/Day effluent, whether they
are small, large or medium scale industries, even based
on economic investment criteria. The justification given
by GPCB like common drainage network also does not
hold good, as standards are enforced at the outlet of
individual industry and GPCB is expected to enforce the
standards at the outlet of industry and not at the
common network. Therefore, Issue No.2 is also answered
in Negative.

       against whom the same are required to be issued. It
       will be beneficial to reproduce <a href="/doc/1730116/" id="a_31">Section 34(3)</a> for
       ready reference.

       (2). Xxxxxx
       (3) The person, officer or authority to whom any
       direction is sought to be issued shall be served with
       a copy of the proposed direction and shall be given
       an opportunity of not less than fifteen days from the
       date of service of a notice to file with an officer
       designated in this behalf the objections, if any, to
       the issue of the proposed direction."

       proposed directions were communicated to the
       Appellant as required in the manner stated above.
       Needless to say there is non-compliance of Rule
       34(3) of the Water (Prevention and Control of
       Pollution) Rules, 1975. For this reason, the
       impugned direction issued by the WB Pollution
       Control Board is bad in law since it has been issued
       without having any legal authority. We are of the
       opinion that the Pollution Control Appellate Authority
       (P.C.A.A.) (WB) failed to take into account this
       important legal flaw while passing the impugned
       order dated 24.07.2012. The Appellate Authority
       committed error while holding the Appellant
       vicariously liable and to uphold the direction to pay
       pollution cost. We are of the opinion that the WB
       Pollution Control Board may not issue consent to
       operate the unit unless the other conditions
       enumerated at serial nos. 1 to 4 in the directions
       issued by the WB Pollution Control Board are
       complied with by the Appellant. The grant of consent
       to operate or to refuse the same if certain conditions
       are not complied with by the Appellant, is within the
       discretion of the Board (WB PCB).

       direct recovery of pollution cost. Considering the

<p id="p_57">       68. Before entering into the realm of general
       discussion and the directions that the Tribunal
       needs to pass in the facts of the present case and in
       the larger administration of environmental justice,
       we may answer the issues/questions formulated by
       us in paragraph 24 of this judgment. The answers
       are as follows: -

                 interregnum for compliance and/or in the
                 nature of compensation cannot be held to be
                 without the authority of law or jurisdiction,
                 in so far as it is not penal or punitive.

                 of the conditions stated in the consent order

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">               c. The order of the Appellate Authority suffers

                    invoked by the Board as per terms of the
                   guarantee. Consequently, the Board would
                   be entitled to receive the guarantee amount,
                   however, would be entitled to use the same
                   only for the purposes of compliance and/or
                   for making good the environmental loss or
                   degradation caused by the applicant.
</p><p id="p_59">           74. We hold that the condition requiring the
            respondents to furnish the bank guarantee is
            not penal and encashment thereof is neither
            unjustified nor covered under any of the
            exceptions stated in the judgment of the
            Supreme Court in the case of Vinetec
            Electronics Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
</p><p id="p_60">           75. However, we further direct that the amounts
            received by the Board against encashment of
            bank guarantee shall, in preference to all other,
            be utilised for the compensatory purposes or
            restoration of the degraded environment
            resulting from emission and discharge of
            effluents and other pollutants in violation of the
            prescribed standards by the industry.
            Remnant, if any, may be utilised for
            installation    of   such   effluent    treatment
            plants/anti-pollution devices, directed to be
            installed under the order of consent or
            otherwise in the unit of the industry as it
            would      help    in   bringing     down      the
            emission/pollution levels and bringing it in line
            with the prescribed parameters, thus protecting
            the environment. The Board shall have no
            authority or power to forfeit this amount and
            use it for any other, including for its own,
            purposes.
</p><p id="p_61">32.            The purport of all these Judgments will show
that the SPCB cannot use the BG as a penal measure
against any non-compliance, but can seek/invoke the BG
for ensuring time-bound and well defined substantial
improvements in the pollution control system. In simple
words, BG regime shall not be used or rather misused as
"pollute and pay'. Nor the BG regime can be used as
substitute for the legal action against the non-compliance
as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_33">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_34">Air Act</a>, and EP Act.

 envisaged under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_35">Air Act</a>s before the competent
Court of Magistrate. Neither the BG can be taken as
penalty or compensation for pollution. Wherever the
Board requires a unit to furnish bank guarantee for
compliance of conditions of consent order, installation of
anti-pollution devices and ensuring that it is a pollution-
free unit, then, in such cases, the Board should ensure
that its order provides for a 'time targeted action plan'. In
default of which and upon inspection, such bank
guarantee would be liable to be invoked/encashed for
environmental compensation and restoration purposes.

<p id="p_62">33.            CETP at Vapi is continuously not meeting with
the       norms             and,   therefore,   any   relaxation   of   inlet
standards to the units, which are covered under CETP
inlet effluent quality standards, needs to be viewed in
that context. The Applicant has prayed for relaxing
standards for SSI industries (on economic criteria) of
applicable parameters of BOD/COD. We are not inclined
to issue any specific order in this regard, as CETP is not
performing as per the standards and any further
relaxation can further deteriorate the quality of CETP
treated effluent. In any case, the CETP inlet and outlet
standards need to be complied simultaneously, obviously,
with a more emphasis on outlet standards considering
the impacts on environment on Precautionary Principle.
We, therefore, grant liberty to the Applicant to approach
GPCB with the request along with duly technical
justification that the enhanced pollution load due to such
relaxed standards will not affect operations of CETP, and
also, the safeguards to ensure that the apprehensions
raised by GPCB and plant operators like release of shock
load by SSI units, discharge of untreated effluent, change
in characteristics of effluents etc., are fully addressed.
