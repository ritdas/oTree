                  ===================

              Dated this the 20th day of June, 2012

<p id="p_1">       The writ petition was filed challenging Exts.P14 and P15.

Ext.P14 is a direction issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control

Board exercising its powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 directing that the

hotel of the petitioner shall be closed till adequate pollution

facilities are provided with the approval of the Board. Ext.P15 is a

consequential communication issued by the Panchayat.

</p><p id="p_2">       2.   Apart from contending that the Hotel has its own waste

disposal facilities, petitioner has no case that it has installed an

effluent treatment plant for discharge of effluents. If that be so,

Ext.P14 order issued by the Board cannot be said to be illegal

warranting interference, muchless in a proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3.   Realising this difficulty, learned counsel for the

petitioner   today    undertakes   before   this  Court   that   the

requirements laid down by the Pollution Control Board will be

complied with by them by installing necessary facilities within

WPC.No.35020/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 :2 :</span>



four months from today.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.    Taking note of this submission and also considering the

fact that the petitioner is a running establishment and that this

order has been remaining stayed on account of the interim orders

passed by this court in this writ petition, I feel the time as sought

for should be granted to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     Therefore, recording the undertaking of the learned counsel

for the petitioner, this writ petition is disposed of directing that

the hotel will be permitted to function for four months from today

subject to the petitioner obtaining necessary licence from the 1st

respondent Panchayat and also getting the facilities installed by

them approved by the Board in the meanwhile.
