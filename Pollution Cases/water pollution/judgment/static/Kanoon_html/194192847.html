HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ALOK SHARMA

Mr. Prateek Kasliwal, for the petitioner.

BY THE COURT</pre>
<p id="p_1">		Admittedly the impugned notice dated 10.05.2016, issued by the Member Secretary, Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, Jaipur is amenable to appeal under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. The jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is discretionary. I am of the view that as the petitioner has an efficacious alternate remedy, it should be required to resort thereto.
</p><p id="p_2">		It is directed that looking to the urgency in the matter, in the event of an appeal being filed by the petitioner against the impugned notice dated 10.05.2016, it be decided by a reasoned order within four weeks of its filing.
</p><p id="p_3">		The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly. 
</p><p id="p_4">		Stay application needs no address in view of the petition itself having been disposed of.
