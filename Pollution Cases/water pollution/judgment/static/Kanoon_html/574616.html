T.S.Thakur, Chief Justice (Oral)

            This petition pose a question of validity of an order passed by

the Chairman, Haryana Pollution Control Board dated October 17, 2008

issued under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981, directing closure of all mining operations carried out by the

petitioner for mining of minor mineral quarry in Villages Ramgarh /

Sherifpur and Village Chandpura in district Ambala. When this petition

came up before us on November 17, 2008, it was inter alia pointed out by

Mr. Bali, counsel appearing for the petitioner that the government had not

properly notified the constitution of the Board and the Members comprising

the same, as required under <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_3">Sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/186527788/" id="a_4">7</a> of the Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, nor had the government appointed

appellant authority as required under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_6">Section 31-A</a> of the Act. The validity

of the impugned order passed by the Chairman of the Board was on that

ground assailed by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Learned Advocate General, appearing for the State of Haryana

and the Pollution Control Board had however sought time to sort out the

matter and to take steps for notification of the Board as also the

constitution of an appellate authority in terms of <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_7">Section 31</a> of the Act

aforementioned.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Mr. Hooda has today filed before us copies of two notifications,
</p><p id="p_8">             -2-          CWP No. 18971 of 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_9">one dated 21.11.2008 issued under <a href="/doc/281550/" id="a_8">Section 4(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/369085/" id="a_9">5(1)</a> of Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 nominating the Chairman

and the Members of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. By the 2nd

notification dated November 26, 2008, the government have constitution an

appellate authority comprising Justice A.S.Garg, a former Judge of this

Court, as President with two other members. It is submitted by Mr. Hooda

that with the issue of the above notifications deficiency if any in the

constitution of the Board and the appellate authority in terms of the Act

stands removed. He further points out that the State Pollution Control

Board has already entertained an application filed by the petitioner for the

issue of "Consent to Establish" (Post Facto) the unit for mining of minerals

in the villages mentioned above and issued the requisite consent in terms

of <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_11">Section 21(1)</a> of the Act. A copy of the said Consent order has also been

placed on record by Mr. Hooda. He argues that with the issues of consent,

the petitioner can if so advised seek "Consent to Operation" the said unit

after complying with all other requirements stipulated for the same.

the issue of "Consent to Establish" in favour of the petitioner, the petitioner

compliance with the conditions stipulated for the same. He submits that this

petition could be disposed of with a direction that the Board shall entertain

the application for issue of "Consent to Operate" and pass appropriate

orders on the same, in accordance with law, expeditiously.

</p><p id="p_11">            In the circumstances therefore, and keeping in view the

submissions made at the Bar, we are inclined to dispose of this writ petition
