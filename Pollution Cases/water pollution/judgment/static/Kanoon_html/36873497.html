                      81/18C, Panampatti Village, Iluppur Taluk, Pudukottai District. By a registered

                      sale deed dated 28.04.2011 bearing Doc.No.848/2011 registered at the office of

                      the Sub-Registrar, Anna Vasal, the petitioner purchased the property and

                      with adequate air and water pollution control measures. The Revenue Authority,

                      viz., Tahsildar issued patta evidencing the possession of the petitioner over the

                      lands and the Assistant Engineer, Tamil Nadu Electricity Board issued a

                      Certificate certifying that the petitioner is having electricity Service Connection

                      for carrying on stone crushing unit in the said lands. The petitioner-Unit also

                      installed dust containment system like Zinc sheet cover at the emission sources

                      and the dust suppression system like water sprinkler arrangement in their Unit.

                      They have also installed adequate pollution control measures in their Unit to

                      contain air and water pollution. The petitioner-Unit is 500 metres away from the

                      approved habitation which is evident from the Certificate dated 27.05.2016

                      issued by the Tahsildar, Kadayampatti Taluk.

<p id="p_3">                            3. It is the further case of the petitioner that even though they obtained

                      permission from various statutory authorities to run the stone crushing unit, the

                      petitioner inadvertently did not apply for consent from the respondent-Tamil

                      Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) in the year 2013. On 12.01.2018, the

                      TNPCB authorities inspected the Unit and issued a show cause notice as to why

                      the Unit should not be closed, as they are running the Unit without valid consent

                      from the TNPCB. The petitioner applied for consent from the TNPCB to run the

                      Unit. The petitioner has made application through online on 27.01.2018 and

                      thereafter re-submitted the same after rectifying the defects on 30.03.2018 for

                      grant of consent both under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

                      necessary documents for grant of consent from the second respondent-TNPCB

                      and the petitioner also paid consent fee under both the said Acts from the year

                      2013, as they were running the stone crushing Unit from the year 2013. After

                      conducting inspection of the Unit, the second respondent rejected the grant of

                      consent on 19.03.2018 by proceedings under both the said Acts on the grounds

                      that one M/s.Selvi Industries, M/s.Sri Jeyamurugan Crusher, M/s.Sri Bagavathi

                      Crusher and M/s.Sri Bagavathi Blue Metals are located within 1 kilometer radius

                      from the petitioner-crushing Unit and the present habitation, viz., Panampatti

                      of the TNPCB, which were dismissed on 18.12.2018, against which the present

                      Writ Petition is filed by the petitioner-Unit.

                      rejected mainly on the ground that four crushing Units referred to above, are

                      located within a distance of 1 Km from the petitioner-Unit and as on date, all

                      those four stone crushing Units are either abandoned or suspended, and

                      therefore, there cannot be any impediment for the TNPCB to grant consent to

                      the petitioner-Unit.

<p id="p_6">                             6. The respondents 1 and 2/TNPCB have filed a detailed counter affidavit,

                      and it was indicated that the said four crusher Units are located within 1 Km

                      radius from the petitioner-Unit and it was also indicated therein that M/s.Selvi

                      Industries and M/s.Sri Jeyamurugan Crusher were not in operation and M/s.Sai

                      Hridham Infraa Private Limited (formerly M/s.Sri Bagavathi Crusher) is carrying

                      they are not in operation. In respect of the third Unit, it was renewed upto
