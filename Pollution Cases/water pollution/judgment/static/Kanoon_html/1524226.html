</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Challenge in the writ petition is against Ext.P14

order, which is one seen to have been passed by the

Chairman of the Pollution Control Board. Essentially,

the Chairman was only reiterating the stand taken by

the Board in this regard and therefore, Ext.P14 also

may be treated as an order passed by the Board itself,

contends the learned Standing Counsel for the

Pollution Control Board. It is further pointed out by

the counsel for the Board that the order is therefore,

appealable before the Appellate Authority under the

Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Pollution Act</a>. Submission is recorded.

appeal against Ext.P14 within three weeks from today,

the Appellate Authority under the Act shall consider

the same    as having been filed within time.          The

Appellate Authority    shall also treat the appeal as

maintainable.  It will not be         open to the Pollution

Control Board to raise a contention as regards the

maintainability of the appeal. Orders shall be passed by

the Appellate Authority without delay. Other contentions

of the petitioner are left open.
