ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	present acquittal Appeal has been filed by the appellant ?  Law
	Officer under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, against
	the Judgment and order 26th December, 1997, rendered in
	Criminal Case No. 1693 of 1990, by the learned Judicial Magistrate,
	First Class, Kadi, whereby the learned Magistrate has acquitted the
	accused from the offences charged against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">It
	is the case of the appellant ?  original complainant that as Law
	officer in Gujarat Pollution Control Board he was authorized to
	prosecute the persons who commit the breach of the provision of
	<a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act,
	1974 (for short ?Sthe Water Act??). The respondent No.1 is a
	limited company and the respondents No.2 to 6 are the Directors and
	the respondent No.7 is the Manager of the said respondent No.1 ? 
	Company. The respondent No.1 company was producing Aata, Soji, etc.
	and for that purpose they were using about 3000 ltrs. of water and
	thereafter the respondents were discharging the polluted water out
	side in open place without purification. The respondents have not
	obtained any permission from the Gujarat Water Pollution Control
	Board (for short ?SGPCB??). The complainant thereupon had visited
	the place of the respondents and found that the respondents are
	discharging the effluent/polluted water without any permission and
	thereby they have committed the offence punishable under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water
	Act</a>. Thereupon the complainant filed Complaint under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">25</a>
	read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_6">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_7">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_8">47</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">The
	learned JMFC framed the charge Ex.127 against the accused.
	Thereafter the evidence was led and after hearing the parties the
	learned Magistrate came to the conclusion that the prosecution has
	failed to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted
	all the accused from the charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Being
	aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said Judgment and order dated
	26/12/1997 rendered by the learned JMFC, Kadi, in Criminal Case No.
	1693 of 1990, the appellant has preferred this Appeal, in the
	capacity of the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Heard
	learned APP Ms. Mita Panchal for the State and learned Senior
	Advocate Mr. Prakash Thakkar on behalf of the respondents ? 
	original accused.
</p>
<p id="p_6">It
	is contended by learned APP that the Judgment and order of the trial
	Court is against the provision of law; the trial Court has not
	properly considered the evidence led by the prosecution and looking
	to the provisions of law itself it is established that the
	prosecution has proved the ingredients of the offence against the
	present respondents. Learned APP has also read the oral as well as
	the documentary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">On
	behalf of the respondents ?  accused learned Senior Advocate Mr.
	Prakash Thakker has contended that the matter is very old. The
	complainant has not verified the fact that from where the polluted
	water was found and at that time there was a full rainy season and
	nobody can say that who has committed the offence in question.
	Lastly, he contended that the learned Magistrate has assigned cogent
	reasons and after fully appreciating the evidence the learned
	Magistrate has rightly acquitted the accused from the offences
	charged against them.
</p>
<p id="p_8">I
	have gone through the Judgment and order passed by the learned
	Magistrate. I have also perused the oral as well as documentary
	evidence led before the trial Court and also considered the
	submissions made by the learned Counsel for the respective parties.
	From the evidence itself it is established that the prosecution has
	not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. When the prosecution
	has failed to establish its case against the accused then the
	accused are entitled to get the benefit of doubt and there is no
	reason to interfere with the reasons assigned by the learned
	Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_9">It
	is settled legal position that in acquittal Appeal the appellate
	Court is not required to re-write the Judgment or to give fresh
	reasonings when the reasons assigned by the trial Court acquitting
	the accused. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of STATE OF
	KARNATAKA v/s. HEMAREDDY, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417,
	has observed that when the Appellate Court agrees with the reasons
	and the opinion given by the lower Court then the re-discussion of
	evidence is not necessary. In the instant case, this Court is in
	full agreement with the reasons given and findings recorded by the
	trial Court while acquitting the respondents ?  accused and
	adopting the said reasons and for the reasons aforesaid, in my view,
	the impugned Judgment is just, legal and proper and requires no
	interference by this Court at this stage. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">In
	view of above discussion, I see no reason to interfere with the
	findings arrived at by the trial Court. Hence, this Appeal requires
	to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">In
	the result, the Appeal is hereby dismissed. The impugned Judgment
	and order dated 26.12.1997 passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Kadi, in
	Criminal Case No. 1693 of 1990 acquitting the respondents ? 
	accused, is hereby confirmed. Bail bonds, if any, shall stands
	cancelled.
