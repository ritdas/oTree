         No.4, these experts can only be held responsible under

         the provision of <a href="/doc/19056/" id="a_26">Section 34</a> of the Act and the prosecution

         cannot lie against the directors. This submission is not at





         all acceptable. In view of provision of <a href="/doc/19056/" id="a_27">section 34</a> of the Act

         not only directors but also its officers who are involved in

         the manufacture of such substance can be prosecuted.

                    quite different which is apparent from the fact that firstly the
                    controversy of the complaint not having any necessary




                                                      
                    averments was not present before the High Court in the
                    reported decision. Secondly, in that case, there was only a
                    bald statement that the respondents were directors of the




                                                     
                    manufacturers.    In   the   present    matter,      however,       the
                    respondents were not arrayed only because they were the
                    directors. That is certainly one reason. However, in addition
                    to that, a statement has been made in paragraph 6 of the




                                          
                    complaint that by manufacturing of the concerned medicine
                             
                    for sale, the company and its directors had committed the
                    breach of the Act. Thus, there was an allegation that the
                    directors were privy to the manufacturing of medicine by the
                            
                    company.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">                    8.    In our opinion, the averments in paras 4,5,6 and 8 of the
      

                    complaint cannot be described as the bald statements. The
                    emphasized portion in para 6 of the complaint suggests
   



                    manufacturing of the medicine by the company and its
                    directors. The averments in all these paras would have to be
                    read together and the para 6 of the complaint would have to





                    be read in the light of the other averments. It seems that in
                    the reported decision in the complaint, there           was no link
                    pleaded in the directors and the manufacturing process.
                    That is not the situation here. This was the case of the





                    manufacture of the drug for human consumption and after it
                    was tested in laboratory, was found to be defective since
                    there was a growth of fungus, which is a very serious matter
                    related to public health."

                       the     proceeding    can   be    quashed         by    using

                       and <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_68">section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. The difference between

                       degree of scale and diligence as would amount to

                       take on his own behalf. In view of these
                       provisions, the question arises as to whether the
                            
                       Food Inspector is expected to collect aforesaid
                       information from the Company. For that, one
                       needs to go through the provisions of the Act
      


                       which give powers to the Food Inspector. In this
   



                       regard, there is only provision of <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_80">section 14-A</a> of
                       the Act. As the samples were collected from the
                       manufacturer/ its employees, it can be said that





                       there       was   no   question       of     seeking         more
                       information from the vendor, accused No. 1 with
                       regard to manufacturer, distributor or dealer. In
                       such a case, it needs to be presumed that as per





                       the information supplied by employee of the
                       Company like accused No. 1, from whom sample
                       of milk was purchased, the Food Inspector took
                       further action and filed proceeding against the
                       petitioners.
