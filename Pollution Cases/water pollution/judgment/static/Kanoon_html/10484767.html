Introduction

1.1 These are 38 writ petitions filed by builders of various properties in

the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT of Delhi) who have been

issued show cause notices and also directions by the Respondent Delhi

Pollution Control Committee (`DPCC‟) for alleged violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section

25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

[hereafter `the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>‟) and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_5">22</a> of the Air (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 [hereafter `the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>‟]. Barring two

petitions where the buildings constructed are residential complexes, in

each of the other petitions the building constructed is a commercial

shopping complex or a shopping mall.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 2 of 122</span>
 1.2 The show cause notices have been issued on the ground that these

Petitioners had not, prior to commencing construction, applied to the

DPCC for and obtained from it the „consent to establish‟ under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">Section

25</a> of the Water Act or the DPCC‟s „consent to operate‟ under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_9">Section 21</a>

of the Air Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
1.3 Some of the petitioners have constructed commercial complexes or

shopping malls of a built up area of over 20,000 sq.m. They were

therefore required to comply with the environment impact assessment

(EIA) notifications in terms of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986

(EPA). The EIA norms with which they are expected to comply are set

out in the EIA notification dated 27th January 1994 as further amended on

7th July 2004 and 14th September 2006. The issue that arises in some of

these petitions, where the commercial or residential complex is of a built

up area of over 20,000 sq.m, is whether independent of the EIA clearance

obtained by such petitioners from the Government of India in the

Ministry of Environment and Forests (`MoEF‟), a separate consent to

establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a> and a consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a>

would nevertheless be required to be obtained from the DPCC.



1.4 Another issue common to some of these petitions is the validity of the

levy by the DPPC of penalties, fines and environment damages in the

form of fixed sums of monies or by requiring the Petitioners to furnish

bank guarantees as a condition to the grant of consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a>

and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 3 of 122</span>
</p><p id="p_5"> 2. The case of the Petitioners broadly stated is that the residential and

commercial shopping complexes and shopping malls are not covered

under either the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a>. Therefore there was no need

for any of these Petitioners to have obtained from the DPCC either prior

consent to establish under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_17">Section 25</a> of Water Act or prior consent to

operate under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_18">Section 21</a> of the Air Act. The case of the DPCC is that the

activity of construction of commercial complexes, shopping malls and

even residential complexes is covered under both the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Air Act</a> and the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a> and the failure to obtain prior consent to establish or prior

consent to operate makes the petitioners liable under either or both Acts.

For complexes where the built up area is over 20,000 sq.m, the stand of

the DPCC is that the mere obtaining by such builders of EIA clearance

from the MoEF will not obviate the need to obtain separate prior consents

from the DPCC under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_21">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_22">Air Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

Background to the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_23">Water Act</a> and amendments

</p><p id="p_7">3. The first issue to be considered is the applicability of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">Water Act</a> to

the complexes in question. Emphasis has been placed by both sides on

the background to the enactment of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_25">Water Act</a>. The Statement of

Objects and Reasons (`SOR‟) to the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Act</a> as it was first enacted on

23rd March 1974 referred to a Committee set up in 1962 to draw up a

draft enactment for the prevention of water pollution. The SOR noted that

"the problem of pollution of rivers and streams has assumed considerable

importable and urgency in recent years as a result of the growth of the

industries and the increasing tendency to urbanization." The Report of

the Committee was circulated to the State Governments and was also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 4 of 122</span>
 considered by the Central Council of Local Self-Government. Based on

the recommendation of the Central Council a draft bill was prepared.

The Bill was passed by both the Houses of Parliament and received the

assent of the President in 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">4. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_27">The Water Act</a> underwent further changes in 1978 and thereafter in

1988. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_28">Section 25</a> of the Water Act in its present form was a result of

certain extensive amendments made to it in 1988. Para 2 of the SOR of

the Amendment Act No. 53 of 1988, which is relevant for the present

purposes, reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "2. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_29">The Water Act</a> is implemented by the Central and State
       Governments and the Central and State Pollution Control
       Boards. Over the past few years, the implementing agencies
       have experienced some more administrative and practical
       difficulties in effectively implementing the provisions of the
       Act. The ways and means to remove these difficulties have
       been    thoroughly     examined   in   consultation   with    the
       implementing agencies. Taking into account the views
       expressed, it is proposed to amend certain provisions of the
       Act in order to remove such difficulties. The State
       Legislatures of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura have
       passed resolutions under <a href="/doc/1294039/" id="a_30">Article 252(2)</a> of the Constitution
       authorizing the Parliament to amend the provisions of the
       <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_31">Water Act</a> to give effect to those amendments."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">5. Thereafter in Para 3(iii) and 3(vi) of the SOR, it was explained that the

Bill inter alia sought to make the following amendments to the Act,

namely:
</p>
<p id="p_11">   "(iii) it is proposed to make it obligatory on the part of a person

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                  Page 5 of 122</span>
            to obtain the consent of the relevant Board for establishing
           or taking any steps to establish any industry, operation or
           process which is likely to cause pollution of water and also
           to empower the Boards to limit their consents for suitable
           periods so as to enable them to monitor observance of the
           prescribed conditions;
</p><p id="p_12">           ......
</p><p id="p_13">   (vi)    it is proposed to empower the Boards to give directions to
           any person, officer or authority including the power to
           direct closure on regulation of offending industry,
           operation or process or stoppage or regulation of supply of
           services such as water and electricity"
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">6. It is plain, therefore, that the amendments made in 1988 were with a

view to making it obligatory on the part of the person taking any steps to

establish "any industry, operation or process which is likely to cause

pollution of water...." to obtain the prior consent of the State Pollution

Control Committee (PCC).
</p>
<p id="p_16">

Position under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_32">Water Act</a>
</p><p id="p_17">7. To recapitulate, one of the central issues in these petitions is whether

there is statutory requirement in terms of <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_33">Section 25(1)</a> (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_34">Water

Act</a> for persons establishing a commercial shopping complex or shopping

mall or a residential complex to obtain prior consent to establish from the

DPCC. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_35">Section 25</a> of the Water Act which mandates such requirement

reads as under:

<p id="p_19">9. One of the submissions made by Mr. Sorabjee, learned Senior counsel

on behalf of the Petitioners is that the requirement of obtaining prior

consent to establish in terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_43">Section 25</a> (1) (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_44">Water Act</a> arises

only where the activity in question is to establish an „industry, operation

or process‟ which in turn discharges „trade effluent‟. The argument is that

a residential complex cannot produce „trade effluent‟. It can only produce

domestic sewage which the legislature has consciously excluded from the

expression „trade effluent‟. It is further urged that what takes place in a

commercial shopping complex or shopping mall is mere retail sale of

goods and services. There is no „industry, operation or process‟ that goes

on inside a commercial shopping complex or mall that discharges „trade

effluent‟. On behalf of the Petitioners, it is sought to be contended that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 10 of 122</span>
 the above provision was never intended to cover shopping complexes,

malls or the residential complexes. Mr. Sorabjee submitted that the words

"operation or process or any treatment and disposal system or any system

of extension or addition thereto" following the word "industry" have to

be read ejusdem generis the word "industry" and therefore was not meant

to cover an activity which is not an industrial activity. It is contended that

there is no industrial activity that takes place in a shopping complex or

mall or a commercial complex. In other words, only industries such as

chemical industries, metallurgical industry, engineering industry and so

on are meant to be covered by the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_45">Water Act</a>. Consequently, it is argued

that <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_46">Section 25</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_47">Water Act</a> is not attracted in any of the present

cases.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">10. It must be noticed that the definition of „trade effluent‟ under <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_48">Section

2(k)</a> underwent a change with the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_49">Amendment Act</a> No. 53 of 1988. The

definition of „trade effluent‟ in the unamended <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_50">Section 2(k)</a> contained the

words "carrying on any trade or industry" following the words "...any

premises used for.." This was replaced by the words "...from any

premises carrying on any industry, operation or process, or treatment and

disposal system." The idea was to expand the use of the premises and not

limit it to an industry but also any process or treatment and disposal

system. What stood excluded from the definition of „trade effluent‟ was

"domestic sewage". The word `sewage‟ itself has been defined under

<a href="/doc/949252/" id="a_51">Section 2(g)</a> to mean effluent from any sewerage system or sewage

disposal works and includes sullage produced from open drains. The

word `sewage‟ when qualified by the word `domestic‟ should necessarily
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                   Page 11 of 122</span>
 mean sewage produced from premises used for domestic purposes. The

word "domestic" when contra-distinguished from the expression "trade"

could mean a place used for residence rather than for business or trade.



</p><p id="p_22">11. However, the above definition of „trade effluent‟ does not take a

residential complex or even a commercial shopping complex or shopping

mall out of the purview of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_52">Section 25</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_53">Water Act</a>. A careful

reading of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_54">Section 25</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_55">Water Act</a> would show that it is intended

to cover not just „industry‟ which discharges „trade effluent‟ but any

„process or operation‟ that results in a discharge of „sewage‟ not limited

to trade effluent. The expression „sewage or trade effluent‟ in <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_56">Section 25</a>

(1) (a) <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_57">Water Act</a> which follows the words „operation or process, or any

treatment and disposal system or any extension or addition thereto, which

is likely to discharge..‟ is wide enough to cover all kinds of sewage and

not just „trade effluent‟. Likewise, the expressions „process‟ and

„operation‟ is not meant to be confined to „industry‟ but to all kinds of

processes and operations including those that take place in kitchens and

bathrooms of residential complexes and retail sales in shops and

restaurants and activities in the rest rooms of commercial shopping

complexes and malls.

<p id="p_23">

the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Leslie Brown Ed.) are as

process that is proposed to be established brings into use "any new or

altered outlet for the discharge of sewage" then <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_60">Section 25(1)</a> will stand

attracted. The proviso to <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_61">Section 25(1)</a> states that where the steps to

establish an industry, operation or process have already commenced

before the commencement of the 1988 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_62">Amendment Act</a>, such steps may

continue for a period of three months and if, the person who has taken

such steps makes an application for consent within that period, till the

nature of the requirement of even an ongoing construction to obtain prior

consent to establish from the State PCC.

</p><p id="p_27">14. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_63">When the Water Act</a> was first enacted in 1974, the scale of both

commercial and residential shopping complexes as a result of

urbanization was perhaps not anticipated. There has been a dramatic

increase in the number of residential and commercial shopping

complexes that have come up in urban metropolises in the recent past.

More significant is the size of such commercial/shopping complexes.

Having huge shopping malls having a built up area of 20,000 sq. m. is

not an unusual feature as is evident in seven cases in the present batch of

writ petitions. The volume of sewage that such residential and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                     Page 13 of 122</span>
 commercial complexes and shopping malls are likely to discharge into

the sewage system would indeed be enormous. The recognition of the

need to have the regulatory authority, in these cases the DPCC, to be

approached by the builders of such complexes and malls for prior consent

to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_64">Water Act</a> is consistent with the object of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_65">Water

Act</a> as amended in 1988. The ultimate object is to ensure that there is

effective prevention and control of pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_28">

Purposive construction

</p><p id="p_29">15. In the considered view of this Court, it is not possible to place a

narrow construction on the words "operation" and "process" occurring in

<a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_66">Section 25(1)</a> of the Water Act. The words "operation or process"

occurring in <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_67">Section 25(1)</a> (a) have to be given the widest possible

meaning and scope. This approach is consistent with the SOR of the 1988

amendments to the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_68">Water Act</a> which make it clear that the legislative

intent was to expand the scope of the regulatory powers of the state PCC.

The principle of ejusdem generis is therefore inapposite in the context.

On the other hand the principle of purposive construction commends

itself for application. In Anderton v. Ryan (1985) 2 All ER 355, it was

explained that: "Statutes should be given what has become known as the

purposive construction, that is to say the Courts should identify the

„mischief‟ that existed before passing of the statute and then if more than

one construction is possible, favour that which will eliminate the

mischief so identified." <a href="/doc/1799678/" id="a_69">In Pepper v. Hart</a> (1993) 1 All ER 42, it was

held: "The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks to give

effect to the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                Page 14 of 122</span>
 extraneous material that bears on the background against which the

legislation was enacted." This has been consistently followed by our

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1944204/" id="a_70">New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia</a>

(2008) 3 SCC 279; <a href="/doc/77516/" id="a_71">Tanna and Modi v. CIT</a> AIR 2007 SC 2301 and

Position of residential complexes under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_73">Water Act</a>
</p><p id="p_31">16. While it is clear that commercial shopping complexes and shopping

malls would stand covered under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_74">Section 25</a> (1) (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_75">Water Act</a>, the

position vis-à-vis residential complexes is examined next. The DPCC is

right in its contention that residential complexes where there are a large

number of residential apartments would also be within the purview of

<a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_76">Section 25(1)</a> (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_77">Water Act</a>. The residential complexes are likely

to discharge large volumes of "sewage" as distinguished from „trade

effluent‟. <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_78">Section 25(1)</a> (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_79">Water Act</a> envisages any "operation or

process" which is likely to discharge "sewage". The collective operation

or processes that take place within a residential complex is likely to

discharge large volumes of sewage into the municipal sewerage system.

To repeat, these processes or operations may take place within the toilets

and bathrooms and kitchens of a residential complex. They could also

take place as a result of any treatment of such sewage collected in some

effluent treatment plant within a residential complex. Then there is the

watering of the lawns and plants in such residential complexes. Large

volumes of water may be used for central air-conditioning or cooling.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 15 of 122</span>
 There can be many activities in a residential complex which result in the

use of water, generation and discharge of sewage and the carrying of such

sewage into main sewerage system for further treatment. In the

circumstances, it is difficult to accept the contention of the Petitioners

that residential complexes would fall outside the purview of <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_80">Section

25(1)</a> (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_81">Water Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">17. The question whether the construction of a single-storeyed residential

building of insubstantial dimensions would attract <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_82">Section 25(1)</a> (a) of

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_83">Water Act</a> need not be answered in these petitions since none of them

concerns such a situation. As far as the present cases are concerned, the

two residential complexes which have been constructed have a built up

area of 23,281 sq.m and 10,733 sq.m respectively. It is not possible

therefore to underestimate the impact that the discharge from such

residential complexes of large volumes of sewage would have on water

pollution in general particularly when such sewage joins the main

sewerage system.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">18. It was urged that as long as the municipal sewage system is being

treated in effluent treatment plants, and the discharged sewage from these

complexes joins such systems, there is no need for each of these

complexes to obtain a prior consent to establish from the DPCC under the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_84">Water Act</a>. This argument although attractive does not account for the

mandatory nature of the requirement to obtain consent to establish under

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_85">Water Act</a>. It also does not account for the fact that at the stages of

pre-construction, during construction and post-construction these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 16 of 122</span>
 complexes would continue to attract the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_86">Water Act</a>. The

liability under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_87">Water Act</a> does not get exempted only because the

sewage discharged from such complexes joins the main municipal

sewerage system which may or may not be treated in keeping with the

water pollution norms.

<p id="p_36">

Water pollution during the construction phase

</p><p id="p_37">19. At this juncture it is important to understand the impact that the

activity of construction of a commercial shopping or residential complex

or a shopping mall is likely to have on water pollution. This court wishes

to draw a distinction between the pre-construction stage when <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_88">Section 25</a>

(1) <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_89">Water Act</a> is attracted and a prior consent to establish is mandated

and the construction phase itself which can also result in pollution being

caused. For instance during construction, water is drawn from bore wells

dug in the property itself or water is brought in through water tanks.

Large quantities of water are used during construction and used water is

also discharged. If unregulated, this could have an adverse impact on the

neighbourhood, the ground water and generally on the municipal

sewerage system.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">20. The pollution that can possibly be caused by discharge of domestic

sewage from a residential complex or trade effluent from a commercial

complex or industry during the construction phase would attract the

various provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_90">Water Act</a>. Even after completion of

construction a functional residential or commercial complex will have to

abide by the water pollution norms stipulated by the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_91">Water Act</a>. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 17 of 122</span>
 DPCC has been constituted under <a href="/doc/557069/" id="a_92">Section 4(4)</a> of the Water Act. <a href="/doc/376419/" id="a_93">Section

9</a> of the Water Act permits the constitution of committees by the DPCC.

Under Section 11A the DPCC can delegate its powers to its Chairman.

<a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_94">Section 16</a> of the Water Act sets out the functions of the Central

Pollution Control Board (`CPCB‟). <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_95">Section 21</a> of the Water Act

empowers the DPCC or any of its officials to take samples of water

"from any stream or well or samples of any sewage or trade effluent

which is passing from any plant or vessel or from or over any place into

any such stream or well" for the purposes of analysis. The word „sewage‟

in this context would include „domestic sewage‟ as well. <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_96">Section 23</a> gives

the DPCC power of entry at any time any place for the purposes of

performing any of the functions entrusted by the DPCC to such officer

for the purposes of determining "whether and if so in what manner, any

such functions are to be performed or whether any direction or

authorization served, made, given, or granted under this Act is being or

has been complied with." <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_97">Section 24</a> of the Water Act prohibits the use of

a stream or well for disposal of polluting matters. Consequently, all of the

above provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_98">Water Act</a> get attracted when an activity,

including an industrial, trade, commercial or domestic activity, causes

pollution. This power can be exercised by the DPCC at any time during

the construction phase and after the completion of construction when the

complex in question becomes functional.

<p id="p_40">

Applicability of Section25 (5) <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_99">Water Act</a> to the cases on hand

</p><p id="p_41">21. While this Court accepts the contention of the DPCC that <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_100">Section

25(1)</a> (a) stood attracted in these cases, the DPCC for some reason did
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 18 of 122</span>
 not act at a time when the construction of these residential and

commercial complexes had either not commenced or having commenced,

had not been completed. In other words, in most cases, as will be seen in

the discussion of the individual petitions, the DPCC did not issue a show

cause notice at a time when the constructions had either not begun or

were in progress. The show cause notice was invariably issued by the

DPCC after the construction had been completed and in many cases after

the completion certificate was issued. In such a situation, to require the

builder of such complex to obtain „prior consent to establish‟ under

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_101">Section 25</a> (1) (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_102">Water Act</a> was a direction that was not capable

of being complied with. Unfortunately, this was the only provision

invoked by the DPCC in each of the cases to pass consequential orders of

either imposition of fine or damages or order closure.



</p><p id="p_42">22. It appears to this Court that with the buildings in question having

already been constructed without obtaining prior consent to establish, the

DPCC ought to have fallen back on the legislatively envisioned „Plan B‟.

What ought to have been done by the DPCC was to invoke <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_103">Section 25</a> (5)

of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_104">Water Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_105">Section 25(5)</a> talks of a situation where an industry

operation or process has already been established or the steps for

establishment have already been taken without obtaining the prior

consent of the State PCC. In such an event the State PCC has to serve, on

the person who has established or taken steps to establish, a notice

imposing any such conditions as it might have imposed if an application

had been made for its consent "in respect of such establishment, such

outlet or discharge."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 19 of 122</span><p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44"> 23. The DPCC ought to have proceeded on the premise that each of the

buildings of the petitioners were constructed without its prior consent to

establish and then should have invoked its powers under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_106">Section 25(5)</a> of

the Water Act. What the DPCC has however done in each of the cases is

invoke <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_107">Section 25</a> (1) and therefore require the petitioners to apply at that

stage to it for consent to establish. While the DPCC was armed with

sufficient powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_108">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act to issue directions,

such directions must be such as are capable of being complied with.



</p><p id="p_45">24. It was urged by Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior counsel for the

DPCC that by letting off the petitioners who had admittedly acted in

violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_109">section 25</a> (1) (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_110">Water Act</a> a wrong message would

be sent and a premium placed, as it were, on brazen violations of the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_111">Water Act</a>. Such submission, in the considered view of this Court, does

not reflect the correct legal position. If for some reason the DPCC has

failed to take action against those who have established commercial or

residential complexes without obtaining prior consent to establish, then it

is not as if no action can at all be taken against the builders, owners or

occupiers of such complexes. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_112">Section 25</a> (5) has been enacted precisely

for such a contingency. <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_113">Section 26</a> of the Water Act further arms the

DPCC with review and monitoring powers and to change the conditions

imposed if they are found to be not effective. The DPCC can even after

the construction is complete, proceed to act in exercise of its powers

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_114">Section 25</a> (5) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_115">Water Act</a>. In other words, the legislature

expects that the DPCC will act vigilantly at all times to ensure that no

violator escapes legal liability under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_116">Water Act</a>.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 20 of 122</span>
</p><p id="p_46"> 25. There is another aspect to the matter. There was no clarity about the

correct legal position till now even as far as the DPCC was concerned.

These cases were for the DPCC, in a sense, test cases. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_117">Section 25</a> of the

Water Act was perhaps not invoked by the DPCC earlier and in any event

not on this scale against commercial or residential complexes. Not having

and having allowed the construction of the complexes to be completed, it

would not be reasonable for the DPCC to insist that these petitioners

must go back to the stage of obtaining „prior consent to establish‟. If after

a show cause notice is issued under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_120">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act and

within the time stipulated, the corrective measures are not put in place by

the person who has established the shopping mall or residential complex,

then it would be open to the DPCC to take further steps in accordance

with <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_121">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. As long as the power to take action

under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_122">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act remains, there need not be any

apprehension of any wrong message being given to those who failed to

obtain consent of the DPCC prior to establishing the complexes.



Multiplicity of authorities does not render exercise of powers under the
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_123">Water Act</a> illegal
</p><p id="p_47">26. It was argued on behalf of the Petitioners that under Schedule XII to

the Constitution of India, read with <a href="/doc/745615/" id="a_124">Article 243W</a> thereof, the powers,

authority and responsibility in relation to water and water treatment is

exclusively vested in the municipalities, i.e., in this case the Municipal

Corporation of Delhi (`MCD‟). It was further submitted that under the

Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (`DMC Act‟) the powers to grant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                  Page 21 of 122</span>
 permission and regulate constructions of buildings in Delhi are

exclusively vested with the MCD. Reference is also made to the

provisions of the Delhi Jal Board Act (Delhi Water Board Act). The

submission is that there cannot be a multiplicity of authorities over the

same subject matter and that if the control and regulation of water and

sewage is within the exclusive domain of the MCD then the DPCC

cannot also exercise such powers in relation to the same subject matter

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_125">Water Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">27. This Court is unable to agree with the above submission. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_126">The Water

Act</a> is in a separate domain and its provisions will have to be complied

with notwithstanding that the MCD has the power to lay down a separate

set of regulations and bye-laws for use of water. For instance, the MCD

may have the power to levy tariffs for the use of water. That does not

mean that the DPCC cannot issue directions in regard to the prevention

and control of pollution of water. They operate in separate fields and both

sets of regulations and norms will have to be complied with. Incidentally

Entry 5 in Schedule XII reads: "water supply for domestic, industrial and

commercial purposes". It obviously does not cover the entire field of the

use of water and treatment and discharge of sewage.

Deemed consent in terms of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_127">Section 25(7)</a> Water Act
</p><p id="p_51">28. The Court would like to observe that when an application is made by

a project proponent for consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_128">Water Act</a>, the

DPCC has to process and decide such application within four months in

terms of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_129">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water Act. As will be presently seen while
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                Page 22 of 122</span>
 discussing the individual cases, there has been no answer by the DPCC to

the factual assertion in some of these cases that despite applying twice for

the consent to establish under <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_130">Section 25(1)</a> of the Water Act, no

response was received from the DPCC for well over four months after the

making of such application. Consequently, where an applicant has not

been communicated any decision of the DPCC for four months after the

making of an application, the deeming provision of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_131">Section 25(7)</a> would

kick in and it would be deemed that the consent to establish has been

granted. If thereafter DPCC finds that any activity in the building which

has already been constructed attracts the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_132">Water Act</a> then

it will have to proceed in accordance with other provisions of the Act to

prevent or control such polluting activity.    <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_133">Section 25(1)</a> of the Water

Act cannot obviously be enforced if the DPCC has allowed the four

months‟ period after the making of an application for consent to

establish, as envisaged under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_134">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water Act, to elapse.

<p id="p_53">Position under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_151">Air Act</a>
</p><p id="p_54">30. Next for consideration are the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_152">Air Act</a> and the

validity of the action taken thereunder by the DPCC. It requires to be first

noticed that the definitions of the different terms under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_153">Air Act</a> are

not identical to the corresponding terms in the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_154">Water Act</a>. The words "air

pollutant" or "air pollution", "emission", "industrial plant" occurring in

<a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_155">Section 2(a)</a>, <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_156">2(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_157">2(j)</a> and <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_158">2(k)</a> respectively of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_159">Air Act</a> read as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">     "(a) "air pollutant" means any solid, liquid or gaseous

<p id="p_55">31. The requirement of obtaining from the DPCC a prior consent to

operate flows from <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_160">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air Act which reads as under:

        without the previous consent of the State Board, operate any
       industrial plant for the purpose of any industry specified in the
       Schedule in an air pollution control area:

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">       Provided that a person operating any industrial plant in any air

       Amendment Act, 1987 (47 of 1987), for which no consent was
       necessary prior to such commencement, may continue to do so
       for a period of three months from such commencement or, if he
       has made an application for such consent within the said period
       of three months, till the disposal of such application."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">32. After its amendment in 1988, the essential definitions remained

unchanged. The consent to establish or operate had to be obtained only

where it was concerning "any industrial plant in an air pollution control

area". It appears to this Court that as far as the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_162">Air Act</a> is concerned, the

emphasis was only on consent to operate having to be obtained for

establishment of an industrial plant. <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_163">Section 2(k)</a> defines industrial plant

to mean "any plant used for any industrial or trade purpose and made any

area pollutant into the atmosphere". In the instant case, the expression

"trade purposes" therefore have to be distinguished from the industrial

purposes. The word "trade" could have a wide meaning. It could include

the transaction that takes place within a commercial shopping complex or

a shopping mall. The word "air pollutant", as defined in <a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_164">Section 2(a)</a>,

means the presence in the atmosphere "in such concentration as may be

or tend to be injurious to the atmosphere or the other breeding creatures

or plants or property or environment". Therefore the activity has to be

such that it results in the establishment of an industrial plant in an air

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                  Page 26 of 122</span>
 pollution control area. Air pollution, in terms of <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_165">Section 2(b)</a> is "presence

in the atmosphere of any air pollutant".
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">33. A collective reading of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_166">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air Act with <a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_167">Section

2(a)</a>, <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_168">2(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_169">2(k)</a> thereof leads this Court to the conclusion that a

commercial shopping complex or a shopping mall would be covered

within the scope of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_170">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air Act. Mr. B.B. Gupta, learned

counsel for some of the Petitioners drew the attention of the Court to the

Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Union Territory Rules, 1983

(UT Rules). He submitted that Rule 2 (h) of the UT Rules is the only

provision which defines the word "premises" which has been defined to

mean "any building constructed or already used for industrial or

commercial purposes". Far from supporting the submission of Mr. Gupta,

this definition suggests that even a building used for commercial

purposes would be covered by <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_171">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air Act. Likewise,

Rules 9 and 10 of the UT Rules and the forms thereunder do not exclude

a commercial/shopping complex from the applicability of the <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_172">Section 21</a>

of the Air Act.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">34. One of the submissions on behalf of the DPCC was that in most of

these buildings, whether it was a commercial shopping complex or a

residential complex, there would be a 24-hour power back-up diesel

generator set (DG set) that was likely to cause air pollution and attract the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_173">Air Act</a>. This submission was sought to be countered

by the Petitioners by pointing out that only such DG sets that satisfy the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                  Page 27 of 122</span>
 pollution control norms would be used by the Petitioners and that this is

an event that was likely to take place after the building was

commissioned and not at the stage of consent to operate.




</p><p id="p_61">35. Here the Court would like to make two observations. The position of

the applicability of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_174">Section 21</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_175">Air Act</a> to commercial shopping

complexes and shopping malls is different from its applicability, to

residential complexes. This will be discussed in some detail shortly

hereafter. Secondly, these cases are concerned with the applicability of

<a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_176">Section 21</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_177">Air Act</a> at a stage when construction of the building

in question has not commenced. The position of the applicability of the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_178">Air Act</a> to any on-going construction and to any building complex which

is functional is again different.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">36. As far as commercial shopping complexes or shopping malls are

concerned, it might be difficult to anticipate, even before the start of

construction, what would be the extent of use of DG sets. In any event

this need not be the only factor that will determine whether <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_179">Section 21</a>

(1) <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_180">Air Act</a> applies to commercial shopping complexes or shopping

malls. Given the definition of „air pollutant‟ under <a href="/doc/1169969/" id="a_181">Section 2(a)</a> read with

<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_182">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air Act, and the fact that the commercial shopping

complexes or shopping malls are going to be used for a trade or

commercial activity, is sufficient to attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_183">Section

21(1)</a> of the Air Act. Whether or not the use of a DG set will attract the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_184">Air Act</a> is a separate matter. It is obvious as and when

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                Page 28 of 122</span>
 the building begins to get used for a trade or commercial purpose and DG

sets are used therein, if such DG sets do not comply with the pollution

control norms, a separate cause of action arises for the DPCC to take

action.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">37. Next the position vis-à-vis residential complexes may be examined.

Since <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_185">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air Act only talks of obtaining prior consent to

operate where the air pollution is likely to be caused as a result of the

operation of any "industrial plant for the purpose of any industry

specified in the Schedule", there is no possibility of expanding the

meaning of the word "industrial plant", even on a purposive construction,

to include a residential complex. Reliance was placed by learned Senior

counsel for the DPCC on the judgment of the Karnataka High Court in

<a href="/doc/332602/" id="a_186">Nitin Majumdar v. State of Karnataka</a> 2007 (4) Kar LJ 569. That case

concerned a place used for storage, which was held to be covered under

the definition of „plant‟. It is not possible to stretch the meaning of the

word „plant‟ to include a residential complex. The ratio of the said

decision is therefore inapplicable to a complex used only for residential

purposes. The contrast with the corresponding words in <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_187">Section 25</a> (1) (a)

of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_188">Water Act</a> is indeed striking when one examines <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_189">Section 21</a> (1) of

the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_190">Air Act</a>. The crucial words "operation or process" inserted into

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_191">Section 25</a> (1) (a) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_192">Water Act</a> after the 1988 amendment do not find

place in <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_193">Section 21</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_194">Air Act</a>. The resultant position is that as far

as a purely residential complex is concerned, on the present wording of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                  Page 29 of 122</span>
<a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_195">Section 21</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_196">Air Act</a>, there is no requirement of obtaining the

prior consent of DPCC to operate.
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">38. It was further contended on behalf of the DPCC that the construction

activity itself could cause both air and water pollution. One of the

purposes of requiring the obtaining of prior consents, as noticed by the

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1026316/" id="a_197">T.N. Godavarman Tirumulpad v. Union of India</a>

2006 (10) SCALE 246 (the Vasant Kunj Ridge matters) is the inevitable

use of reinforced cement concrete (RCC) mix during construction. There

is a likelihood of air pollution being caused due to use of loose cement

during construction activity. Clearly, therefore, it is anticipated that the

very activity of construction is likely to cause both air and water

pollution. This can be appreciated in more than one context. Where

what is being constructed is a building that has to be used for the

purposes of a commercial complex or shopping complex or shopping

mall, then apart from obtaining the consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_198">Water

Act</a> and consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_199">Air Act</a>, after the construction

activity commences such activity will have to nevertheless comply with

the pollution control norms that would give rise to a separate cause of

action to the DPCC for the applicability of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_200">Water

Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_201">Air Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">39. Where it is a residential complex, while there may be no need to

obtain prior consent to operate under <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_202">Section 21</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_203">Air Act</a>, once

the construction activity commences, that activity has to be in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 30 of 122</span>
 consonance with the provisions of both the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_204">Air Act</a> as well as the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_205">Water

Act</a>. Needless to mention, once the complex, whether commercial or

residential or a shopping mall, is functional, the norms under both the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_206">Air

Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_207">Water Act</a>, or for that matter the EPA or any other

environmental law, will have to be complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_70">
</p><p id="p_71">40. The position where the construction of a commercial shopping

complex or shopping mall has been allowed to be completed without a

prior consent to operate is examined next. In such event, unlike the fall

back plan of action under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_208">Section 25</a> (5) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_209">Water Act</a>, the course of

action available to the DPCC would be to inspect the building in exercise

of its powers under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_210">Air Act</a> and the Rules thereunder and then issue a

show cause notice requiring the builder or the owners or occupiers as the

case may be to comply with the conditionalities imposed by it under the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_211">Air Act</a> within a specified time frame, failing which the DPCC can issue

further directions under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_212">Section 31A</a> Air Act.

<p id="p_74">The position under the EPA
</p><p id="p_75">42. The EIA Notification dated 14th September 2006 requires the

obtaining of a prior EIA clearance for "new projects or activities listed in

the schedule to this notification." The schedule includes, inter alia,

building/construction projects/area development projects and townships.

Serial 8(A) concerns building and construction projects. In column 4 it is

stated that where the extent is of equal to or more than 20,000 sq.m. and

less than 50,000 sq.m. of built up area, the EIA clearance is mandatory.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 32 of 122</span>
</p><p id="p_76"> 43. The appendix to the above EIA Notification sets out the format in

which an application has to be made for an EIA clearance. The second

part of the format concerns "use of natural resources for construction or

operation of the Project (such as land, water, materials or energy,

especially any resources which are non-renewable or in short supply)".

Serial No. 2.2 asks for details about "Water (expected sources &amp;

competing users)". Appendix 2 sets out the exclusive requirement for

construction projects. In para 2 there is a detailed checklist concerning

„Water Environment‟. Para 2.1 requires the applicant to "give the total

quantity of water requirement for the proposed project with the breakup

of requirements for various users". In particular, the following questions

are asked:

</p><p id="p_84">45. The contention of those Petitioners who have obtained EIA clearance

for their projects is that by requiring them to again approach the DPCC

for consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_229">Water Act</a> and consent to operate under

the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_230">Air Act</a>, the same exercise is being unnecessarily asked to be repeated

by the DPCC. It is further submitted that once the MoEF has already

given clearance, it would not be open to the DPCC to again examine

those very issues and refuse either the consent to establish under the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_231">Water Act</a> or the consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_232">Air Act</a>.



</p><p id="p_85">46. In reply it is pointed out by the DPCC that under most of the EIA

clearances, one of the conditionalities imposed is that the applicant has to

obtain consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_233">Water Act</a> and consent to operate

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_234">Air Act</a> respectively from the DPCC. Additionally, reference is

made to a Circular dated 21st November 2006 issued by the MoEF

clarifying that an NOC from the State Pollution Control Board („SPCB‟)

and its consent to establish are "separate legal requirements, any project

proponent has to fulfil." It is clarified that "NOCs are required under

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                    Page 35 of 122</span>
 Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_235">Air Act</a>s are mandatory requirement under those Acts and will

have to be taken as required and do not require to be intended as

environmental clearance". The DPCC has also pointed out that there is

no question of repugnancy between the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_236">Water Act</a>s on the one

hand and the EPA on the other. To be fair to the Petitioners, it was not

their case that there is any repugnancy between the statutes in question.

Their submission is that once they have obtained EIA clearance under the

EIA Notification dated 14th September 2006, they do not have to again go

before the DPCC for a separate consent to establish and consent to

operate.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">47. This Court finds that there is indeed an element of overlap between

some of the aspects examined by the MoEF while granting EIA

clearance, and those aspects on which the DPCC grants either consent to

establish or consent to operate or both. At the same time, the need to

separately obtain consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_237">Water Act</a> and consent to

operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_238">Air Act</a> from the DPCC is mandatory as clarified by

the MoEF in its Circular dated 21st November 2006. As explained by the

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1623563/" id="a_239">State of Bihar v. Kedar Sao</a> (2004) 9 SCC 344, it is

possible that more than one enactment applies to the same facts and

circumstances and it is possible that the applicant may have to get

clearances from different agencies for the same activities. The mere fact

that an EIA clearance has been obtained from the MoEF cannot be a

ground to seek exemption from obtaining consent to establish under the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_240">Water Act</a> and consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_241">Air Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_88">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 36 of 122</span>
</p><p id="p_89"> 48. A possible balance that can be struck with a view to avoiding

duplication is to hold that when a holder of an EIA clearance applies to

the DPCC for either consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_242">Water Act</a> or consent

to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_243">Air Act</a>, it would be incumbent on the DPCC to

ascertain the aspects that have already been examined by the MoEF in

granting the EIA clearance. Those aspects need not be again examined by

the DPCC. There is usually a role assigned to the SPCB under the EIA

notifications. Even assuming that the position in Delhi is different and the

DPCC does not come into the picture when an EIA clearance is granted

by the MoEF, it would nevertheless be necessary for the DPCC to avoid

repeating the same exercise which has been performed by the MoEF in

granting the EIA clearance. Therefore, to the extent that certain aspects

have not been covered by the EIA clearance, it would certainly be open

for the DPCC to examine those aspects and decide whether or not to

grant consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_244">Water Act</a> and consent to operate

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_245">Air Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_90">

Who should apply for consent?
</p>
<p id="p_91">49. It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioners that after the completion

of the construction in terms of validly sanctioned plans the ownership of

the property, or portions thereof, usually changes hands. The question

posed is, in such event, who should apply for consent to establish or to

operate and who should be called upon to comply with the environmental

norms?
</p>
<p id="p_92">
</p><p id="p_93">50. It is not as if the person who originally applied for EIA clearance or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 37 of 122</span>
 the consent to establish or consent to operate would have nothing to do

with the property in question once the construction is complete. There

may indeed be multiple owners in a constructed building. In such event,

if the builder already knows who they are, even before construction

commences, then the application for EIA clearance or consent to

establish or operate, as the case may be, will be made jointly by the

builder and such individual owners. If the building has been completed

without obtaining prior consent to establish under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_246">Section 25</a> (1) (a) of

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_247">Water Act</a> it would be incumbent upon the person receiving a show

cause notice from the DPCC in terms of <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_248">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act

to inform the DPCC the names of the persons to whom the whole or part

of the building in question has been sold or transferred. Notices can then

be issued to such persons as well. Till such time the person first receiving

a show cause notice furnishes the complete particulars of subsequent

transferees and till discharged, such person will continue to be liable to

answer the show cause notice and to explain why he should not be

proceeded against for the violations of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_249">Water Act</a>. The position would

be more or less similar under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_250">Air Act</a>. In any event, since under the

Rules under both the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_251">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_252">Air Act</a> there is a requirement

that the DPCC should conduct an enquiry or investigation before issuing

a show cause notice, that might reveal the names of the persons to whom

the notices should be issued.

The ambit of DPCC's powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_253">Section 33A</a> Water Act and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_254">Section

</p><p id="p_95">51. This brings up the next question as to the scope of the powers of the

Act which are more or less identically worded. <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_257">Section 33A</a> of the Water

Act reads as under:

       contained in any other law, but subject to the provisions of this
       Act, and to any directions that the Central Government may

       and performance of its functions under this Act, issue any
       directions in writing to any person, officer or authority, and
       such person, officer or authority shall be bound to comply with
       such directions.

<blockquote id="blockquote_52">       Explanation-For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared
       that the power to issue directions under this section includes the

</blockquote>
<p id="p_97">52. The above provision opens with a non obstante clause. However, it is

subject to the other provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_258">Water Act</a>. It gives the DPCC the

power to issue directions in writing to any person, officer or authority

and such person, officer or authority shall be bound to comply with such

directions. The directions would include the power to order closure

prohibition or regulation of any "industry, operation or process" or the

"stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity, water or any other

service". The power of the DPCC under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_259">Section 33A</a> Water Act is indeed

wide. It implies within it the requirement of following the principles of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 39 of 122</span>
 natural justice before the exercise of such power. On a collective reading

of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_260">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_261">33A</a>, the legislative scheme appears to be that where

there is a failure by a person to comply with either <a href="/doc/754307/" id="a_262">Section 25(1)(a)</a> or

<a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_263">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act then it would be open to the DPCC to

exercise its powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_264">Section 33A</a> of the Act. Without giving any

show cause notice under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_265">Section 25(5)</a> in the instant case and without

waiting for the expiry of the time within which the corrective steps have

to be taken, it will not be open to the DPCC to straightway invoke its

power under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_266">Section 33A</a> to order closure of the shopping mall or

commercial or residential complex concerned. That would make such

exercise of power vulnerable to invalidation on the grounds of

arbitrariness and unreasonableness. The position as regards <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_267">Section 31A</a>

of the Air Act is no different. That power too cannot be exercised to

straightaway order closure of a building without giving the person

concerned a prior show cause notice consistent with the procedure

outlined under the Rules under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_268">Air Act</a>.

Validity of the levy of penalties and environmental damages

the furnishing of bank guarantees as a pre-condition to the grant of

consents are examined next. Connected with this issue is the question

whether the Chairman of the DPCC had the power to constitute a

Consent Management Committee („CMC‟) which proceeded to levy

environmental damages, penalties, fines and require the furnishing of

bank guarantees in some of these cases.

been conferred on the State Board to delegate its powers.



</p><p id="p_102">55. It is pointed out by the Petitioners that the DPCC has, contrary to the

relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_271">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_272">Air Act</a>, delegated its powers

with regard to granting prior consent to establish or consent to operate

of the Water Act to the Chairman and Member-Secretary. It is stated that

the Chairman DPCC is also the Chairman of the CMC which deals with

the aspect concerning consent. It is accordingly sought to be contended

that there can be no sub-delegation by the Chairman of his powers to the

CMC and the decision taken by the Chairman with the assistance of the

Members of the CMC is invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_103">
</p><p id="p_104">56. If indeed it was the Chairman alone who was acting in exercise of the

powers delegated to him under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_275">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_276">Section

33A</a> of the Water Act, then the final decision to either agree to or to

refuse the consent to establish or consent to operate should have been

taken independently by the Chairman. The minutes of the meetings,

however, show that this was the decision of the CMC. Although the

Chairman of the DPCC may be the Chairman of the CMC, he is but one

member in the CMC. There is nothing to indicate that the decision of

 CMC was unanimous or by majority or that it was the decision only of

the Chairman. There is no power under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_277">Water Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_278">Air Act</a>

given to the Chairman to further sub-delegate his powers in regard to

consent to establish or consent to operate to the CMC. Such sub-

delegation was obviously bad in law. Unless it is shown, and it is not,

that the other members of the CMC apart from the Chairman were

performing a mere advisory role and had nothing to do with the actual

grant or refusal of the consent to establish or consent to operate, such

decision by the CMC is clearly ultra vires the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_279">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_280">Water Act</a>.



</p><p id="p_105">57. In the instant case, this Court is unable to find any justification for the

CMC to itself take decision as regards the grant and refusal of the

consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_281">Water Act</a> and consent to operate under the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_282">Air Act</a>. Secondly, even where it agreed to grant consent to establish, the

CMC imposed a pre-condition that the applicant should pay a penalty or

fine or furnish a bank guarantee or in some cases all or some of them.

There is no statutory basis for such a direction to be issued by the CMC,

or for that matter by even the Chairman of the DPCC. The grant of the

consent to establish or consent to operate ought not to be made

conditional upon payment of some fine or penalty or furnishing of bank

guarantee. Given the object of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_283">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_284">Air Act</a>, which is

the prevention and control of pollution, the mere payment of fine or

penalty or furnishing of bank guarantee is unlikely to prevent and control

the likely pollution that can be caused. The basic approach adopted by

 the CMC where such penalty or fine has been levied or bank guarantee

secured appears to be faulty.
</p>
<p id="p_106">
</p><p id="p_107">58. The decision to levy environmental damages and to seek the

furnishing of bank guarantees has been sought to be justified by the

DPCC with reference to <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_285">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_286">Section 33A</a> of

the Water Act. As already noticed, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_287">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act is more or

less similarly worded as <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_288">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act and both

provisions have been inserted by the 1988 Amendments. A reference has

already been made to <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_289">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. The power under the

said provision includes the power of the DPCC to issue "any directions in

writing to any person". The `Explanation‟ to the provision clarifies that

the power to issue directions includes the power to direct "closure,

prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or process or the

stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity, water or any other

service". Yet, this power has to be one coupled with a duty to act

reasonably and fairly. It cannot be stretched to include a power to levy a

penalty.
</p>
<p id="p_108">
</p><p id="p_109">59. In the considered view of this Court, the power to levy a penalty on

any party is in the nature of a penal power. It is settled law that unless

there is a specific power in the statute enabling the authority to do so, it

cannot levy penalties or damages with reference to the general power

under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_290">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act or <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_291">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. The

Mysore Sales Tax 1957 when there was no provision in the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_296">Central Act</a>

for imposition of penalty for default in payment of tax. Answering the

question in the negative, the opinion of Ray CJ, writing for the majority

explained (SCC, p.31):
</p>
<p id="p_110">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">       "25. Penalty is not merely sanction. It is not merely adjunct to
       assessment. It is not merely consequential to assessment. It is not
       merely machinery. Penalty is in addition to tax and is a liability
       under the Act. Reference may be made to <a href="/doc/555776/" id="a_297">Section 28</a> of the Indian
       Income-tax Act, 1922 where penalty is provided for concealment
       of income. Penalty is in addition to the amount of income-tax. This

       107(SC) said that penalty is not a continuation of assessment
       proceedings and that penalty partakes of the character of additional
       tax."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_111">60. In his concurring opinion Beg, J. (as His Lordship then was) observed

(SCC@ p.35):
</p>
<p id="p_112">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">       "39. On a consideration of the provisions mentioned above, it
       seems to me to be clear that whatever may be the objects of
       levying a penalty, its imposition gives rise to a substantive liability
       which can be viewed either as an additional tax or as a fine for the
       infringement of the law. The machinery or procedure for its
       realization conies into operation after its imposition. In any case, it
       is an imposition of a pecuniary liability which is comparable to a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                   Page 44 of 122</span>
        punishment for the commission of an offence. It is a well settled
       cannon of construction of statutes that neither a pecuniary liability
       can be imposed nor an offence created by mere implication. It may
       be debatable whether a particular procedural provision creates a
       substantive right or liability. But, I do not think that the imposition
       of a pecuniary liability, which takes the form of a penalty or fine
       for a breach of a legal obligation, can be relegated to the region of
       mere procedure and machinery for the realization of tax. It is more
       than that. Such liabilities must be created by clear, unambiguous,
       and express enactment. The language used should leave no serious
       doubts about its effect so that the persons who are to be subjected
       to such a liability for the infringement of law arc not left in a state
       of uncertainty as to what their duties or liabilities are. This is an
       essential requirement of a good government of laws. It is implied
       in the Constitutional mandate found in <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_299">Section 265</a> of our
       Constitution: "No tax shall be levied or collected except by
       authority of law"."

<p id="p_113">61. Later in India Carbon Ltd., the question arose whether sales tax

authorities in the States could charge interest when collecting and

enforcing payment of central sales tax. Following the decision in

Khemka it was held that absent a substantive provision in the central Act

requiring the payment of interest on central sales tax, the authorities in

the states could not charge interest thereon. The resultant position is that

there being no specific provision in the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_300">Water Act</a> or <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_301">Air Act</a>

empowering the DPCC to levy penalties, fines or environmental

damages, or to require the furnishing of bank guarantees, no such order

or direction can be issued by the DPCC, much less the CMC, in exercise

of the general powers to issue directions under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_302">Section 33</a> A Water Act

</p><p id="p_115"> 62. The DPCC has placed reliance upon the decision of the learned

Single Judge of this Court dated 16th January 2009 in Writ Petition (C)

No. 7516 of 2007 (<a href="/doc/113532302/" id="a_304">Regent Automobiles Pvt. Ltd. v. GNCTD</a>.) The Court

in Regent Automobiles was interpreting the provisions of the Delhi

Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act, 2000 (DCETP Act). Section 11

of the DCETP Act which contains a specific provision for penalty reads

as under:
</p>
<p id="p_116">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">               "11. Penalty for non-payment within the specified

               deemed to be in arrears and the appropriate authority
               may after such inquiry as it deems fit, impose on such
               person a penalty not exceeding the amount in arrears."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_117">63. Section 16 of the DCETP Act reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_118">

               in exercise of its powers and performance of its
               functions under this Act, issue any directions in
               writing to any occupier, society, person, officer or
               authority, and such occupiers, society, person, officer
               or authority shall be bound to comply with directions.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_61">                (b) the stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity,
               water or any other service."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_119">64. Further Section 17 DCETP Act spells out the consequences of failing

to comply with the direction issued by the authority. It enables the

authority to levy a further penalty in the event of such failure.              In

addition, Section 18 DCETP Act talks of penalty for certain kinds of acts.

Section 19 DCETP Act provides for residual penalty for contravention of

certain provisions of the Act. It was noticed by learned Single Judge

that, "but for <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_305">Section 16</a> it can be argued that the entire range of sanctions

including penalties have been specifically provided by various provisions

such as <a href="/doc/921478/" id="a_306">Section 11</a>, <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_307">18</a>, <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_308">19</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/303980/" id="a_309">20</a>." It was in the above context that the

question posed by the learned Single Judge was "whether the general

power to issue directions comprehends the power to require bank

guarantees to be furnished?" After referring to certain decisions which

explained that "everything necessary to carry out the purposes of the

grant can be done by the authority entrusted with the power", the learned

Single Judge came to the conclusion that the "court cannot limit the

options available to statutory authorities to meet emerging challenges,

towards ensuring compliance with the provisions." Yet, even in that case

the Court accepted the contention of the Petitioners that in the show

cause notices, preceding the impugned orders, there was no mention

about the possibility of issuance of orders requiring bank guarantees to be

furnished. Further the orders did not indicate the application of mind to

what existed on site, and what was the standard required to be complied



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                   Page 47 of 122</span>
 with. Therefore while the challenge on account of lack of power failed,

the impugned orders were held not sustainable in law and set aside.




</p><p id="p_120">65. In the considered view of this Court, the above decision in Regent

Automobiles is of no assistance to the DPCC in the present case. The

provisions of the DCETP Act are different from the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_310">Air

Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_311">Water Act</a> particularly with reference to the penalty provisions.

In the DCETP Act, <a href="/doc/921478/" id="a_312">Sections 11</a>, <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_313">17</a>, <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_314">18</a> and <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_315">19</a> talk of penalties and it is

in that context it was held that the power under <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_316">Section 16</a> of that Act

includes power to require furnishing of bank guarantee. Neither in the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_317">Water Act</a> nor in the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_318">Air Act</a> is there any provision that permits DPCC to

levy a penalty. That power is with the courts and that too after returning a

conviction. Chapter VI of the Air Act and Chapter VII of the Water Act

talks of penalties which result from a conviction for violation of the

provisions. Clearly, the penalties envisaged under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_319">Air Act</a> and the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_320">Water Act</a> can be levied only at the end of judicial proceedings before a

criminal court. That power cannot be exercised by the DPCC. There is

no provision either under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_321">Water Act</a> or under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_322">Air Act</a> that

empowers a State Board to levy penalties or environmental damages,

much less require the furnishing of a bank guarantee.




</p><p id="p_121">66. This Court has, therefore, no hesitation in coming to the conclusion

that orders issued by the CMC or even the DPCC in the instant case

levying penalty and requiring furnishing of bank guarantees and making

the grant of consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_323">Water Act</a> and consent to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 48 of 122</span>
 operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_324">Air Act</a> conditional upon payment of such penalties

and furnishing of such bank guarantees are entirely without the authority

of law and require to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_122">


Procedural violations by the DPCC

</p><p id="p_123">67. This Court finds that the procedure adopted in the instant case by the

DPCC in levying the damages and requiring the Petitioners to furnish

bank guarantees was not consistent with the requirements of the Rules

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_325">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_326">Water Act</a>. Under Rule 20A(3) of the UT Rules the

requirement is of serving a copy on the alleged violator of the proposed

directions and being given an opportunity of not less than 15 days from

the date of service of a notice to file objections to the proposed

directions. Where the direction is for the stoppage or regulation of

electricity or water or any other service then under Rule 20A(4) copy of

the proposed direction should be endorsed to the occupier of the industry,

operation or process. After the receipt of the objection and within 45 days

from that day, the DPCC should give an opportunity to the person to file

objections and after considering the objections and for reasons to be

recorded in writing, either confirm, modify or decide not to issue such

directions. Where the DPCC decides that it is not expedient to provide

such an opportunity on account of a likelihood of grave injury to the

environment, it should record an opinion to that effect.

been followed by the DPCC. This would be discussed in greater detail

while dealing with the individual cases. This Court would like to

33<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_330">A of the Water Act</a>, which is indeed a coercive power, has to be

requirements. The Rules under both statutes have to be mandatorily

followed while exercising such powers.

authorities, the construction industry, consumer associations as well as

civil society groups involved in issues of environmental protection. Not

only should DPCC reorganize itself as a vigilant regulator but seek the

active cooperation of all of the above interested parties. Also, to avoid

any criticism of selective application of law, the DPCC should ensure

that the law applies and is enforced in a uniform, predictable and certain

way, while ensuring that action taken is within the four corners of the

law.

Consideration of individual petitions

W.P. (C) No. 2714 of 2008 (Vardhman Properties Ltd.)

</p><p id="p_154">72. The building in this case is a shopping-cum-office complex built on a

commercial plot. The total built up area is 7700 sq.m. The show cause

notice was issued by the DPCC on 13th February 2008 asking the

Petitioner to explain why it should not be proceeded against for its failure

to apply for a consent to establish under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_362">Section 25</a> of the Water Act and

consent to operate under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_363">Section 21</a> of the Air Act. The show cause

notice further stated with reference "you are proposing to construct/have

started construction activities without obtaining prior „Consent to

Establish‟ under Air &amp; <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_364">Water Act</a> from DPCC". The Petitioner was

asked to show cause why "prosecution proceedings should not be

initiated against you and/or your establishment should not be closed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 55 of 122</span>
 under the appropriate provisions of the Acts for contravention of the

provisions of the aforesaid Acts".
</p>
<p id="p_155">
</p><p id="p_156">73. By the time the above show cause notice was issued, the building had

already been constructed. In fact, construction commenced on 7 th June

2005 in terms of the sanctioned building plan and was completed on 25 th

June 2007. The Petitioner replied to the above notice on 18th February

2008. Inter alia, it was pointed out that an application was made on 3 rd

September 2007 under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_365">Information Act</a>, 2005 („<a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_366">RTI Act</a>‟) on

the exact criteria adopted by the DPCC for identifying commercial

complexes for the purposes of consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_367">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_368">Water

Act</a>. The DPCC had replied that commercial/residential buildings not

generating trade effluent are required to discharge their sewage into

sewage system maintained by Delhi Jal Board/MCD/DDA which in turn

was responsible for treating the sewage in the sewage treatment plant as

per the norms prescribed under the pollution control laws and in such

event consent was not required for the said commercial/residential

buildings.
</p>
<p id="p_157">
</p><p id="p_158">74. On 18th March 2008, an order was passed by the DPCC noting that a

reply had been filed by the Petitioner to the show cause notice on 18 th

February 2008 that "no application has been made till date". The case

was then placed before the CMC (Orange). It was decided by the CMC to

direct the Petitioner to apply for consent to establish and submit

"Environmental Clearance obtained from MoEF, Govt. of India" and an

 "affidavit indicating date of start of construction and completion of

construction, approved architectural drawing and completion certificate

within 15 days from the issue of this letter".
</p>
<p id="p_159">
</p><p id="p_160">75. The challenge in the present petition is to the aforementioned order

dated 18th March 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_161">
</p><p id="p_162">76. As already held by this Court hereinbefore that there was no question

of the Petitioner having to apply for environmental clearance from the

MoEF in terms of the EIA Notification dated 14 th September 2006 since

the built up area was not above 20,000 sq.m. In the present case the built

up area was 7700 sq.m. The categorization of an industry as Orange, Red

or Blue appears to that of the DPCC. It is not found either under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_369">Air

Act</a> or under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_370">Water Act</a>.        Nevertheless, a commercial shopping

complex required prior consent to establish prior to commencement of

construction. But once the construction was already complete, then it was

pointless to require the Petitioner to apply thereafter for consent to

establish.
</p>
<p id="p_163">
</p><p id="p_164">77. Thirdly, the Petitioner‟s reply dated 18th February 2008 has been

noticed but not discussed by the DPCC in the impugned order.                In

particular, the Petitioner‟s response to the reply received by it under the

<a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_371">RTI Act</a> has not been adverted to at all. Although it is possible that the

sewage generated by the shopping complex will join the main sewage

system which is being taken to the effluent treatment plant of the DJB,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                Page 57 of 122</span>
 that by itself will not obviate the need to obtain consent to establish from

the DPCC.
</p>
<p id="p_165">
</p><p id="p_166">78. It appears that DPCC itself was not very clear about the legal position

and, therefore, the above reply was given under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_372">RTI Act</a>. It cannot be

said that the DPCC estopped from rectifying its position or correcting its

understanding of the law.
</p>
<p id="p_167">
</p><p id="p_168">79. Inasmuch as the building already was constructed on 25 th June 2007,

by the time the show cause notice dated 13 th February 2008 was issued,

the direction issued by the DPCC requiring the Petitioner to thereafter

apply for a consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_373">Water Act</a> and consent to

operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_374">Air Act</a> was a direction which was incapable of being

complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_169">
</p><p id="p_170">80. This is, however, not the end of the matter. The DPCC can still

proceed under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_375">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act requiring the Petitioner to

comply with the pollution control norms under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_376">Water Act</a>. This it can

do after following the procedure under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_377">Section 25(5)</a>.




</p><p id="p_171">81. As far as <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_378">Air Act</a> is concerned, the DPCC can inspect the premises to

ascertain what is the extent of the air pollution caused, if any, and then

issue notice to the Petitioner.

</p><p id="p_173"> 82. The direction issued in the impugned order dated 18 th March 2008,

requiring the Petitioner to apply for consent to establish and consent to

operate, is for the aforementioned reasons not sustainable in law. While

setting aside the impugned order dated 18th March 2008 for the

aforementioned reasons, this Court leaves it open to the DPCC to now

proceed in accordance with <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_379">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act and other

relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_380">Air Act</a>. If it finds after an enquiry or

investigation that the use of the premises is causing either water or air

pollution, and corrective action is not taken within the time limit set for

the purpose, it can proceed further to issue directions as envisaged under

two more DG sets located at the terrace, there was no information about

 22nd November 2007 with the DPCC. A show cause notice was issued on

5th December 2007 which was replied to on 13th December 2007

informing the DPCC that the application seeking „consent to establish‟

was already pending. No reply was received from the DPCC. The DPCC

again sent a notice dated 14th March 2008 requiring the Petitioner to

submit environmental clearance, approved architectural drawings and the

completion certificate. Thereafter the DPCC sent a letter dated 26th May

2008 informing the Petitioner that its case was being placed before the

CMC.
</p>
<p id="p_228">
</p><p id="p_229">115. At its meeting on 21st August 2008, the CMC took note of the fact

that the total project cost is ` 44.14 crores and that in similar cases the

CMC has levied damages of 1% of the project cost and 2% of the project

cost for bank guarantee which in the present case worked out to damages

as cash penalty of ` 44 lakhs and bank guarantee of ` 88 lakhs. The

aforesaid damages as cash penalty and bank guarantee valid for three

years was asked to be furnished by 17th September 2008. The Petitioner

then made a representation which was again considered by the CMC in

its meeting held on 7th October 2008. The CMC now reduced the penalty

amount to ` 40 lakhs and bank guarantee amount to ` 85 lakhs and asked

the unit to comply with the directions of 6th July 2008.

Petitioner to pay environmental damages or to furnish bank guarantee

and, therefore, the impugned direction is wholly unsustainable in law and

is hereby set aside. If indeed the Petitioner had already filed an

application for consent to establish on 22nd November 2007, then in the

absence of any reply thereto by the DPCC in terms of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_433">Section 25(7)</a> of

on Plot No.3, District Centre, Jasola, New Delhi known as Splendor

Forum. The area of the plot is about 5704 sq. m. It was purchased from

the Delhi Development Authority for commercial purposes in an open

auction. The Petitioner states that all the necessary permissions from all

 authorities concerned including the municipalities, electricity department,

Chief Fire Officer, Delhi Urban Art Commission, and Airport Authority

of India were taken. The construction of the building started in March

2004 and the construction up to the plinth level was completed in

December 2005. The EIA Notification dated 7th July 2004 brought within

its fold construction activity. The Petitioner states that in terms of the

said EIA Notification where construction was complete till the plinth

level, no environmental clearance was necessary. However, since DDA

insisted on the Petitioner producing the EIA clearance certificate in order

to process its case for additions, alterations and modifications, the

Petitioner applied and was granted EIA clearance by the MoEF on 2nd

November 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_235">
</p><p id="p_236">120. In response to a notice dated 20th/21st August 2007 from the DPCC,

the Petitioner applied for consent to establish under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_436">Section 25</a> (1) (a) of

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_437">Water Act</a> on 5th September 2007. A reply to the notice dated 20th/21st

August 2007 was also sent to the DPCC by the Petitioner. The aforesaid

application for consent dated 5th September 2007 was never formally

rejected by the DPCC. However, an order dated 31st December 2007 was

passed by the DPCC issuing directions under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_438">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act

and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_439">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act primarily on the ground that the

construction was started and completed without first obtaining consent to

establish. It was also alleged that there were certain violations of the

conditions of the EIA clearance although according to the Petitioner this

was outside the scope of the powers of the DPCC. By the impugned order

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                Page 74 of 122</span>
 dated 31st December 2007, the Petitioner was asked to pay fine and

furnish a bank guarantee. The Petitioner submits that said order was

passed without complying with the principles of natural justice and was

contrary to the procedure under the Rules. The premises was inspected by

MoEF. It is stated that in its report dated 5th May 2008 the MoEF

recorded that there has been satisfactory compliance of most of the

conditions laid down in the EIA clearance. It was concluded that the

commencement of construction by the Petitioner in March 2004 could

not be treated as a violation of the EPA. Hence no legal action was

recommended by the MoEF against the Petitioner under the EPA.




</p><p id="p_237">121. The directions issued by the DPCC on 31st December 2007 have

been assailed as being ultra vires the powers of the DPCC under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_440">Air

Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_441">Water Act</a>. The said order is also challenged on the ground of

non-compliance with the applicable Rules and further that DPCC cannot

take action for alleged non-compliance with the conditions forming part

of the EIA clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_238">
</p><p id="p_239">122. In its counter affidavit dated 31st January 2008 the DPCC contended

that the Petitioner initially did not apply to the DPCC for prior consents

under either the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_442">Water Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_443">Air Act</a>. It was only after a formal

notice was issued to the Petitioner in August 2005 that on 5 th September

2007, the Petitioner applied to the DPCC for consent to establish under

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_444">Water Act</a> and consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_445">Air Act</a>. According to the

 initiate actions under Sections 15, 16 and 19 of the EPA. An inspection

was carried out in the premises on 23rd December 2007 and the

deficiencies noted at that time have been listed out in the counter

affidavit. The conditions imposed by the amended clearance dated 10 th

February 2007 and the status of compliance was also set out in detail in

the counter affidavit. It is stated that the CMC at its meeting on 26 th

December 2007 and 28th December 2007 deliberated upon the matter

considering the facts and circumstances including the representation

dated 27th December 2007 made by the Petitioner. Thereafter the

impugned order dated 31st December 2007 was passed under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_446">Section 31A</a>

of the Air Act and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_447">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act asking the Petitioner to

pay 0.5% of the project cost of ` 65 crores as fine, which was required to

be deposited in the DPCC‟s account within 30 days. The DPCC‟s stand is

that "any smaller amount of fine will only mean that a non-deserving

Petitioner with no bonafides of commitment to preserving clean air and

water in his environment, would not work towards a correction. Surely

environment deserves ½ % of his total project cost to make him realize

the degree of his callousness." A detailed parawise reply to the writ

petition has also been given by the DPCC.

<p id="p_242">124. It is pointed out that it is only by the amendment with effect from 7 th

July 2004 that construction activity came to be added to the EIA

Notification and again it was clarified that such amendment would not

apply to "any construction project falling under entry 31 of Schedule-1

including new townships, industrial townships, settlement colonies,

commercial complexes, hotel complexes, hospitals and office complexes

for 1,000 (one thousand) persons or below or discharging sewage of

50,000 (fifty thousand) litres per day or below or with an investment of

Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakhs) or below." The Petitioner

proceeded on the assumption that the term „investment‟ in the said

Notification would include the amount invested in construction and

raising the super-structure and since that was around ` 34 crores, no EIA

clearance was required. Thereafter when a further modified EIA

Notification was issued on 14th September 2006, the Petitioner applied to

the MoEF for EIA clearance on 12th March 2007. Time was granted by a

Circular dated 21st November 2006 of the Central Government up to 30 th

June 2007 for applying for EIA clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_243">
</p><p id="p_244">125. It is not the submission of learned counsel for the Petitioner that

there is any repugnancy between the EPA and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_448">Air Act</a> and the Water

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                  Page 77 of 122</span>
 Act. On the other hand, it is not denied that the EPA would apply and

that in the Petitioner‟s case, the EIA clearance would have to be obtained.

What is contended is that once EIA clearance has been obtained, there is

no occasion to again apply to the DPCC under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_449">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_450">Water

Act</a> for consent to operate and consent to establish respectively. Further,

it is submitted that there are many aspects of the EIA clearance which

include water and air pollution and, therefore, the exercise would become

repetitive and cumbersome. Thirdly, it is sought to be contended that the

jurisdiction as regards the EIA clearance is of the Central Government

and not of the DPCC particularly with reference to the National Capital

Territory of Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_245">
</p><p id="p_246">126. The stand of the Respondents, on the other hand, is that consent

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_451">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_452">Water Act</a> are independent of the EIA

clearance and that although the DPCC may have no jurisdiction as

regards the EIA clearance, to the extent that such EIA clearance itself

mandates that the person in whose favour such clearance has been

granted has to obtain consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_453">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_454">Water Act</a>, the

DPCC‟s jurisdiction will stand attracted. It is further submitted that the

parameters that would weigh with the DPCC in processing an application

for consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_455">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_456">Water Act</a> might be different from

those which would weigh with the MoEF in granting EIA clearance.



</p><p id="p_247">127. This Court has considered the above submissions. In view of the

built up area of the building being over 20,000 sq.m., an EIA clearance is

mandatory. For the reasons already discussed, it must be held that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                Page 78 of 122</span>
 requirement of obtaining consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_457">Water Act</a> and

consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_458">Air Act</a> is independent of the EIA clearance

obtained in respect of the Petitioner‟s shopping complex or shopping

mall. But this requirement would have applied at the stage when

construction had not commenced.
</p>
<p id="p_248">
</p><p id="p_249">128. However, in this case at the time when the Petitioner applied for and

obtained the EIA clearance, the construction of the building was

complete. There was no show cause notice issued to it by the DPCC from

the time it commenced construction sometime in March 2004 till it

completed its construction in December 2005. Clearly, the DPCC woke

up very late. The first show cause notice was issued sometime in August

2007. Even then the show cause notice was issued to M/s. G.S.

Developers &amp; Contractors Pvt. Ltd. who were only contractors whereas

the whole shopping complex was built by the Petitioner. Be that as it

may, for the reasons already discussed the course open to the DPCC was

to invoke <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_459">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act to require the Petitioner to

rectify any deficiency that must have been noticed on the inspection of

the premises.     Even under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_460">Air Act</a>, there is no question of now

requiring the Petitioner to apply for „prior consent to operate‟ since the

construction of the building is already complete.
</p>
<p id="p_250">
</p><p id="p_251">129. There are enough provisions in both the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_461">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_462">Water Act</a>

to deal with a situation where without obtaining prior consent a building

been constructed and has become functional. As already pointed out the

action under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_463">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act and Section 33A of the Water
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 79 of 122</span>
 Act will have to be exercised reasonably after complying with the rules

envisaged under both these Acts. The exercise should not be a

mechanical one. Since this is a building which has been granted EIA

clearance, the DPCC should find out first whether there are other aspects,

not covered by the EIA clearance that require to be rectified by the

Petitioner both under the Water as well as the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_464">Air Act</a>. In other words,

the exercise to be undertaken by the DPCC ought not to be repetitive of

the exercise undertaken by the MoEF while granting EIA clearance.



</p><p id="p_252">130. Thirdly, there is no legal basis for the DPCC to impose penalty and

environmental damages on the Petitioner or require it to furnish a bank

guarantee. For the reasons already discussed, such orders are plainly

outside the powers of the DPCC under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_465">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_466">Air Act</a> and

cannot be sustained in law.
</p>
<p id="p_253">
</p><p id="p_254">131. The DPCC has relied upon an order dated 14th October 2003 passed

by the Supreme Court in Writ Petition (C) No. 657 of 1995 (Research

Foundation for <a href="/doc/548962/" id="a_467">Science Technology and National Resource Policy v.

Union of India</a>) where in para 70.6 an observation was made to the

following effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_69">               "MoEF should consider making a provision for bank
               guarantee being given by importer while seeking
               permission to import used oil, furnace oil and zinc
               wastes to be released only on the imported
               consignment being found to be in conformity with the
               declared item of import. After taking a decision,

</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                   Page 80 of 122</span>
<p id="p_255"> 132. The above observation of the Supreme Court does not by any means

imply that an SPCB like the DPCC can begin to levy penalties and fines

and environmental damages or require bank guarantees to be furnished in

exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_468">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_469">Section 33A</a>

of the Water Act. The above contention is accordingly rejected.



</p><p id="p_256">133. Reliance has been placed by the DPCC on an order dated 17 th

October 2006 passed by the Supreme Court in the Vasant Kunj Ridge

matters. The above order was passed in an application filed seeking

acceptance of the report of the Expert Committee relating to violation of

environmental norms by certain parties who had constructed shopping

malls or hotel complexes in the Vasant Kunj Ridge area. After referring

to the earlier orders dated 19th August 1997 and 8th March 2004, the

Supreme Court observed "that the parties were not aware that they had to

take EIA clearance in terms of the amended EIA Notification dated 7 th

July 2004. It was then observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_70">       "The confusion arose because DDA all through all through gave an
       impression to the parties participating in auction that all requisite
       clearances had been obtained. Had such parties inkling of an idea
       that such clearances were not obtained by DDA, they would not
       have invested such huge sums of money. The stand that wherever
       constructions have been made unauthorisedly demolition is the
       only option cannot apply to the present cases, more particularly,
       when they unlike, where some private individuals or private
       limited companies or firms being allotted to have made
       contraventions, are corporate bodies and institutions and the
       question of their having indulged in any malpractices in getting the

        approval or sanction does not arise. Some of the allottees are the
       National Book Trust, School of Planning or Architecture, Shri
       Ram Vithala Sikha Seva Samiti, International Centre for Alternate
       Dispute Resolution and Institute for Studies and Industrial
       Development. In most of these cases the constructions are already
       complete and have become functional."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_257">134. Consequently, the following directions were issued:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">               "10. In view of what has been stated above, the MoEF
               has now to take a decision by taking the land as
               constraint area. It is needless to say that even if the
               land is held to be constraint area the constructions
               thereon have to be made after having the requisite
               clearance. The MoEF shall take note of the stands
               projected by the Respondents. We are prima facie
               satisfied about the bona fides of the Respondents but
               at the same time it needs no emphasis that DDA
               should have been more transparent in ensuring that it
               was not putting a site for auction where there was
               scope for litigation.   It had definitely created an
               impression that all necessary clearances had been
               obtained, though it does not appear to be so. What
               remains to be decided as to what remedial measures
               including imposition of such amounts as costs can be
               taken".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_258">135. The position as far as the present set of cases is concerned, is not

very different. The DPCC appears to have woken up after the

construction of the shopping-cum-commercial complexes/malls was

completed. Therefore as far as the present cases are concerned, the above

orders do not come to the aid of the DPCC for seeking to proceed against

the Petitioner for failing to obtain prior consent to operate under the Air

 Act and prior consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_470">Water Act</a>.           As already

clarified, this would not preclude the DPCC from proceeding under the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_471">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_472">Water Act</a> in the manner already discussed hereinbefore.



</p><p id="p_259">136. The understanding of the law by the DPCC as reflected on its

website should not be taken to be determinative. There is no estoppel

against law. The position depicted by the DPCC on its website will be

obviously subject to and in consonance with the correct legal position.

There has been a lack of clarity even within the DPCC on whether the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_473">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_474">Air Act</a> apply to construction

activity. Hopefully that confusion should not remain any longer.



</p><p id="p_260">137. For the aforementioned reasons, this Court while setting aside the

order dated 31st December 2007 passed by the DPCC permits it to

proceed in accordance with law against the Petitioner in terms of <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_475">Section

25(5)</a> of the Water Act and the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_476">Air Act</a>.

the complex have been sold/leased out to different persons and, therefore,

the complex is no longer in the control of the Petitioner. As and when a

fresh show cause notice is issued to the Petitioner by the DPCC, it will be

open to the Petitioner to furnish to the DPCC the names of the individual

owners of the different portions who might be liable to the extent of their

respective portions. This by no means will absolve the Petitioner of its

liability which is joint and several with such individual owners/lessees. It

will be for the DPCC to decide who should be made liable for complying

 with the various provisions under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_477">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_478">Air Act</a>.

W.P. (C) No. 3095 of 2008 (DLF Ltd.).

15659.50 sq.m. situated at District Centre, Saket, New Delhi with an

attached general parking plot admeasuring 14072.48 sq. m. was

purchased in an auction from DDA to be used as retail/office/multiplex/

service apartment purposes. Although according to the Petitioner no

formal consent was required, to avoid any hyper-technical objection and

impediment at a later stage and without prejudice to its rights, the

Petitioner applied to the DPCC for consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_479">Water

Act</a> and consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_480">Air Act</a> on 3rd June 2005. The first

of the applications has not till date been formally rejected and thus shall

it should file a fresh application.

Petitioner with the DPCC on 25th/26th September, 2007. The said

that the project is for residential group housing and not for trade,

March 2008, 10th April 2008 and 16th May 2008 to avoid any difficulty at

a later stage but to no effect. DPCC wrote to the Petitioner on 2nd

 November 2007, 14th March 20008 and 21st April 2008 for taking action

for not taking prior consent to establish and prior environment

clearances. The Petitioner replied to these letters. The DPCC by letters

dated 20th and 30th August 2007 asked the Petitioner to apply afresh as its

earlier application dated 5th September 2006 had been sent to the Central

Government. Another application for consent to establish was filed by

the Petitioner with the DPCC on 8th February 2007. This was also not

disposed of within four months. Consequently the Petitioner contends

that for a second time consent to establish should be deemed to have been

granted on 7th June 2007. After about one year of the filing of the second

application, the DPCC asked the Petitioner to file an affidavit of

compliance, which was complied with. It was explained that no

environment clearance was necessary as the built up area was less than

20,000 sq.m. In any event consent to establish should be deemed to have

been granted. Yet, the DPCC insisted and threatened to take legal action

including levying a penalty, asking for a bank guarantee and ordering

closure. In the circumstances, the present writ petition was filed.



</p><p id="p_288">153. The DPCC has not denied the above contentions of the Petitioner. In

particular there is no denial of the assertion that the application for

consent to establish filed by the Petitioner on 5th September 2006 should

be deemed to have been granted on 4th January 2007. Therefore, in this

case even the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_499">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act cannot

be initiated by the DPCC. This will, in any event, not preclude the DPCC

W.P. (C) No. 4322 of 2008 (DLF Ltd. )

</p><p id="p_292">155. The Petitioner states that it is the owner of a residential plot at E-

Block, Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi having purchased the same from a

private individual in terms of Sale Deed for the purpose of construction

of a residential complex. According to the inspection report dated 2nd

June 2008, the total built up area is 14,246.918 sq.m. As such, no

environment clearance was necessary under EIA Notification. All

necessary permissions to construct a residential housing complex were

granted on 22nd August 2007. Before commencement of construction, the

Petitioner filed an application dated 14th May 2007 with the DPCC,

complete in all respects, seeking consent to establish. The said

application was not rejected for over four months thereafter. The

Petitioner submits that in the circumstances, in terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_502">Section 25</a> (7)

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_503">Water Act</a>, consent to establish shall be deemed to have been granted on

13th September 2007. However, to avoid any difficulty at a later stage,

reminders were sent to the DPCC by the Petitioner on 12th March 2008,

27th March 2008, 10th April 2008 and 16th May 2008. The DPCC

 threatened to take action against the Petitioner by its letters dated 3rd

March 2008 and 2nd May 2008 for not taking prior consent and prior

environment clearance. The Petitioner explained the entire position to the

Respondent. By letters dated 20th and 30th August 2007, the DPCC asked

the Petitioner to apply afresh as its earlier applications had been

forwarded to the Central Government. During the course of hearing

before the CMC, it was explained that the project was for residential

group housing and not for trade, commercial or industrial purposes; no

environment clearance was necessary and consent to establish should be

deemed to have been granted since the Petitioner‟s application dated 14th

May 2007 for consent to establish had not been rejected even four

months thereafter. Feeling aggrieved by the threatened action of the

DPCC of directing closure, imposition of penalty and requiring the

furnishing of bank guarantee, the present petition was filed.



</p><p id="p_293">156. The facts of this case are no different from the facts in W.P.(C) No.

4319 of 2008 except that the construction commenced on 5 th March 2008

and the construction was proposed to be completed in 3 years from the

date of its commencement. Further, the total built up area is 14,246.918

sq.m. and, therefore, there was no requirement for obtaining EIA

clearance. The DPCC is not disputing that the Petitioner had filed an

application on 14th May 2007 which was not disposed of within four

months thereafter. In terms of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_504">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water Act, therefore,

the consent to establish must be deemed to have been granted. This

being a residential complex, there was no need to obtain consent to

operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_505">Air Act</a>.

aside. This will, in any event, not preclude the DPCC from taking any

from the MCD and other authorities were granted in November 2006.

On 1st June 2006, the Petitioner applied to DPCC for consent to establish.

The application remained pending and was not rejected for over four

deemed to have been granted on 30th September 2006. However, to avoid

any difficulty at a later stage, reminders were sent by the Petitioner to the

DPCC in March/April 2008 but to no avail. During the course of hearing

the Petitioner was directed to file the affidavit of compliance. This was

done by the Petitioner. Nevertheless, the DPCC threatened to take action

against the Petitioner by ordering closure, imposing a penalty and/or

</p><p id="p_308">166. The Petitioner states that in an auction held on 15th December 2003,

the Petitioner purchased a commercial Plot No. 4 in the layout plan of

Shopping Mall, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi admeasuring about 15300 sq.

m. The necessary permissions from municipal authorities, Electricity,

Airport Authority of India, Fire Services and Delhi Urban Art

Commission were obtained. On 27th April 2005, an application for

consent to establish was filed by the Petitioner with the DPCC. The

DPCC was a party to the proceedings before the Supreme Court of India

in W.P. (C) No. 202 of 1995 titled as <a href="/doc/1026316/" id="a_520">T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v.

Union of India</a>. The Supreme Court, by an order dated 20th March 2006,

took note of the ongoing construction and directed that as a special case,

all permissions and clearances in the present case would be dealt with by

the Central Government. The DPCC was directed to forward all the

 papers to the Central Government. The DPCC did so. A public hearing

was organized to which a Member, DPCC was a party. One of the

requirements of the public hearing was the grant of a No Objection

Certificate by the DPCC, which apparently was granted or was deemed to

have been granted by the DPCC before conducting the public hearing.

The EIA Notification 1994 as amended on 7th July 2004 was replaced by

a Notification dated 14th September 2006. Certain clarificatory Circulars

dated 13th October 2006 and 21st November 2006 were issued by the

Central Government permitting the existing projects to continue. EIA

clearance was granted by the MoEF on 24th November 2006. The

application for consent to establish filed by the Petitioner with DPCC on

27th April 2005 remained pending. A reminder was sent by the Petitioner

on 16th July 2007 to know the fate of their application. By letters dated

20th and 30th August 2007, the DPCC directed the Petitioner to file a fresh

application for consent as the earlier application had been forwarded to

the Central Government. A fresh application for consent to establish was

filed by the Petitioner on 21st /25th September 2007 but this too was not

rejected within four months. For a second time, the consent to establish

was deemed to have been granted on 24th January 2008. It was for the

first time on 18th March 2008 that the DPCC asked for certain

documents. These were supplied. The CMC insisted on levying a penalty

on the Petitioner apart from requiring the furnishing of a bank guarantee.

21st/25th September 2007 and no rejection order was passed for at least

four months thereafter. The Petitioner is right in its contention that

consent under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_521">Water Act</a> must have been deemed to be granted on

the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_524">Water Act</a>s do not per se amount to acts of pollution much

Petitioner that the „precautionary principle‟ and/or the polluter pays

principle are being misconstrued and misused by Respondent No. 1. Fee

and fines/penalties are two totally different concepts in law. While a fee

or a levy can be collected under an appropriate statute by way of a

statutory interdict and used for the purpose for which it has been

imposed, a fine or penalty cannot be collected and used for discharging

governmental obligations or meeting expenses of the government. It is

submitted that the actions of the Respondent in imposing and collecting

penalties are ultra vires their powers under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_527">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_528">Water Act</a>

W.P. (C) No.8901 of 2008 (Brightways Housing and Development
Ltd.)
</p><p id="p_319">173. A commercial plot No. 7, Non-Hierarchical Commercial Centre,

Jasola, New Delhi, measuring 5198 sq.m. was purchased by the

Petitioner in an open auction of the DDA on 7th July 2004 for a total

consideration of ` 33,07,50,000/-. A perpetual Lease Deed was executed

in favour of the Petitioner on 29th September 2005 and the actual,

physical possession of the said plot was also handed over on the same

date.   Building plans for raising construction on the said plot were

sanctioned by the DDA on 7th February 2006. The Petitioner states that

although no EIA clearance was required for raising construction on the

said plot, either prior or subsequent to the raising of construction, but to

avoid precipitate action, the Petitioner filed an application dated 1st

 September 2007 with Respondent No.3 for EIA clearance and also

submitted the requisite documents.
</p>
<p id="p_320">
</p><p id="p_321">174. The Petitioner filed an application dated 25 th October 2007 with the

DPCC for consent to establish. A notice dated 18th March 2008 was

received by the Petitioner from the DPCC alleging that the Petitioner had

commenced construction without obtaining prior consent to establish. A

reply dated 27th March 2008 was sent by the Petitioner informing that its

application seeking consent to establish was already pending with the

DPCC. The DPCC sent a notice dated 30th April 2008 requiring the

Petitioner to submit an EIA clearance, approved architectural drawing

and completion certificate. Thereafter the DPCC sent a letter dated 1st

July 2008 informing the Petitioner that its case was being placed before

the CMC. The Petitioner submits that after exchange of correspondence

and certain meetings held, the CMC in its meeting held on 28 th August

2008, without appreciating the case of the Petitioner and without any

authority imposed a penalty of ` 1 crore and further called upon the

Petitioner to furnish a bank guarantee of ` 2 crores.



</p><p id="p_322">175. The MoEF intimated the Petitioner of the creation of a States

Committee for obtaining environmental clearance. As a result the

Petitioner applied afresh to the State Committee of the MoEF for an EIA

Clearance by way of application dated 2nd September 2008. No decision

was however taken on the said application. On a representation made by

the Petitioner to the DPCC on 16th September 2008, the CMC of the

DPCC in a meeting held on 24th November 2008 reduced the penalty to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 103 of 122</span>
 ` 72 lakhs and required the Petitioner to furnish a bank guarantee in the

sum of ` 1.5 crores considering an amount of ` 28 lakhs had been earlier

paid by the Petitioner to the DDA.
</p>
<p id="p_323">
</p><p id="p_324">176. This Court finds that the impugned order imposing the penalty has

not been issued by DPCC but by the CMC, which is a Committee

constituted by the Chairman, DPCC by an office order dated 28th

December 2006. First, no power vests with the Chairman, DPCC under

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_531">Water Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_532">Air Act</a> to further delegate his powers to the CMC.

Therefore CMC had no authority to conduct any proceedings for

imposing penalty on the Petitioner. In any event, even the constitution of

the CMC was solely for the purpose of granting/refusing/revoking of

consent to establish. It had no power delegated to it to impose any

penalty or seek bank guarantee or order closure of the premises or

recommend prosecution. For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order

dated 24th November 2008 of the CMC imposing environmental damages

to the tune of ` 72 lakhs and requiring the Petitioner to furnish a bank

guarantee in the sum of ` 1.5 crore is unsustainable in law and is hereby

set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_325">
</p><p id="p_326">177. The construction commenced in June 2005 and was completed in

June 2007. It is only thereafter that an impugned notice dated 18 th March

2008 was issued by the DPCC asking the Petitioner to apply afresh for

consent to establish. For the reasons already mentioned, such a direction

was not capable of being complied with. It would nevertheless be open

to the DPCC to now proceed in accordance with Section 25(5) of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                               Page 104 of 122</span>
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_533">Water Act</a> and relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_534">Air Act</a> but only after following

the due process of law. If, after making its enquiry/investigations into the

matter, the DPCC finds that the use of the premises is causing either

water or air pollution, then it can proceed thereafter in accordance with

law. It may be observed that EIA clearance was required for the project

of the Petitioner since the total built up area is 21096.513 sq.m. It is not

clear whether the MoEF has taken a decision on the Petitioner‟s

application dated 2nd September 2005.

W.P. (C) No.1391 of 2010 (R.C. Sood and Co. Pvt.Ltd.)

</p><p id="p_329">179. The Petitioner is stated to be the owner of Plot No. 10, Shivaji

Palace District Center, Shivaji Palace, Raja Garden, New Delhi. The size

of the plot is 5,832 sq.m. The plot was purchased from the MCD through

a tender process on 30th July 2004. The Petitioner was granted the

requisite permission to construct a shopping-cum-residential complex by

the DDA. The Petitioner, on 7th September 2006, applied to the MoEF for

EIA clearance. The Petitioner resumed the construction of the shopping

complex in accordance with the notifications and circulars.



</p><p id="p_330">180. The Petitioner states that it proceeded on the basis that it was not

required to obtain consent to establish or consent to operate under the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_535">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_536">Air Act</a> respectively. However, since the Petitioner did

not want any impediment in its project, it made an application dated 11th

September 2006 to the DPCC seeking consent to establish along with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">W.P. (C) No. 543/2008 batch                                 Page 105 of 122</span>
 requisite documents. The Petitioner alleges that the DPCC erroneously

forwarded the said application of the Petitioner to the MoEF for issuance

of a „No Objection Certificate‟ under the 2006 Notification. The

Petitioner claims to have been surprised to receive a notice dated 15th

January 2007 from the DPCC to show cause why prosecution

proceedings should not be initiated against it and why the establishment

should not be closed down as the Petitioner had started construction

without obtaining prior consent to establish under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_537">Water Act</a> and

prior consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_538">Air Act</a>. The Petitioner replied to the

show cause notice on 28th February 2007 stating that it was the DPCC

itself which had forwarded the application of the Petitioner to the MoEF.

Nevertheless, as a measure of caution, the Petitioner re-submitted the

application along with all requisite documents to the Respondent on 27th

February 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_331">
</p><p id="p_332">181. The Petitioner states that after an inordinate delay, DPCC replied to

the Petitioner on 5th December 2007 by directing the Petitioner to first

pursue its application for obtaining EIA clearance from the MoEF and

thereafter forward a copy of the said EIA clearance to the DPCC for

consideration of its application. The Petitioner was granted the EIA

clearance by the MoEF on 26th March 2008 which the Petitioner

forwarded to the DPCC on 27th March 2008. Thereafter the DPCC by

letter dated 28th April 2008 directed the Petitioner to submit an affidavit

giving item-wise compliance of all the conditions laid down in the EIA

clearance. It is submitted that although the DPCC had no role in the

matter of EIA clearance, the Petitioner, with a view to avoiding

10th June 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_333">
</p><p id="p_334">182. The Petitioner was called for a hearing before the CMC of the

DPCC on 17th September 2008. During the course of the hearing, it

appeared that the Petitioner had been called for the purposes of deciding

on the imposition of penalty and requiring the furnishing of a bank

guarantee for the purported violation of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_539">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_540">Air Act</a> on

part of the Petitioner. Ultimately, the CMC imposed a penalty of ` 59

lakhs and directed the Petitioner to furnish a bank guarantee for ` 1.18

Crores for a period of three years.
</p>
<p id="p_335">
</p><p id="p_336">183. On 28th November 2008, the Petitioner received a letter from the

DPCC alleging that the Petitioner had commenced construction activities

without obtaining prior consent under the aforesaid Acts and therefore

had violated the provisions of the aforesaid Acts. It was further alleged

that certain deficiencies were noted in the project/building of the

Petitioner. On 3rd December 2008, in another meeting called by the

DPCC, the Petitioner tried to explain to the DPCC that it had not

committed any violation of any of the laws, rules, regulations. On this,

the DPCC made a marginal reduction of the penalty from ` 59 lakhs to

` 50 lakhs and of the bank guarantee from ` 1.18 crores to ` 1 crore. In

response to the letter dated 28th November 2008 of the Respondent, the

Petitioner filed an affidavit on 30th January 2009 claiming that the

deficiencies pointed out by the DPCC in its letter dated 28th November

2008 had been duly rectified.

out the building to M/s. Shoppers Stop Ltd. and executed a sub-lease

dated 11th May 2007 for running a shopping mall in the said building.

Shopper‟s Stop took possession of the building in June 2007. The DPCC

in its meeting held on 23rd December 2008 directed Shoppers Stop Ltd. to

apply for consent to operate.
</p>
<p id="p_339">
</p><p id="p_340">185. The Petitioner states that it received another letter from the DPCC

on 3rd March 2009 referring to the inspection conducted by "Special

Inspection Team" of the DPCC on 16th January 2009 wherein certain

deficiencies were noted by SIT in the premises of the Petitioner. On 23 rd

May 2009, the Petitioner clarified to the Respondent that it had already

rectified the deficiencies pointed out by the SIT. The Petitioner states that

it was given a hearing on 21st January 2010. According to the Petitioner,

the DPCC at this meeting took a decision to launch prosecution against

the Petitioner. The Petitioner received a letter dated 11 th February 2010

from the DPCC stating that its earlier application of 11 th September 2006

had become infructuous. With the Petitioner‟s representation dated 26 th

February 2010 to the DPCC eliciting no response, the present writ

petition was filed challenging the minutes of the CMC‟s meetings dated

17th September 2008, 3rd December 2008 and 21st January 2010.

imposing environmental damages to the tune of ` 59 lakhs and requiring

the Petitioner to furnish bank guarantee in the sum of ` 1.18 crores is for

 The subsequent decisions dated 3rd December 2008 and 21st January 2010

W.P. (C) No. 9128 of 2009 (Ridge View Construction Pvt. Ltd.)

</p><p id="p_343">187. A commercial plot measuring 2500 sq.m. being Plot No. D-2,

District Centre, Saket, New Delhi was purchased by the Petitioner in an

open auction conducted by DDA on 29th September 2003 for a total

consideration of ` 43,41,00,000/- and the possession of the said plot was

handed over to the Petitioner soon thereafter. A perpetual lease deed

dated 1st July 2004 was subsequently executed by the DDA in favour of

the Petitioner. The DDA handed over to the Petitioner the architectural

conditions and controls which enabled the Petitioner to raise construction

as per the control drawings. Construction was thus raised by the

Petitioner on the plot till the plinth level much before 7th July 2004.



</p><p id="p_344">188. The Petitioner filed an application with the MoEF seeking EIA

 2008 issued by the DPCC to M/s. Taneja Developers and Infrastructure

Limited (`TDIL‟) wherein it was alleged that the construction of a retail-

cum-office complex was being carried out by TDIL. The Petitioner states

that on various occasions it clarified to the DPCC that the said

commercial complex was being developed by the Petitioner. However

the show cause notices continued to be issued to TDIL. Subsequently, the

CMC by an order dated 15th October 2008 issued directions for closure of

the Petitioner‟s retail-cum-office complex immediately and further asked

the electricity distribution companies to disconnect the electricity supply

and the DJB to disconnect the water supply.

Petitioner filed W.P.(C) No. 7850 of 2008. This Court stayed the

operation of the impugned order. Another show cause notice dated 10th

November 2008 was issued by the DPCC. This Court at the next hearing

held that on account of issuance of the fresh show cause notice nothing

survived in the said writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_347">
</p><p id="p_348">190. The Petitioner replied to the fresh show cause notice on 21st

November 2008. Thereafter, the DPCC issued a letter dated 8th May 2009

directing the Petitioner to close its commercial building immediately and

further directing the NDPL/BSES to disconnect the electricity supply and

the DJB to disconnect the water connection to the said building. The said

directions were purportedly as a result of a decision taken by the CMC on

23rd April 2009 and an inspection carried out at the site on 8 th April 2009.

</p><p id="p_349"> 191. The Petitioner submitted that no EIA clearance was required since

the built up area of the premises (19,227.15 sq.m.) was less than 20,000

sq.m. The Petitioner had installed a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) of 56

KLD capacity which was fully operational prior to 8th April 2009 and for

which an adequacy report/certificate had also been granted by a

recognised institute nominated by the DPCC itself. Regarding no

permission having been obtained from the DJB for extraction of ground

water from bore well, it is submitted that the Petitioner has already

obtained permission from the concerned authorities. The Petitioner states

that it is not utilizing the water from the bore well and it has deployed

tankers for fulfilling its requirements of water in the complex.        The

Petitioner alleges that when its representative went to the DPCC to

submit an application for consent to operate, the application was refused.

Petitioner on 8th May 2009.

<p id="p_351">
</p><p id="p_352">193. For the detailed reasons already discussed, the question of the

DPCC taking action for the Petitioner not having obtained EIA clearance

does not arise. In any event, the Petitioner with the built up area being

less than 20,000 sq.m., there was perhaps no requirement to obtain such

EIA clearance. If this was one of the reasons for the closure order then

such closure order is unsustainable in law. As regards the other

deficiencies pointed out, and the Petitioner‟s claim to have cured them,

they involve disputed questions which this Court cannot possible go into.

be followed by the DPCC prior to passing such closure order was not

complied with by the DPCC in the instant case.
