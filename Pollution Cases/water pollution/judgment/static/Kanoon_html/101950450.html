            For the Respondent No.5         : J.C. to A.A.G.
                                 ------

5/05.11.2012</pre><p id="p_1">:     The petitioner is a company and is in process of establishing

           a 'green field' 3 MTPA integrated steel plant in Chas-Chandankyari

           Block in the District of Bokaro. The industry is to be set up on

           investment of Rs.Ten thousand crores. According to the petitioner,

           out of the said amount they have already invested more than Rs.

           Eight thousand crores. For arranging the said heavy amount, the

           petitioner has to raise loan from the bank and other financial

           institutions on which they have to pay heavy amount of interest.

           Substantial amount has also been raised from the general public by

           issue of shares.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2      The petitioner has claimed that the proposed steel plant is

           being constructed with the latest technical knowhow and with virtual

           no pollution due to waste water and air emission. The waste water

           is to be recycled with the application of modern technology as also

           the air pollution shall be controlled by advanced devices bringing

           the standard of emission well within the norms provided by Pollution

           Control Board. The company has invested Rs.525 crores on

           pollution control measures.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 -2-</span><p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">3.    Before proceeding with the project the petitioner obtained

terms of reference from the Ministry of Environment and Forest,

Government of India and they were directed to approach the

Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board for conducting public

hearing/public consultation. After public hearing, the Environmental

clearance was granted to the petitioner. The petitioner, thereafter,

approached the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board for taking

consent to establish the said industry. The petitioner, for that

purpose, made an application under the Provisions of Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    The petitioner, in the meanwhile, was granted consent and

'No Objection Certificate' by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control

Board. The petitioner, thereafter, started the construction work. The

said 'no objection' was issued on the basis of furnishing tentative

locations of the project cited within the study area. The construction

was started and information was duly furnished to the respondents.

The period of 'no objection' was also extended from time to time

after being satisfied with the petitioner's construction in accordance

with the environmental norms.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    The petitioner, in the same manner, made an application for

extending the validity of consent to establish beyond 4.5.2010. The

respondent-Board thereupon served a notice to show-cause

purportedly on the basis of a report submitted by a memo dated

4.5.2010 alleging that the construction work is being carried out on

a part of forest land. The petitioner was asked to show-cause as to

why the petitioner's application be not rejected and an order of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -3-</span>

closure be passed on that ground.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.    The petitioner filed reply to the show-cause stating, inter alia,

that the land claimed by the Forest Department in Bhagabandh

including Plot No.1159, 1389 and 1120 was frivolous. No

notification was ever issued declaring the area as a protected

forest. A similar claim of the Department was under the challenge in

another case being Title Suit No.26/1989 and the claim was

rejected and the order was upheld up to the Supreme Court. The

Board, on being satisfied after considering the reply and the

materials on record, extended the validity period of NOC till

4.5.2011 by a fresh order dated 30.7.2010 (Annexure-5/1). The

petitioner, thereafter, resumed the construction activities and made

further constructions.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.    When the petitioner was about to complete the construction

of blast furnace, they applied for 'consent to operate' the said unit

as specified in the NOC for 'consent to establish' dated 5.5.2008.

</p><p id="p_9">8.    In stead of granting consent, the Pollution Control Board

issued another show-cause notice asking the petitioner as to why

the application for 'consent to operate' be not refused.

</p><p id="p_10">9.    The petitioner filed reply stating, inter alia, that there was no

ground for refusal of the consent as the company has complied with

all the requirements of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Pollution Act</a>. After application for

consent, four months' statutory period has expired and there is

deemed consent of the concerned authority under the provisions of

<a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_4">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 and <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_6">Section 21(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_7">Section 21(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/169222158/" id="a_8">21(5)</a> of the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 -4-</span>
</p><p id="p_11">10.   On expiry of the prescribed period, the petitioner made trial

test run of the unit and information was also given to the

respondents. The petitioner's representative also held a meeting

with the respondent no.2 and explained everything to their

satisfaction including that the area where the unit is set up is part of

the study area.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.   Despite the same, another notice dated 15.2.2011 was

issued by the respondent no.2 asking the petitioner to submit an

explanation for change of the site of the industry from South

Parbatpur, Chandankiyari Block to Bhagabandh, Chas Block.

</p><p id="p_13">12.   The petitioner sent reply to that letter stating, inter alia, that

the lands of village Bhagabandh were within the study area of the

impact study in respect to which clearance was granted by the

respondent nos.1 and 2 for setting up the steel plant. The

respondents, thereafter, sought for full land schedule giving the

description of village, Block, Khata No., Plot No., etc. which were

also furnished. The period for the consent i.e. 'No Objection

Certificate' was then extended till 4.5.2011.

</p><p id="p_14">13.   The petitioner, thereafter, made application dated 4.4.2011

praying for grant of extension of the said 'No Objection Certificate'

for the remaining units for a further period of two years.

</p><p id="p_15">14.   The grievance of the petitioner is that since thereafter more

than a year elapsed, but the same has not been responded by the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.   According to the petitioner, though the extension is deemed

to have been given after the lapse of the prescribed period as

provided under <a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_10">Section 21(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_11">Section 21(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/169222158/" id="a_12">21(5)</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   -5-</span>

the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_14">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water Act, in order to avoid

any controversy the respondents are required to issue an

expressed 'No Objection', as the petitioner has fulfilled all the

parameters and norms required under the provisions of the

aforesaid Acts. However, till date the respondents have kept the

matter hanging in balance. The petitioner, under that circumstance,

has to file this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.      Mr. M. Sohail Anwar, learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of the respondent nos. 1 and 2 submitted that the Board has

no intention to forestall the process of the industry. They are

concerned with the implementation of the provisions of pollution

control laws and the respondents has not proceeded to pass any

order or dispose of the application filed by the petitioner only in view

of pendency of this writ petition. Learned counsel submitted that the

matter shall be taken up by the Board without further delay and

effective order shall be passed within five weeks. He further

submitted that, if so required, a date shall be fixed for giving an

opportunity of hearing to the petitioner .
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.      Considering the aforesaid facts and submissions and the

stand taken by learned counsel for the respondents, this writ

petition is disposed of directing the respondent nos. 1 and 2 to

consider the petitioner's application and, as assured by them, if so

required, give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and after

taking into consideration the facts and provisions of law and the

related decisions, shall dispose of the petitioner's application within

five weeks from the date of receipt / production of a copy of this

order.

</p><p id="p_20">          18.   Until final order is passed, the respondents shall not take any

          coercive action against the petitioner.

                I.A. Nos.2991 and 3305 of 2012

                In view of the final disposal of the writ petition, these

          interlocutory applications stand infructuous.

</p><p id="p_23">                I.A. Nos.2991 and 3305 of 2012 are, accordingly, rejected, as
