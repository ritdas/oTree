under   Bonai   Sub-Division   of   Sundargarh   district   in   favour   of   Sri

S.N.Mohanty, the late father of the petitioner for a period of 20 years, i.e.,

from 20.01.1987 to 19.01.2007. On expiry of the said lease period, petitioner

has applied for renewal of the said mining lease in Form-J on 06.12.2005 for

another 20 years from 20.01.2007 to 19.01.2027 for a reduced area of

188.523 hectares surrendering the balance area of 144.540 hectares.

</p><p id="p_4">            Learned counsel for the petitioner draws our attention to the fact

that pursuant to application dated 25.10.2006, Ministry of Environment and

Forest, Government of India vide their letter dated 28.01.2008 under

Annexure-4, granted the environmental clearance in respect of 188.523

hectares. Thereafter, necessary approvals were also obtained from the office of

Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (WL) and Chief Wildlife Warden, Orissa

under the cover of their letter dated 03.07.2009 (Annexure-5).

</p><p id="p_5">            Thereafter, the Union of India in the Ministry of Environment

and Forest had granted in principle approval for diversion of 177.517

hectares of forest land, i.e., stage-II clearance under <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_2">Section 2</a> of the Forest

(Conservation) Act, 1980 vide their letter dated 31.07.2009 under Annexure-

the petitioner to deposit necessary NPV of Rs.13,72,72,870/- for 177.517

hectares. Renewal of mining lease was applied for 188.523 hectares, whereas

the above forest area falls under Eco-value class-I and the canopy density is

0.3 for which NPV is to be changed @Rs.7,30,000/- per hectare over the

entire forest area, i.e., 188.523 x Rs.7,30,000/- = Rs.13,76,21,790 and since

the petitioner earlier had deposited Rs.13,72,72,870/-, he was further called

upon to deposit the differential NPV of Rs.3,48,920/-within thirty days. In

compliance of such direction of opposite party No.3 under Annexure-7,

petitioner made deposit of the aforesaid differential amount of NPV vide

Bank Draft dated 10.06.2010. All other permissions in respect to clearance

from State Pollution Control Board etc. were duly obtained.

</p><p id="p_8">            As it appears that the petitioner had also moved for necessary

approval under sub-rule (2) of Rule 23C of Mineral Conservation and

Development Rules, 1988 (for short, 'Rules, 1988') and by letter dated

12.01.2011 (Annexure-12), the Regional Controller of Mines granted

necessary approval of Final Mine Closure Plan (for short, 'FMCP') for the

surrendered area of 144.54 hectares.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.          As it appears that the opposite party No.3, who issued No.2877

dated 05.06.2010 (Annexure-7) was transferred and after the joining of his

successor in office as D.F.O., Bonai Division, impugned letter dated

24.10.2011 (Annexure-13) came to be issued, wherein, the DFO claimed that

the total area under Renewal of Mining Lease (for short, 'RML') is 333.063

hectares and not 188.523 hectares and based on such computation, a

further demand of Rs.10,33,07,410/- has come to be raised. The said

demand was communicated under cover of letter dated 25.10.2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>



(Annexure-22) issued by the subsequent DFO, Bonai Division, which is the

subject matter of challenge in the present Writ Petition.


</p><p id="p_10">4.          Mr.Sanjit Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf

of the petitioner vehemently submits that the factual premises on the basis

of which the impugned demand came to be raised is wholly erroneous and

baseless. The petitioner has never applied for the Renewal of Mining Lease

(RML) of 333.063 hectares. As would be evident from application in Form-J

under Annexure-2 dated 06.012.2005, total area the petitioner sought for

renewal of mining lease in question is for 188.523 hectares. Based on such a

renewal application, forest and environmental clearance were obtained from

Union of India. Consequent upon receipt of the stage-II clearance under

<a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_3">Section 2</a> of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 vide letter dated 31.07.2009

under Annexure-6, petitioner was called upon for payment of the differential

NPV in respect of KJST mines under Annexure-7. Consequently, petitioner

has also deposited the additional demand of Rs.3,48,920/-, within the time

stipulated therein. It is further submitted that the successor-DFO, who had

issued the impugned letters under Annexures-13 and 22, is in effect seeking

to review the decision taken by his predecessor in office and while the

opposite party No.3 has sought to saddle the petitioner with a huge financial

liability, which the petitioner in law is not liable to bear. Therefore,

Mr.Mohanty prays for quashing of the demand raised under Annexures-13

and 22.

</p><p id="p_12">5.          Mr.M.S.Sahoo, learned Additional Standing Counsel, appearing

on behalf of the State placing reliance on the counter affidavit filed by

opposite party No.3-Divisional Forest Officer, Bonai Division, and in

particular, highlights the fact that in Annexure-13, the DFO has noted that

the surrendered forest area of 144.540 hectares included an area of 7.466

hectares of broken forest land. The petitioner had failed to provide any

document from the competent authority to show that the proposal for

surrender of forest area of 144.540 hectares had been accepted by the

appropriate authority and therefore the consequent demand is fully justified.

Apart from the above, he also places strong reliance on the report of the

Central Empowered Committee (for short, 'CEC') dated 26.04.2010, and in

particular paragraph 15 [sub-clause (b), (c), (d) and (e)] thereof. He further

submits that the said report of the CEC having been accepted by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, the demand raised thereto is fully justified.

surprised to note the contents of paragraph 5 of Annexure-13, wherein, the

opposite party No.3-DFO has noted to the effect that the petitioner had not

provided any authenticated document regarding acceptance of surrender of

141.51 hectares of forest area. It appears that the DFO concerned was

unaware of the grant of approval of the Final Mine Closure Plan (for short,

'FMCP') issued by the MoEF, under cover of letter dated 12.01.2011 under

Annexure-12, wherein, approval was accorded in respect of 144.54 hectares

of KJST for surrender/closure of the mining in exercise of sub-rule (2) of

Rule 23C of Rules, 1988.</blockquote><p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">            Regional   Controller   of       Mines,   Indian   Bureau   of   Mines,

Bhubaneswar, the competent Authority under the said Rules, having issued

Annexure-12 dated 12.01.2011 we are of the considered view that since the

said document was very much available with the DFO concerned; therefore,

the finding at paragraph 5 of Annexure-13 by the concerned DFO is wholly

incorrect and baseless. This erroneous finding of non-availability of

authenticated document issued by competent authority, accepting surrender

of 141.517 hectares of forest area proposed for closure of mining by the

petitioner arrived at by the concerned DFO is further fortified from the CEC

report dated 26.04.2010 (Annexure-E/2) to the Counter affidavit, wherein,

the concerned DFO who was a member of the said Inspection Team, who had

jointly inspected the site before granting the "FMCP" in respect of the forest

land proposed by the petitioner for closure of the mining. Therefore, in our
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                          8</span>



considered view, the DFO concerned was fully aware of such statutory

approval accorded under the Rules, 1988, and yet ignored the same.


</p><p id="p_16">             Apart from the above, in paragraph-1 of Annexure-13, the DFO

concerned has noted 333.063 hectares to be the total area under RML. It is

clear from the pleadings of this case as well as the application made for

renewal that the petitioner had never made any application for Renewal of

Mining Lease (RML) in respect of 333.063 hectares forest area as claimed by

the DFO concerned in the impugned notice/letter under Annexure-13. In

fact, the petitioner had made application for Renewal of Mining Lease (RML)

in respect of 188.523 hectares only. So, on this factual score also, the

impugned demand raised by the concerned DFO can no more survive.


</p><p id="p_17">8.           Insofar as contention raised by the State and reliance being

placed on the report of CEC under Annexure-E/2 to the Counter Affidavit, in

particular   relevant   portion   of   paragraph   15   thereof,   as   mentioned

hereinabove, is reproduced hereunder for ready reference.

             a mine covered under the 'deemed extension' clause,
             the mining operation should be permitted to be

</p><p id="p_19">      The mining in the forest land included in the
mining lease should be permissible only if, in addition
to the above, the approval under the FC Act/TWP has
been obtained;
</p>
<p id="p_20">(c)    no forest land can be leased/assigned without
first obtaining the approval under the FC Act. Therefore,
the forest area approved under the FC Act should not
be lesser than the total forest area included in the
mining leases approved under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_5">MMDR Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_21">Both necessarily have to be the same. In view of the
above, this Hon'ble Court while permitting grant of
Temporary Working Permission to the mines in Orissa
and Goa has made it one of the pre-conditions that the
NPV will be paid for the entire forest area included in
the mining leases. Similarly, all the mining lease
holders in Orissa should be directed to pay the NPV for
the entire forest area, included in the mining leases;

</p><p id="p_22">(d)    In Orissa, substantial area included in the mining
leases as non forest land have subsequently been
identified as DLC forest (deemed forest /forest like
areas) by the Expert Committee constituted by the State
Government pursuant to this Hon'ble Court's order
dated 12.12.1996. While processing and/or approving
the proposals under the FC Act in many cases such
areas have been treated as non-forest land. It is
recommended that (i) the NPV for the entire DLC area
included in the mining lease, after deducting the NPV
already paid, should be deposited by the concerned
lease holder and (ii) the mining operations in the
unbroken DLC land (virgin land) should be permissible
only if the permission under the FC Act has been
obtained/is obtained for such area. Keeping in view the
peculiar circumstances as was existing in Orissa and
subject to the above, the mining operations in the
broken DLC land may be allowed to be continued
provided the other statutory requirements and Rules
are otherwise being complied with;
</p>
<p id="p_23">(e)   The demand for the payment of the NPV as per
sub-para (b), (c) and (d) above should be raised by the
concerned Divisional Forest Officer within a maximum
period of 30 days and the mining lease holder should
deposit the amount payable towards the NPV (for the
balance forest area) within a period of 30 days
thereafter failing which the mine should not be allowed

            to continue its operations. Appropriate detailed working
            instructions in this regard should be issued
            immediately by the State Government."
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">9.          We find that the in the above factual backdrop and at this

juncture, the petitioner having paid the required NPV in respect of 188.523

hectares of forest area for which application for renewal of the mining lease

was sought for and the approval thereof had already been obtained vis-à-vis

having procured the necessary environmental and forest clearance including

clearance from State Pollution Control Board etc. reliance placed on CEC

report is in no manner justified to substantiate the impugned demand. We

are further of the considered view that the attempt made by the DFO

concerned to give retrospective effect for levy of NPV is impermissible in law,

since the petitioner in the present case had in fact applied for part renewal of

the original mining lease limiting it to only 188.523 hectares and is liable for

payment of NPV in respect of the said area only. Any attempt to raise

demand or seek payment of NPV in respect of the area surrendered shall be

treated as violation of mandate of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in respect of

NPV which has to be prospective except certain conditions stipulated in the

case of T.N.Godavarman Thirumulpad (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">10.         We are further of the considered view that in Annexure-7, the

DFO had determined the NPV payable and the subsequent DFO, in our

considered view, had no authority to review the decision taken by his

colleague to whom he succeeded. Even in Annexure-13, there is reference to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                       11</span>



the earlier DFO's letter dated 05.06.2010 and the same letter has been

appended as Annexure-7 to the writ petition. Mere reference to the earlier

communication of a competent authority cannot clothe any authority on his

successor to review the decision of his predecessor in office. We are of the

considered view that the opposite party No.3-DFO does not possess any

power of review of the order which had been passed by his predecessor.

Apart from that, it would be relevant to note here that under Annexure-15,

the necessary FMCP certificate has been issued by the Regional Controller of

Mines of Indian Bureau of Mines on 11.01.2012, wherein, the certificate has

been granted to the effect that the protective, reclamation and rehabilitation

work have been carried out in accordance with the Final Mine Closure Plan

approved vide letter dated 12.01.2011 under Annexure-12 for carrying out

mining work over and above the area of 144.540 hectares which was offered

for surrender.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">11.         We are of the further considered view that the opposite party

No.3-DFO appears to have acted under certain confusion of the scope of his

authority over the matter, in spite of his inspection being carried out for

implementation of the FMCP in KJST Mining lease (part area), where the

DFO himself was a member and the document to that effect is also appended

as Annexure-E/2 to the counter affidavit filed by himself. In the observation

made therein, it appears that essentially from the three blocks identified

within the surrendered area, i.e., 144.540 hectares, two blocks are virgin

and not distributed by mining and allied activities. The third block located in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                        12</span>



North-East corner of the mining lease area, was having two Bauxite quarries

named as Q-2 and Q-3 for which reclamation and rehabilitation were

approved in FMCP on visit of the inspection team consisting Joint Director,

Directorate of Mines, Government of Odisha, Divisional Forest Officer, Bonai

Division, Sundargarh, Senior Assistant Controller of Mines, Indian Bureau of

Mines, Government of India as well as Assistant Mining Geologist, IBM,

Government of India. It appears there from that, insofar as Q-2 and Q-3 are

concerned, they found that growth of trees planted therein is good but the

density is very less. Survival rate of plantation observed to be around 80%

and 70% respectively. Insofar as Q-3 is concerned, the user agency, i.e., the

petitioner has been advised to spread fertile foreign soil in the area and to fill

up the pits to be dug for plantation by foreign soil followed by watering

during the dry period to boost the growth of the plants.


</p><p id="p_30">12.          Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is

duty bound to carry out the directives of such Inspection Team, and in

particular, acted in compliance of mandates of Rules, 1988, but the fact that

the petitioner has undertaken to carry out the aforesaid steps pursuant to

the inspection report cannot form the basis/justification for raising a

demand for payment of additional NPV and that too for the surrendered

forest area by the petitioner. We are in agreement with the contentions

advanced by the petitioner and find that the petitioner having deposited the

NPV in respect of 188.523 hectares for which renewal has been sought for

and approval obtained, no demand of NPV beyond that area could be said to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                       13</span>



         be justified in law. Consequently, we set aside Annexure-13 as well as

         Annexure-22 and further direct that the amount of additional NPV deposited
