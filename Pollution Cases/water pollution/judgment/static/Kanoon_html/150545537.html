                            Both these writ petitions are being taken up for hearing

                     together as similar issues are involved in these two proceedings. The

                     writ petitioner in W.P. No. 2994(W) of 2013 has applied for electricity

                     connection in Nabagram block in the district of Murshidabad. The

                     process for effecting supply appears to have been held up for non-

                     furnishing of certificate under the provisions of West Bengal Ground

                     Water Resources (Management, Control and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Regulation) Act</a>, 2005

                     (the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>, in short). An affidavit has been filed by the Director,

                     State Water Investigation Directorate and Chairman, State Level

                     Ground Water Development Authority. In this affidavit the manner in

                     which license under the aforesaid Act is granted has been explained.

</p><p id="p_5">                            It is submitted by the learned Senior Standing Counsel that

                     the present policy of the State is to require certificates from all

                     applicants who want to use subsoil water through a submersible

                     pump energized by electricity. In respect of blocks in this State

                     categorised as critical and semi-critical, rigorous test is applied, but

                     for regular blocks, a liberalised procedure is pursued.

</p><p id="p_6">                            Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners in both the writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                2</span>

petitions submits that in both the cases, applications have been made

before the Water Authority. Let these applications be processed, and

actual connection shall be withheld till registration certificates from

the said authority are obtained. This Court would request the Water

authorities to take decision on the petitioners' applications within a

period of six weeks from the date of communication of this order.

</p><p id="p_7">       On such certificate being produced, within a period

of six weeks from the dates of production of certificate,

supply shall be effected to the petitioners. In the event for

any compelling reason such supply cannot be effected

within    the    timeframe      prescribed      above,     then     the

petitioners or any one of them, as the case may be, shall

be informed in writing the reason for delay.

</p><p id="p_8">       So far as W.P. No. 2994(W) of 2013 is concerned, it is

submitted on behalf of the distribution company that connection was

given to the petitioner from a common transformer on the basis of his

undertaking that he shall produce the certificate from the Water

Authority. In the event the Water Authority grants certificate, then

supply shall be regularised. If such certificate is refused, then there

shall be disconnection of supply.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       The writ petitions stand disposed of in the above terms.

       There shall, however be, no order as to costs.

       Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for,

shall be supplied to the learned Counsel for the parties as

expeditiously as possible, in compliance of usual formalities.
