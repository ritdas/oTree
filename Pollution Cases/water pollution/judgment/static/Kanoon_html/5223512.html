<p id="p_7">          It is not in dispute between the parties that initially the plot in

which the factory has been established by the petitioner was allotted to

one M/s Northern Glass Industries Limited to set up a glass factory. It

was a condition in the allotment letter issued to M/s Northern Glass

Industries Limited that if the compensation amount is enhanced in

future, the same shall be paid by the company. However, the above

named company failed to pay the enhanced amount which resulted into

attachment of the land in execution proceedings initiated on an

application moved by the land owners for payment of enhanced

compensation, lateron the property was put up on sale. The petitioner is

one of the purchaser. An application was moved to get a "No Objection"

Certificate under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_7">Sections 21</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_8">22</a> of the 1981 Act and <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_9">Sections 25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_10">26</a>

of the 1974 Act to set up a leather cloth industry but the same was

rejected on a ground that the petitioner has set up the factory on a

disputed plot. It is an admitted case on record that for violation of the

condition of the allotment, the plot allotted to M/s Northern Glass

Industries Limited was resumed and the said company had come to this

Court by filing a writ petition viz. Civil Writ Petition No. 3750 of 2005

challenging the order of resumption . As per the information supplied,

the said writ petition was allowed vide order dated 11.12.2007 and the
