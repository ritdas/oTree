     ORAL JUDGMENT: (PER A.S.OKA,J.)




                                                                                    
     1        The submissions of the learned counsel for the 
     parties   were   heard   on   the   last   date.   The   Civil 




                                                            
     Application   No.221   of   2013     made   in   a   disposed   of 
     PIL   by   the   Mumbai   Municipal   Corporation   discloses 
     shocking   state   of   affairs   in   Mumbai.     The   city   of 




                                                           
     Mumbai   is   stated   to   be   the   commercial   capital   of 
     India.  Now, it is sought to be made a "Smart" City. 
     But,   admittedly   quantity   of   60%   to   70   %   of   the 




                                             
     municipal solid waste generated every day in Mumbai 
                             
     is being illegally dumped in the city itself by the 
     Mumbai   Municipal   Corporation.     An   affidavit   was 
                            
     filed   by   the   Municipal   Commissioner   of   the   Mumbai 
     Municipal Corporation way back on 2nd  March 2015 in 
     which it is accepted that as of that date, there was 
      

     a   daily   generation   of   9400   Metric   Ton   (for   short 
     "MT")   municipal   solid   waste   and   approximately   1000 
   



     MT of debris   of buildings and that the generation 
     of solid waste is likely touch 10,000 to 11,500 MT 





     per   day.   The   same   affidavit   and   subsequent 
     affidavits   record   the   admitted   position   that   there 
     is   only   one   proper   facility   in   the   city   at   Kanjur 
     which   has   processing   capacity   of   3000   MT   of   solid 





     waste per day.  This facility  is in conformity with 
     the Municipal Solid waste (Management and Handling) 
     Rules,2000 (for short "the MSW Rules").  Thus, as of 
     March   2015,   every   day,   a   quantity   of   7400   MT   of 
     municipal     solid   waste   including   the   debris   was 
     being   illegally   dumped   by   the   Mumbai   Municipal 
     Corporation (for short `the said Corporation'). The 
     dumping   is   made   at   the   sites   at   Deonar   and   Mulund

     This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 30/03/2016

     which were required to be closed down long back as 
     the same are not in conformity with the requirements 




                                                                                    
     of the MSW Rules. Today, after nearly one year, the 
     quantity   must   be   much   more.     On   one   hand,   during 




                                                            
     last   few   years,   the   Government   went   on   increasing 
     Floor   Space   Index   (for   short   "FSI")   for   the 
     constructions   in   the   city     and   on   the   other   hand, 




                                                           
     though the MSW Rules came into force on 3rd  October 
     2000,   neither   the   State   Government   nor   the   said 
     Corporation   have   bothered   to   comply   with   the   MSW 




                                             
     Rules.  We may note here that Schedule-I of the MSW 
                             
     Rules   contains   implementation   schedule.   Read   with 
     Rule   4   of   the   MSW   Rules,   the   Schedule-I   provides 
                            
     that it is the obligation of a Municipal Authority 
     to   set   up   waste   disposal   and   processing   facilities 
     in   terms   of   the   said   Rules   by   31st  December   2003. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">     If what is stated in the affidavits filed on record 
     by   the   Municipal   Commissioner   and   other   Municipal 
   



     Officers is taken as correct, by the end of the year 
     2019,   there   will   be     processing   facilities   in   the 





     city   in   conformity   with   MSW   Rules   which   can   deal 
     with quantity of only 8000 MT per day.  Going by the 
     affidavit   of   the   Municipal   Commissioner   filed   in 
     March   2015,   by   the   end   of   2019,   the   generation   of 





     solid waste will not be less than 14,000 to 15000 MT 
     per day.  Thus, there is no possibility that in near 
     future,   the   said   Municipal   Corporation   of   the 
     commercial   capital   of   the   country   will   be   able   to 
     comply with the mandatory requirements of MSW Rules. 
     The affidavits on record will show that as a result 
     of   the   recent   incidents   of   fire   at   Deonar   Dumping 
     ground   where   illegal   dumping   is   being   made,   the

     citizens   in   the   locality   suffered   from   respiratory 
     diseases.  The pollution level of the city increased 




                                                                                    
     alarmingly. In many parts of the city, Air Quality 
     Index(AIQ)   was   more   than   330.   In   the   surrounding 




                                                            
     area   of   Deonar,   schools   were   required   to   be   kept 
     closed for few days to protect the children from the 
     pollution   created   by   the   fire.   We   are   informed 




                                                           
     across the bar that on this Saturday also there was 
     a fire.  Perhaps, what happened at Deonar may be an 
     indication of the things to come in future, unless 




                                             
     drastic steps are taken by the State Government and 
                             
     by the said Municipal Corporation.

<p id="p_3">     2        Now   we   come   to   the   prayers   made   in   Civil 
     Application No.221 of 2013 filed in disposed of PIL. 
     Way back on 2nd  April 2013, this Court on the basis 
      

     of   the   consensus   of   all   the   parties   including   the 
     State   Government   disposed   of   the   Writ   Petition 
   



     No.1740   of   1998   and   other   connected   petitions 
     including the present PIL No.217 of 2009.  Clause 10 





     of the consent order granted only three months time 
     to   close   down   all   the   dumping   sites   which   do   not 
     comply   with   the   MSW   Rules.   Going   by   the   said 
     Judgment and Order, the dumping sites  at Mulund and 





     Deonar were required to be closed down by 2nd  July 
     2013. Paragraph 15 of the said order granted maximum 
     time of 24 months for setting up  and commissioning 
     of   waste   processing   facility   at   existing   sites. 
     Thus, as far as the city of Mumbai is concerned, the 
     time   limit   provided     by   the   MSW   Rules   to   set   up 
     waste   disposal   and   processing   facility   is   already 
     over about 12 years back.   The time provided under

     in   the   city   is   being   dumped   at   Deonar   in   gross 
     breach of MSW Rules and the aforesaid Judgment and

     at village Karvale Khurd, Taluka Ambernath, District 




                                                            
     Thane   to   the   said   Corporation.     We   may   note   that 
     till that date, the actual allotment was not made. 
     As far as allotment is concerned, the same was made 




                                                           
     only after several orders were passed by this Court 
     and in particular the order dated 27th  October 2015 
     which records that as per the decision of the State 




                                             
     Government, the area of the site at village Karvale 
                             
     was   52.10   Hectare   out   of   which   only   39.90   Hectare 
     was   vesting   in   the   State   Government   which   was 
                            
     substantially   encroached   upon   and   the   rest   of   the 
     area was yet to be acquired.   It is only after the 
     said order that the State Government machinery moved 
      

     with   some   kind   of   speed.     There   is   an   affidavit 
     dated   10th  February   2016   by   Shri   Ajoy   Mehta,   the 
   



     Municipal Commissioner.   It is a detailed affidavit 
     which   records   the   steps   which   the   said   Municipal 





     Corporation proposes to take.  The steps proposed to 
     be   taken   as   regards   the     sites   as   set   out   in   the

     stated that the area of 32.77 H is under the process 
     of   demarcation   which   will   be   completed   by   April 
     2016.   After the demarcation, a compound wall will 
      

     be   constructed.     It   is   stated   that   by   the   end   of 
     2019, the first phase of Waste to Energy Processing 
   



     will commence which will take care of the quantity 
     of 2000 MT per day and in future, the capacity will 





     be increased progressively to 5000 MT per day.

     Rules which has a capacity to deal with solid waste 
     of   3000   MT   per   day   and   up   to   December   2016,   the

     What is allotted by the State Government is an area 




                                                            
     of 38.37 H, a portion of which is encroached upon. 
     It is stated that additional area of 12.20 H will be 
     acquired   subsequently.     It   is   stated   that   the 




                                                           
     process   of   removal   of   encroachments   will   be 
     commenced by the State Government which is expected 
     to   be   completed   in   May   2016   after   which   a 




                                             
     demarcation will be carried out and thereafter, the 
                             
     construction   of   a   compound   wall   will   be   commenced. 
     Considering   the   fact   that   the   land   is   encroached 
                            
     upon, perhaps the Municipal Commissioner has not set 
     out the outer limit within which the facility will 
     be set up thereon.   He has stated that as and when 
      

     the plant is set up, it will deal with the quantity 
     of 3000 MT per day. 
</p>
<p id="p_67">     12       Analysis of the aforesaid affidavits shows that 





     even if everything goes on smoothly, by the end of 
     year 2019, the  facilities in terms of the MSW Rules 
     will be available to deal with the municipal solid 
     waste of the quantity of only 8000 MT per day. These 





     facilities may be sufficient to deal with only  50% 
     to 60%   of the municipal solid waste generated per 
     day, as by that time, the generation of solid waste 
     per   day   may   easily   reach   quantity   of   15,000   MT. 
     There   is   absolutely   no   possibility   that   even   till 
     the end of the year 2019, facilities will be created 
     in the city of Mumbai in terms of the MSW Rules to 
     deal with the generation of entire quantity of the

     solid waste generated every day.  That is why in one 
     of the earlier orders, this Court observed that in 




                                                                                    
     the city of Mumbai, the MSW Rules are being observed 
     only in breach.

<p id="p_68">     13       Now  we   come  to   the   latest   affidavit  dated   15th 
     February 2016  filed by Shri Swadheen Kshatriya, the 




                                                           
     Chief Secretary of the State Government.  During the 
     earlier hearing, an issue was raised by this Court 
     as   to   whether   the   State   Government   intends   to   put 




                                             
     any   restrictions   on   the   construction   activities   in 
                             
     the   city.   It   is   stated   in   the   said   affidavit   that 
     major   proposals   received   in   the   city   are   of   re-
</p>
<p id="p_69">     development   projects   of   old   buildings   or   slum   re-
     development   projects.     It   is   stated   that   imposing 
     restrictions   on   the   construction   activities   will 
      

     have serious consequences. By the said  affidavit of 
     the   Chief   Secretary,   the   State   Government   has 
   



     expressed inability  to impose any such restrictions 
     on   the   constructions   on   the   ground   that   the   said 





     restrictions     will   lead   to   creation   of     slums   and 
     that the construction industry in the city will be 
     considerably affected.   What is material is that in 
     none   of   the   affidavits   placed   on   record   either   by 





     the   State   Government   or   the   Mumbai   Municipal 
     Corporation,   it   is   stated     that   any   scientific 
     assessment   is   made   of   the   impact   of   large   scale 
     constructions which are going on in the city on the 
     generation   of   municipal   solid   waste   including 
     construction   waste.   This   exercise   was   necessary   as 
     even   by   the   end   of   the   year   2019,   the   said 
     Corporation   will   be   in   no   position   to   make   full

<p id="p_73">     Again for this measure, perhaps the amendment of DCR

     not   at   all   helpful   today   in   any   manner   to   control

     The   implementation   of   the   Circular   can   be   made

     Corporation   during   the   period   between   1 st  January 
     2014 till 30th September 2015 (21 months). The chart

     only   318   (18.70%)   proposals   are   of   a   new

     the Regulation 33 of the DCR.  
</p>
<p id="p_74">     15       As stated earlier, there is no ground made out 
     by the Municipal Corporation for grant of extension 





     of   time   provided   in   the   judgment   and   order   in   the 
     PIL   as   even   according   to   the   case   of   the   said 
     Corporation,   there   is   no   possibility   of   creating 
     facilities in near future in terms of the MSW Rules 





     to   deal   with   the   entire   quantity   of   solid   waste 
     generation   in   the   city.     The   seriousness   of   the 
     situation   leaves   no   option   for   the   Court   but   to 
     grant   extension   of   time   so   that   there   is   some 
     pressure   on   the   said   Corporation   and   the   State 
     Government to act. It is now high time for them to 
     act.   If   no   drastic   steps   are   taken,   the   citizens 
     will   be   exposed   to   grave   danger   of   pollution.   The

     situation   is   alarming   which   poses   a   threat   to   the 
     commercial capital of India which is to be converted 




                                                                                    
     into   a   "smart   city".   As   far   as   this   city   is 
     concerned, substantial compliance with the MSW Rules 




                                                            
     and the directions issued in the PIL appears to be a 
     distant dream.
</p>
<p id="p_75">     16       Therefore, the first question is the period for 
     which the extension should be granted and the second 
     question is, what  the conditions, if any, should be 




                                             
     imposed while granting the extension.

<p id="p_76">              Considering   the   casual   and   indifferent   manner 
                            
     in which the Authorities have proceeded, grant of a 
     long extension will make the Authorities complacent 
     and   therefore,   the   only   way   to   ensure   that   some 
      

     drastic   steps   are   taken   by   them   is   to   grant   a 
     limited   extension   for   the   time   being   so   that   the 
   



     Court   can   monitor   the   progress,   if   at   all   an 
     Application   is   made   for   further   extension.     Hence, 





     we propose to extend the time till 30th June 2017.

<p id="p_77">     18   Now, we come to the second issue regarding the 
     conditions   which   can   be   imposed.     We   have   perused 





     the Circular dated 15th February 2016.  It is issued 
     in   exercise   of   the   power   under   section   154   of   the 
     MRTP   Act.     We   have   already   held   that   the   measures 
     suggested   therein   are   of   no   help   to   restrict   the 
     creation of municipal solid waste unless the DCR is 
     modified.  Therefore, the State Government will have 
     to take steps either on its own or by directing the 
     Mumbai Municipal Corporation to initiate process of

     the necessary modification to the DCR. This process 
     will   take   some   time.     Thus,   it   is   not   easy   to 




                                                                                    
     implement the directions given under section 154 of 
     the MRTP Act. For complying with the first direction 




                                                            
     of   setting   up   facilities   for   processing   bio-
     degradable wates, the said Corporation will find it 
     difficult   to   find   sites.   Setting   up   adequate 




                                                           
     facilities   for   disposing   of   the   entire   quantity   of 
     solid   waste   generated   in   the   city   in   terms   of   the 
     MSW   Rules   appears   to   be   a   distant   dream   as   the 




                                             
     facilities which will be created by the end of the 
                             
     year 2019 will take care of only 50% to 60% of the 
     total quantity. 
</p>
<p id="p_78">     19       As   of   today,   neither   the   said     Municipal 
     Corporation   nor   the   State   Government   have   come   out 
      

     with any solution   whatsoever for ensuring that the 
     quantity of solid waste generated in the city every 
   



     day   should   not   increase.     As   stated   earlier,   the 
     affidavit of the Chief Secretary indicates that the 





     State Government is more worried about the impact of 
     imposing   any   restraint   on   the   new   constructions   in 
     the   city   on   the   real   estate   industry.     At   this 
     stage,   we   must   note   that   while   dealing   with     the 





     similar   issue   concerning   the     Kalyan   Dombivali 
     Municipal Corporation (KDMC), this Court has imposed 
     restraints on the grant of building permissions till 
     the   facilities   are   created   in   terms   of   the   MSW 
     Rules.  It is true that the learned Advocate General 
     may be right in making a submission that comparison 
     cannot be made between the city of Mumbai and city 
     of Kalyan Dombivali for various reasons.

     20       Finding   that   the   KDMC   did   not   abide   by   the 
     provisions   of   the   MSW   Rules,   this   Court   in   a   PIL 




                                                                                    
     passed   an   interim   order   preventing   grant   of 
     development permissions in the city.     The Division 




                                                            
     Bench   found   that   there   was   no   possibility   of   the 
     Municipal Authority of complying with the MSW Rules. 
     In   another   case   relating   to   the   Municipal 




                                                           
     Corporation   of   the   city   of   Thane,   there   was   an 
     assurance   given   by   the   Municipal   Corporation   that 
     the   facilities   in   terms   of   the   MSW   Rules   will   be 




                                             
     created by the end of October 2017 which will cater 
                             
     the   need   of   the   entire   quantity   of   the   municipal 
     solid   waste   created   every   day.   Though   while 
                            
     admitting   the   petition   concerning   the   Municipal 
     Corporation of the city of Thane, this Court has not 
     imposed   restrictions   on   the   grant   of   development 
      

     permissions, it was made clear in the order that if 
     it   is   found   that   the   Municipal   Corporation   is   not 
   



     abiding by the assurances, a drastic order imposing 
     restrictions will be passed.
</p>
<p id="p_80">     21       In the present case, we have already held that 
     at   the   commencement   of   the   year   2015,     the 
     generation   of   the   municipal   solid   waste   in   Mumbai 





     was   about   10,400   MT   (including   the   building   waste) 
     per day and today, it may be of the quantity of at 
     least  11,000   MT   per   day.   Today,   only    3000   MT  per 
     day   is   being   processed   in   terms   of   the   MSW   Rules 
     which will be at the highest increased to  8,000 MT 
     per day by the end of the year 2019. By that time, 
     the   per   day   generation   of   solid   waste   in   the   city 
     may in all probability reach 15,000 MT.

     22       We have also pointed out that out of the lands 




                                                                                    
     handed   over   by   the   State   Government,   the   land   at 
     village Karvale   has substantial encroachments upon 




                                                            
     it. In fact, in the earlier affidavit of the Chief 
     Secretary,   the   stand   taken   was   that   the   Municipal 
     Corporation   of   City   of   Mumbai   should   remove   the 




                                                           
     encroachments.   However,   when   it   was   pointed   out   by 
     this   Court   that   the   said   Municipal   Corporation 
     cannot   exercise   statutory   powers   outside   its 




                                             
     territorial   jurisdiction,   now   the   State   Government 
                             
     has made a statement that it will take up the work 
     of   removal   of   the   encroachments.     An   area   of   12 
                            
     Hectare     is   not   yet   acquired   and   placed   in   the 
     possession of the said Municipal Corporation.

     on   in   the   city.   But   there   is   absolutely   no 
   



     possibility   of   the   said   Municipal   Corporation

     directions in the judgment and order of this  Court 
     dated 2nd April 2013 in near future. In fact, during 
     last few years, the State Government has amended DCR 
     providing for grant of more and more FSI. The State 





     Government   is   encouraging   unsustainable   growth. 
     Thus,   there   is   a   gross   breach   on   the   part   of   the 
     Municipal Corporation of the statutory provisions of 
     the MSW Rules. Moreover, there is a gross breach of 
     the order passed by this Court on 2nd April 2013 in

     disastrous  effects of the fire on the people living 
     in   the   proximity   of   the   Deonar   site   have   been

     in   the   entire   city   to   an   alarming   level.   Local 
     residents were affected by respiratory deceases. The 
   



     local   Schools   were   required   to   be   kept   closed   for 
     few   days.     The   learned   senior   counsel   representing 





     the   intervenors   pointed   out   that   even   on   Saturday, 
     27th  February 2016  there  was    a  fire  on  the  Deonar 
     dumping ground.   The learned senior counsel further 
     pointed out the earlier orders passed by this Court

     observed in the earlier part of this order that the 




                                             
     fire   at   Deonar   dumping   ground   has   posed   a   major 
                             
     danger   to   the   health   of   the   citizens.   The   Air 
     Quality Index figures placed on record show that due 
                            
     to   smoke   generated   by   the   Deonar   fire,   alarming 
     readings of air quality index were recorded in the 
     city.

<p id="p_84">     25   Going by the stand taken by the said Municipal 
   



     Corporation,   the   capacity   of   processing   of   solid 
     waste  at   Kanjurmarg     is   only   of   3,000  MT   per   day. 
</p>
<p id="p_85">     It   is  stated   that  the  dumping     at  Mulund   site  has 
     been stopped. Therefore, the only logical conclusion 
     which can be drawn is that every day  a quantity of 
     at least 7,400 MT of solid waste   is being   dumped 





     at Deonar site. There is no protection to the Deonar 
     site   in   any   manner.   The   security   guards   who   were 
     promised to be deployed at the site are not found on 
     the   site.       There   is   no   police   protection   to   the 
     site.   As stated earlier, the CCTV cameras are not 
     working. The No Objection Certificate (NOC) granted 
     by   the   Airport   Authority   of   India   to   the   site   has 
     come to an end long back and, therefore, the height

     serious issue of the breaches of the provisions of 
     the MSW Rules and breaches of the orders passed by

     health   of   the   citizens   of   Mumbai.     Due   to   the 
     breaches on the part of the State Government and the 
     Municipal Corporation, there is a complete violation

     with the hope that the State Government as well as 
     the Municipal Corporation will take up speedy steps 
      

     as pointed out earlier.   The Secretary In-charge of 
     the Urban Development Department is responsible for 
   



     implementation of the provisions of the MSW Rules in 
     the   metropolitan   cities.   Thus,   apart   from   the 





     Municipal   Corporation,   the   State   Government   is 
     equally   responsible   for   implementation   of   the   MSW 
     Rules,   more   so   when   it   is   its   responsibility   to 
     procure the land for landfill sites for the benefit 





     of the city of Mumbai. Unless drastic conditions are 
     imposed  for the grant of extension of time, neither 
     the   State   Government   nor   the   Municipal   Corporation 
     will   take   any   serious   steps.   The   culpable   inaction 
     of the Authorities for all these years is the cause 
     of   the   serious   situation   in   the   city.     In   the

<p id="p_87">              We have already pointed out the subsequent part 
     of   the   affidavit   wherein   the   Chief   Secretary   has 
                            
     expressed that the real estate industry will suffer 
     if   there   are   restrictions   imposed   on   the 
     development.     The learned senior counsel appearing 
      

     for   the   Municipal   Corporation   has   pointed   out   that 
     nearly   80%   to   85%   proposals   submitted   for 
   



     development   are   in   respect   of   re-development 
     projects.   On one hand there is no real possibility 





     of any Authority complying with the MSW Rules and on 
     the   other   hand,   the   development   by   construction   of 
     buildings   in   the   city   continues   on   a   very   large 
     scale.  There are  proposals for grant of additional 





     FSI by amending the DCR.  We are, therefore, of the 
     view that, in case of certain development proposals, 
     restrictions   will   have   to   be   imposed.   More   so, 
     because   neither   the   State   Government   nor   the 
     Municipal   Corporation   has   bothered   to   make   a 
     scientific   assessment   of   the   impact   of   large   scale 
     constructions going on in the city on the generation 
     of   the   municipal   solid   waste   in   the   city.   Without

     doing   any   such   scientific   study,   a   contention   is 
     sought   to   be   raised   by   the   State   Government   that 




                                                                                    
     there   is   nothing   on   record   to   show   that   the 
     constructions   which   are   coming   up   in   the   city, 




                                                            
     will have any major impact on the quantum of solid 
     waste   generation   in   the   city.  Prima   facie,   it   is 
     very   difficult   to   accept   the   contention.     In   any 




                                                           
     case,   this   contention   could   not   have   been   raised 
     without   making   a   scientific   study.   It   is   obvious 
     that   more   and   more   constructions   in   the   city   will 




                                             
     increase   population   density   which   will   generate 
                             
     more   and   more   municipal   solid   waste   as   also 
     construction waste.

<p id="p_88">     28       We  are conscious of the fact  that in  the city

     projects which are going on and the occupants of the 
     existing   premises   might   have   vacated   their

     on the grant of the   proposals/Applications for the 
     re-development   projects   including   the   construction

     consideration   of   fresh   proposals/   Applications 
     submitted for new construction of the buildings for 
     residential or commercial purposes. The restrictions 
     will have to be imposed on the implementation of the 
     provisions of the DCR for   grant of additional FSI 
     which will be incorporated hereafter by amending the
