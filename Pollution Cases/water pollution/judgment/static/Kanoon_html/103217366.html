<p id="p_2">Justice A.S. Naidu (Acting Chairperson)
Dr. G.K. Pandey (Expert Member)


                                   Dated 7th September, 2012



      Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Indian Council

for Enviro Legal Action Vs. Union of India and others

[1993(3) SCALE 579] has observed - tolerating infringement

of law is worse than not enacting law at all. The case in hand

is a clear example of infringement of law to the optimum.


</p><p id="p_3">2.   Every Indian is proud of "Kaziranga National Park,"

which is not only declared as a National Park, Tiger Reserve

under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, but

also is declared as a World Heritage Site by United Nations

Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                6</span>
</p><p id="p_4">      The Applicant is a resident of village Bokakhat, and is

concerned about the ecology of the area and future of the

Indian Rhino, Elephant and wide species of flora and fauna

available in the Kaziranga National Park. He has approached

this Tribunal invoking jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/174072768/" id="a_1">Section 14(1)</a> of the

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, inter-alia, praying for

appropriate directions to the Authorities to safe guard

Kaziranga and its ecology.         According to the Applicant,

unregulated quarrying and mining activities permitted in and

around the area of "Kaziranga National Park", not only

threatens the Eco-Sensitive Zone, but also the survival and

existence of Rhinos, Elephants and other wildlife species. It is

submitted that Kaziranga National Park harbours the largest

population of the Indian One Horned Rhinoceros and that its

survival is critically dependent on the protection of the

boundaries of the Kaziranga National Park as well as the

adjoining areas including the Karbi-Anglong hills, from

pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.     The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), it is

alleged, showed an apathy to the irregularities, overt acts and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 7</span>


several omissions and commissions committed by the

Authorities and acted as a mute spectator, to the rampant

violation of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

1986 as well as Rules framed thereunder, in as much as the

prohibition and restriction on the location of industries and

carrying on processes and operations in different areas

prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986

has been given a complete go by. The restrictions imposed

under Rule-5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 is

also followed more on its breach than its compliance.


</p><p id="p_7">4.    Drawing attention of this Tribunal to the Notification

dated 5th July, 1996 issued by the MoEF, it is submitted that

the latter on being satisfied that anthropogenic activities cause

air, water and land pollution thereby endangering forest,

genepool reserves, vegetation and living creatures and that

those activities should not be carried out at close proximity so

that our natural resources can be protected, and on being

further satisfied that Kaziranga National Park is the home of

three-fourth of the total population of the Rhino and contains
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  8</span>


largest single concentration of endangered species and wild

animals like swamp-deer, wild buffalo, elephants, tigers and

Gangetic Dolphins, it is the only park of its kind with a viable

low land grass land-ecosystem in South Asia, in exercise of

the powers conferred by sub-section(1) and clause(v) of sub-

section (2) of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_3">Section 3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986 read with clause (d) of sub-rule (3) and sub-rule (4) of

rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, notified

that on and from the date of publication of the Notification the

expansion of industrial area, township, infrastructural facilities

and such other activities which would lead to pollution and

congestion shall not be allowed within "No Development Zone"

which was specified in the Appendix to the said Notification,

except with the prior approval of the Central Government.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_3">5.      The grievance of the Applicant before this Tribunal is

that, in flagrant violation to the aforesaid notification,

mushrooming of stone quarries were installed indiscriminately

within the "No Development Zone" (NDZ) thereby causing

immense adverse impact on the environment, wildlife and

ecology. Unfortunately, no action was taken by the Authorities

to stop illegal installation of quarries and crushing units, in

spite of the fact that the Applicant had submitted several

objections / representations and approached the State as well

as Central Authorities with a prayer to take action to stop

infringement and violation of law. The Applicant also sought

information from the Authorities under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_4">Information

Act</a> (RTI) and came to know from the replies submitted by the

MoEF, vide letter dated 21st July, 2011, that there are no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   10</span>


records regarding granting of permission to any of the stone

crusher unit near the Kaziranga National Park.


</blockquote><p id="p_10">6.    Relying upon the GPS Mapping and Google Earth

Software, the Applicant brought to the notice of this Tribunal

that at least seven (7) stone crushing units are situated within

10 km radius of the Kaziranga National Park and are within

the NDZ notified by the 1996 Notification. The Google Earth

Map further revealed that many other stone crusher units were

also functioning within the NDZ. The applicant, it is submitted

having no other way out, had to approach the portals of this

Tribunal with a prayer to direct the MoEF to take immediate

measures to identify the stone crusher units and other

processes, operating in the NDZ and pass necessary direction

to stop operation or to vacate and further direct the defaulting

units to restore the environment that has been damaged due

to their overt and illegal act, to its original position.


</p><p id="p_11">7.    After receiving notice from this Tribunal, a reply has

been filed on behalf of MoEF (R-1) admitting the fact that in

the year 1996 a Notification was issued declaring NDZ in and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                11</span>


around Numaligarh refinery site which includes the area of

Kaziranga National Park.       It is, further, averred that in

consonance with the direction issued by this Tribunal by order

dated 19th April, 2012, the MoEF got conducted an inspection

of the site through responsible officers. The officers visited

the spot and had submitted a report with a map describing the

total area of NDZ and the number of industrial units

functioning in the said zone or on its vicinity. The positions of

the industrial units were demarcated on the map which was

annexed to the reply. After receipt of the report, it is averred,

that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Zonal Office

Shillong, the Regional Office (MoEF) Shillong, and the

Pollution Control Board, Assam, were informed to strictly

implement NDZ.        In paragraph 5 of the reply, the MoEF

relying upon the report disclosed that total number of 64 (sixty

four) units are located in the area of NDZ, the break-up of

which is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_12">
Stone crushers - 26 (twenty six),

Brick kilns - 14 (fourteen),

Tea Estates - 12 (twelve),
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 12</span>


Miscellaneous units - 12 (twelve).
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      The MoEF further took the plea that as the area covered

under the NDZ within its given co-ordinates is more than 600

sq. km. and the CPCB officials could not visit/cover the entire

area and assess the field situation due to heavy monsoon

and prayed for some more time to submit the correct position.



</p><p id="p_15">8.    On behalf of the State of Assam (R-2), a reply has been

filed taking a bald stand that neither any stone crusher unit nor

stone quarry is operating in the NDZ, except in Karbi-Anglong

district. According to the State, Karbi-Anglong Autonomous

Council Authority is an independent Authority who is

competent to place the factual facts with regard to existence of

industries within their area.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">9.    However, in paragraph 4 of the reply, it is admitted that

12 (twelve) number of stone crusher units which were in

operation till 31st December, 2011 are situated within 10 km

from the boundary of Kaziranga National Park, and that the

order with regard to suspension of permission of those stone
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               13</span>


crusher units is sub-judiced before the Hon'ble Guwahati High

Court. The Government of Assam, further averred that it is

fully conscious of the importance of rich-biodiversity of Assam

and its status as a National Park, Tiger Reserve, Elephant

Reserve and World Heritage Site of UNESCO and has

constituted the Kaziranga Biodiversity Conservation and

Development Committee to find out the ways and means for

protecting the population of Rhino, Elephant, Tiger, Buffalo

and many other important species in Kaziranga.



</p><p id="p_18">10.    In their reply, though, the State of Assam took the

stand that certain writ petitions were pending before the

Hon'ble Guwahati High Court and as such they were not able

to take action against the crusher units and stone crushers

situated within 10 km of NDZ, in the additional affidavit it is

admitted that the said statement was based on lack of

communication, and is a mistake of fact, in as much as all the

writ petitions have been disposed of in the meanwhile.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                14</span>
</p><p id="p_19">11.   A reply has been filed on behalf of Karbi-Anglong

Autonomous Council (R-4) taking the stand that the said

district is situated far away from the Kaziranga National Park

and as such the Applicant should have no grievance against

existence of any industry in the said district. In paragraph 8 of

the reply, relying upon the report submitted by the National

Tiger Conservation Authority, it is reiterated that there are

several stone crusher units next to the forest area and inside

the reserved forest.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">12.   Respondent Nos. 5 to 15 are the owners of the existing

units which are operating in or around NDZ. In their reply the

said Respondents took a positive stand that the units

belonging to the said Respondents are located outside the

NDZ as defined in Notification dated 5th July, 1996. According

to the said respondents, the stone crusher units are existing

since the year 1984/1993/1994 on the basis of valid

permissions issued by the Director, Kaziranga National Park /

Director/Divisional Forest Officer, Eastern Assam Wildlife

Division, Bokakhat and / or agreement executed by Divisional

Forest Officer, Eastern Assam Wildlife Division, Bokakhat and

that they are running stone crusher units on the basis of

consent issued by the Pollution Control Board Guwahati,

Assam. The units being their bread and butter they should be

permitted to operate the same.

</p><p id="p_23">13.   In course of hearing, a petition was filed by M/s.

Numaligarh Refinery Local Area Development and Safety

Forum, to implead it as an intervener. It claims to be a public

forum, formed with the objective to protect and safe guard

intents and rights of small industrial units and workers

engaged in the said units. According to the intervener, right to

life, includes livelihood and the industrial units are the

livelihood of its members.       Relying upon the ratio of the

decision in the case of "Olga Tellis &amp; Ors. Vs. Bombay

Municipal Corporation, (1985)3 SCC 545" intervener prayed

to quash the Notification dated 5th July, 1996 issued by the

MoEF with respect to the 15 km radius of the Numaligarh

Refinery Area as the same is contrary to the settled principles

of law enumerated under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

Learned Counsel for Respondent Nos. 5 to 15 took pain to

convince us that the tea industries being eco-friendly and as

some of the industries are existing much prior to issuance of

notifications in the year 1999, their existence should not be

the facts of this case. However, we are conscious that some

of the tea industries are existing within NDZ prior to 1996. Be

that as it may, by afflux of time, science and technology has

advanced to such a stage where the level of pollution can be

reduced considerably. This Tribunal is required to decide the

controversies applying <a href="/doc/170223725/" id="a_6">Section 20</a> of the National Green

Tribunal Act, 2010 which casts onerous duty upon this

Refinery Local Area Development and Safety Forum to permit

them to be impleaded as party. The said forum was granted

opportunity of hearing. The main grievance of the forum is

with regard to issuance of the Gazette Notification dated

5th July, 1996 by the MoEF declaring 15 km radius of the

Numaligarh Refinery Area as NDZ. A prayer is made to quash

the said Notification of 1996.        Law is well settled that an

intervener cannot make a third case or traverse beyond the

pleadings of the parties. Even otherwise, no relief can be

granted to an intervener. This being the settled position of

law, it is open to the intervener to pursue its grievance in

accordance with law, if the same is available to it.

prior approval of the Central Government.             A copy of the

Notification dated 5th July, 1996 was forwarded to the

Chairman, Assam Pollution Control Board (APCB) on

6th December, 1996. We fail to understand as to why there

was a delay of 5 months in forwarding the Notification, which

itself reveals lack of seriousness of the Central Government.


</p><p id="p_39">19.    In course of hearing, it was brought to our notice that

even before issuance of Notification dated 5th July, 1996, the

Government       of    Assam      had   issued   a   Notification   on

19th January, 1996 specifying No Development Zone in and

around Kaziranga National Park. In spite of issuance of such

notifications,   the    Central    Government        and   the   State

Government, maintained stony silence with regard to the

implementation of the notifications. Consequently, number of

stone crusher units, brick kilns and other polluting units were

illegally set-up in close proximity of Kaziranga National Park
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                      21</span>


as well as within the No Development Zone.                       Non-

implementation of the notifications both by the Central

Government as well as State Government of Assam speaks

volumes with regard to their callousness and apathy in

protection of ecology of Kaziranga National Park which

resulted     in     causing     pollution   thereby   damaging    the

environment as well as ecology and eco-sensitive zone.


</p><p id="p_40">20.          In their reply, the MoEF has clearly admitted that

approximately 64 (sixty four) units are functioning in the NDZ.

The said units consist of stone crushers, brick kilns, tea estate

and other miscellaneous units.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">             The reply given by the Central Pollution Control

Board, an autonomous regulatory body of MoEF by letter

dated 29th April, 2011, reveals that neither permission was

accorded nor clearance was granted to set-up any of stone

crusher units nor there was renewal of license of any stone

crusher units existing within the NDZ around Kaziranga

National Park. However, they clarify that stone crusher units

may    not        require     environment    clearance   under    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                 22</span>
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.              By letter dated

31st March, 2011, the Wildlife Division of the Ministry clearly

admits that they have no information regarding existence of

any stone crusher units in the vicinity of Kaziranga National

Park. The said statement appears to be incorrect in view of

the reply filed by the MoEF before this Tribunal



</p><p id="p_43">21.        It is well settled that pollution is a civil wrong. By its

very nature, it is a Tort committed against the community as a

whole. A person, therefore, who is guilty of causing pollution

has to pay damages for restoration of environment and

ecology. See M.C. Mehta Vs. Kamalnath 1997(1)SCC 388.




</p><p id="p_44">22.       After hearing Learned Counsel for the parties and

perusing the records, this Tribunal finds materials to reveal

that 10 (ten) stone crusher units have been set-up in the NDZ

after issuance of Notification in 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">          The Applicant, however, alleges that there are 27

(twenty seven) stone crusher units functioning within a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 23</span>


distance of 500 m of the NDZ. However, CPCB report has

mentioned clearly 11 (eleven) stone crushers are located

within NDZ.     23 (twenty three) stone crushers are located

within 500 km of outer periphery of NDZ.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">          The Tribunal also finds materials to reveal that 34

(thirty four) Brick Kilns are operating within the NDZ and the

same were set up after 1996. The report submitted by CPCB

fortified the said fact. In fact, all the Brick Kilns are situated

within the NDZ, except 1 (one) which was set up before 1996.




</p><p id="p_49">23.       It,   further,   appears   that   in   the   year   1999

Government of Assam notified the "Bokakhat Mini Industrial

Estate" (MIE) comprising of an area of 10 hectare for locating

saw mills within the NDZ.             Surprisingly, it appears,

permissions were granted for setting up stone crushers,

steel fabrication units, hotels / guest houses within the

MIE.    To the report submitted by the CPCB before this

Tribunal, a list of units operating in the Bokakhat MIE is

annexed. It is apparent that both the Forest Department and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                24</span>


the SPCB have granted NOC / licenses for setting up of the

units after 1996 within NDZ, in flagrant violations to the

restrictions imposed by MoEF in the Notification as well as

Rule-5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.



</p><p id="p_50">           There are also number of wood based units

functioning in the NDZ.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">24.        Apart from all these, it appears, after 1996 number

of Tea Factories have been established within NDZ.          The

CPCB admits existence of the said units and has furnished

details of tea factories out of which 3 (three) were set up after

1996. However, the report is silent with regard to the date of

establishment of other 12 (twelve) Tea Factories and it

appears due to climatic conditions and paucity of time, the

area where the said factories are situated could not be visited

by the CPCB officers.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">25.        The adverse impact on the ecology and the

environment by the units situated within the NDZ can be

classified as follow :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                         25</span><p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">i.     The      Brick        Kilns,   are    most   polluting

       industries. None of the Brick Kilns have

       stack emission monitoring provisions. They

       also normally do not have fixed chimneys.
</p>
<p id="p_57">       The emission from the Brick Kilns would

       cause hazards and adverse impacts on the

       environment, biodiversity and flora and

       fauna.</p><pre id="pre_3">


ii.    The stone crushing units are major source

       of    air   pollution.     They      cause   immense

       damage to the ecology and environment.


</pre><p id="p_58">iii.   In the Tea gardens, toxic pesticides are

       used which may pollute surface and ground

       waters.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
iv.    The Tea Factories use coal normally in their

       boilers. The sulphur content of such coal is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                               26</span>


                 very high and the air pollution therefrom

                 could pose a great threat to environment.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
          v.     Majority of the Tea factories, it appears,

                 have not installed acoustic enclosure in their

                 generators in violation of the environmental

                 norms.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
          vi.    The effluents of the tea factories, it appears

                 are directly released through surface drains

                 without any treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
          Of course, these are only few examples and in fact,

existence of the industrial units in the NDZ amounts to causing

atrocity to the environment, ecology and to the nature.



</p><p id="p_63">26.       The scenario of events discussed above reveal that

after issuing the Notification way back in the year 1996, no

follow up action was taken either by the MoEF or by the

Government of Assam.        The stipulations and embargoes

created in the notification appear to have been ignored and

grossly violated with impunity. The MoEF, after issuance of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                     27</span>


the notifications, was required to prepare the road map with

regard to implementation of the prohibitions specified in the

notification, but that was not done. It remained satisfied after

issuing the notification and even did not communicate the

same for about five months. The State of Assam admittedly

has received a copy of the notification, may be after 5 months.

It had also issued a notification of its own specifying the NDZ

in Kaziranga. Unfortunately, the State Government also failed

to enforce the prohibitions imposed by the notification. No

effective steps appeared to have been taken in consonance

with Rule-5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986,

consequently there was mushroom growth of industrial units

within or in the vicinity of NDZ.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">27.        Facts, in the case in hand, make it clear that the

Notification declaring NDZ within the radius of 15 km around

the Numaligarh Refinery so as to protect Kaziranga National

Park was issued in the year 1996. The said Notification was

issued in exercise of the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of

the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, and is still in vogue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                28</span>


and is not only binding but also enforceable. Issue no. 1 (one)

accordingly stands answered.
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">28.       Continuous infringement of law and tolerance of

violations of law, for the reasons good, bad or indifferent, not

only renders legal provisions nugatory but also such tolerance

by the Enforcement Authorities encourages lawlessness which

cannot be tolerated by any civilised society.



</p><p id="p_68">29.       In the case of Indian Council for Enviro Legal

Action Vs. Union of India and others (supra) the Hob'ble

Supreme Court has observed that "A law is usually enacted

because the legislature feels that it is necessary. It is with a

view to protect and preserve the environment and save it for

the future generations and to ensure good quality of life that

the Parliament enacted the Anti-Pollution Laws, namely the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">These Act</a>s and Rules framed and Notification issued

thereunder contain provisions which prohibit and / or regulate

certain activities with a view to protect and preserve the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                  29</span>


environment.       When a law is enacted containing some

provisions which prohibits certain types of activities, then, it is

of utmost importance that such legal provisions are effectively

enforced.     If a law is enacted but is not being voluntarily

obeyed, then, it has to be enforced. Otherwise, infringement

of law, which is actively or passively condoned for personal

gain, will be encouraged which will in turn lead to a lawless

society.     Violation of anti-pollution laws not only adversely

affect the existing quality of life but the non-enforcement of the

legal provisions often result in ecological imbalance and

degradation of environment, the adverse effect of which will

have to be borne by the future generations."

indifferent attitude exhibited by the Authorities, number of

polluting industries / units were established in and around the

No Development Zone of Kaziranga thereby posing immense

threat to the biodiversity, eco-sensitive zone, ecology as well

case of infringement of law. We, therefore, have no hesitation

to direct the MoEF and the Government of Assam to deposit

Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) each, with the Director,

Kaziranga National Park for conservation and restoration of
