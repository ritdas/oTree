                          The Petitioners, who are the residents of Tiruchirappalli, in these

                  Public Interest Litigations oppose the construction of the Bio Fertilizer

                  Procuring and Processing Unit comprised in T.S. No. 130, of Senkulam

                  Village in Ward No. 43 of Tiruchirappalli Corporation complaining that it

                  was causing air pollution and serious health hazards to the residents in the

                  neighborhood and have sought for the intervention of this Court in the

                  matter.

                  Respondents and perused the materials placed on record, apart from the

                  pleadings of the parties.

</p><p id="p_5">                  3.      The Writ Petitions were contested by the Learned Counsel for the

                  Respondents by highlighting that it was in furtherance to the Scheme

                  formulated by the Central Government under the Solid Waste Management

                  Rules, 2016, that it had been decided by the Tiruchirappalli Corporation that

                  instead of dumping the daily collected waste in a single plant or land fill site,

                  the same should be disposed within the respective wards of the local body by

                  adopting advanced technologies by opening a number of solid waste handling

                  facilities called micro-compost plant so that such waste generated can be re-

                  used in the respective areas. It is explained that due to rapid urbanization,

                  there is scarcity of place in Tiruchirappalli Corporation limits and with great

                  difficulty, a small portion of a larger extent of land belonging to the

                  Tiruchirappalli Corporation that had been earmarked for 'park' has been

                  identified for locating the micro-compost plant, for which the Petitioner

                  cannot take any exception. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Division

                  Bench of this Court in M.G.M. Nagar Nala Munnetra Sangam -vs-

                  Commissioner (Order dated 11.12.2018 in W.P. No. 12779) in which a similar

                  contention that the place earmarked by local body for maintaining a 'park'

                  could not be used for any other purpose has been rejected. It is also

                  highlighted that it would be meaningless to shift the micro-compost plant to

                  some other distant place as it would not serve the very purpose of

                  establishing the same if it was far away from the place where waste

                  generated had to be collected and disposed in a scientific manner.       It is

                  further added that the micro-compost plant has become functional during

                  the pendency of these Writ Petitions.

                                During inspection, it was noticed that total municipal

                          solid wastes collected are brought to the facility (dry, wet and

                          inert waste). Further on perusal of recent records of four

                          months it was ascertained that maximum solid waste received

                          was found to be 7.750 MT. (Wet waste - 3.353 Tons,

                          Dry waste - 1.57 Tons, Reject - 2.827 Tons).

</p><p id="p_10">                                Since the said Micro Composting facility is processing

                          more than 5 tons/day. Authorization from Tamilnadu Pollution

                          Control Board is required.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                                Hence as per Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules,

                          2016, the unit has to obtain Authorization and Consent for its

                          operation under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a> from Tamilnadu Pollution

<p id="p_12">                                The above micro compost plant is located very nearer (less

                          than 5m) to the residential buildings and composting activity

                          causing nuisance to the nearby public due to bad smell and flies.

                          During inspection also it was found that bad smell and flies

                          nuisance is not tolerable. Further plastics and other wastes

                          were stored in the tanks used for composting. During

                          inspection, nearby public complaint about the bad smell and

                          flied nuisance to them and requested to change the micro

                          compost plant to some other place."

</p><p id="p_14">                  5.      It is evident from the aforesaid report that the micro-compost plant

                  has been generating more than five metric tonnes per day and that the

                  necessary authorization from the State Pollution Control Board under Rule

                  15(y) of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, has not been obtained.

                  The said report also highlights that it has been found during inspection that

                  the micro-compost plant had not been maintained in hygienic conditions and

                  it has created severe health hazards to the residents of the locality.



</p><p id="p_15">                  6.      In that view of the matter, we are constrained to direct the closure of

                  the micro-compost plant in T.S. No. 130, of Senkulam Village in Ward No. 43

                  of Tiruchirappalli Corporation, which is the subject matter of the Writ

                  Petitions till necessary authorization as required under Rule 15(y) of the

                  Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, is obtained from the State Pollution

                  Control Board and all other statutory requirements for ensuring hygienic

                  maintenance of the same are complied with. Though several other

                  contentions are also been raised by the Petitioners in support of the relief

                  claimed, we have not examined the same as we have directed the closure of

                  the micro-compost plant for the statutory violation till those requirements

                  are complied and as such, the Petitioners are at liberty to agitate in that

                  regard if cause of action for the same arises in future.
