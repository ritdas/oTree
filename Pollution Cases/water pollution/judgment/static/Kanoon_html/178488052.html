      Shri Yogesh Kumar Gupta, learned counsel for the
applicant.
      Shri Pankaj Wadhwani, learned Public Prosecutor for
the non-applicant/State.
      Heard. Case diary perused.
      This is first bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C.
for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.1114/2018
registered at Police Station - Banganga, District - Indore for

<a href="/doc/1374604/" id="a_4">277</a>, <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_5">278</a>, <a href="/doc/1074140/" id="a_6">284</a>, <a href="/doc/4266/" id="a_7">308</a>, and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">34</a> of IPC and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_9">sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_10">26</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_11">44</a>
of Water Pollution &amp; <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_12">Control Act</a>, 1974. The applicant is in
custody since 3/11/2018.
      As per the prosecution case, on 03/10/2018 the police
Banganga got an information from the informer that injured
Naresh was brought to the hospital by one Naveen as he
suffered certain reactions because of some chemical was
flowing in the Naala. On the basis of the said information,
police reached at the place of incidence and during
investigation, they found that the applicant was cleaning the
offending vehicle in the Naala, due to which the foam came
out and the eyes of the people was burning. During
investigation,   accused has stated that he took the said
chemical from Geeta Shree Garden and the owner and of the
said garden is Manohar Porwal and the owner of the tanker is
Yogendra Chandrawat.       It is also alleged that due to said
chemical Jitendra, Liyakat and Naresh were injured. On the
            HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH :INDORE BENCH

                                  M.Cr.C. No.1164/2019
                                (Prakash Vs. State of M.P.)

           basis of the aforesaid,       the alleged crime was registered
           against the present applicant
                 Learned counsel for the applicant submits that       the
           present applicant is innocent and he has been falsely
           implicated in the present case. He submits that the present
           applicant is not the owner of the tanker nor he is the owner of
           the chemical. Only because he is a driver, he was driving
           the said tanker. The investigation is over, charge-sheet has
           been filed and conclusion of the trial is likely to take long
           time. In such circumstances, he prays that the applicant be
           released on bail.
                 Learned Public Prosecutor for the non-applicant/State
           opposes the application and submits that as per oral and
           material evidence which has come in the case diary, there is
           ample evidence against the present applicant and, therefore,
           no case is made out for enlarging the applicant on bail.
                 Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the
           parties and perused the case diary.
                 After taking into consideration all the facts and
           circumstances of the case, I do not find it fit to release the
           applicant on bail.
                 M.Cr.C. No.1164/2019 filed by the applicant has no
           merit and is accordingly dismissed.
