<p id="p_1">1.                 This is an Application filed under Section 14,15

read with <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_1">Section 18</a> of the National Green Tribunal

Act,2010. Both the Applicants are resident of village

Kolpewadi, and are an agriculturists. They have claimed

compensation due to loss of agricultural crop and damage

to their lands, as a result of discharge of untreated

effluents by Unit of the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 (In short,

'Sugar Factory').
</p>
<p id="p_2">FACTS AND LIMITATION

</p><p id="p_3">2.             There is no dispute about the fact that both the

Applicants are agriculturists and have their respective

lands at village Kolpewadi. It is undisputed that the

Respondent Nos.1 and 2, run a Sugar Factory of which

main product is 'sugar' and bye products are country

liquor, spentwash, waste water etc. The Sugar Factory

was established a way back and is in operation over a

long period of more than 30/40 years. The location of the

Sugar Factory is on the border of Kolpewadi and

Suregaon. At a short distance from the Sugar Factory,

there is River 'Godavari'. There is underground pipeline

which is used for carrying partially treated spent wash of

the Sugar Factory. A part of said pipeline is underneath

                                                              Page 3
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 of the agricultural land Gut No.48, owned by Applicant

No.2- Sakharam. The agricultural land Gut No.98

admeasures 53-Rs and is situated at Shahajahapur,

whereas the agricultural land Gut No.302, owned by the

Applicant No.1, Sukdeo, admeasures 53-Rs and is

situated at Kolpewadi.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.             Briefly stated, the Applicants case is that the

Sugar Factory used to discharge polluted water and

effluents in their agricultural lands, as a result of such

untreated discharge of effluents, their lands become

uncultivable. The groundwater of the area is polluted. The

water has become unpotable. The untreated water flows

from the lands of Applicants and released in 'Godavari'

through a Nulla. They made several complaints which

remained unheeded. Applicant No.2 - Sakharam had

cultivated sugarcane crop, which was due for harvesting

in the month of December, 2013. In the midst of

December, 2013, the pipeline carrying spent wash of the

Sugar Factory burst/broke open and, therefore, the spent

wash gushed out in his agricultural land. Resultantly, the

sugarcane crop standing in the area of 10-Rs was

corroded. He made complaint with the Revenue Authority.

The        Revenue          Authority,   prepared   panchanama      in

pursuance to his complaint. Though, Applicant No.1,

Sukadeo, was making grievance through representations


                                                                 Page 4
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 since 2011, yet the Respondent Nos.3 and 4, had not

taken necessary corrective measures to ensure that the

Sugar Factory shall not discharge untreated waste water

in the nearby area. The groundwater quality of the land

has deteriorated due to discharge of effluents from the

Sugar Factory.              The Respondent Nos.3 and 4, issued

certain directions when the water sample analysis

indicated that the water was contaminated, unpotable

and not useful for any purpose. Still, however, as per last

consent to operate order dated 6.4.2013, was granted to

the Sugar Factory after accepting Bank Guarantee of

Rs.50,000/-. Contamination of groundwater has resulted

into pollution of well water and therefore, Applicant No.1

Sukadeo, could not cultivate his land. His land has

become barren, due to such pollution, because of

untreated effluent discharged by the Sugar Factory.

Consequently, the Applicants seek compensation of Rs.

25 lakhs and 20 lakhs respectively. They also seek

directions against the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 for closure

of the Sugar Factory. They also seek directions against

MPCB, to take steps against the Sugar Factory to ensure

that no damage is caused to the agriculturists of the area,

due to pollution caused by the Sugar Factory.

</p><p id="p_5">4.             Main contestants are the Respondent Nos.1 and

</p><p id="p_6">2. They resisted the Application by filing joint written


                                                          Page 5
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 statement. According to them, the Sugar Factory has

provided           Effluent   Treatment   Plant   (ETP),   with     an

adequate controlled equipment for Boilers and also

provided stack height of 72 meters. The Sugar Factory

provides treatment through two (2) stage RO (Reverse

Osmosis) to bio digested effluent and Multi Effect

Evaporators (MEE) mixed with press mud and burned in

Gasifier to generate energy and bio char, which is used as

Fuel/Manure. It is averred that the Sugar Factory has

taken all necessary steps to control water pollution and

air emission. It is further contended that the Applicants

have made false allegations regarding discharge of

untreated waste water by the Sugar Factory in the land

adjacent to their agricultural crops, which caused

damage to their crops. It is categorically denied that the

Applicants suffered damages due to discharge of effluents

by the Sugar Factory run by the Respondent Nos.1 and 2.

So also, it is denied that the sugarcane crop of the

Applicant No.2, in the area of 10-Rs, was corroded due to

spread of spent wash on account of bursting of the

pipeline, carrying spent wash, which runs through his

land. According to the Respondent Nos.1 and 2, the

pipeline runs underground approximately 1 meter deep

and never broken down, known to them, it was broken

within the area of land of Applicant No.2 - Sakharam. It


                                                                  Page 6
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 is alleged that both the Applicants have led improper and

inflated claims without any foundation. According to

contesting Respondents, Applicant No.2- Sakharam, did

not allow them to repair the broken pipeline. The Sugar

Factory was required to incur heavy expenditure due to

obstinate conduct of Applicant No.2 - Sakharam. It is

alleged that the Sugar Factory has paid Rs.49,341/- to

the Applicants as payment for sugarcane crop on

5.4.2014. It is further alleged that average gross income

for 10R Land will not exceed Rs.13,000/- per year and

therefore, the claim put forth                   by Applicant No.2 -

Sakharam, is highly excessive. Both the Applicants

spread false rumors to defame the Sugar Factory and

filed the Application with malafide intention. It is alleged

that the Application is barred by limitation. It is also

contended that ad-interim ex-parte relief, could not have

been granted by the NGT, without hearing the contesting

Respondents.

<p id="p_7">5.             An additional affidavit filed by GirishJagtap on

behalf of the Respondent Nos.1 and 2, in order to specify

that water analysis reports, soil analysis reports, are

normal and the ETP, will not be found to be effectively

working.

                                                                      Page 7
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 Regional             Officer.         On   their        behalf,     affidavit      of

AnkushPhulse, regional officer, is filed on record. His

affidavit is to the effect that the Sugar Factory is granted

consent           to        operate    subject     to     certain    terms      and

conditions. Lastly, the consent was granted on 7.3.2014,

which is valid up till 31st July, 2014. The Sugar Factory

has not furnished the Bank Guarantee, as per the

condition enumerated in Consent to Operate. It is

contended that a Show-Cause Notice dated 28.11.2014,

was issued to the Sugar Factory because of the fact that

there were various non-compliances found during course

of inspection. Inspection carried out by the MPCB, reveals

that the Sugar Factory had not provided adequate ETP

and also bypass arrangements to discharge substandard

quality of effluent into Nulla was improper. However,

during visit dated 29th March, 2014, it was noted that

ETP was provided by the Sugar Factory and was well

working.           It       was   also     found        that   it   was   bypass

arrangement,                  provided     to      discharge        substandard

effluents from evaporation of span to open Nulla outside

the factory premises. Thus, the Sugar Factory did comply

with the directions of MPCB. The MPCB had received a

complaint regarding incident about discharge of spent

wash in the agriculture land of Applicant No.2 -

Sakharam (Gut No.98) at Shahahapur (Kolpewadi). The


                                                                                Page 8
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 regional officer, Nashik had then issued a Show-Cause

Notice to the Sugar Factory on 6.1.2014. The Sugar

Factory had stopped discharging of spent wash through

pipeline after such a Notice given by the MPCB. The

Sugar Factory started leaving of spent wash by using

tankers after primary treatment of bio-digester for

composting. It is stated that land of Applicant No.2 -

Sakharam was damaged and a portion of his crop was

corroded and as such, the panchanama was drawn on

24.12.2013. It is admitted by the Respondent Nos.3 and

4,     that        approximately         10-Rs,    agricultural      land   of

Applicant            No.2-    Sakharam,       was     damaged        due    to

discharge of spent wash, as a result of bursting of

pipeline, which goes through the land. According to the

Respondents Nos.3 and 4, now, the Sugar Factory has

upgraded the system and as such problem of air and

water pollution is duly addressed.

<p id="p_9">7.             The MPCB has further submitted that they have

issued another Show- Cause-Notice to the Respondent-

Industry            on      22nd    April,2014,     based       on    certain

observations made during the visit on 29.3.2014, calling

upon the Industry to reply within seven (7) days or else

<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">9.       We have heard learned Counsel for the parties. We

have carefully perused the documents placed on record. It

is pertinent to note that the independent Authority like


                                                                         Page 11
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 the Pollution Control Board, categorically admits two

things. First, there was incident of breaking of the

underground                 pipeline,   which   resulted   into   loss   of

sugarcane crop, standing in the land of Applicant No.2.

Secondly, untreated waste water was being discharged

and drifted through a Nulla connecting 'Godavari' river by

the Sugar Factory. In other words, before updating all the

equipment, the Sugar Factory had not taken due care to

ensure zero discharge, though assurances were being

given to install proper ETP. The MPCB had given interim

directions vide communication dated 22nd March, 2014,

for installation of proper ETP, furnishing of time bound

programme to update ETP within one month, not to

discharge substandard quality of effluents outside the

factory premises in any condition and                        to   furnish

irrecoverable Bank Guarantee of Rs.50,000/-, as well as

Bank Guarantee of Rs.5 lakh and Rs. 2.5 lakh, to secure

compliance of the consent conditions. The documents

placed on record, go to show that inspite of repeated

directions of the MPCB, the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2,

had not taken due care to improve the system, in order to

ensure zero discharge.
</p>
<p id="p_22">10.              Though, it is manifest from the recorded that

there was understanding of breaking of underground

pipeline, which resulted into gushing of spent wash in the


                                                                    Page 12
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 sugarcane crop standing in the land Gut No.98, owned by

Applicant No.2 - Sakharam, yet, the Respondent Nos.1

and 2, flatly denied such averment. They came out with a

case that the Application is based upon concocted

averments. This attitude of the Respondent Nos.1 and 2,

is unfair. It appears that the Respondent Nos.1 and 2, did

not file any FIR at the Police Station. Had there been any

sabotage           or       criminal   act   done    by   any   anti-social

elements, then they would have filed such report with the

police. Absence of filing any complaint with the police, is

indicative of the fact that bursting of underground

pipeline did occurred, because of improper maintenance

and undue care at the hands of the Respondent Nos.1

and 2.          The Respondent Nos.1 and 2, were required to

ensure proper handling of spent wash and other products

of the Sugar Factory, so as to avoid adverse impact on the

crops and the lands of nearby areas. The adverse impact

of pollution caused by the Sugar Factory, must have been

avoided          by         the   Sugar   Factory.   The   precautionary

principle is squarely applicable in the context of the

present case. It was expected that the Respondent Nos.1

and 2, should take precaution to avoid such mishap.

They did not take adequate precaution to avoid the same.

2014, prepared by the regional officer of MPCB that in


                                                                     Page 13
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 presence of villagers and the revenue officers, goes to

show that in land Gut No.302, of village Kolpewadi, there

was no crop found. Admittedly, Applicant No.1 - Sukdeo

owns         land           Gut   No.302,   admeasuring   83-R.    The

inspection report further shows that the channel near

Kolgaon-Suregaon boundary was found carrying water

and there was water flowing through the gutter, running

within boundary of the Sugar Factory. The Sugar Factory

was found to have discharged untreated water in the

Nulla and subsequently it was being discharged in a well.

The water analysis reports of the water samples collected

during the relevant period, are also indicative of the fact

that the water found in the area was unfit for human use,

agricultural use or for any other purpose.

</p><p id="p_24">12.             Perusal of the photographs attached with the

affidavit of the Respondent Nos.1 and 2, go to show that

the Sugar Factory has updated the system. It is, no

doubt, true that recently the Sugar Factory has improved

the system and the effluent discharge being done

scientifically. It also appears that certain incorrect

reporting was done in the newspapers, however, that is

not of much significance. The copy of 7x12 extract in

respect of Gut No.302, shows that for the year 2010-

2011, crop like Corn and Soyabin were cultivated in that

land. One cannot be oblivious of the fact that there is a


                                                                  Page 14
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 well in the said land and Applicant No.1 - Sukdeo is the

member of Sugar Factory. Still, however, now he is

unable to cultivate sugarcane crop.        The entries in the

7x12 extracts, show that the land is unfit for cultivation

of such crop, which requires irrigation.

</p><p id="p_25">13.            Be that may as it is, fact remains that due to

discharge of untreated effluent in the land Gut No.302,

owned by Applicant No.1-Sukdeo, at least for some

period, may be of a year or so, his land became

uncultivable. So also, is quite explicit that due to bursting

of pipeline, running underneath the land of Applicant

No.2 - Sakharam, his land Gut No.98, also suffered loss

due to corroding of sugarcane, in or about area of 10-Rs.

The Respondent Nos.1 and 2, failed to demonstrate that

they observed precautionary principle. The loss caused to

the Applicants cannot be attributed to 'act of God', i.e.

"vis major". Obviously, it is due to improper care taken

by the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, particularly, for the

purpose of arresting discharge of spent wash and

discharge of untreated water from the Sugar Factory, that

such damage is caused. Needless to say, both the

Applicants are entitled to compensation for loss sustained

by them and the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, also shall be

liable to restore the damage caused to the lands and

groundwater in the area.

that the Applicants have not given sufficient evidence to

justify the amounts claimed by them in the Application. It

is true that the amounts claimed by them appears to be

of much higher side. What appears from the record is

that Applicant No.1 Sukdeo, probably lost irrigation

facility for a period of couple of years and, therefore,

might have suffered financial loss for about Rs.2 lakh.

His claim for compensation of Rs. 25,00,000/- (twenty

five lakh), is highly inflated. It is without any rationale

and        foundation.      It   appears   that   Applicant   No.2

Sakharam, lost sugarcane crop standing in 10-Rs area for

one year, which could be valued at Rs. 1,50,000/-,

considering expenditure required by him for the purpose

of cultivation and overhead charges etc. Learned Counsel

for the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, invited our attention to

payment given to Applicant No.2 Sakharam by the Sugar

Factory. We do not found it enough to consider such

payment receipts as sufficient evidence to determine the

quantum of compensation, particularly, in view of the fact

that the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, have not come forward

with clean hands. Because they tried to deny each and

everything in their reply affidavits. The quantum of

compensation has to be assessed, of course, on the basis

of hypothesis and goods work, having regard to the

(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 market value of the crops, overhead charges and relevant

factors in the rural area. Considering aspects, we deem it

proper to hold that the Applicant No.1, is entitled to

receive compensation of Rs.2 lakh and the Applicant

No.2, is entitled to receive compensation of Rs.1.5 lakh

from the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2.

</p><p id="p_30">15.            So far as question of limitation is concerned, we

cannot overlook the fact that the present Application is

covered by <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_2">Section 14</a> read with <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_3">Section 15</a> ( ) of the NGT

Act, 2010. An Application can be filed within a period of

five (5) years from the date of 'cause of action'. Alleged

cause of action, even if it be stretched to the year 2013,

or first week of the said year, yet, the Application filed as

on 10.3.2014, is well within limitation. The Respondent

Nos. 1 and 2, failed to show as to how the Application is

barred          by          limitation.   The   Application   cannot     be,

therefore, dismissed on such ground.

Re:- Point (iv)

</p><p id="p_31">16.            It is observed from the submissions made by the

Applicants and also the Respondent Nos.3 and 4, that the

MPCB had collected samples of the well water from the

wells in Kolpewadi, Suregaon and Kolgaon on random

basis in last few years. It is noted that the MPCB had

collected two (2) samples from the wells of the Applicants


                                                                       Page 17
(J) Appln. No. 34 of 2014
 on 5.11.2011 and the reports of MPCB further indicate

that the water quality is highly deteriorated, particularly,

in terms of BoD, CoD and conductivity etc. Further some

other groundwater samples collected by the MPCB and

enclosed along with the additional affidavit, are also

exceeding the standards. However, the sampling exercise

conducted by the MPCB, is quite random and it seems

that no scientific approach was adopted to design a

sampling network and then establish an appropriate

sampling frequency, so that reliable statistic information

can be derived from such data. No doubt, random

sampling at various locations indicate the status of the

groundwater quality, which is deteriorated due to various

reasons including the impact of uncontrolled discharge

and storage of the industrial effluent, particularly in

'Kaccha' lagoon by the Respondent-Industry; the exact

quantum and spread of       pollution cannot be assessed

from such random data. It would have been more

appropriate on the part of MPCB, that in view of regular

complaints, a scientific data base should have been

developed, on the groundwater status in the area. In

absence of such data base, the Tribunal finds it difficult

to suggest specific remedial measures and also, the costs

associated with such remediation.

</p><p id="p_34"> 17.            The issue of groundwater contamination seems to

be serious, as it is undisputed fact that the Respondent-

Industry, is providing water supply to some of the

villagers due to well water pollution. The groundwater is

an important natural resource and more importantly

remediation of pollution of groundwater is a very complex

subject, as it is difficult to assess the level and spread of

contamination and further remediation takes long time to

perform and, therefore, it is necessary that efforts shall

be      taken         by    the   Regulatory   Authorities     to    avoid

groundwater contamination on priority basis. In the

instant case, probability of further contamination of

groundwater still persists, as the reports of MPCB

indicate           that     treated   industrial   effluents    of     the

Respondent-Industry, are even now not meeting the

norms and the critical parameters of BoD and CoD and

are still highly exceeding the standards. The MPCB

further submits that 'Kaccha' lagoons are still in the

operation and untreated effluent, is stored in the same.

All these observations give clear indications of continued

groundwater contamination. The MPCB should have

taken immediate action for stopping the use of 'Kaccha'

pit and carrying out necessary remediation thereof on

priority. Further, it is not clear what action plan MPCB

has       taken for continuous violation of its                 consent


                                                                     Page 19

 conditions by the Respondent-Industry. The fact that

MPCB has not taken any action after issuing Show-

Cause-Notice on 22nd April, 2014, when the matter is

before the NGT, speaks a volume. We have already given

our elaborate opinion on the enforcement policy of MPCB

in the matters of VinolKalwalvs State of Maharashtra

(Application No.30(THC)/2013) we expect that the MPCB to

take suitable legal action in the instant case also, within

next two (2)weeks.

<p id="p_35">18.            The Tribunal finds that the groundwater quality

in the surrounding area, has been deteriorated, as

observed from the MPCB reports. However, in absence of

scientific data base, skill and spread of the groundwater

contamination cannot be assessed.             It is, therefore,

necessary that the MPCB, which is Regulatory Authority,

and is also mandated under <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_4">Section 17</a> of the Water Act,

and shall take immediate measures to formulate the

comprehensive and scientific action plan for remediation

and improvement of the groundwater quality in the

surrounding areas. The MPCB may conduct necessary

assessment of groundwater pollution in the vicinity of the

Respondent-Industry and develop necessary action plan

for restitution and restoration of the groundwater quality

within next six (6) months. The MPCB shall direct the

Respondent-Industry to execute such action plan and if

plan, then MPCB shall execute the same on its own, may

be by taking the help of an Expert Agencies, if required.

The entire restitution and restoration exercise, shall be

completed maximum in next two (2) years. The entire

costs of developing of action plan and also execution

thereof, shall be borne by the Respondent-Industry,

which shall be recovered by the MPCB from the
