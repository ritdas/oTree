5/02.04.2013</pre><p id="p_1">      Heard the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                  The Bihar State Pollution Control Board, Patna filed a complaint

      case bearing C/1 Case No. 8 M/ 91 against the petitioner and M/s EMDET

      Jamshedpur Pvt. Ltd. through its Director - Manjot Singh for commission of

      the offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_1">Section 44</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

      Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) alleging therein

      that the accused persons are manufacturing certain items for the use of

      Telco and in that process, it has been using the outlet for discharge of

      sewage and trade effluent without obtaining consent as required under

      <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Sections 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_4">26</a> of the said Act which is punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_5">Section 44</a> of the

      said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  Mr. A.K. Das, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner,

      submits that after the case was lodged, the court without taking

      cognizance of the offence issued summon and then warrant of arrest as

      also process under <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_6">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C. was ordered to be issued against the

      petitioner. Those orders when were challenged before the Revisional Court,

      it were set aside by the Revisional Court. Thereupon, the petitioner filed an

      application under <a href="/doc/1245435/" id="a_7">Section 205</a> Cr.P.C. for dispensation of personal

      attendance which was rejected. However, that order was challenged and

      the prayer for dispensation of personal attendance was allowed by this

      Court. Thereupon, when it was noticed that the court is proceeding with

      the matter without taking cognizance of the offence, the instant application

      has been filed, wherein specific plea has been taken that the court has still
 not taken cognizance of the offence and without taking cognizance the

court proceeded with the matter which is quite illegal and this fact is

apparent from the order-sheet annexed with this application.

</p><p id="p_4">         Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the

records, it does appear that when a complaint was lodged by the Bihar

State Pollution Control Board, Patna, it was registered on 1.4.1991 which

order or subsequent order never shows that the court has even taken

cognizance of the offence against the petitioner. In spite of that, summon

as well as warrant of arrest and even the process under <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_8">Section 82</a> Cr.P.C.

were issued for securing the attendance of the petitioner. However, those

orders on being challenged were set aside but the fact remains that the

court without taking cognizance of the offence proceeded with the matter

which is evident from the order dated 28.5.2005/ 28.11.2005 whereby

notices were ordered to be issued against the petitioner which is under

challenge. The said orders in absence of any order taking cognizance can

certainly be said to be bad.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         Accordingly, those orders are hereby set aside with a direction to

the court concerned to proceed with the matter in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_6">         Consequently, this application stands disposed of.



</p><p id="p_7">                                                     (R.R. Prasad, J.)
