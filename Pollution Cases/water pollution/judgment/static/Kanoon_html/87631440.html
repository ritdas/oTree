     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED U/S 439 OF
CR.P.C. SEEKING TO QUASH THE ENTIRE PROCEEDINGS
IN C.C.NO.1009/2012 FOR THE OFFENCES P/U/S 44 OF
WATER (PREVENTION &amp; CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT,

    This   criminal    petition coming     on  for
Admission this day, the Court made the following:

                      O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This petition is filed to quash the proceedings

in C.C. No.1009/2012 pending trial for an offence

punishable    under   <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_1">Section     44</a>   of   the   Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.


</p><p id="p_2">     2.   The learned counsel for petitioner would

submit that the Board has issued consent order on

04.01.2013.    Therefore, the     learned    Magistrate

should not have taken cognizance of the afore-

stated offences to issue process to petitioner.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              :3:</span>
</p><p id="p_3">       3.    This submission is prima facie untenable

in view of the fact that the process was issued to

the petitioner on 19.06.2012.          If the consent, as

contended by the learned counsel for petitioner,

has been issued by the Board, whether consent

order       would   obliterate   the   offence   of   which

cognizance has been taken by the trial court are

matters for consideration on merits of the case.

The accused can raise this contention before the

trail court. The petition is dismissed.
