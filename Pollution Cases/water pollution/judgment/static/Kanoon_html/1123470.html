Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> arising from the Complaint:
</p><p id="p_2">                                      The Complainant has filed the present Complaint under
<a href="/doc/1083556/" id="a_1">Section 18</a> of the RTI Act (hereinafter 'the Act'), with this Commission, contending that certain
information with respect to CPCB surveyed enterprises discharging effluents into the River
Ganges should be proactively available on the website of the Ministry/CPCB under <a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_3">(b) of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a> 2005. His request is reproduced below:-
</p>
<p id="p_4">"As per the press release dated 13the October, 2010, of the MoEF {copy enclosed}, CPCB

surveyed 26 industrial enterprises which were discharging their effluents directly into the River

Ganga in the stretch of 500 Km between Kannauj and Varanasi. The findings and directions given

by CPCB to all these units under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_4">Section 5</a> of the Environment Protection Act (1986) were

presented as "Summary Chart of the Compliance Status of the Industries (Inspected) Discharging

effluents to R. Ganga between Kannauj to Varanasi". However, much relevant information
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                      Page 1 of 6</span>
 which may be quite important to ensure that the directions/ orders of CPCB were issued

without fear or favour and after following due scientific procedures were missing. Moreover,

no such information is given on the websites of MoEF or CPCB regarding other rivers.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Prayer:
</p>
<p id="p_6">   1. Each industry type has a different kind of pollution potential (for example a pesticide

      industry's effluent can't be similar to the effluent of a sugar industry) which depends the

      raw materials, chemicals, processes it use for the production of goods, however such

      information was missing in the above mentioned survey report w.r.t 26 industries. In other

      words CPCB may be directed to disclose the details of industries which are inspected in

      any such kind of survey. This information at least can give the abstract information to the

      general public so that it can keep an eye on the industries with high pollution potential and

      inform the government agencies in case of any violation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   2. There are no details of the discharge standards (Global/Indian) which are being followed /

      devised by the CPCB to determine the quality of effluent of these industries? As the

      standards are the touchstone on which any such conclusions are tested, their disclosure is

      necessary to ascertain that the validity of conclusion by public in general or researches in

      particular.
</p>
<p id="p_8">   3. There is no information of the findings of the CPCB regarding the discharge quality

      parameters for the effluent of each of these 26 industries, for instance, in terms of

      Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved

      Oxygen (DO), total / fecal coliform and concentrations major ions, heavy metals, organic

      solvent etc., CPCB might have analyzed while assessing the quality of effluent as per the

      discharge quality standard they follow. This is particularly very important to ensure that

      standard practices for waste water quality analysis were followed or not, or, whether each

      industry's effluent was checked for all established parameters before giving order of

      clearance, closing or minor improvements.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                       Page 2 of 6</span>
<p id="p_9">    4. Interestingly 7 units were found to be closed during inspection; however, the date and time

       of inspection were missing? There is also no information regarding the follow up action

       which CPCB might have taken for those 7 units. The Hon'ble IC is requested to direct the

       CPCB to furnish this crucial information in all such survey, or otherwise CPCB may be

       directed to state on its website that no follow up action have been taken in this regard till

       date. Lack of this information renders the survey and actions taken by CPCB on violators

       meaningless.
</p>
<p id="p_10">   5. There is no information on the CPCB or MoEF websites, that whether CPCB has followed

       up other 19 industries after serving notice to ensure the compliance of its directions given

       to the latter. Hon'ble IC may direct CPCB to display compliance report on their website. It

       may be noted that only with this information general public can complain to the competent

       authority, if violators were found not to follow the directions of CPCB by general public at

       any point of time. However, in case of non availability of any such report CPCB may be

       directed to state that no follow up action has been taken.
</p>
<p id="p_11">   6. The Hon'ble IC is requested to direct the CPCB to disclose the names of all the industrial

       units along all the major rivers of India which are discharging their effluent directly into

       these streams and also the name of industries which direct their effluent to a common

       effluent treatment plant before discharging in the rivers?
</p>
<p id="p_12">   7. The websites of CPCB or MoEF also do not mention the details of any such survey which

       might have conducted along any other major river except the mentioned stretch of River

       Ganga or its tributaries in India? Hon'ble IC is requested to direct the CPCB to disclose

       such details, if any, or otherwise it may be directed to state that no such survey has ever

       been conducted along any other river of India."

<p id="p_13">Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing:
</p><p id="p_14">The following were present:
</p><p id="p_15">Appellant: Mr. Ankur Goyal;
</p><p id="p_16">Respondent: Mr. Pankaj Vaerma, Dy. Director, Ministry of Environment &amp; Forest, Government
of India on behalf of Sh. Rajneesh Dube, Jt. Secretary. Dr. D.D. Basu Scientist 'E', Mr. A
Sudhakar, Scientist 'D', Mr. D.S Kharat, Scientist 'D' and Mr. Nazimuddin Scientist 'D', Central

<p id="p_17"> The Complainant states that out of 26 industries inspected by the CPCB, seven were found closed.
Furthermore, specific details found in each industry and what kind of remedial action being taken
by the industries and the standard of measurement on the basis of which the CPCB concluded
that the industry was not complying with the standards.
</p>
<p id="p_18">The Respondents state that when an industry is decided to be closed the water electricity is
directed to the civic agencies to be cut off and the relevant authorities are informed. However, the
Complainant states that when these industries are re-opened then the basis and measure on which
the same is allowed should be made available in public domain. Dr. D.D. Basu states that the
Complainant has done a good job of reading the entire rules and legislations and come to the
analysis. Dr. Basu welcomes his efforts and states that there various state pollution control boards
and therefore compilation of reports takes time.
</p>
<p id="p_19">Mr. Ankur Goyal states that it is stated that the industries were found to be closed, the basis on
which these were closed are not know. Top this Dr. Basu responds that many industries close
because of economic crises, therefore there is no role of the CPCB. The Commission is of the
opinion that in such a situation corruption can not be ruled out. Dr. Basu agrees that the CPCB
would have no problem in publishing on its website the details of the industries which were found
to be closed. The Commission and the Respondents agree that the co-operation of the citizens is
essential in maintaining a strict vigil on such industries.
</p>
<p id="p_20">The Complainant states Electroplating industries, tanneries and pesticide industries are also
responsible for causing a large amount of water pollution. The standards of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment
Protection Act</a> have to be followed. The Respondents state that the water is inspected mostly on
direction of the Courts, for industries there are four or five main parameters are monitored,
however even if one standard is not found satisfactory - the industry may be closed down,
furthermore during suo moto exercises standards notified under the Environmental Protection Act,
1986 are followed.
</p>
<p id="p_21">The Respondents state the list of the grossly polluting industries is available at
http://cpcb.nic.in/gpi.pdf, the list of Polluted river stretches is available at
http://cpcb.nic.in/upload/NewItems/NewItem_172_FinalPollutedStretches.pdf. The Commission
has viewed the same and a copy has been made available to the Complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_22"> <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">The Act</a>ion of non-complying industries, usually the state s given directions under <a href="/doc/192670971/" id="a_7">Section 18</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_23">(b) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a> 1974 to take action and <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_9">Section 5</a> directions are given directly to the
industries in cases of gross/irreversible environmental damage. The Complaint submits that the
list of directions given under both the Sections including the copies of the directions should be
available on the website. The Commission directs that these shall also be made available on the
website of the CPCB under a separate head on the main page.
</p>
<p id="p_24">The Respondents also state that the CPCB has also prepared a report on the Environment
Information System on GIS Platform, which will provide access to Environmental Information
with GEO reference on water quality and Air quality for the entire country. The Commission
hereby directs the CPCB to publish this report on the website of the board under a separate head.
</p>
<p id="p_25">The Commission has perused the website of the CPCB has not published its manuals which
have to be published in pursuance of their obligations under <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_10">section 4</a> (1) (b) of the Act.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                        Page 4 of 6</span>
<p id="p_26"> It was further asserted in the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED), held at Rio De Janiero, that 'environmental issues are best handled with participation
of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have
appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities,
including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the
opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage
public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to
judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.'
Thus, obligating member states to disseminate information concerning the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_27">The Right to Information is a fundamental right of the citizens which has been codified by the RTI
act, No. 22 of 2005. The act envisions that all citizens shall receive information primarily by suo
moto disclosures by various public authorities as prescribed by section (4) of the act. Disclosures
in accordance with the said Section are crucial to ensure transparency and accountability in
institutions. This would reduce the load of RTI Applications being filed with each institution as
information would be freely available to citizens and they would not have to apply for it. It further
envisages that citizens would be required to specifically ask for information under section (6) only
in a few cases. Citizens have been demanding that certain information is essential to them and
should be available proactively in form of public notice boards, display boards etc.
