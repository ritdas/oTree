service tax thereon from 1st September 2008 to 31st March 2009,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009      Page 1 of 16</span>
 pendente lite and future interest @ 18% per annum and a decree in
the sum of Rs. 3,30,900 as damages/mesne profits for the month of
April 2009, pendente lite interest and future damages including
service tax on Rs. 3,30,900 from the date of filing of the suit till such
date that the Defendant vacates and hands over the peaceful
possession of the suit property, and a decree of permanent injunction
to restrain the Defendant, their directors, agents, servants or any one
acting for and on their behalf from sub-letting, assigning or parting
with possession of the suit property in favour of the third party and to
award costs.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2. The case of the Plaintiff is that he is the owner of the suit property
which is an immovable property that is freehold, including the
building constructed thereon, by virtue of conveyance deed dated 25th
January 2007 executed in his favour by the President of India. The
Defendant is the licensee of the built up portion on the basement of
the suit property. The Plaintiff states that the suit property was given
on licence to the Defendnat by an agreement of leave and licence
dated 9th April 2008 for a period of three years with effect from 1st
July 2007 on a monthly licence fee of Rs. 1,50,000 payable on or
before the seventh day of each month by cheque, after deduction of
tax at source. The Defendant was also liable to pay service tax as
applicable. The Defendant has paid a sum of Rs. 1,80,000 by way of
interest free security deposit which is refundable upon the Defendant
to vacate the suit property, after adjustment of all dues towards rent,
service tax etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 2 of 16</span>
</p><p id="p_4"> 3. The Plaintiff states that the suit property was given to the
Defendant for industrial purposes, i.e., to run and operate a workshop
and servicing of motor cycles under the supervision of Hero Honda
Motors Limited. However, it was stipulated in the agreement that the
Defendant was to comply with the rules and regulations of the local
authorities with regard to the premises. Either party could terminate
the agreement by giving three months' notice in writing to the other
to vacate the premises. It was further stipulated that if the
Government or the authorities prohibited the Defendant from carrying
on its operation from the suit premises, the Plaintiff could issue a
termination notice.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4. The Plaintiff states that by an order dated 17th April 2008 the Delhi
Pollution Control Committee ('DPCC') declared the Defendant's
workshop at the suit property as a polluting unit and directed the
Defendant to stop all operations from the unit with immediate effect.
The Defendant was irregular in the payment of licence fee and has
stopped the payment of licence fee altogether with effect from 1st
September 2008. It is further stated that the Defendant has not
bothered to pay to the Plaintiff despite repeated requests and
reminders. A legal notice dated 19th December 2008 was issued by
the Plaintiff through his Advocate calling upon the Defendant to
vacate and hand over the peaceful possession of the suit property to
the Plaintiff by 31st January 2009. The Defendant was also called
upon to pay arrears of licence fee with effect from 1st September
2008. Apprehending that the Defendant was attempting to sublet,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 3 of 16</span>
 assign and or part with possession of the suit property in favour of the
third party, the present suit was filed seeking the reliefs as mentioned
hereinbefore.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5. Summons in the suit and notice on the application, IA No. 6846 of
2009, under Order XXXIX Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC was issued to the
Defendant by the Court on 22nd May 2009. The following interim
order was passed by the Court on that date:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "IA No. 6846 of 2009

        The Plaintiff in this suit for possession/ejectment of ex

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        The Plaintiff has made out a case for grant of ex parte ad

        application is restrained from parting with possession of

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        The provisions of Order 39 Rule 3 CPC be completed
        within one week."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">6. Apart from the written statement, a counter claim was also filed by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 4 of 16</span>
 the Defendant. On 17th July 2010 the Court passed the following
order:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">         "1. The learned counsel for the Defendant has stated that the
         possession of the suit premises bearing plot no. 507, Patparganj
         Industrial Area, Delhi-92 is not with him as much as the
         Plaintiff had removed locks of the Defendant and put his own
         lock. The learned counsel states that the Defendant has filed
         affidavit along with the keys vide Dy. No. 68787 dated
         30.04.2010, however, neither the affidavit nor the keys are on
         record. The learned counsel for the Defendant to take steps to
         ensure that the same be brought on record.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         2. The learned counsel for the Plaintiff has stated that although
         he has received an affidavit in this regard, however, the
         averments as well as the submissions made in this regard are
         not correct that the Plaintiff had put his own lock on the
         premises in question. It is further contended by the
         learned counsel for the Plaintiff that since one of the reliefs
         which has been claimed by the Plaintiff is possession of the
         suit premises and as the Defendant himself has admitted that he
         is not in possession of the premises in question, and therefore,
         there should be no impediment in appointing a Local
         Commissioner who will go to the spot and hand over the
         possession of the premises to the Plaintiff after breaking open
         the lock. The learned counsel for the Defendant has very fairly
         stated that he has no objection to this fact subject to the
         condition that the Local Commissioner shall prepare an
         inventory of the items lying at the suit premises.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">         3. In view of the submissions made by the learned counsel, I
         feel that the justice would be sub served in case the Local
         Commissioner is appointed who shall visit the premises
         bearing plot no. 507, Patparganj Industrial Area, Delhi-92 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 5 of 16</span>
         break open the locks and prepare an inventory of all the items
        which are found lying there. The said items shall be permitted
        to be taken by the defendant or his duly authorized
        representative. In the event of the defendant refusing to
        remove the machinery or the goods, the learned
        Local Commissioner shall be free to release the said goods on
        superdari on furnishing bond in such sum as he may deem fit
        to such person as he may deem fit. After preparing an
        inventory and taking the possession the Local Commissioner
        shall hand over the possession of the suit premises to the
        plaintiff or his duly authorized representative. The Local
        Commissioner shall be free to take assistance of the
        photographer, if felt necessary.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        4. Mr. Siddarth Vaid, Mob. No.9891351095 who is present in
        Court is appointed as the Local Commissioner to visit the suit
        premises bearing plot no. 507, Patparganj Industrial Area,
        Delhi-92 on Tuesday at 4.00 P.M. Since the learned counsel for
        the parties are present, the learned Local Commissioner is
        not required to give notice to either of the party. The fees of the
        learned Local Commissioner is fixed at Rs.25,000/- to be borne
        by the plaintiff. It shall be ultimately apportioned at the time of
        final disposal of the matter.

<p id="p_8">7. Pursuant to the above order, the Local Commissioner ('LC')
prepared a report and filed it in the Court on 21st October 2010. The
LC has, in his report, stated that since the Defendant had specifically
stated that the premises were not under his lock and key, the lock on
the main gate of the premises was physically broken and the locks of
the basement, first floor and second floor were also broken. Apart

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 6 of 16</span>
 from one CBZ Hero Honda Motorcycle and a water treatment plant,
certain other articles were also found and details thereof have been set
out in the report. Out of those items the Defendant claimed ownership
of two items, i.e., the water treatment plant and one of the old broken
iron gates. After obtaining possession of the premises, it was handed
over to the Plaintiff and a copy of the acknowledgement of receipt of
possession to the Plaintiff has been enclosed with the report of the
LC. The two items claimed by the Defendant had been removed by
him and rest of the other items had been given to the Plaintiff on
superdari basis. The Plaintiff was also given a motorcycle, CBZ Hero
Honda, on superdari basis. The Plaintiff has put his own lock on the
suit premises.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8. The stand taken in the written statement filed by the Defendant is
that the suit is not maintainable since the Plaintiff has failed to give
six months' notice of termination of tenancy to the Defendant. It is
next stated that the suit is premature since by an agreement dated 9th
April 2008 the premises in question was let out to the Defendant by
the Plaintiff for a period of three years beginning from 1st July 2007
and expires on 31st June 2010. Then it is alleged that the Plaintiff
filed never permitted the Defendant to run its business smoothly.
Several false and frivolous complaints were filed to the various
government departments and as a result of which the Defendant could
not run its business and was compelled to close down its business.
Consequently, the Defendant suffered huge losses. The Defendant
accordingly, has filed a counter claim to the suit on account of closure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 7 of 16</span>
 of its workshop, the employees were sitting idle and even the
Defendant had been paying their salaries till 31st October 2008 and in
this account the Defendant suffered loss of Rs. 5,96,335.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9. The case of the Defendant is that the Defendant had been
generating revenue of Rs. 13 lakhs per months from the workshop in
question. After complaints made by the Plaintiff, it could generate
only a sum of Rs. 6 lakh. It is stated that the Defendant has suffered
loss of Rs. 7 lakhs per month and it comes to Rs. 49 lakhs for the
period, i.e., 1st January 2009 to 31st July 2009. However, the
Defendant is restricting its claim to Rs. 25 lakhs. In para 19 of the
counter claim, the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff has to pay a
sum of Rs. 1,50,42,266 on account of damages due to inaction and
omissions on the part of the Plaintiff, together with interest @ 18%
per annum from the date of filing of the present counter claim till its
realization.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10. IA No. 11537 of 2009 has been filed by the Plaintiff under Order
VII Rule 11 CPC for rejection of the counter claim of the Defendant.
Notice was directed to issue in this application on 3rd November
2009. IA No. 11504 of 2009 has been filed by the Plaintiff under
Order XV-A (A) and Order XXXIX Rules 10 CPC seeking direction
to the Defendant to pay the admitted license fee/occupation charges
@ Rs. 1,50,000 per month and service tax thereon @ 10.3% per
month with effect from 1st September 2008 till the date of passing of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 8 of 16</span>
 the order on the application. Notice was directed to issue in this
application on 7th September 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11. As far as the prayer (a) of the Plaintiff for possession is
concerned, it no longer survives as was noted by the Court in its order
dated 4th April 2011. Admission/denial of the documents was done by
the parties on 24th November 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12. By an order dated 5th May 2012, an application, IA No. 21077 of
2011, filed by the Defendant seeking to place on record additional
documents including original reply dated 22nd November 2011 by the
DPCC under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, 2005 ('RTI') along with
copies of the applications dated 14th, 24th March 2008, 8th April 2008
and 9th June 2008 by the Plaintiff against the Defendant, was allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13. Thereafter, the Defendant filed an application, IA No. 5959 of
2013, under Order VI Rule 17 CPC seeking to amend the written
statement to incorporate the pleas on the basis of the action taken by
the DPCC and the averments on account of the consent made by the
DPCC it had shut down its unit although the plant and machinery
were still lying therein. Amendment is sought to be made to para 3 of
the written statement stating that the Defendant was compelled to
sign an agreement sometime in the last week of December 2007
under coercion; that it agreed to pay an exorbitant rent of Rs.
1,50,000 per month which was much higher than the market rate. It is
now sought to be averred that after the Defendant declined to an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 9 of 16</span>
 increase in the rent to Rs. 3,00,000 per month, the Plaintiff again
made various complaints to the DPCC against the Defendant. Para 3
of the written statement it is sought to be amended to state that the
papers were signed by the Defendant sometime in the last week of
October 2007 and that the Defendant requested the Plaintiff several
times to give to it a signed copy of the lease agreement so that the
same could be filed along with the application for grant of consent of
DPCC but the Plaintiff declined to do so. The amendment seeks to
add an averment in the written statement that the Plaintiff wrote to the
DPCC on 14th and 24th March 2008 enquiring as to what action they
had taken to stop the operation of the workshop of the Defendant. It is
sought to be now contended that in view of the threats, coercion and
harassment, the Defendant was compelled to pay a higher rent.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Ramesh Kumar,
learned counsel for the Plaintiff and Mr. Sanat Kumar, learned
counsel for the Defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15. The case originally pleaded by the Defendant in the written
statement that was filed on 25th July 2009 is very different from the
stand now taken in the amended written statement through the
application, IA No. 5959 of 2013, under Order VI Rule 17 CPC on 8th
April 2013. The case of the Plaintiff in IA No. 11537 of 2009 seeking
rejection of the counter claim is that the allegation that the Defendant
had to shut down its unit on account of the Plaintiff not giving NOC
for running workshop or service station in the premises is false. It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 10 of 16</span>
 stated that the agreement dated 9th April 2008 itself constitutes such
permission and that the said document has been admitted by the
Defendant. It is further stated that the Defendant has not produced a
single document in support of the allegations made in the counter
claim in this regard. Even the order dated 20th June 2008 of the DPCC
refusing consent to the Defendant does not state so.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16. The documents placed on record show that a lease deed was
entered into between the Plaintiff and the Defendant way back on 2nd
July 2001. This was for a period of three years and was only for
industrial purpose. At this stage no complaint was made by the
Defendant about the Plaintiff not giving it an NOC. The
Environmental Engineering Group ('EEG') gave an adequacy report
on the "Effluent Treatment Plant for M/s. Auto Needs (I) Pvt. Ltd." in
January 2006 itself. On 9th January 2008 the Defendant applied to the
DPCC for consent under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)
Act</a> 1974 ['<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>'] and under Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1971 ['<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>']. The Plaintiff was shown as the
owner of the premises. Enclosed with the application was the
affidavit of the Defendant and details in Form 1. There was nothing
stated by the Defendant about the Plaintiff not giving an NOC.
Pursuant to the application filed by the Defendant for consent to
operate, an inspection of the premises took place by the DPCC on 2nd
April 2008. Thereafter a fresh lease agreement was signed by the
parties on 9th April 2008. The lease agreement was registered. This
belies the case of the Defendant that the Plaintiff made it difficult for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 11 of 16</span>
 the Defendant to operate from the premises. No letter appears to have
been written by the Defendant to the Plaintiff about any such alleged
inconvenience caused to it.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17. Para 15 of the leave and licence agreement dated 9th April 2008
states that "if any Government Authorities prohibit the Licensee to
carry on its operation on any ground whatsoever the Licensor shall
have the option to terminate to the agreement of leave and licence by
giving notice state above." The Defendant's attempt to now contend
by way of the application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC that the said
leave and licence agreement was signed due to coercion and pressure
brought about by the Plaintiff is an afterthought and is without any
basis in any contemporaneous correspondence or document. Such a
plea which goes to the root of the matter cannot be sought to be
introduced for the first time through an amendment nearly three years
after the written statement was originally filed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">18. On 17th April 2008 the DPCC issued directions to the Defendant
under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_6">Section 31</a> (A) of the Air Act pointing out that when the unit
was inspected on 2nd April 2008 it was found that the Defendant had
not installed adequate stack height and acoustic enclosure with DG
set of 7.5 KVA; it had been operating its unit since 2001-2002
without obtaining consent to establish/operate and that it had applied
for consent to establish only on 10th March 2008. Accordingly, the
DPCC directed the Defendant to stop the operation of its unit with
immediate effect. Corresponding directions were issued to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 12 of 16</span>
 electricity distribution company to disconnect the power supply, to
the Delhi Jal Board to disconnect the water supply and the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi to cancel the licence. Similar directions were
issued by the DPCC on the same date under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_7">Section 33</a> (A) of the
Water Act. In its order it was stated that during the inspection it was
observed that the Defendant had installed an effluent treatment plant
(ETP) but was the ETP was found non-operational. No dry or wet
sludge was seen in the Sludge Drying Beds. Directions were also
issued by the DPCC on the same date under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. In this order, a reference was
made to a public complaint having been received and to the fact that
during inspection it was found that no steps had been taken for
storage, handling and disposal of hazardous waste under Hazardous
Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989 [HWM Rules']. It
was stated that the unit has been operating without obtaining
authorization under the HWM Rules, 1989. Therefore, the reasons for
the DPCC shutting down the unit operated by the Defendant from the
premises did not have anything to do with the Plaintiff not giving an
NOC to the Defendant. The very basis of the counter claim is
therefore, non-existent.
</p>
<p id="p_20">19. It may be noticed at this stage that the Defendant filed W.P.
(Civil) No. 3717 of 2008 in this Court seeking quashing of the
aforementioned orders of the DPCC. There is no whisper in the entire
writ petition about the Plaintiff not giving an NOC and that leading to
the passing of the aforementioned orders. On the other hand an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">IA Nos. 11504 of 2009 &amp; 5959 of 2013 in CS(OS) No.939 of 2009   Page 13 of 16</span>
 undertaking was given to this Court by the Defendant on 14th May
2008 that it would not run the industrial unit and maintain status quo
till such time its applications were not considered by the DPCC.
Subject to this it was directed that the DPCC would not take any
further coercive action against the Defendant till its applications were
disposed of. Later on 12th January 2009 in a contempt petition filed
by the DPCC, the Defendant informed the Court that it had already
written a letter to the DPCC undertaking to close its activities. The
Defendant stated before the Court that the alleged breach, if any, of
the order dated 14th May 2008 was "neither intentional nor
deliberate". The Defendant offered to voluntarily pay a sum of Rs.
5,000 to the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20. In light of the above facts, it appears that the case now sought to
be pleaded by the Defendant through its counter claim and the
proposed amendments to the written statement is at variance with the
record of what has transpired thus far. The amendment as prayed for
or entertaining the counter claim of the Defendant cannot therefore be
permitted.
</p>
<p id="p_22">21. Accordingly IA No. 11537 of 2009 filed by the Plaintiff under
Order VII Rule 11 CPC is allowed and the counter claim of the
Defendant is rejected. IA No. 5959 of 2013 filed by the Defendant

<p id="p_23"> IA No. 11504 of 2009
</p><p id="p_24">22. Turning to IA No. 11504 of 2009 which is an application by the
Plaintiff under Order XV-A and Order XXXIX Rule 10 CPC, it is
seen that on 15th April 2013 the following order was passed therein
by the Court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">        "IA No. 11504 of 2009
        This is an application filed by the Plaintiff under Order
        XV-A (A) and Order XXXIX Rule 10 CPC.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">        As far as the rate of licence fee/rent is concerned, there is
        no dispute that with effect from 1st July 2007 licence
        fee/rent was Rs. 1,50,000 per month.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        The Plaintiff in this suit for possession now claims that
        the Defendant has vacated the suit premises in July 2010
        while Defendant is claiming that the Plaintiff had
        forcibly taken over the possession of the suit premises in
        September 2009.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">        In my view, without going into these allegations and
        counter allegations at this stage, it would be appropriate
        if the Defendant is directed to deposit in Court the
        license fee/rent calculated @ Rs. 1,50,000 per month
        from 1st September 2008 till September 2009 which
        deposit, of course, would be without prejudice to the
        Defendant's contentions made in the existing written
        statement as well as in the amendment application (being
        IA No. 5959 of 2013) that it is not liable to make any
        payment in view of its counter claim against the
        Plaintiff.

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">         Let the Defendant make the deposit in Court in the name
        of the Registrar General within four weeks. Upon that
        deposit being made the same shall be kept in a fixed
        deposit in a bank initially for a period of six months.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">        After this deposit is made the present application shall be
        taken up for further hearing to decide whether Plaintiff is
        entitled to disbursement of the deposited amount or not.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        Renotify on 4th July 2013."

<p id="p_25">23. It appears that the said amount is yet to be deposited by the
Defendant. The Defendant is directed, as a last opportunity, to
comply with the above order within two weeks from today. The
further hearing of this application will be taken up thereafter.
