Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. against the order of Permanent Lok

Adalat, whereby complaint of the residents of Kanwar Avenue Amritsar

who on purchase have become owner of the property bearing different plot

numbers in Kanwar Avenue Amritsar situated in Colony duly approved by

the Municipal Corporation Authorities under TP Scheme No.83 Notification

dated 12.04.2001, has been allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Grievance of the complainant before the Lok Adalat was that

they had applied for release of temporary electric connection which was

duly released by Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. bearing different

account numbers. One of the account number is Temp/8913 and

consumption charges have already been paid without committing any

default. Thereafter an application for installation of the permanent electric

connection along with Form-AA and copy of sale deed and other documents

required was submitted but the same was not released on the premise that

colonizer of the colony had not got approved the layout of the LD system

from Chief Electrical Inspector. The case of the complainant was that LD

system and transfer had already been installed by the colonizer in the

</p><p id="p_7">Kanwar Avenue Colony and the many residents of the colony have been

released the connection. This fact in written reply before Lok Adalat was

not denied. However, during the pendency of the writ petition, Ms. Promila

Nain, has drawn the attention of this Court to Annexure P-9 attached with

replication in CWP No.8533 of 2016, regarding issuance of notice of the

disconnection of the electricity to other residents owing to the observations

rendered by the Lok Adalat. She further submits that Punjab Pollution

Control Board, Amritsar vide notice dated 24.03.2015 had issued a direction

to the Chief Engineer (Border Range), Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd.,

Amritsar under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 on the premise that it had been decided to close the

project due to the violation done by the builders. It is in this aspect of the

matter, permanent connection cannot be granted. Reference has also been

made to Annexure P-7 i.e. letter dated 07.09.2015 written by an office of

Engineer in Chief/Commercial, PSPCL, Patiala to Sub Divisional Officer,

Commercial, Mall Mandi, Amritsar on the subject of NOC by PSPCL to

Shree Balaji City Developers Private Limited of Kanwar Avenue residential

colony on the premise that there was deficiency with regard to the certain

documents. All these factors have not been taken into consideration by the

Permanent Lok Adalat.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            She further submits that during the pendency of the writ

petition, builder has already complied with certain requirements as noticed

in Annexure P-7 and regard other contemplating to do so very soon and

resultantly permanent connection would be released. On completion of the

order of Lok Adalat in its letter and spirit would be complied with.

</p><p id="p_10">            Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents submits

that Electricity Board had woken up by issuing notices to certain residents

of the colony only on account of the observations rendered by the Lok

Adalat. Even if the requirement was not done by the Builder, a person

cannot be deprived of essential services i.e. electricity as consumption

charges have been paid by the consumer and not by the builder. LD System

had already been installed and there is no default in that and has drawn the

attention of this Court to para Nos.3, 4 and 5 of the reply filed by builder,

which reads as under:-

<p id="p_13">              The affidavit filed on behalf of builder attaching the approved

layout (Annexure R-1) and licence and permission/detailed load sheet

(Annexure R-2) has not been rebutted by any of the resolution. Even

specific averments of approval of LD system on 06.08.2016 which is almost

year after the letter (Annexure P-7) has also not been denied perhaps on the

premise that builder has already submitted the requisite documents and

contemplating to the deposit of the dues, if any, of the Electricity Board.

</p><p id="p_15">having brought to the notice of Lok Adalat and accepted by the official of

PSPCL, the Electricity Board has woken up and taken the action in this

regard. Such type of action on behalf of PSPCL is highly deprecable and not

appreciated. There is no denial to the issuance of the temporary connection

and consumption charges. Replication has been filed only to deny the

written statement filed on behalf of the applicant but not to that of the

builder. Non-compliance of the requirement/terms and conditions of the

Punjab Water Pollution Control Board cannot be an impediment for the

residents for not using the benefit of the essential service i.e. electricity. It

appears that PSPCL has been adopting pick and choose policy in denying

the issuance of connection to certain applicants who were constrained to

knock the door of Lok Adalat vis-a-vis others an action now have been

initiated in order to come on a platform of parity. Be that as it may, once

Ms. Promila Nain, Advocate on instruction from Bal Krishan, Addl. SCO

suffered statement that the builder has already submitted requisite

documents and is contemplating to deposit the dues, though no objection

had been taken in the written statement before the Lok Adalat regarding

pendency of the dues except non-confirming to the sketch plan of LD

system, yet had an audacity to raise objection of no dues.

</p><p id="p_16">             It is strange that the plea of no dues even had not been taken up

in the written statement but it has come for the first time from the mouth of

Addl. SCO who is present in the Court. The officers at the helm of the

affairs are required to be coherent and consistent in their stand but not to

adopt a inconsistent stand. Precisely, this was noticed by the Lok Adalat
