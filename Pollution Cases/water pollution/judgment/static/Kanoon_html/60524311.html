</pre>
<p id="p_1">    1            This Application has been registered upon transfer of

    the Writ Petition No.3461 of 2002 by the Hon'ble High Court of

    Judicature of Bombay, Bench at Aurangabad vide its order

    dated 1st October 2013. The Application has been mainly filed

    to challenge the Government of Maharashtra Resolution dated

    20th April 2000, stipulating authorization fees under the Bio

    Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 1998,

    notified under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment (Protection) Act</a> 1986, to be

    paid by the Health Care Institutions.

     the Bombay Public Trust Act 1950.                  The Applicant No.2 is a

    practicing Medical Professional.               The brief contentions of the

    Application are as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">                 Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of

    India (Respondent No.1) have enacted <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection)

    Act</a> 1986 with an objective to provide "an enactment of a

    general legislation on environment protection which inter-alia;

    should enable co-ordination of activities of the various

    regulatory agencies, creation of an authority or authorities with

    adequate powers for environmental protection, regulation of

    discharge           of       environmental   pollutants   and   handling   of

    hazardous substances, speedy response in the event of

    accidents threatening environment and deterrent punishment

    to those who endanger human environment, safety and health".

    3            The Central Government has notified the Bio Medical

    Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 1998 (hereinafter

    referred as "BMW Rules") for Environment sound management

    and handling of the Bio Medical Waste in the country. The said

    Rules provide for effective segregation, collection, transport,

    treatment and disposal of the Bio Medical Waste in a scientific

    manner.            The Rules have been made applicable to all the

    institutions and individuals who generate the various types of

    Bio Medical Waste as defined in the said Rules. These Rules

    further require the occupier, as defined in the Rules, to make

    application in the prescribed form to the Prescribed Authority


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(J) Application No.8(THC)/2013                                                 3</span>
     for obtaining the necessary authorization under the provisions

    of these Rules.               As per Rule 7 of the BWM   Rules 1998, as

    amended, the State Pollution Control Board have been notified

    as the Prescribed Authority for the enforcement of the

    provisions of these Rules. Under Rule 8 of the BMW Rules, as

    per Sub-clause (3), every application in form (1) for grant of

    authorization shall be accompanied by fees as may be

    prescribed by the Government of State or Union Territory.

    State Government of Maharashtra has issued the impugned

    Notification dated 20th April 2000 under these provisions of the

    Rules which is under challenge in the present application.


    4               The Applicants submit that the reference of the Levy

    of Fees in Clause (3) of Rule 8 of BMW Rules is outside the

    power, jurisdiction and authority of the Respondents.                 The

    Applicants further state that the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>

    1986 and the provisions there under do not authorize the

    Respondents to levy the fees and therefore, the Applicants

    further state that purported empowerment under Rule 8(3) of

    the BMW Rules to prescribe fees is ultra virus the Statute and

    Rule making powers of the Respondents.                   The Applicants

    submit          that         Environment   Department,   Government    of

    Maharashtra had earlier stipulated the Fees under Rule 8(3) of

    the BMW Rules vide the Government Resolution dated 9th

    March 1999 which have been subsequently revised vide the

    impugned Government Resolution.                  The Applicants further


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">(J) Application No.8(THC)/2013                                             4</span>
     claim that they have made representation to the State

    Government clearly mentioning that there is abnormal increase

    in the fees for smaller hospitals and the fees are reduced for the

    larger hospitals. The Applicants further submit that there is no

    special         benefit,       service       or   privilege    to    the    Medical

    practitioners/professionals wanting the increase in the fees and

    rendition of services and there is no rational under-laying in

    charging of high fees for BMW authorization. The Applicants

    further submit that the Applicants are under compulsion to

    pay fees at increased rates purportedly under statutory powers

    and without consent of the payer.                      The Applicants further

    submit that there is no nexus in increasing and charging of the

    fees for authorization and the service rendered.


    5            The Applicants also submit that the Bio Medical Waste

    cannot be termed as hazardous substance as contemplated and

    envisaged in <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a> 1986 and Bio

    Medical Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules and the

    Applicants therefore, pray for following prayers among others :-

    Tribunal had directed Maharashtra Pollution Control Board

    (MPCB) to serve the notices to the Applicants and accordingly

    they were served. The Applicant failed to appear but a letter

    from Secretary of Indian Medical Association, Aurangabad,

    dated 4-12-2013 addressed to the Tribunal was placed on

    record, and the contents of the letter are reproduced below:

        Environment at that time. Most of our members have already

</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">7                Still, however, the Tribunal wanted to examine the

issues raised in this Application and requested the Counsel for

MoEF to advise on the issue. Mr. Ratnaparkhi, Counsel for MoEF

explained that the BMW Rules have been framed in exercise of the

powers conferred by <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_11">Section 3</a>, <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_12">6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_13">25</a> of Environment

(Protection) Act 1986. He further mentions that <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> of the

Environment Protection Act is very broad and Rule 3(1) is

reproduced below :-
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">        "Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Central
        Government shall have the powers to take all such
        measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the
        purpose of protecting and improving the quality of
        Environment and preventing, controlling and abating
        Environmental Pollution."

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">    The sub-Rule (2) lists out various measures without prejudice
    to the generating of the provisions of Sub-section (1) referred
    above".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">    8            He further explained that Rule 6 empowers the Central

    Government to make Rules in respect of all or any of the

    matters referred to in <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_15">Section 3</a>.        Further <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_16">Section 25</a> also

    authorize the Central Government to make Rules for carrying

    out the purpose of this Act which includes setting the standard,

    the procedure, the authorities etc.      He, further explains that

    these powers defined under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_17">sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_18">6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_19">25</a> clearly enable

     and authorise the Central Government to stipulate the

    provision          of        fees   under    the   Rules   notified   under   the

    <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_20">Environment (Protection) Act</a>. He further submits that, in any

    case, for effective implementation of the Rules, the Enforcement

    Authority will definitely require resources which need to be

    raised using the principle of Polluter Pay's and he, therefore,

    submits that there is no illegality in the provision stipulating

    fees of authorization under the Bio Medical Waste Rules 1998.


    9            The MPCB has also filed an Affidavit and elaborately

    explained the role of MPCB in implementation of BMW Rules.

    It is submitted by MPCB that the Respondent/Board is

    supposed to cause visits, inspections and sampling in order to

    ensure the compliances of the various stages of BMW

    (Management &amp; Handling) Rules i.e. segregation, collection,

    transportation, treatment and disposal. The Respondent Board

    needs to make necessary inquiries while processing the

    authorization                 applications     and    carry    out     necessary

    administrative work for effective enforcement and compliance of

    the BMW Rules. The MPCB further submits that the fees are

    charged as per the provisions of Rule 8(3) of BMW Rules as

    notified by the State Government. MPCB further submits that

    though the revised fee structure was notified on 20th April

    2000, the State Government through Environment Department,

    Government of Maharashtra has reviewed this fees structure

    considering the various representation received in this regard

     and revised fees structure has been notified vide Government

    Resolution dated 10th April 2003 which is placed on record.

    The MPCB further submits that the State Government has

    considered various representations and the present fees

    structure vide Govt. Resolution dated 10th April 2003 is based

    on number of beds.            MPCB therefore, that the present

    application may be dismissed as infructuous as the contentions

    of the Applicants have already been considered by the State

    resulting into revised fees structure as notified vide G.R. dated

    10th April 2003.

    10           On perusal of the records and also submissions made

    by MoEF and MPCB and also, the communication from the

    Applicants' organization that the issue is now settled, the

    Tribunal is required to see whether, in fact Law allows the

    authority to charge the authorization fees and also contention

    raised that the Bio Medical Waste is not a hazardous waste will

    have to be considered.

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">
    11           The Tribunal is aware that the Tribunal is not having

    powers similar to the powers of the High Courts, conferred by

    the Constitution under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a>, to issue mandamus writ to

    declare certain Notification as ultra virus.


    12           Still, however, we would like to note a judgment of

    Hon'ble Karnataka High Court regarding charging of fees in

    "Fr.Muller's Hospital, Rep. by Vrs. The Member Secretary And

    Others, AIR 2004 Kant 342" wherein it is held that:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                  "18. <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_22">Article 265</a> of the Constitution mandates that no
                 tax should be levied or collected without the authority
                 of law. Such mandate is equally or a fortiori applied
                 to delegated legislation. The letter of the law should
                 be strictly adhered to when such levy is by the
                 delegated authority. It has been well recognized that
                 taxing power can be exercised only by the Legislature.
                 The levy of fee is part of taxing power though on a
                 lesser scale. If the constitutional mandate even for
                 levy of taxes is that it cannot be without the authority
                 of law the scrutiny in respect of justification of fee by
                 the prescribed authority can only for stricter and not to
                 the contrary. There cannot be any levy either by
                 implication or intent. The levy should be specific,
                 permitted and authorized in law. If these principles
                 are applied the provisions of Sub-rule 3 of Rule 8
                 cannot withstand the scrutiny of any of the tests
                 evolved in the context of levy of fee by a delegated
                 authority. There is no express provision in the Act
                 enabling the Central Government to frame Rules
                 providing for levy of fee as is levied as per letter dated
                 26th July 1999 issued by the State Government based
                 on the notification dated 20th July, 1998, Annexure C
                 issued by the Central Government. The provisions of
                 Sub-rule 3 of Rule 8 are clearly ultra-virus the Act and
                 as such cannot be sustained.
