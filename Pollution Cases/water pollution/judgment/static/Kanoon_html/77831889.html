<p id="p_1">1.          The instant petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

prays for declaring notification dated 05.08.2011 issued by Haryana

State Pollution Control Board-respondent No.2 (for brevity 'Board'),

which is based on impugned letter dated 16.05.2011 (P-14) as ultra

vires of the Constitution. The grievance made by the petitioner is

that the category of Computer Operator, which was earlier eligible

for     consideration   for   promotion   to    the   post    of   Deputy

Superintendent has been deleted blocking the avenues of promotion

for them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          Brief facts of this case which has led to filing of the

instant petition are that the petitioner was promoted as Computer

Operator on 23.03.1997 in the Board. He has been assigned duties
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP No. 14803 of 2011                                             -2-</span>

with the Member Secretary of Board-respondent vide order dated

22.02.2008 and also he worked as PA to President, Appellate

Authority of the Board-respondent in addition to his own duties. On

15.03.2004 (P-7), the Board decided to create new posts which were

duly sanctioned by respondent No.1. It is clarified in the Annexure-B

appended to the sanction letter that the cadre of Deputy

Superintendent would be considered as the diminishing cadre. The

new Regulations known as Haryana State Pollution Control Board

(Group A, B, C and D) Service Regulations, 2004 (for brevity 'the

2004 Regulations') were enforced on 05.10.2004 (P-8). According to

the 2004 Regulations, for promotion to the post of Superintendent,

the feeder cadre of Deputy Superintendent with two years' service in

the Board has been made eligible. The feeder cadre for promotion

to the post of Deputy Superintendent was Assistants/ Accountant/

Computer Operators (provided Computer Operators have undertaken

1/3rd ministerial work) with seven years' service in the Board.

</p><p id="p_3">3.         On 02.05.2006, the Board decided to amend the Service

Regulations by providing promotional avenues for Assistants/

Accountants/ Computer Operators (subject to the condition that the

Computer Operators have undertaken 1/3rd ministerial work) with

nine years' experience for promotion to the post of Superintendent.

This was required to be done on account of the fact that the cadre of

Deputy Superintendent has been diminishing cadre and had almost

vanished. The Board forwarded these recommendations for approval

of the State of Haryana on 02.05.2006 (P-9). On account of the fact
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No. 14803 of 2011                                           -3-</span>

that the proposal sent by the Board was not being considered by the

State Government, CWP No. 20254 of 2010 was filed, which was

disposed of on 15.11.2010 with a direction to take decision on the

proposal sent on 02.05.2006 (P-12).       On 16.05.2011 (P-14), the

State of Haryana accorded partial approval to the proposal sent by

the Board.     The category of Computer Operator was deleted from

the feeder cadre for promotion to the post of Superintendent. The

petitioner along with another Computer Operator represented the

respondent-State for providing promotional avenues to the Computer

Operator like the petitioner to the post of Superintendent.        The

respondent-State     sought   recommendation      from    the   Board-

respondent, which again recommended vide letter dated 30.05.2011

(P-17) that the Computer Operator should be clubbed with the cadre

of Assistant/ Accountant for promotion to the post of Superintendent.

Eventually the amendment in the 2004 Regulations was published in

the gazette on 05.08.2011 (P-19), which excluded the cadre of

Computer Operator.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.           We have heard Mr. Sapan Dhir, learned counsel for the

petitioner at some length. Learned counsel has argued that once the

category of Computer Operator was a feeder cadre for promotion to

the post of Deputy Superintendent then it is unjustified and unfair for

respondent No.1 to exclude this category for promotion to the post

of Superintendent.    According to learned counsel, if experience of

seven years can be increased to nine years for cadre of Assistant/

Accountant from 7 years to 9 years then for a computer operator
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CWP No. 14803 of 2011                                         -4-</span>

also similar conditions could be imposed.      Learned counsel has

emphasised that the avenues of promotion cannot be blocked

completely for computer operator.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.         Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner, we are of

the considered view that the action of the respondent does not suffer

from any legal infirmity warranting interference of this Court. It is

the case of the petitioner that he had earlier worked as Steno Typist

from March 1993 to 16.08.1996 when his services were regularized.

He Joined the Board on his transfer on 16.08.1996 (P-1, P-2 &amp; P-3).

He was promoted on 26.03.1997 as Computer Operator and has

been working as such.     It is true that a Computer Operator who

have undertaken 1/3rd ministerial work with seven years' experience

used to be eligible for promotion to the post of Deputy

Superintendent.      The cadre of Deputy Superintendent was

diminishing cadre and eventually Regulations 7 and 9 read with

appendix B were amended.        The Board in its recommendation

suggested to include the post of Computer Operator with nine years'

experience for promotion to the post of Superintendent. However,

those recommendations were not accepted by the respondent-State

and the post of Computer Operator has been deleted as a feeder

cadre.   One of the reasons, which is apparent from the 2004

Regulations is that there are two posts of Computer Operator and

the same are also declared to be the diminishing cadre, as is evident

from appendix A, Item No. 22. Moreover, the amendments need

the approval of the State Government under Sub Sections (3) and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No. 14803 of 2011                                          -5-</span>

(3-A) of <a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_2">Section 12</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974.     Accordingly, we find no element of arbitrariness in

deleting the cadre of the Computer Operator as feeder cadre for

promotion to the post of Superintendent.     There is no element of

arbitrariness which may lead to an inference that the Articles 14 and

16(1) of the Constitution have been violated.     The petitioner has

already earned promotion from Steno typist.       If the petitioner is

stagnated in the cadre of computer operator then he is apparently

entitled to Assured Career Progression Scheme (for brevity 'ACP

Scheme'), which would ensure that he gets step up in his pay. In

the wake of the aforesaid ACP Scheme available to the petitioner,

the ratio of the judgment rendered in <a href="/doc/484064/" id="a_4">O.Z. Hussain v. Union of

India ALR</a> 1990 SC 310 and <a href="/doc/272468/" id="a_5">Council of Scientific and

Industrial, Research and another v. K.G.S. Bhatt</a> (1989) 4

SCC 635, would not be applicable to the facts of the present case.

The writ petition is wholly without merit and does not warrant

admission.

dismissed.
