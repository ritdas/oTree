      THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner is a medical scale industry located at

Sy.No.83A and 79 of Belgal village, Bellary taluk and

district in an area measuring 11 acres, which forms part of

3599 hectares of land declared by the Government of

Karnataka as Industrial land.    The petitioner established

his industry since 01/12/2010 and he has obtained

necessary permission from the concerned department.

The petitioner made an application for certificate from the

Pollution Control Board under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a> of the Water Act

and he has got deemed permission under sub section 7 of

Section 25 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a> 1974.       Despite the same,

second respondent-Pollution Control Board passed an order

which was challenged before the Appellate Authority in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>




appeal No.16-17/2012.          The same was disposed of

31/01/2013 and remanded to the second respondent for

reconsideration. The said order was subject matter in Writ

petition No.8106/2013       and 8272-74/2013           which was

disposed of on 23/07/2013 wherein permission sought by

the petitioner to make an application for clearance from

the Pollution Control Board was accepted and respondent

was directed to dispose of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.      In view of the directions issued by this Court

in the above referred writ petition, though an application

was made under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Section 25</a> of the Act and necessary

documents     were   produced,        the    respondent   has   not

disposed of the same till today.            In the meanwhile first

respondent Gulburga Electricity Supply Company by its

instruction dated 10.09.2013 has disconnected power

supply given to the petitioner on 08.09.2013 at 5.00 p.m.

and the same was communicated to the petitioner on 10th

September 2013.           Being aggrieved by the            same,

petitioner has filed this petition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     4</span><p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.     The      action   of       the    first   respondent   in

disconnecting power supply to the petitioner industry and

the action of the second respondent in directing the first

respondent to disconnect power supply is subject matter in

this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4.     The ground urged by the petitioner is that

since 2010 he has started carrying on business in the

factory and he had made an application within the

stipulated time i.e. before commencement of the factory

and since it was not disposed of within the time stipulated,

he has got deemed permission under sub section (7) of

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> of the Water Act.                  He has challenged the

direction issued by the second respondent to the first

respondent dated 10/09/2013 as ultra vires.                It is under

Rule 34 sub clause 4 member Secretary to the Board has

power to issue such direction contrary to the same

Annexure "J" is issued by the Assistant Executive who is

not a member Secretary or any person appointed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>




Board in that behalf.     Secondly, direction issued by the

second respondent to the first respondent               also   not

applicable to the occupier of the nature i.e. the petitioner

herein. Learned counsel refers to the judgment reported

in 2006 SC 2038. The said judgment is referred in order

to substantiate his submission that clearance from the

Pollution Control Board or various department is dispensed

since the land was allotted for industrial purpose by the

KSIIDC     -Annexure     B.   Notification     issued    by    the

Government of Karnataka dated 01/12/2010 for acquiring

land for industrial establishment in which the petitioner

commissioned his industry.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      5.    Learned     counsel    for   the   first   respondent

GESCOM submitted that it is not required to issue notice to

the occupier since such opportunities were given by the

second respondent. Any direction issued by the concerned

authority under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a> 1974, first respondent has

to comply with the same as per <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_6">Section 33</a> A of the Water

Act, which is mandatory one, and the first respondent is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>




bound by such direction.         The counsel for the second

respondent submitted to dismiss this petition as the

mandatory requirement under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_7">Section 25</a> of the Water Act

has not been complied.       Prior permission      has to be

obtained before establishing any industry. Applications

made by the petitioner for clearance have been dismissed

on earlier occasions. One such refusal has been produced

and marked as Annexure "R2" dated 31/12/2008, "R7"

dated 09/10/2012 and "R8" dated 13/09/2013.               This

refusal order initially has not been challenged.           The

direction   issued   by   this     Court   in   Writ   Petition

No.8106/2013 and other connected matters vide Annexure

"G"   has not been complied since required materials are

not produced by the petitioner.      Second respondent had

addressed several complaints by the public and that the

pollution emitted by the petitioner-industry is causing

health hazards and agricultural lands have become barren.

Hence, it has directed first respondent to disconnect the

power supply.    Second respondent has also passed an

order dated 02/07/2012 for closure as per Annexure "R-6".
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                7</span>




It is further submitted that it is not only the petitioner

industry has been closed down but other 5 industries have

also been closed down for want of clearance from the

Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      6.    Learned    Government        Pleader   adopted       the

submission made by respondents 1 and 2.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      7.    It is undisputed fact that the land on which the

petitioner is carrying out business is allotted by the

Government for industrial purposes.           The purpose of

allotment is for establishing industries.          Any industry

before establishing or commencing its business, has to

take prior permission under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">Section 25</a> of the Water Act

1974 which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "25.   Restrictions on new outlets and new
    discharges:     subject to the provisions of this
    section, no person shall, without the previous
    consent on the State Board-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (a)    establish   or   take    any     steps    to
                  establish any industry, operation or
                  process,    or   any     treatment       and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              8</span>




                disposal system or any extension or
                addition thereto, which is likely to
                discharge sewage or trade effluent
                into a stream or well or sewer or on
                land (such discharge being hereafter
                in this section referred to as discharge
                of sewage)
and an application for consent of State Board under
sub-section(1) shall be made in such form, contain
such particulars and shall be accompanied by such
fees as may be prescribed.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">Sub Section (7) of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_9">Section 25</a> states that the consent
referred to in sub-section(1) shall, unless, given or
refused earlier, be deemed to have been given
unconditionally on the expiry of a period of four
months of the making of an application in this behalf
complete in all respects to the State Board."


</p><p id="p_15">      8.    In the instant case, application made by the

petitioner for permission under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_10">Section 25</a> of the Act was

not disposed of within the time stipulated.      Hence, the

petitioner is said to have the benefit of deemed provision.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   9</span>
</p><p id="p_16">      9.     The said submission has been examined in the

light of the communications made as referred in Annexures

R2, R7 and R9.     By these endorsement the case of the

petitioner   for   grant     of       permission   was   refused.

Notwithstanding    the     same,      when   closure   order   was

passed, the same was challenged before the Karnataka

State Appellate Authority, Bangalore, constituted under the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a> 1981. Writ Appeal NO.18 and connected appeal

no.19/2011 was disposed of on 9th November 2011 in

which, order passed by the second respondent was               set

aside and remanded for fresh consideration.               Second

respondent has not placed any reliance as to the order

passed pursuant to the remand order dated 09/11/2011.

Hence, it is taken for recording purpose that the second

respondent has not disposed of the matter after the

appeals are remanded on 09/11/2011.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      10.    The case of the first respondent is that he is

duty bound to comply with the directions issued by the

second respondent is being examined.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              10</span><p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">     11.    <a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_12">Section 33</a> A of the Act reads as follows:

</p><p id="p_21">           33A.    Power     to      give    directions:-
</p><p id="p_22">    Notwithstanding anything contained in any other
    law, but subject to the provisions of this Act, and
    to any directions that the Central Government
    may give in this behalf, a Board may, in the
    exercise of its powers and performance of this
    functions under this Act,     issue any directions in
    writing to any person, officer or authority and
    such person, officer or authority shall be bound to
    comply with such directions.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

As per <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_13">Section 33A</a> it is the Board who is the competent

authority to issue directions to any persons or authority

and such directions issued by the competent authority is

binding on all other authorities.     Rule 34 of the Water

Rules 1975 further mandates that the proposed directions

issued by the board either for stoppage or regulation of

electricity or water or any other services affecting the

carrying of any industry, operation or process and is

sought to be issued to an officer or an authority, a copy of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                11</span>




the proposed direction shall also be endorsed to the

occupier of the industry, operation or process, as the case

may be, and objections, if any, filed by the occupier with

an officer designated in this behalf shall be dealt with in

accordance with the procedures under sub-rules(3) and (5)

of this rule.    From this it is clear that direction can be

issued either by the Board or by the Member Secretary of

the Board or any person authorised by the Board.


</p><p id="p_24">      12.   Now it is relevant to examine whether the

impugned direction issued by the first respondent is by the

Environment Officer of the Board at Bellary.


</p><p id="p_25">      13.       In the communication dated 06/09/2013, it is

not referred whether the same has been authorised by the

Board or whether he is the competent authority or whether

he is a Member Secretary. Unless the persons who issue

directions to the first respondent is competent, such

direction is ultra vires under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_14">Section 33A</a> and sub-rule(4)

of Rule 34 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water Act</a> and Rules.         The direction

issued to the first respondent is not by the competent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                12</span>




authority.    In this regard, submission of the second

respondent that what has been forwarded to the first

respondent is only the communication of the decision

taken by the Board and the Member Secretary who are

competent. In this regard it is relevant to mention that

when a statute directs a statutory authority to function in a

particular manner he should carry out the same in the

manner prescribed under the Act.     <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">The Act</a> says it is the

Member Secretary or an authorised person by the Board

shall issue direction to the first respondent then he alone

can act in accordance with the said provisions. He cannot

delegate such power to environment authority since he has

no power of delegation. Further the environment officer is

not a competent authority to issue direction to the first

respondent.    The learned counsel for the appellant relies

on sub para 2 of para 97 of the judgment in the case of

Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board          Vs. C.

Kenchappa and Ors. reported AIR 2006 SC 2308 97

para(2) which is as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  13</span><p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">      "(2) We also direct the appellant to incorporate
   the condition of allotment to obtain clearance from
   the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board before
   the land is allotted for development.          The said
   directory    condition   of   allotment   of   lands   be
   converted into a mandatory condition for all the
   projects to be sanctioned in future."
</p>
<p id="p_28">

This Court in (1987) 7 Kar. Law Journal 410 held that " as

a matter of fact no industry shall be commenced unless

the unit secures clearance from the agency under the

relevant provisions of the law as aforementioned".             The

legal provisions thus take care of the possible situation in

which the industry, unit established in any one of those

industrial area may be found to be violating the law, the

units can even be permitted to be closed if they do not

comply with the statutory requirement relating to control

and elimination of pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">      14.      Industries are very much important for the

growth of a nation.     Industries provide employment and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                14</span>




improve the standard of living and as well as social and

economic condition. They are the backbone of the nation

and at the same time, health of a man is of paramount

importance. Industries shall not be permitted to carry on

at the cost of human existence.        Closure of industries

creates       epidemic   in   the    society   and    creates

unemployment. Closure of an industry is not a solution, in

effect, it is the Pollution Control Board to get the industry

established and take measures to reduce pollution which

shall not mar the human growth.        In view of the above,

case on hand is required to be decided.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">        15.    The application filed by the petitioner as per

the direction of this court is still pending consideration. If

the materials furnished by the petitioner are not sufficient,

the Board has to call for required documents from the

petitioner.     Unless such directions are issued to the

petitioner, it is not proper for the Board to dismiss the

case.     In the circumstance, the action of the first

respondent in disconnecting power on the basis of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                             15</span>




direction/communication    issued    by    the   incompetent

authority is illegal and ultra vires.     Hence, I pass the

following order:
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">      Writ Petition is allowed.     Annexure "J" is hereby

quashed. The first respondent forthwith connect the power

supply to the petitioner industry.    Second respondent is

directed to dispose of the applications pending before it

afresh within 3 months in accordance with law.        If the

documents furnished by the petitioner are not sufficient,

second respondent shall call for further documents and

pass appropriate order in accordance with law within three

months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this

order.
