ORAL
ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.	Rule.
</p><p id="p_2"> Mr. Sunil Mehta, learned advocate, waives service of rule on behalf
of respondent No.1 and Mr. Kartik Pandya, learned APP, for respondent
No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.	This
petition under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1">Article 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,
is filed to quash and set aside the Criminal Case No.4596 of 1997
pending before learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ankleshwar
for alleged offences punishable u/s. 24, 25, 43, 44 and 47 of the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (in short  the
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>, 1974 ).
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.	So
far as averments made in the complaint are concerned with regard to
submissions of report and analysis carried out by the authorised
officer, there is no dispute.  However, Mr. Devang Nanavati learned
advocate for applicants submit that allegations levelled against the
applicants herein (accused Nos. 4, 5 and 6) are not specific and
general in nature.  Even it is not averred that applicants are in any
manner in charge of day-to-day affairs of the Company or responsible
for such affairs.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.1.	Learned
advocate further submits that when there are no specific allegations
qua applicants with regard to conduct of business/affairs of the
Company, permitting proceeding of criminal case before the competent
court of law to proceed further will be a travesty of justice and
result into undue hardship and agony to applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.	By
relying on <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_4">Section 47</a> of the Water Act,1974, it is submitted that to
make a person criminally liable one of the essential requirement is
that such a person at the time of commission of offence is to be in
charge of and responsible of day-to-day affairs and conduct of the
business of the Company.  Since averments in the complaint lack the
above ingredients, the impugned complaint deserves to be quashed and
set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.	Learned
advocate for the applicants also placed reliance on oral judgment
dated 4.2.2010 passed by learned Single Judge (Coram: Hon'ble Mr.
Justice Akil Kureshi) in Criminal Misc. Application No.14138 of 2009
and submitted that in identical facts and circumstances of the case,
the complaint challenged in the said application came to be quashed
and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.	Learned
advocate appearing for the Gujarat Pollution Control Board-Respondent
No.1 is unable to dispute the above proposition of law.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.	Having
heard learned advocates appearing for the parties and considering the
facts and circumstances of the case and perusal of the impugned
complaint and provisions of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_5">Section 47</a> and <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_6">49</a> of the Water Act, 1974,
it appears that there are no specific averments with regard to
applicants being in charge of or responsible for the conduct of the
business of the Company.  It is further revealed that the applicants
are stationed at Mumbai and the factory is at Ankleshwar, managed by
the Manager concerned.  In the decision of Astad Parakh v. State
of Gujarat by referring to <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_7">Section 47</a> of Water Act, 1974 and
<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_8">Section 141</a> of Negotiable Instrument Act, in paras 3, 4 and 5 learned
Judge has observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_10">	3.	Counsel
	for the Pollution Control Board however, relied on <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_9">Section 47</a>  of
	Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, which reads
	as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_11"> 47.
Offences by companies.(1)Where an offence under this Act has been
committed by a company, every person, who at the time the offence was
committed was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for
the conduct of, the  business of the company, as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be
proceeded against and punished accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_12">Provided
that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any such
person liable to any punishment provided in this Act if he proves
that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he
exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such
offence.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">	(2)</span>
<p id="p_13">	Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section(1),  where an
	offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is
	proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or
	connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any
	director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such
	director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed
	to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded
	against and punished accordingly. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">	4.	It
	can thus be seen that language used in the above provision of
	passing any vicarious liability of offence committed by the company
	is on material aspect identical to language used in <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_11">Section 141</a> of
	the Negotiable Instrument Act, which reads as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_15"> 141.
Offences by companies.(1)If the person committing an offence under
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Section 138</a> is a company, every person who, at  the time the offence
was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to the company
for the conduct of, the  business of the company, as well as the
company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be
liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly:
</p>
<p id="p_16">Provided
that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any person
liable to punishment if he proves that the offence was committed
without his knowledge, or that he had exercised all due diligence to
prevent the commission of such offence:
</p>
<p id="p_17">[Provided
further that where a person is nominated as a Director of a company
by virtue of his holding any officer or employment in the Central
Government or State Government or a financial corporation owned or
controlled by the  Central  Government or the State Government, as
the case may be, he shall not be liable for prosecution under this
Chapter.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">	(2)</span>
<p id="p_18">	Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section(1),  where any
	offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is
	proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or
	connivance of, or is attributable to, any neglect on the part of,
	any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company,
	such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be
	deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be
	proceeded against and punished accordingly. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">5.	Relying
on the decision in case of <a href="/doc/672341/" id="a_13">Saroj Kumar Poddar v. State (NCT of
Delhi) and another</a> reported in (2007) 3 Supreme Court Cases 693,
and decision in case of <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_14">K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. Vora and another</a>
reported in (2009) 10 Supreme Court Cases  48, it can be seen
that in absence of any allegation that petitioners were in-charge of
and were responsible to the company for its day to day functioning,
their mere status of being the Directors of the company would not
make them responsible for any alleged act of the company
particularly, when it is pointed out that factory of the company was
situated at Anand and petitioners were all through out residing at
Mumbai. Additionally, I also find that complaint was filed way back
in the year 1997, summons was served to the petitioner only recently.
It is stated that the company has also gone sick and principal
accused who was in-charge of the company has died.
</p>
<p id="p_20">8.	I
am in the agreement with the above observations and findings of the
learned Judge.  So far as the case on hand is by and large similar to
the facts of the above case and, therefore, above decision and law
laid therein will apply with equal force since the complaint lack
necessary ingredients of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_15">section 47</a> of the Act, I deem it just and
proper to quash and set aside the
proceedings of Criminal Case No.4596 of 1997 pending before learned
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ankleshwar and accordingly
the same is quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_21">9.	Petition
is allowed accordingly.  Rule is made absolute.
