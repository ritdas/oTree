<p id="p_1">1.         This petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

prays for issuance of direction to the respondents to implement the

rehabilitation scheme, dated 10.1.2007 (P-5), which has been

sanctioned by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction

(for brevity, 'BIFR'). The petitioner Company has also challenged

order dated 13.9.2000 (P-1), passed by the Assessing Authority for

Cess-cum-Member Secretary, Haryana State Board for Prevention

and Control of Water Pollution, under <a href="/doc/921478/" id="a_2">Section 11</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977 (for brevity,

'the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_4">Cess Act</a>') raising the demand of `8,16,851/- on account of

Water Cess payable by the petitioner, imposing the penalty of

equivalent amount as well as interest of `7,49,418/-, total of which

comes to `23,82,120/-. The order dated 15.3.2011 (P-4), passed by

the Appellate Authority, dismissing the appeal preferred by the

petitioner Company under <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> of the Cess Act against the

order dated 13.9.2000, has also been challenged. Still further, the

communication dated 20.4.2010 (P-8) has also been challenged

whereby it has been asked to make payment of the outstanding

amount of `23,83,120/- before the sale of surplus assets of the

petitioner Company and to avoid action under the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_6">Cess Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_2">2.         The undisputed facts of the case are that the petitioner

Company is engaged in the business of processing of textiles,

having its processing unit at Faridabad.    Due to recession in the

international market, it started incurring losses and in the year

1996 an application under <a href="/doc/700346/" id="a_7">Section 25-N</a> of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947, was filed before the Specified Authority-cum-Joint Labour

Commissioner, Haryana, seeking permission to retrench surplus

991 workmen out of 2163 workmen, which was allowed. Another

application under <a href="/doc/1967435/" id="a_8">Section 15(1)</a> of the Sick Industrial Companies

(Special Provisions) act, 1985 (for brevity, 'SICA') was filed before

the BIFR. On 4.10.1996, the petitioner Company was declared as a

sick industrial company in terms of <a href="/doc/19388/" id="a_9">Section 3(1)(o)</a> of SICA.

</p><p id="p_3">3.         It has been claimed that despite the complete lock out in

the factory and the fact that w.e.f. 12.9.1996 the workers' union

took forceful possession of the plant, machinery and office of the

petitioner Company, it continued to pay water cess from 1993 to

1996 at the rate of `85,000/- on actual consumption basis.

However, on 13.9.2000, the Assessing Authority of the respondent

Haryana State Pollution Control Board-respondent No. 2, exercising
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No. 5915 of 2011                                                 3</span>


the powers under <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_10">Sections 10</a> and <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_11">11</a> of the Cess Act, raised the

total demand of `23,83,120/-, which includes Water Cess, penalty

and interest (P-1). Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner Company filed

an appeal on 11.10.2000 under <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_12">Section 13</a> of the Cess Act, for

setting aside the order dated 13.9.2000.            It was specifically

highlighted in the appeal that since the petitioner Company has

been declared as a sick company by the BIFR on 4.10.1996,

therefore, as per <a href="/doc/1691689/" id="a_13">Section 22</a> of the SICA no recovery could be

effected from it without seeking prior permission from BIFR. It was

further stated that even the assets of the Company could not be

disposed of or alienated without the permission of the BIFR (P-2).

The Appellate Authority, however, dismissed the appeal on merit,

vide order dated 15.3.2001 (P-4). With regard to the fact that the

matter was pending before BIFR and that the petitioner Company

has been declared as a sick company, the Appellate Authority in the

concluding para of its order made the following observations:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "     However, the point raised by the company, that the

          dues are not recoverable after their cases has been

          registered with BIFR, may be examined by the Assessing

          Authority. The appellant also raised the issue, that when

          the case is registered with BIFR, it is wrong to impose

          penalty   or   charge    interest   and    also   the   lodge

          proceedings under Land revenue Act for recovery of

          dues. The Assessing Authority will look into the matters

          at his own level and take suitable action.        The appeal

          does not lie in this case."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">4.        It is, thus, evident that the Appellate Authority under the

<a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_14">Cess Act</a> has left it open for the Assessing Authority to apply his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CWP No. 5915 of 2011                                              4</span>


mind on the aforementioned issue and take a decision by

examining the issue at his own level.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.        On 10.1.2007, the matter before BIFR came up for

consideration and after considering the suggestions and rival

contentions of the parties, a rehabilitation scheme under the

provisions of <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_15">Section 19(3)</a> read with <a href="/doc/100106/" id="a_16">Section 18(4)</a> of the SICA was

finalised, which has been placed on record (P-5). The respondent

Nos. 2 Board was a party before the BIFR. The representative of

the respondent No. 2 Board, namely, Shri P.K. Sharma, was present

during the proceedings. In para 12 of the order dated 10.1.2007, it

has been specifically directed that the various Government and

statutory authorities including Haryana State Pollution Control

Board would reassess their demands after taking into account the

period for which the petitioner Company had remained closed.

</p><p id="p_6">6.        In para 13 of the petition, the petitioner Company has

given the details of debts/liabilities which have been discharged by

it when the proceedings were pending before the BIFR and even

thereafter. The respondents, however, did not accept in principle

that the rehabilitation scheme prepared by the BIFR was the

rehabilitation scheme finalised by the BIFR (P-6 Colly).        The

petitioner Company also applied under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_17">Information Act</a>,

2005 for supplying the reasons for not implementing the directions

of the BIFR (P-7).     On 20.4.2010, a reply has been sent by

respondent No. 3 stating that there is no provision to waive the

interest/penal charges for default or non-payment of any dues

under the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_18">Cess Act</a> (P-8). Faced with the action of the respondents,

the petitioner Company has filed the instant petition.

</p><p id="p_7">7.        In the written statement filed on behalf of respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No. 5915 of 2011                                                  5</span>


Nos. 2 and 2 there is no denial of the factual position. It has been

reiterated that there is no provision in the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_19">Cess Act</a> for waiving off

the water cess as claimed by the petitioner Company. The BIFR has

made only a recommendation which is not binding upon them. It

has been specifically admitted that no appeal against the order

dated 10.1.2007 (P-5), passed by the BIFR has been filed by

respondent Nos. 2 and 3.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.        We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length

and perused the paper book with their able assistance.        It is a

conceded position that the petitioner Company has been declared

as a sick company by BIFR on 4.10.1996 under the provisions of

<a href="/doc/19388/" id="a_20">Section 3(1)(o)</a> of SICA. Eventually, vide order dated 10.1.2007, the

BIFR has also formulated a rehabilitation scheme for revival of the

petitioner company, which has been duly approved in the presence

of representatives of various parties including the respondent

Pollution Control Board. In para 12 of the order dated 10.1.2007,

BIFR has specifically issued directions to various Government and

statutory authorities including the respondent Pollution Control

Board that they would reassess their demands after taking into

account the period for which the petitioner Company had remained

closed. In para 7(B)(x) of the rehabilitation scheme, in respect of

the dues of the State Government of Haryana and its agencies, the

following proposal has been approved by BIFR:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "x)   STATE GOVERNMENT OF HARYANA

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          a)    To declare the company as a "Relief Undertaking"

          and grant all benefits and concessions as per the State

          Government's policy guidelines for sick industrial units.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          b)    To accept the payment of power charges based on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CWP No. 5915 of 2011                                              6</span>


          actual consumption of power for August &amp; September,

          1996 i.e. till the company was in operation, after

          adjustment of the security deposit lying with them. The

          payment shall be made over a period of twelve months

          from the date of sanction of scheme on interest free

          basis and to waive the entire minimum demand charges,

          slow meter charges, late payment surcharge, interest,

          penalty meter rent, meter charge or any other charges

          etc.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          c)     To accept the payment of water cess as based on

          actual discharge till the company was in operation, as

          per past average. The payment shall be made over a

          period of twelve months from the date of sanction of the

          scheme and to waive the entire interest, penalty etc.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">          d)     To waive interest/penal interest/penalty/damages

          etc. for the defaults or for non-payment or for delayed

          payment of any dues payable to the State Govt."

          (emphasis added)

</blockquote><p id="p_9">9.        Once the rehabilitation scheme has been approved by

BIFR in the presence of the representative of the respondent

Pollution Control Board and it is their own admitted case that no

appeal against the order dated 10.1.2007 passed by BIFR has been

filed before the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial

Reconstruction (for brevity, 'AAIFR') by the respondent Pollution

Control Board, then the rehabilitation scheme would be binding on

all the parties before the BIFR. We find no force in the argument

raised on behalf of the respondent Pollution Control Board that the

rehabilitation scheme is not binding on them and there is no

to reproduce the relevant part of <a href="/doc/1691689/" id="a_23">Section 22</a> of SICA, which reads

thus:-

for consideration before Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of

</p><p id="p_12">    515 It was held that for successfully invoking the applicability

of <a href="/doc/1691689/" id="a_29">Section 22</a> of SICA, it has to be established that a sanctioned

scheme is under implementation and it could not be said that

despite the aforesaid situation the provisions of <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_30">Section 22</a> would

not be attracted (See para 9). Therefore, it is evident that the BIFR

has permitted respondent Nos. 2 and 3 to accept the payment of

water cess as based on actual discharge till the company was in

operation as per past average. The payment has to be made over a

period of 12 months from the date of sanction of the scheme and to

waive the entire interest, penalty etc. This aspect has also been

highlighted by the Appellate Authority in its order dated 15.3.2011

(P-4) although it has been left to the wisdom of the Assessing

Authority.    Accordingly, we find that the relief claimed by the

petitioner is meritorious and deserves to be accepted even on this

additional ground.

the Assessing Authority is set aside. The respondents are directed

to implement the rehabilitation scheme in so far it concerns them
