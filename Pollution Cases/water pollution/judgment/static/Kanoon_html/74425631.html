</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">2.    The case made-out by the Petitioner may be summed up
thus :
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.1   The petitioner is 82 years old.               He is a Poet and a
Journalist.
</p>
<p id="p_11">2.2   He has written various books like "Narayan Sarovar -
Koteshwar",            "Lehriyu",    "Sambhre       Munke      Sen",       "Jay
Aashapura", "Kulda", "Kachchhi language demands justice"
and "Shree Sai Katha Kalpataru".
</p>
<p id="p_12">2.3   He also claims to have written many articles on
Development, Culture, History, Politics, Boundary of Kutchh,
Kutchhi language etc.


2.4   It is the case of the petitioner that Narayan Sarovar is
one of the most sacred Pilgrimage sites for Hindus.                        It is
located in Lakhpat Taluka of Kutchh District at a distance of
about 165 kms. from Bhuj where lies an ancient Koteshwar
Temple at a distance of 2 kms. away from the Bank of Kori

creek of the Arabian Sea.
</p>
<p id="p_13">2.5   Narayan Sarovar (Lake) is one of the five holy lakes of
Hinduism,      along      with   Maansarovar     in   Tibet,    Pampa    in
Karnataka, (Bindu Sarovar in Siddhpur, Patan), Bhuvaneshwar
in Orissa and Pushkar in Rajasthan.
</p>
<p id="p_14">2.6   There are temples of Shri Trikamraiji, Laxminarayan
Govardhannathji, Dwarkanath, Adinarayan, Ranchhodraiji and
Laxmiji.
</p>
<p id="p_15">2.7   The State of Gujarat approved a scheme for development
of the Narayan Sarovar Tirth Dham, through                     the Tourism
Corporation of the State Government.              In 2010, the Tourism
Corporation of Gujarat decided to develop the Narayan
Sarovar, - Koteshwar as a tourist destination.
</p>
<p id="p_16">2.8   The grievance voiced by the petitioner is that in the
name of development, the Tourism Corporation has started
construction of car parking on the Southern side of Lakhpat
Koteshwar Coastal Highway which is a part of                   the Sarovar
(Lake). The construction of Car Parking area is being done by
filling the sarovar with          sand, stones, cement and other
materials as a result of which substantial area of the Sarovar
which is a water body has been filled-up.
</p>
<p id="p_17">2.9   It is also the grievance of the petitioner that the Tourism
department is developing a garden under the Destination
Development          of   Narayan      Sarovar   Project.         For   the
development of the Garden, the department has filled-up a
substantial portion of the Sarovar resulting in curtailing the

area of Sarovar where at one point of time water used to flow
smoothly.
</p>
<p id="p_18">2.10 It is also the case of the petitioner that the Tourism
Department has constructed latrines near the Bank of the lake
including the Catchment Area of the Sarovar.
</p>
<p id="p_19">2.11 The construction of latrines on the Catchment area of
Narayan Sarovar has caused hindrance in the smooth flow of
the water from Naani Aav to the area of the Sarovar.            The
polluted water from the latrines percolates resulting in water
pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_20">2.12 The Tourism Corporation has also constructed a platform
on the south of Trikamrai Temple Complex where the              main
gate of the lake is situated through which the pilgrims enter to
take the holy bath.
</p>
<p id="p_21">2.13 In such circumstances referred to above, according to the
petitioner, the intervention of the Court is solicited in public
interest and the reliefs prayed for in this petition deserves to
be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_22">3.   An affidavit-in-reply has been filed on behalf of the
respondent no.4, the District Collector, duly sworn by the
Dy.Collector and Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Nakhatrana, inter
alia stating as under :
</p>
<p id="p_23">-    The parking area is outside the periphery of Narayan
     Sarovar and the Catchment area and, therefore, the
     allegations of filling-up of the Sarovar are far from truth.

      The Garden which has been developed is also not within
      the area of Narayan Sarovar.
</p>
<p id="p_25">-     The toilets which have been constructed are in no
      manner causing any obstruction for the smooth flow of
      the water.         All possible precautions and care has been
      taken to see that the Narayan Sarovar is not damaged in
      any manner. The DILR has prepared a map. The report
      placed on record would indicate that there has been no
      encroachment on the water body.
</p>
<p id="p_26">3.1   An affidavit-in-reply has also been filed on behalf of the
respondent no.5, Narayan Sarovar Gram Panchayat, duly
sworn by its Sarpanch wherein the following averments have
been made :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "3. The respondent no.5 most respectfully submits that
      the temples of Koteshwar Mahadev and Trikamraiji are
      holy temples and pilgrims pay regular visits for
      worshiping. The respondent No.5 further states that the
      temples of Koteshwar Mahadev and Trikamraiji situated
      in the villages of Koteshwar and Narayan Sarovar are on
      the coastal line and at the border of India and therefore,
      they are places of interest also for the visitors. It is most
      respectfully stated that uptill now there were limited
      infrastructural facilities for the tourists and pilgrims, but
      of late, the respondent no.1,2 &amp; 4 have taken deep
      interest for the development and it has resulted into two
      way State Highway from Bhuj to Koteshwar having length
      of 160 km. It is submitted that there is a B.S.F. Head
      Quarter at Koteshwar for the protection of coastal line.</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">      The respondent No.5 craves leave to add that the
      respondent No.1 &amp; 4 have undertaken number of
      developmental activities resulting into (1) construction of

submitted that all these projects are being executed by
Gujarat State Tourism Development Corporation Limited
and due to that tourists &amp; pilgrims are benefited to a
great extent. The respondent No.5 submits that there
are in all two Dharma Shalas having in all 150 rooms
(including Air-conditioned rooms) as well as Toran Hotel
belonging to Gujarat State Tourism Development
Corporation Limited. The respondent No.5 submits that
due to the said infrastructural development, there is
heavy rush of tourists and pilgrims and the same is
required to be met with by way of providing more and
more facilities to them. The respondent No.5 further
states that the ultimate beneficiaries are he local
villagers due to the said all round developmental
activities and heavy rush of visitors resulting into more
self employment opportunities. The respondent No.5
submits that all these activities are undertaken by the
respondent No.2 during last 2 to 3 years and not only
that even both the holy temples are renovated.
</p>
<p id="p_28">4.    The respondent No.5 most respectfully submits that
the averments &amp; allegations made by the petitioner
against construction of toilets, parking plots and snan
ghat as well as raising garden are thoroughly baseless.
The respondent No.5 submits that as per his knowledge
and revenue record, the construction of parking plots,
toilets, snan ghats and gardens are not on Narayan
Sarovar land. The respondent No.4 herein has filed a
detailed affidavit in reply controverting the said
allegations and also produced a sketch drawn by the
office of District Inspector of Land Record showing the
location of Narayan Sarovar as well as the projects under
construction. From kind perusal thereof it would be clear
to the Hon'ble Court that the developmental activities
undertaken by the respondent No.2 are not by way of
encroachment or reclamation of Sarovar.               The
respondent No.5 submits that the parking plots, garden,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                      Page 8 of 25</span>

Pay &amp; Use Toilets as well as Snan Ghat are at the
distance places.
</p>
<p id="p_29">5.    The respondent No.5 humbly states that Narayan
Sarovar covers revenue survey no.6 admeasuring 15
acres of land. It is pertinent to note that a Car parking is
provided on Government waste land while a garden is on
revenue survey no.7/1 (Paiki) and it is also a waste land.
The respondent No.5 further states that the Gram Ghat
(Mela Ground) is also situated on revenue survey No.7/1
(Paiki) and the toilets are constructed on the said waste
land.    The respondent No.5 craves leave to annex
herewith the copies of Village Form No.7 &amp; 12 with
regard to revenue survey No.6 of Narayan Sarovar as
well as Village Form no.6 showing that revenue survey
No.7/1 (Paiki) is waste land and marked as Annexure-A &amp;
B respectively. The respondent No.5 further states that
there was an old Dharma Shala on revenue survey No.5
of Narayan Sarovar and the same is removed and the
respondent No.2 has put up Snan Ghat at that place and
a copy of Village Form No.7 &amp; 12 with regard to revenue
Survey No.5 is annexed herewith and marked as
Annexure-C.
</p>
<p id="p_30">6.    In view of the above mentioned facts and
circumstances and considering the sketch made
available by the District Inspector of Land Record, it is
crystal clear that the averments &amp; allegations made by
he petitioner are baseless.
</p>
<p id="p_31">7.    The respondent No.5 further submits that even a
letter dated 10/07/2010 addressed by the deponent to
the Commissioner of Tourism annexed as Annexure-D by
the petitioner is also misread and misinterpreted. It is
submitted that there are certain suggestions made to the
said authority for overall development and full
cooperation is also assured for that.
</p>
<p id="p_32">8.    The respondent No.5 submits that even the Gram
Panchayat has also passed a Resolution dated
28/05/2010 permitting the respondent No.2 to undertake
authorized    developmental     activities for   overall
development of the area which is ultimately in the
interest of public at large, a copy of Resolution dated
28/05/2010 is annexed herewith and marked as
Annexure-D.

</p><p id="p_34">      9.    Lastly the respondent No.5 submits that due to the
      said construction and developmental activities by the
      respondent No.1, 2 &amp; 4, the ultimate beneficiaries are not
      only the tourists and pilgrims but also the local villagers
      also, but they have been benefitted from various
      activities. The respondent No.5 further submits that not
      only the elected Body of the Gram Panchayat, but also
      the general public is for the said developmental activities
      and rendering full cooperation to the Government
      machineries. It is pertinent to note that these activities
      are undertaken and the projects are being executed by
      the State Government and it is linked with Gujarat State
      Tourism Development Corporation Limited and not by the
      Private Organizations and therefore, there is no question
      of opposing it."

<p id="p_35">3.2   One additional affidavit-in-reply has been filed on behalf
of the respondent no.2 duly sworn by the Manager, Project,
Tourism Corporation of Gujarat inter alia stating as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      "5. I state that from a perusal of the map contained in
      the Revenue Records it becomes obvious that the
      Narayan Sarovar is rectangular in shape. Similarly from
      the map prepared from the DILR also it can be gathered
      that Narayan Sarovar is rectangular in shape. That the
      area of Narayan Sarovar was of 6 hectares as per Tippan
      (Form 7/12) and that there is no reduction in the area of
      Narayan Sarovar in any manner way. The map of DILR
      reveals that the area of Narayan Sarovar is 7.96.27
      hectares.

      situated beyond the temple and thus is not situated in
      the area of Narayan Sarovar whereby no reduction in the
      area of Narayan Sarovar has taken place. As far as the
      latrines (Pay and Use toilets) are concerned, I state that
      the same are much beyond the area of Narayan Sarovar,
      across the road. As far as the percolation from latrines is
      concerned, I state that the care in that regard has been

     much beyond the area of Narayan Sarovar.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     7.    I state that as far as the changing rooms are
     concerned, the same have been constructed by
     demolishing of old dilapidated building which was a
     Dharmsala and existed there since decades. The said
     changing rooms were constructed by using the very
     plinth of said Dharmsala which as aforesaid was in
     existence.    In fact, this was done in terms of the
     permission granted to the Corporation by Collector, Bhuj
     vide his letter dated 10.5.2010. A copy of the said letter
     dated 10.5.2010 granting permission to the Corporation

     aforesaid activities mentioned in the captioned writ
     petition are a part of the said development plan which
     task was handed over the Corporation by State of
     Gujarat. In fact, a series of meetings in this regard had
     taken place with various authorities including the
     petitioner and several discussions had taken place from
     time to time for better utilization of development plan to
     cater to needs of pilgrims visiting Narayan Sarovar. I

<p id="p_36">4.   Mr. Jainish Shah, the learned advocate appearing for the
petitioner, vehemently submitted that the action on the part of
the respondent authorities in filling-up the Sarovar for the
purpose of construction of parking, garden and toilets is
absolutely illegal and contrary to the pronouncement of this
Court, reported in 2002 (3) SLR 2295, in the case of <a href="/doc/324892/" id="a_1">Shailesh

submitted that the construction which has been put up is on
the extended boundary of the Sarovar and is in no manner
obstructing the smooth flow of water. Mr.Jani also submitted
that the State Government is conscious of the fact that
Narayan Sarovar is one of the most important religious
destinations and with a view to provide better facilities and
amenities to the pilgrims who visit the place in large numbers,
it thought fit to develop the area through its Tourism
Department. Mr.Jani laid much stress on the fact that the DILR
upon instructions from the Deputy Collector, Nakhatrana had
undertaken a comprehensive survey of Narayan Sarovar and
the area adjacent thereto.              The DILR has prepared a map
which indicates that the area of Narayan Sarovar was of 6
hectors as per Tippan (Form no.7/12) and that there has been
no reduction in the area of Narayan Sarovar in any manner.
The map of DILR revealed that the area of Narayan Sarovar is
7.96.27 Hectors. Mr. Jani also submitted that the construction
is already completed.            As a matter of fact, the project had
commenced way back in the year 1999 as evident from the
order passed by the Division Bench of this Court in Special Civil
Application No.1043/1999 decided on 11/5/1999 wherein the
petitioner herein had filed a petition with respect to the same
subject matter and the Court had directed the petitioner to
approach the local authority and represent the matter before
them. Thus, according to Mr.Jani, the petition should not be
entertained even on the ground of delay and laches.

<p id="p_45">7.   Before adverting to the rival submissions canvassed on
either side, we deem it necessary to consider the decision
rendered by the Division Bench of this Court in Shailesh Shah
(Supra.). In the said case a petition was filed with regard to
the question of protecting, preserving and improving the water
bodies      in    the     State    and      safeguarding      them     against
encroachments.            The court took the view that water is
essential to many of the most basic activities such as
agriculture,        forestry,     industry,         power   generation       and
recreation.        The court also held that the citizens have a
fundamental right under <a href="/doc/820476/" id="a_4">Article-15(2)(b)</a> of the Constitution of
not being subjected to any disability, liability, restriction or
condition with regard to the use of the wells, tanks and bathing
ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained out of
State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public. The
Court further held that all lakes and tanks which are not the
properties of individual are declared to be the properties of
Government by virtue of Sec. 37 of the Bombay Land Revenue
Code. The Municipal Corporations are under an obligation to
make       reasonable        and      adequate         provision    for      "the

M.C.Mehta v. Union of India, reported in (1997) 3 SCC 715. The
necessity to limit the construction activities in the close
vicinity of the two lakes was recognized by the Supreme Court,
as noted above. It is rather unfortunate that decades have
passed with laws already governing the field being put to disuse
by the apathy of the authorities to actively involve themselves
in protection and preservation of     water bodies. The interim
orders made in these petitions have, however, goaded them into
some action and the final responses on behalf of the State
Government, the Urban Development Authorities and the Municipal
Corporation have raised a distinct ray of hope that may in near
future glitter on the surface waters of the waterbodies that are
promised to be reinforced and preserved.
</p>
<p id="p_48">17. The importance of identifying the waterbodies in the State
can hardly be over emphasized. That is indeed the starting
point; and, after much exercise, the State Government has placed
on record the particulars of the existing lakes and ponds and
acceded to the suggestion of this Court that it will notify in
the Gazette all the waterbodies indicated in the Development
Plans and the Town Planning Schemes, as also the lakes and ponds
in other areas of the State where a Scheme or Development Plan
is not operative, so as to identify them for all time to come.
We accordingly direct that the State Government will notify all
the lakes and ponds as may have been shown in the areas covered
by the Town Planning Schemes and Development Plans, as also
those in the areas not so covered throughout the State, in short
all the waterbodies in the territory of the State that vest in
the State and / or the Area Development Authorities or the local
bodies including Panchayats, in the official gazette within
three months from the date of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_49">18. The next important aspect is that the waterbodies that vest
in the State or local bodies should not be alienated or
transferred. It appears that, in the past, the land covered by
the waterbodies have been put to other uses under the Town
Planning Schemes and then a stand is taken up that the Town
Planning Schemes having become part of the statute, the Court
cannot do anything about it, or, if such land is put to some
other use allowed under the scheme, that it will not be
appropriate to dig up the construction to revive a waterbody.
When State is enjoined upon a duty under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_12">Article 48A</a> read with
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_13">Article 21</a> of the Constitution to endeavour to protect and
improve environment which would include the waterbodies and
every citizen is under a duty under <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_14">Article 51A(g)</a> to protect
and improve environment including lakes, which are specifically
mentioned therein as a part of environment, and when such
material resources need to be protected to enable people to
enjoy a quality life which is the essence of the right to life
guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Article 21</a> as held by the Apex Court in Hinchlal's
case (supra), there would virtually be no constitutional option
to convert the land under the lakes and ponds to any use that
may alter their character as waterbodies in violation of the
constitutional mandates to the State and the citizens not only
to protect but to improve them. The Supreme Court has made this
explicit in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_16">M.C.Mehta v. Kamal Nath</a>, reported in (1997) 1 SCC
388 by holding that these natural resources are meant for the
public use and cannot be converted into private ownership. Step
in this direction is taken by the State Government by declaring
Draft of the State Water Policy (2002). Announcements on Water
Resources Planning, Development and Management in paragraph 4 of

the Policy statement include the strategy of making efforts "to
protect and use all fresh water / natural resources like lakes,
tanks, ponds, talavadis, springs etc. and preservation of
existing freshwater bodies shall be ensured. Traditional water
retaining structures shall be protected .........". The Circular
dated 15-3-1999 (a copy of which is annexed with the affidavit-
in-reply dated 4-4-2002 of the Under Secretary to the
Government, Urban Development &amp; Urban Housing Department), was
issued instructing the concerned authorities that while making
any original development plan or a revised development plan, the
waterbodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds, canals or any other
type of waterbodies should be preserved as such waterbodies and
should not be included in the proposals for other uses and these
waterbodies should not be given any final plot number and their
character should be preserved. In order to ensure that the
waterbodies in the State which are identified as per the
development plans, town planning schemes and the government
records and which will be notified in the official gazette, we
direct that the State Government, all Area Development
Authorities and local Bodies will protect, maintain and preserve
all the waterbodies in the State which are identified as per the
development plans, town planning schemes and the government
records and which will be notified in the official gazette, as
waterbodies and they will not be alienated or transferred or put
to any use other than as waterbodies.
</p>
<p id="p_50">19. Water has also a destructive potential if the standards of
its quality are not maintained. Misuse of water resources and
poor water management practices would result in depleted
supplies, falling water tables, shrinking inland lakes, and
stream flows diminished to ecologically unsafe levels. Water
pollution, originating mostly from human activities, occurs even
more frequently and in a widespread manner, making the quality
of water unsuitable for many uses. The management of water
quantity cannot be efficiently done without considering the
water quality. Water resources should be managed in conjunction
with land resources, and water supply schemes which generate
large amount of waste water in consumer areas should be designed
and built with the required matching drainage networks and waste
water treatment facilities. We would therefore direct the
respondents authorities to take steps to get the standards of
quality of water of the lakes and ponds prescribed by the
concerned authority under the law, and devise mechanism for
periodic monitoring of the quality of water in these lakes and
ponds.
</p>
<p id="p_51">20. Normally, lakes and ponds are expected to be permanently wet
year round. They fall in the discipline of limnology which is a
sub-system of hydrology that deals with the scientific study of
freshwaters specifically those found in lakes and ponds. By the
fallout of dust from the atmosphere and the sediments washed
into the lake, the lake will gradually become eutrophic, with
relatively poor water quality and will gradually become
shallower and may eventually disappear. A lake may come to its
end physically through loss of its water or through infilling by
sediments and other materials. Lakes and ponds depend for their
very existence upon a balance between their main sources of
water and the losses that occur, a sort of water budget which
may reflect the hydrologic idiosyncrasies of the individual
lake. It will usually be difficult to influence the basic
natural factors such as precipitation and evaporation that cause



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                        Page 17 of 25</span>
 C/WPPIL/181/2011                               CAV JUDGEMNT


the imbalances. When the balance between photosynthesis and
decomposition is upset, either too much organic material
accumulates without getting decomposed adequately or too many
bacteria grow and overabundance of decomposition occurs. Most
inland lakes and ponds are eutrophic. Their bottoms get filled
up with rich sediments. Eutrophication causes many harmful
effects such as deterioration of the scenic value of lakes and
ponds due to decrease in transparency or colour changes, water
supply problems including the obstruction of filters, unpleasant
odors and taste of its water, and loss of acquatic life. This
emphasizes the need to proper preservation of lakes and ponds,
because, in addition to supply of water, freshwater bodies also
provide a resource for recreational activities, such as,
boating, swimming, fishing and habitats for various aquatic and
terrestrial species. Pond waters can have many uses from
irrigation to recreational activities. Extensive management
plans and programmes have to be established as a part of
geographic initiatives to ensure the preservation, protection
and restoration of these important environmental resources. The
National Water Policy and the State Water Policy, a draft of
which is produced, are exhaustive documents containing great
vision but now is the time to move beyond policy declarations to
concrete action that may produce results by rejuvenating the
waterbodies, most of which appear to be in a state of "comma".
</p>
<p id="p_52">20.1 The Year 2003 is to be celebrated as International Year of
Freshwater and the United Nations Educational Scientific and
Cultural Organization has undertaken International Hydrological
Programme which is an intergovernmental scientific programme in
water resources. The I.H.P. - VI (2002 - 2007) Programme has
been launched coinciding with the emergence of a profound
paradigm shift in society's approach towards water. There is a
shift in thinking about water from fragmented compartments of
scientific inquiry to a more holistic integrated approach
towards both quality and quantity of water, the surface water
and ground water as well as atmosphere and terrestrial part of
the hydrological cycle. It is, therefore, essential that the
State Government, the Area Development Authorities and the Local
Authorities should hold themselves jointly and severally
responsible to achieve the purpose of the constitutional and
legal mandates for preserving the waterbodies in their proper
and useful state. We therefore direct that the State Government,
the Area Development Authorities and Local Authorities should
take urgent measures to rejuvenate the waterbodies which are to
be notified in the gazette by undertaking a declared phased
programme of desiltation and make adequate provisions for
recharging them by appropriate storm water drains and other
feasible means and to take measures against pollution of such
waterbodies.
</p>
<p id="p_53">21. Monitoring of the rejuvenation, maintenance and preservation
of waterbodies is essential and it is heartening to note that
due importance is given to this aspect in paragraph 30.5 of the
Draft Water Policy of the State which envisages constitution of
Water Resources Council headed by Chief Minister of Gujarat with
Ministers of various Departments as members and Chief Secretary
as Member Secretary, as also of Water Resources Committee headed
by the Chief Secretary with Secretaries of various Government
Departments   as   members    for   inter-departmental   related
activities. Having regard to the urgency and importance of
having a centralized control and monitoring of the programmes



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                        Page 18 of 25</span>

for the protection, preservation and improvement of waterbodies,
we direct that the State Government shall expeditiously take
steps to constitute Water Resources Council as contemplated in
the Draft Water Policy of the State, headed by the Hon'ble the
Chief Minister with other Ministers, including the Ministers in-
charge of the Environment and Urban Development Departments to
oversee   the  programme   for   protection,  preservation   and
improvement of the waterbodies. The State Government will also
constitute the Water Resources Committee headed by the Chief
Secretary which may include the Secretaries of Environment,
Urban Development and Agriculture Departments for monitoring the
implementation of the programme in a time-bound manner with
periodic review of its success. This Committee shall place the
particulars of the targets achieved and the causes of non-
fulfilment of the targets periodically before the Water
Resources Council for its consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_54">22. Without removal of encroachments, the waterbodies under
encroachment can hardly be rejuvenated. It is therefore
essential for the State Government, the Urban Development
Authorities and the local bodies to exercise their statutory
powers to remove the existing encroachments and take measures to
prevent   encroachments.   These   authorities    are,  therefore,
directed to prepare an authenticated record in form of
videography, photography and panchnamas of the existing
encroachments and take urgent steps to remove them in accordance
with law and the rehabilitation policies of the Government.
Responsibilities of the officers / staff concerned,
should be fixed in respect of non-removal of encroachments and
fresh encroachments. The Water Resources Committee will closely
monitor   the   removal   of  encroachments    by   the  concerned
authorities, and, the Area Development Authorities and the local
bodies   shall    furnish,   quarterly,   particulars    of   such
encroachments and their removal to the Water Resources
Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_55">23. There has been opposition expressed on behalf of the State
Government and the authorities, as also on behalf of the parties
whose construction plans are held up, against the directions
contained in paragraph 92 of the interim order dated 18-4-2001
to the effect that the Corporation, Development Authority,
Collector and the State Government "shall not permit any
construction whatsoever within 500 meters of the lake / pond if
the size of the waterbody lake / pond is 5000 sq. mtrs. or less,
and within 1000 meters, if the size of the lake / pond waterbody
is larger than 5000 sq. mtrs. save and except for storage of
water or making gradient etc." The learned Advocate General
argued that a general provision is made in the Regulation 14 of
the Revised draft General Development Control Regulations
published in the Gujarat Government Gazette dated 18-5-2002,
which is reproduced hereunder :
</p>
<p id="p_56">"14. DISTANCE FROM WATER COURSE
No development whatsoever, whether by filing or otherwise shall
be carried out within 30 Mts. from the boundary of the bank of
the river where there is no river embankment and within 15 Mts.
or such distance as may be prescribed under any other general or
specific orders of Government and appropriate Authority
whichever is more, from river where there is river embankment
but in case of kans, nala, canal, talav, lake, water-bodies etc.
it shall be 9.00 mts.

Provided that where a water course passes through a low lying
land without any well defined bank, the applicant may be
permitted by the competent Authority to restrict or direct the
water course to an alignment and cross section determined by
the competent Authority."
</p>
<p id="p_58">23.1 Admittedly, the above provision did not exist when the
interim order was made on 18-4-2001. Exercise of Constitutional
power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_17">Article 226</a> by issuing an interim order cannot be
branded as exercise of legislative function. As a precautionary
and interim measure, the Court can grant an interim order to
prevent constructions that may harm the natural resources which
are required to be protected, preserved and improved. Since the
direction not to construct within the area specified was of
interim nature, given when the above regulation did not exist,
and the matter is now being finally decided, the attack against
such interim direction on the ground that the Court had impinged
on the legislative function of prescribing such limits is
unwarranted. The judicial powers of the Court can be exercised
in context of executive functioning to prevent wrongs and
illegalities and to enforce statutory duties and obligations,
and there can arise no question of the Court exercising
executive or legislative powers when it makes interim judicial
orders under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> to prevent illegalities or wrongs and
to enforce statutory obligations and duties. The character of
such judicial power is distinct and different from the nature of
legislative or executive powers and it has a constitutional
backing.
</p>
<p id="p_59">23.2 There can be no dispute over the proposition that the Court
will not substitute its wisdom for that of the legislature or
the executive. The function of prescribing the parameters for
effective preservation of the water bodies undoubtedly is of the
State Government, Area &amp; Urban Development Authorities, and the
local bodies under the laws, but the established neglect of the
water bodies prompted the Court to issue interim directions to
prevent construction in the areas specified in the interim
order, around the periphery of the lakes and ponds, and that
need not irk the authorities any more, when they have now chosen
to become alert and alive
to the needs of the situation realising the constitutional and
legal requirement to protect, preserve and improve lakes and
ponds.
</p>
<p id="p_60">23.3 Though initially reliance was placed on the Regulation 14,
when asked to disclose on what basis that minimum was fixed, the
learned Advocate General for the State and the learned
Additional Advocate General for AUDA very fairly stated that
though nine meters was prescribed, it was only the minimum and
in reality, the concerned authorities have provided a larger
peripheral margins to prevent construction activities, because,
the lakes are usually surrounded by garden and then come the
peripheral roads which vary in their width and in many case,
they were shown to be eighteen meters or even more in the
development plans. On such examination of the material, it has
been stated in the affidavit filed by the Chief Town Planner
that, when planning for a pond is undertaken, embankment itself
is phased with varying width according to the requirement of the
pond and coupled with 9 mtrs. distance from the pond, may lead
to a distance of more than 9 mtrs. from the pond. It is

stated that, when the planning for a pond is undertaken, the
distance to be kept is determined, depending upon the location
of the water body. On the periphery of Kankaria Lake, there is
90 mtrs. to 160 mtrs. green / recreation zone created. On its
south-west side, a distance of 120 mtrs. is retained in respect
of Chandola lake, as already noted hereinabove. In the affidavit
filed by the AUDA by its Chief Executive Officer, it has been
stated that, inspite of the provision of minimum 9 mtrs. of
distance mentioned in the G.D.C.R. No.14, the AUDA always
examines each case on individual basis, according to the
requirement of the individual water body for the purpose of
fixing of peripheral distance from the waterbodies.

<p id="p_63">9.   Therefore, in view of the decision of this Court in Shailesh
R. Shah (supra), it is the duty of the State Government and all
Area Development Authorities and Local Body to protect,

        C/WPPIL/181/2011                                   CAV JUDGEMNT



maintain and preserve all the water bodies in the State. The
Narayan Sarovar would also be included and in our opinion, the
authorities ought to have been vigilant enough to keep this in
mind before undertaking the work of construction. However,
the question before us is whether there has been any filling-up
of the Sarvoar for the purpose of construction or not.                   For
better adjudication of this issue, we directed the State
respondent        vide our order dated 17th January, 2013, to file
supplementary evidence disclosing the area of Narayan
Sarovar as reflected in the Revenue record as also a revenue
map for the purpose of finding out the encroachment if any.
We also directed that in the meantime renovation work
carried-out by the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat may
continue, but no further land which was reflected in the name
of    Narayan       Sarovar   in   the      revenue   record   should    be
encroached. We also directed the Tourism Corporation of
Gujarat to give affidavit disclosing the extent of their
construction and also to indicate the extent of the construction
they proposed to do on the land which is in the name of
Narayan Sarovar in the revenue record.
</p>
<p id="p_64">10.    Thereafter on 8th August, 2013, a map was produced
before us which was prepared on the Scale of 1cm = 20 mtrs.
For resolving the dispute, we directed the State respondent to
disclose the area of dotted portion on the basis of such scale
and also to give separate measurement of the area of the
rectangular portion which was claimed to be real Narayan
Sarovar as also the area of Garden and Parking based on the
map.

</p><p id="p_66">11.    After due consideration of the matter, more particularly,
the maps which are on record and other materials, we have
reached to the conclusion that there has been filling-up of the
Sarovar to a certain extent which, in our opinion ought not to
have been done.
</p>
<p id="p_67">12.    At the same time we are also conscious of the fact that
the project is completed. We are of the opinion that at this
stage, if we direct the authorities to remove the filling and the
construction, it will cause more damage to the Sarovar rather
than protecting the same. In such circumstances, we are of
the opinion that this PIL could be closed         by issuing the
following directions:-
</p>
<p id="p_68">i)     The respondent authorities shall not touch any part of the
       existing Sarovar in any manner even if it is required for
       the convenience of the pilgrims and will be duty bound to
       protect the boundary of the Sarovar existing as on today.
       There shall not be any further reclamation or filling-up of
       the pond of the Sarovar, even if it is necessary as on
       today as a part of the same project.
</p>
<p id="p_69">ii)    The respondent authorities are also directed to ensure
       that there is no obstruction in any manner at any place in
       the smooth flow of water of the Sarovar.
</p>
<p id="p_70">iii)   The respondent authorities shall also ensure that there
       shall not be any reclamation or filling-up of the Sarovar in
       the extended area, if any, in future.</p><pre id="pre_5">


iv)    The respondent authorities shall ensure that the Sarovar

</pre><p id="p_71">       is not polluted in any manner. We take note of the fact
       that toilets have been constructed in large numbers and
       therefore, the authorities should ensure that in no
       manner the construction of toilets and the sewerage
       should pollute the Sarovar.
</p>
<p id="p_72">13.    With the above, we close this P.I.L. However, in the facts
and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to
costs.
