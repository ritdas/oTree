        writ petition, were six months old and petitioner No.3 was

        fourteen months old. This petition has been filed through their

        next friends, i.e. their fathers, who are concerned about the health

        of their children as they feel that due to the alarming degradation

        of the air quality, leading to severe air pollution in the city of Delhi

        (where these petitioners reside), the petitioners may encounter

        various health hazards. Poor, very poor or severe air quality/air

        pollution affects all citizens, irrespective of their age. However,

        claim the petitioners, children are much more vulnerable to air

        pollutants as exposure thereto may affect them in various ways,

        including aggravation of asthma, coughing, bronchitis, retarded

        nervous system breakdown and even cognitive impairment. The

        petition accepts that there are number of reasons which have

        contributed to poor air quality in Delhi and National Capital

        Region (for short, ‘NCR’). At the same time, it is emphasised that

        air pollution hits its nadir during Diwali time because of

        indiscriminate use of firecrackers, the chemical composition

        whereof increases harmful particulate matters such as PM 2.5 or

        PM10 at alarming level thereby bringing the situation of

        ‘emergency’. The petitioners have, thus, prayed for direction to

        the official respondents to take possible measures for checking

        the pollution by stricking at the causes of the pollution, which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                  Page 2 of 54</span>
        includes seasonal crop burning, indiscriminate dumping of

        dust/malba and other pollutants, etc. The prayer also includes

        banning the use, in any form, of firecrackers, sparkles and minor

        explosives, in any form, during festivals or otherwise.


</p><p id="p_5">2)      This petition came up for preliminary hearing on October 08, 2015

        when notice was issued and the matter was directed to be listed

        on October 16, 2015 at 2:00 p.m. since the petitioners wanted

        stay on burning of crackers during Diwali, which was around the

        corner in that year. When the matter was taken up on October

        16, 2015, certain suggestions were made by the learned counsel

        appearing for the petitioners, which were as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               “1. Restrict licenses to low hazard fireworks.

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">               3.     Restrict window for use of fireworks to be from 7:00

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">               5.     Government be directed to give wide publicity to the ill
                      effects of fireworks and encourage restraint on

                      use fireworks.”


</p><p id="p_8">3)      Suggestion Nos. 5 and 6 were accepted and the relevant portion

        of the order that was passed reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_9"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                      Page 3 of 54</span>
               “In our view for the present, if we accept suggestion Nos. 5
               and 6 it will not in any way affect the interest of the
               respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                      Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned Solicitor General
               appearing for the Union of India states that the Union
               Government has already taken enough and effective steps
               to give wide publicity to the ill effects of fireworks.

</p><p id="p_11">                      In spite of the submission so made by the learned
               Solicitor General, we intend to pass the following order:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                   “The Union Government and all the State Governments
                   will give wide publicity both in print and Electronic media
                   to the ill effects of fireworks and advise people
                   accordingly.</blockquote><p id="p_12">

                   We also direct the Teachers/Lecturers/Assistant
                   Professors/ Professors of the Schools and Colleges to
                   educate the students about the ill effects of the fireworks.””


</p><p id="p_13">4)      Thereafter, this petition was taken up along with certain other

        connected petitions, including Writ Petition (Civil) No. 13029 of

        1985 titled ‘<a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_1">M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a>’ and orders dated

        December 16, 2015 were passed issuing several directions with a

        view to reducing the levels of air pollution within the NCR, as the

        issues in those writ petitions pertained to air pollution in Delhi and

        NCR as well. It may be mentioned that the directions issued

        therein were general in nature though concerning the problem of

        air pollution. Thereafter also the instant writ petition, along with

        the M.C. Mehta case and other cases, came up for hearing and it

        is not necessary to take note of all those orders.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                           Page 4 of 54</span>
</p><p id="p_14">5)      Pertinently, during Diwali of 2016, which was celebrated on

        October 30, 2016, the air quality in Delhi and NCR worsened

        alarmingly. In fact, certain reports indicated that the air quality

        standards in early November of that year were the worst in the

        world. This prompted the Court to take up IA No.4 filed in this writ

        petition.      After hearing the parties, it passed orders dated

        November 11, 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">6)      The petitioners had pressed for interim relief in respect of

        fireworks, drawing the attention of this Court to the emergent

        situation that has resulted in worsening the air quality standards

        in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) because of extensive

        use of fireworks, including firecrackers during Diwali last year. It

        was pointed out that onset of winter itself deteriorates air quality

        in this region and it gets aggravated because of festival/marriage

        season that occurs during these very months. Taking note of the

        aforesaid factors, particularly impact of fireworks on the ambient

        air    and      unhealthy        effects      thereof   which   had     created

        unprecedented situation in Delhi, with air pollution going up at

        alarming levels and making it the most polluted city in the world,

        the order dated November 11, 2016 was passed. Air pollution

        had gone up to 29 times above the World Health Organisation



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                           Page 5 of 54</span>
        (WHO) standards. In the aforesaid scenario, this Court deemed it

        proper to pass certain directions vide its order dated November

        11, 2016 in IA No.4. Snapping the supply chain of fireworks was

        considered to be the more practical way of addressing the

        menace instead of banning the burning the crackers by

        individuals as it would have been difficult to monitor and enforce

        the burning of the crackers by the citizenry.


</p><p id="p_17">7)      In paragraph 18 of the Order dated November 11, 2016 it was

        clarified that much was left to be heard, discussed and said about

        the rival claims and contentions. However, the Court hastened to

        add that harmful effects of fireworks on the ambient air and the

        lungs, eyes and ears of people was also an acknowledged fact,

        as can be seen from the following portion of the said paragraph:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">               “18. We are aware that we are only issuing interim
               directions, and much is left to be heard, discussed and said
               about the rival claims and contentions. What is however
               indisputable is that the harmful effects of fireworks on the
               ambient air and the lungs, eyes and ears of people. What
               is also obvious is the extreme nuisance, noise the fireworks
               cause to citizens particularly the ailing and the aged.</blockquote><p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">               Therefore, though much can be argued as always about
               the significance and even joy of bursting fireworks, but at
               the same time (sic), prima facie, a just constitutional
               balance must overwhelmingly prioritize the harmful effects
               of this hazardous air on present and future generations,
               irreversible and imperceptible as they are, over the
               immediate commercial constraints of the manufacturers
               and suppliers of fireworks…”




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                   Page 6 of 54</span>
</p><p id="p_20">8)      In the process, this Court also recognised the duty of the State to

        ensure a healthy environment in terms of <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_2">Article 48A</a> of the

        Constitution of India as well as the duty of the citizens to ensure

        the same under <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_3">Article 51A(g)</a> of the Constitution. The Court also

        reminded itself of the “precautionary principle” which mandates

        that where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage,

        lack of scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for

        postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. In

        the order the Court had taken note of the deleterious effects of air

        pollution on the health of the people, particularly the children.

        Going by all these considerations, the Court passed the following

        directions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">               “19. We thus consider it inappropriate that explosives
               which are used as fireworks should be available in the
               market in the NCR till further orders. The mechanism of
               the law in this regard is clear. Rule 118 of the Explosive
               Rules, 2008, framed under the <a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_4">Explosives Act</a>, 1884,
               provides for the manner in which licenses issued under the
               <a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_5">Explosives Act</a> to store and sell explosives could be
               suspended or cancelled. Sub-Rule (5) thereof specifically
               confers on the Central Government a power to suspend or
               cancel a license if it considers that it is in public interest.
               This provision also makes it clear that an opportunity to
               hear the licensee could be dispensed with if the Central
               Government considers that in public interest. This Court
               finds that the grave air quality situation in NCR is one such
               case, where this Court, can intervene and suspend the
               licenses to store and sell fireworks in the NCR. We direct
               the Central Government to:

                            territory of NCR.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                    (iii)   No such licenses shall be granted or renewed

</p><p id="p_22">               20. In addition to the above, we direct the CPCB to study
               and prepare a report on the harmful effects of the materials
               which are currently being used in the manufacture of
               fireworks. The report shall be submitted within a period of
               three months to this Court.”


</p><p id="p_23">9)      Since direction was given to the Central Pollution Control Board

        (CPCB) to study and prepare a report of the harmful effects of the

        materials which are currently being used in the manufacture of

        fireworks and submit a report within three months, the matter was

        taken up for consideration thereafter from time to time.


</p><p id="p_24">10)     Thereafter, the manufacturers of firecrackers as well as license

        holders also filed applications for modification of the aforesaid

        interim order. It included IA No. 52448 of 2017. Because of

        these applications, the matter was heard by a Bench of this Court

        and orders dated September 12, 2017 were passed in the

        aforesaid IA. In this order also, the Court recognised severity of

        air pollution in Delhi and NCR. The Court also discussed the

        manner in which air quality had worsened due to fireworks during

        Diwali days in the year 2016. The Court took note of the steps

        that were taken by different authorities aiming to reduce air

        which were needed in this behalf to reduce the pollution in Delhi

        and NCR.          The Court took note of the fact that number of

        measures were required to be taken for improving air quality as

        various factors were contributing to the air pollution.      It also

        specifically mentioned that one of the reasons was burning of

        crackers/fireworks during Diwali. On that basis, the Court also

        accepted that one of the possible methods for reducing it during

        Diwali is by continuing the suspension of licenses for the sale of

        fireworks, thereby implicitly prohibiting the bursting of fireworks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">        However, at the same time, the Court expressed the opinion that

        continuing the suspension of licenses might be too radical a step

        to take for the present. It was deemed appropriate to adopt a

        graded and balanced approach, which is necessary, that will

        reduce and gradually eliminate air pollution in Delhi and in the

        NCR caused by the bursting of fireworks. In the process, the

        Court took into consideration the interest of those who had

        already been granted a valid permanent licence to posses and

        sell fireworks in Delhi and the NCR. We would like to reproduce

        the following paragraphs from the said order:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.               Page 9 of 54</span>
<p id="p_25">               “67. The right to health coupled with the right to breathe
               clean air leaves no manner of doubt that it is important that
               air pollution deserves to be eliminated and one of the
               possible methods of reducing it during Diwali is by
               continuing the suspension of licences for the sale of
               fireworks and therefore implicitly, prohibiting the bursting of
               fireworks.
</p>
<p id="p_26">               68. In our considered opinion, continuing the suspension
               of licences might be too radical a step to take for the
               present – a graded and balanced approach is necessary
               that will reduce and gradually eliminate air pollution in Delhi
               and in the NCR caused by the bursting of fireworks. At the
               same time it is necessary to ensure that injustice is not

               permanent licence to possess and sell fireworks in Delhi
               and the NCR. The graded and balanced approach is not
               intended to dilute our primary concern which is and
               remains the health of everybody and the human right to
               breathe good quality air or at least not be compelled to
               breathe poor quality air. Generally speaking this must take
               precedence over the commercial or other interest of the
               applicant and those granted a permanent licence to
               possess and sell fireworks.
</p>
<p id="p_27">               69. But, from the material before us, it cannot be said with
               any great degree of certainty that the extremely poor
               quality of air in Delhi in November and December 2016
               was the result only of bursting fireworks around Diwali.
               Certainly, there were other causes as well, but even so the
               contribution of the bursting of fireworks cannot be glossed
               over. Unfortunately, neither is it possible to give an
               accurate or relative assessment of the contribution of the
               other identified factors nor the contribution of bursting
               fireworks to the poor air quality in Delhi and in the NCR.
               Consequently, a complete ban on the sale of fireworks
               would be an extreme step that might not be fully warranted
               by the facts available to us. There is, therefore, some
               justification for modifying the interim order passed on 11 th
               November, 2016 and lifting the suspension of the
               permanent licences.

<p id="p_28">               70. At the same time, it cannot be forgotten that admittedly
               there is a huge quantity of fireworks in Delhi and in the
               NCR and the figure has been provided to us by the
               applicant. Similarly, there can be no doubt that the Delhi
               Police had issued a large number of temporary licences in

               2016 and it would not be unreasonable to assume that
               around and during Diwali, there would have been some
               illegal temporary shops set up, whether known or not
               known to the police. We do not have the figures with
               regard to the NCR, but we assume that like in Delhi, a
               large number of temporary licences have been issued for
               the possession and sale of fireworks. Therefore, there is a
               need to regulate the availability and sale of fireworks in
               Delhi and the NCR.”

               permanent licensees and, therefore, a graded regulation is
               necessary which would eventually result in a prohibition.
               Taking all factors into consideration, we are of the view that
               the following orders and directions are required to be
               issued and we do so:

               granted in 2016. The number of temporary licences should
               be capped at 500. Similarly, the States in the NCR are
               restrained from granting more than 50% of the number of
               temporary licences granted in 2016. The area of

               view of the passage of time and further knowledge gained
               over the last 25 years and issue a fresh notification, if
               necessary.

               NCT of Delhi and the corresponding Department in other
               States in the NCR shall immediately formulate a plan of
               action, in not more than 15 days, to reach out to children in
               all the schools through the school staff, volunteers and
               NGOs to sensitize and educate school children on the
               health hazards and ill-effects of breathing polluted air,
               including air that is polluted due to fireworks. School
               children should be encouraged to reduce, if not eliminate,
               the bursting of fireworks as a part of any festivities.

               (8) The Government of NCT of Delhi and other States in
               the NCR may consider interacting with established medical
               institutions for issuing advisories cautioning people about
               the health hazards of bursting fireworks.

               2017 prohibiting the use of compounds of antimony,
               lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead in the manufacture of
               fireworks is made absolute. In addition, the use of

               the composition already approved by PESO is maintained.

               It is the responsibility of PESO to ensure compliance of the
               standards it has formulated.
</p>
<p id="p_36">               (11) Since there are enough fireworks available for sale in
               Delhi and the NCR, the transport of fireworks into Delhi and
               the NCR from outside the region is prohibited and the
               concerned law enforcement authorities will ensure that
               there is no further entry of fireworks into Delhi and the NCR
               till further orders. In our opinion, even 50,00,000 kg of
               fireworks is far more than enough for Dussehra and Diwali
               in 2017. The permanent licensees are at liberty to exhaust
               their existing stock of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR and, if
               that is not possible, take measures to transport the stocks
               outside Delhi and the NCR.

<p id="p_37">               (12) The suspension of permanent licences as directed by
               the order dated 11th November, 2016 is lifted for the time
               being. This might require a review after Diwali depending
               on the ambient air quality post Diwali. However, it is made
               explicit that the sale of fireworks by the permanent
               licensees must conform to the directions given above and
               must be fully in compliance with the Explosives Rules. We
               were informed that the permanent licences were issued by
               PESO and therefore the responsibility is on PESO to
               ensure compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_38">               (13) While lifting the suspension on the permanent licences
               already granted, we put these licensees on notice for
               Dussehra and Diwali in 2018 that they will be permitted to
               possess and sell only 50% of the quantity permitted in
               2017 and that this will substantially reduce over the next
               couple of years. The permanent licensees are at liberty to
               file objections to this proposed direction within 30 days
               from today and thereafter the objections if any will be heard
               and decided. If no objections are filed, this direction will
               become absolute without any further reference to any
               licensee.

<p id="p_39">               (14) Since there is a lack of clarity on the safety limits of
               various metals and constituents used in fireworks, a
               research study must be jointly carried out by the CPCB and
               the FRDC laying down appropriate standards for ambient
               air quality in relation to the bursting of fireworks and the
               release of their constituents in the air. While Schedule VII
               of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 does deal with
               several metals, but as we have seen there are several
               other metals or constituents of fireworks that have not been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                   Page 13 of 54</span>
               studied by the CPCB and no standards have been laid
               down with regard to the concentration of these metals or
               constituents in the ambient air. The CPCB has assured us
               that it will complete the exercise by 15th September, 2017
               but keeping in mind its track record subsequent to the
               order dated 11th November, 2016 this does not seem
               possible. Therefore, we grant time to the CPCB to come
               out with definite standards on or before 30th September,
               2017.
</p>
<p id="p_40">               (15) In any event, a research study also needs to be
               conducted on the impact of bursting fireworks during
               Dussehra and Diwali on the health of the people. We,
               therefore, appoint a Committee to be chaired by the
               Chairperson of the CPCB and consisting of officers at the
               appropriate level from the National Physical Laboratory,
               Delhi, the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied
               Sciences, Timarpur, Delhi, the Indian Institute of
               Technology-Kanpur, scientists from the State Pollution
               Control Boards, the Fire Development and Research
               Centre, Sivakasi and Nagpur and the National Environment
               Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) nominated by the
               Chairperson of the CPCB to submit a report in this regard
               preferably on or before 31st December, 2017.

               (16) Keeping in mind the adverse effects of air pollution,
               the human right to breathe clean air and the human right to
               health, the Central Government and other authorities
               should consider encouraging display fireworks through
               community participation rather than individual bursting of
               fireworks.”


</p><p id="p_41">12)     After the aforesaid order was passed, many applications were

        filed, from both sides, seeking modification of some of the

        aforesaid directions. Insofar as the petitioners are concerned, in

        their application for modification, they prayed for removal of

        Directions Nos. 5 and 10 to 13, which was in essence a prayer for

        restoration of earlier order dated November 11, 2016. Insofar as

        fireworks manufacturers, traders and license holders of the

        fireworks/firecrackers are concerned, they wanted that relaxation

        given in the order dated September 12, 2017 be further

        liberalised.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">13)     After hearing both the parties, orders dated October 09, 2017

        were passed.           The Court accepted the fact that burning of

        firecrackers during Diwali was not the only reason for air pollution

        in Delhi and NCR and there was a need to tackle those factors as

        well. However, it was observed that the immediate impact of use

        of fireworks and firecrackers bursting during Diwali is an

        altogether different aspect. The Court noted that there is direct

        evidence of deterioration of air quality at alarming levels, which

        happens every year. Burning of these firecrackers during Diwali

        in 2016 had shot up PM levels by three times, making Delhi the

        worst city in the world insofar as air pollution is concerned. Direct

        and immediate cause thereof was burning of crackers during

        Diwali. The Court also remarked that every year before Diwali

        there are attempts on the part of the Government (Ministry of

        Environment, Government of India as well as Delhi Government),

        Media, NGOs and various other groups to create awareness in

        the general public about the ill-effects of bursting of these

        crackers. Campaigns are held in the schools wherein children

        are discouraged to have fireworks.            Thus, there is virtually a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                  Page 15 of 54</span>
        consensus in the society that crackers should not be burnt during

        Diwali, which can be celebrated with equal fervour by various

        other means as well. Irony is that when causes are brought in the

        Court, there is a resistance from certain quarters.    Moreover,

        there are adequate statutory provisions, aid whereof can be taken

        to ban the sale of these crackers.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">14)     The Court also took into consideration three substantial

        submissions which were made by the petitioners, viz.: (a) CPCB

        had taken a stand, nearly twenty years ago, that Sulphur in

        fireworks should not be permitted as Sulphur on combustion

        produces Sulphur Dioxide and the same is extremely harmful to

        health. The CPCB has stated that between 9:00 p.m. to midnight

        on Diwali day the levels of Sulphur Dioxide content in the air are

        dangerously high. Moreover, all the above authorities were also

        unanimous in their view that crackers should only be burst in

        designated places. Also the CPCB had specifically stated that

        joined crackers should be banned. Secondly, in the order dated

        November 11, 2016, licenses were suspended primarily for the

        reason that rising in the PM levels at alarming proportion was

        because of burning of crackers during Diwali, which had adverse

        harmful affect and, therefore, there was no reason to relax this



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.            Page 16 of 54</span>
        condition. Another significant argument which was taken note of

        was that the order dated November 11, 2016 was passed

        immediately after the Diwali in the year 2016 and the effect of that

        order had not been tested. Going by these considerations, the

        Court decided to suspend the order dated September 12, 2017 at

        least during the Diwali of 2017 with the following directions:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">               “14...To put it clearly, though we are not tweaking with the
               various directions contained in the Orders dated
               September 12, 2017, the effect of that Order would not be
               given during this Diwali and, therefore, we are making it
               effective only from November 01, 2017. We are conscious
               of the fact that after the said order was passed, the police
               may have issued temporary licences. Accordingly, those
               are suspended forthwith so that there is no further sale of
               the crackers in Delhi and NCR. Further orders in this behalf
               can be passed on assessing the situation that would
               emerge after this Diwali season...”


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">15)     As expected, spate of applications have been filed, most of which

        emanate from the aforesaid orders dated October 09, 2017. Many

        parties have intervened.                  Most of the interventionists are

        supporting the petitioners and want permanent ban on the

        burning of crackers during Diwali. Some have even prayed that

        this ban be extended to the whole country and should not be

        limited to only Delhi and NCR. IAs were also filed seeking ban on

        crop burning. The opposite group consists of manufacturers of

        crackers, manufacturers’ association and license holders. The

        State of Tamil Nadu has come forward to support this category.

            one point of time, almost one lakh children were employed

            in this industry. Though it was admitted that this position

            does not exist any longer in view of strict measures taken

            by the Government.

             Constitution is available to the manufacturers and traders,

             such a ban on burning crackers during Diwali would

             amount to reasonable restriction having regard to the fact

             that right to health was also a fundamental right guaranteed

             under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It was also submitted

             that the cost in the form of medical expenses which are

             incurred for treatment of those who suffered as a result of

             burning of crackers is equally high or even may be higher.

</p><p id="p_60">       (e)     One of the arguments of the opposite side was that there

       were no sufficient studies as to what extent the burning of

       crackers is contributing towards air and noise pollution and

       whether it was such a serious problem which warrants ban. To

       this, reply of the petitioners was that in the field of environmental

       laws, precautionary principle was also applicable which does not

       need exact studies or material.

       not a core and essential religious practice and even if it is so,

       <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_12">Article 25</a> was subject to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_13">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Judgment

</p>
<p id="p_65">               The respondents, who are opposing the prayers made in

        the writ petitions and the IAs, made the submissions to the

        following effect:
</p>
<p id="p_66">        (i)    Burning of crackers during Diwali does not have any

        significant adverse affect on the environment. It is argued that

        there is no study till date which has come to such a conclusion.

        The Deepawali Monitoring Report, 2017 of CPCB is relied upon

        for this purpose and on that basis it is contended that the factors

        which contributed to the problem were not because of crackers

        burning during Diwali. Ambient air quality before and after Diwali

        reflects that there was no spike immediately after Diwali. It was

        accepted that situation of air pollution in Delhi and NCR is

        'generally' worrying. However, there are multiple causes which

        lead to polluting air and such a position existed even before

        Diwali, which showed that other factors played dominant role.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.             Page 22 of 54</span>
</p><p id="p_67">        (ii)    Insofar as presence of PM2.5 in the air is concerned, studies

        of CPCB are relied upon, on the basis of which attempt is made

        to show that: (a) spike was not so much during Diwali days; (b)

        increase in PM2.5 in the air does not remain for long, i.e. it does

        not linger for many days; and (c) it is manageable as well.

</p><p id="p_68">                Reports of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur; National

        Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA; a professor

        from Harvard University; and an affidavit dated January 05, 2018

        filed by CPCB were referred to in support.
</p>
<p id="p_69">        (iii)   It is submitted that pursuant to orders dated September 12,

        2017 whereby the Court had directed that a research study needs

        to be conducted on the impact of bursting fireworks during

        Dussehra and Diwali on the health of people, no such empirical

        data has emerged so far for want of detailed studies.

</p><p id="p_70">                In nutshell, the argument was that in the absence of any

        definite study attributing the worsening of air quality to the

        fireworks during Diwali, the right of the manufacturers and traders

        under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_14">Article 19(1)(g</a>), which is a fundamental right to carry on

        trade, should not be made to suffer till the time there is a

        complete study in this behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_71">        (iv)    It is also argued that the revenue generated from the

        manufacturing and sale of fireworks is to the tune of Rs.6,000


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.               Page 23 of 54</span>
        crores per annum. Further, this industry has given employment

        to five lakh families. Such a revenue to the State as well as

        employment to large number of workers on which five lakh

        families sustain cannot be put in jeopardy by imposing a total

        ban.     It was emphasised that there is a necessity to adopt a

        balanced approach. For this purpose, Status Report and affidavit

        of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has

        been relied upon which suggested eco-friendly firecrackers.

        Advisory dated March 07, 2008 issued by the Petroleum and

        Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), which comes under the

        Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of

        Commerce and Industry, Government of India, was also relied

        upon, as per which the fireworks manufacturers in India were

        advised to ensure that the firecrackers manufactured by them are

        within the limits prescribed in Annexure-I to the said Advisory

        dated March 07, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_72">        (v)    The State of Tamil Nadu also supported the cause of the

        manufacturers and traders of the firecrackers. It was argued that

        the study undertaken by CPCB pursuant to the directions issued

        by this Court was conducted by the Committee which did not

        have a representative from the Fireworks Research and

        Development Centre (FRDC) which was not even informed about

        the development of this case. It was emphasised that any proper

        study in this behalf should address following aspects:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">               a)     Socio-economic effect of the ban needs to be

                      hardship,

                      factors which were leading to air pollution, like
                      construction activity, etc., which are not banned.

                      available in the present day technology which
                      may be deployed to ensure that pollution free
                      firecrackers can be manufactured.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_73">        (vi)   Indic Collective (applicant in IA No. 105355 of 2017)

        opposed the prayer of banning of fireworks during Diwali on the

        ground that it was a religious practice scrupulously followed by

        the Hindus from time immemorial and it had become a core and

        essential religious practice which was protected under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_15">Article 25</a>

        of the Constitution as their fundamental right.


</p><p id="p_74">19)     The arguments of the parties recorded above would show that the

        submissions for and against almost remain the same, which were

        advanced on earlier occasions, though the focus of both the sides

        was more nuanced.                     In the process, the events and

        apposite to take note of the study that has been undertaken by

        dated September 12, 2017.

<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">21)     Following the directions of this Court, a Committee was appointed

        to be chaired by the Chairperson of the CPCB. This Committee

        invited Dr. M.K. Daga, Professor Director, Maulana Azad Medical

        College (MAMC), as health expert to study the methodology. Dr.

        Daga suggested that considering the time available, a short-term

        study based on questionnaire survey, hospital data collection and

        sampling at a few locations can be conducted. This methodology

        proposed by Dr. Daga was agreed to by the Committee. The

        Committee requested MAMC to submit a proposal accordingly.

        On submission of project proposal, the Committee awarded the

        project on 'Health Impact Assessment on Firecracker Burning

        During Dussehra And Diwali' to MAMC.          The scope included

        questionnaire survey for respiratory, skin, air, eye and relevant

        symptoms during pre and post Diwali, clinical study on lung

        function and urine samples of randomly selected subjects, and

        prepared and ultimately it was finalised after incorporating the

        comments from the Members of the Committee. As per this study

        on the afore-mentioned subject, following are the major findings:

               not much different during pre and post Dussehra and

               breathlessness, but this did not translate into any
               significant illness requiring immediate medical attention.
               Other system related complaints were also not much
               different during pre and post Dussehra and Diwali.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">               There was evidence of increased values of barium and
               strontium in urine samples of many subjects. These are
               some of the metals used in firecracker manufacturing.
               Increased levels in urine do reflect a probability of
               exposure. However, all other elements are not increased
               to substantiate the effect of bursting of firecrackers. It is
               also possible that the individuals were exposed due to
               bursting of firecrackers directly or indirectly in their locality.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">               Air quality did worsen during Diwali and symptoms of eye,
               increased coughing, relatively more hospital visits,
               increased noise levels and high metal levels in urine do
               reflect adverse impact of firecracker bursting. However, it
               was not significant statistically. A long term study would be
               required to assess long term health impacts of firecracker
               bursting."

</p><p id="p_90">23)     It can be discerned from the above that the air quality had

        worsened during Diwali.                   There were more patients with

        symptoms of eye, increased coughing and patients with high

        metal levels in urine. Even noise level had increased. These are

        the adverse impacts of firecracker bursting, though the study

        mentions that statistically it was not a significant increase.


</p><p id="p_91">24)     The study has also found that actual PM 2.5 mass concentrations

        increased due to firecracker bursting, which had affected air

        quality.     On Diwali day both PM10 and PM2.5 had 2-3.5 fold

        increase. Also, PM10 and PM2.5 were reported higher in post-

        Diwali day compared to pre-Diwali at all stations.               Another

        significant finding is that PM 2.5 was reduced by 39% compared to

        2016 Diwali, presumably due to the ban order on the sale of

        crackers which was passed on October 09, 2017, which led to

        lesser quantum of fireworks.

        fireworks on Diwali day, PM2.5 levels go up. Secondly, when there

        compared to the earlier Diwali in the absence of ban.

        factors as well.            It calls for necessity to tackle the other

        contributory factors for air pollution and making the air quality as

        'very poor' and even 'poor'.                  Unregulated construction activity

        which generates lot of dust and crop burning in the neighbouring

        States are the two other major reasons, apart from certain other

        reasons, including vehicular pollution etc. The moot question in

        such a scenario is as to whether the menace due to fireworks

        during Diwali or other festivals/occasions should be left

        untouched and the Court should allow the situation to prevail as it

        is, only because it is not the sole reason for causing air pollution?

        Answer has to be in the negative.

        Diwali and post-Diwali, which is the result of bursting of

        firecrackers, it is necessary to understand the adverse affect on

        health of persons of this particulate in air, even if such a situation

        remains only for few days. In this behalf, we may refer to the

        opinions of some experts/prominent doctors in the field, which

        have been placed on record by the petitioners.

               people coming with chest ailments and many of my
               operated patients returned with complaints of cough and
               breathlessness without any other cause for the same. This
               has forced me to carry out innumerable chest x-rays and
               CT scans to confirm that the complaints are due to the
               exposure to toxins. For the sake of relief to the patient and
               in order to relieve them from bronchospasms, my
               colleagues and I are compelled to prescribe inhalers which
               have brochodilators and inhaled steroids, apart from cough
               suppressants and antibiotics. Media reports suggest that
               there has been an increase in asthma medicine sales by
               43% due to pollution (Hindustan Times, May 02, 2017).
               While earlier, it was believed that children with asthma
               would outgrow the affliction, in the present circumstances,
               this seems challenging.
</p>
<p id="p_99">               8. Both at AIIMS and at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, there
               has been a significant increase in the number of patients I
               would see in my OPD in the days immediately following
               Diwali, and I have no doubt that this was on account of
               sudden exposure to the deadly cocktail consisting of
               extremely high levels of toxic gases, particulate matter and
               metallic compounds. Each exposure to firework emissions
               not only leads to acute disastrous effects but also causes
               cumulative long-term irreversible damage. Once the PM 2.5
               particle gets deposited in the lungs, it never leaves, thereby
               affecting the linking for life and diminishing breathing
               capacity. This affects not only the respiratory system, but
               also the cardio-vascular system (heart attacks and
               hypertension), nervous system (strokes and developmental
               abnormalities in children), reproductive system and virtually
               every other health function including the bladder and
               kidneys.
</p>
<p id="p_100">               9. It would be useful to refer to two studies conducted ten
               years apart by a team including Prof. Sundeep Salvi,
               Director Chest Research Foundation, Pune and Member of
               the Government of India's Steering Committee on Air
               Pollution &amp; Health. The first one in 2007 was presented at
               the Annual Congress of the European Respiratory Society
               at Stockholm and reveals the harmful health effects of CO,
               SOx and NOx from fireworks.

               Respiratory Society at Milan in 2017. This has since been
               published in the European Respiratory Journal, and
               examines the personal exposure levels of fireworks (as
               against a general study of ambient air). In these isolated
               and controlled circumstances, the exposure to PM 2.5 was
               found to be as high as 64,5000 u/m3."
</p>
<p id="p_102">
</p><p id="p_103">29)     From the aforesaid it can be gathered that when PM 2.5 crosses

        the normal limits, even if it remains in the air for few days, it

        becomes severe health hazard thereby causing serious health

        problems. Unfortunately such problems are virtually irreversible,

        which means that a person whose health gets affected because

        of this particulate has a long suffering. In view thereof, argument

        in opposition that air quality that gets worsened during Diwali

        remains only for few days would be of no consequence as even

        in few days it causes severe harm to the health of the people, that

        too for prolonged duration.
</p>
<p id="p_104">
</p><p id="p_105">30)     From the aforesaid discussion, the position can be summed up by

        stating that though burning of crackers during Diwali is not the

        only reason for worsening air quality, at the same time, it

        definitely contributes to air pollution in a significant way. Again,

        even when no studies are undertaken on long-term impact

        thereof, the CPCB Committee, which did this exercise taking it as

        a short-term project which was assigned to MAMC, has returned

        a definite finding about deterioration in air quality during Diwali

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                Page 32 of 54</span>
        because of burning of crackers. It has also shown that post-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">        Diwali air pollution in 2017 was less compared to the 2016 Diwali

        which was the result of lesser fireworks in 2017.               This again

        indicates a direct causal connection between burning crackers

        during Diwali and air pollution.              Another immediate effect of

        burning of crackers is that it results in substantial increase in

        PM2.5 level which is a very serious health hazard. In fact, this

        results in severe noise pollution as well which has acute

        psychological, mental and even physical affect on animals. In the

        application seeking intervention and directions (IA No. 68897 of

        2018) filed by Gauri Maulekhi, the applicant has placed on record

        plethora of literature based on various studies depicting profound

        affect of noise/sound on the health of animals, extending to their

        neuroendocrine            system,        reproduction   and   development,

        metabolism, cardiovascular health, cognition and sleep, audition,

        immune system, DNA integrity and gene expression. Fireworks

        sometimes results in temporary or permanent hearing impairment

        in animals. Further, dogs are also known to display psychological

        symptoms of stress during this time. So much so, fireworks has

        traumatising affect even on birds. Deafening sound which the

        crackers produce on bursting are known to disorient birds and

        responsible for their displacement from their nests.             Even the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                     Page 33 of 54</span>
        respiratory system of the birds gets affected. Studies also show

        that the sound of crackers has affect on milch cattle. As the cattle

        is scared, adrenaline is released in its body which inhibits

        oxytocin, a hormone which helps the milk cattle to release milk

        thereby affecting the production of milk.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_106">31)     The aforesaid findings are sufficient to negate the arguments of

        the opposite side that there is absence of scientific study about

        the adverse affect of firecrackers during Diwali. In environmental

        law, 'precautionary principle' is one of the well recognised

        principles which is followed to save the environment. It is rightly

        argued by the petitioners that this principle does not need exact

        studies/material.         The very word 'precautionary' indicates that

        such a measure is taken by way of precaution which can be

        resorted to even in the absence of definite studies. In Vellore

        Citizens' Welfare Forum, this Court explained the principle in the

               frontiers from time to time has led to great changes in
               environmental concepts during the period between the
               Stockholm Conference of 1972 and the Rio Conference of
               1992. <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_16">In Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union of India</a> a
               three-Judge Bench of this Court referred to these changes,
               to the “precautionary principle” and the new concept of
               “burden of proof” in environmental matters. Kuldip Singh, J.
               after referring to the principles evolved in various
               international conferences and to the concept of
               “sustainable development”, stated that the precautionary
               principle, the polluter-pays principle and the special
               concept of onus of proof have now emerged and govern
               the law in our country too, as is clear from Articles 47, 48-A
               and 51-A(g) of our Constitution and that, in fact, in the
               various environmental statutes, such as the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">Water Act</a>,
               1974 and other statutes, including the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_18">Environment
               (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, these concepts are already implied.
               The learned Judge declared that these principles have now
               become part of our law. The relevant observations in the
               Vellore case in this behalf read as follows: (SCC p. 660,
               para 14)

                     “14. In view of the above-mentioned constitutional
                     and statutory provisions we have no hesitation in
                     holding that the precautionary principle and the
                     polluter-pays principle are part of the environmental
                     law of the country.”

               The Court observed that even otherwise, the abovesaid
               principles are accepted as part of the customary
               international law and hence there should be no difficulty in
               accepting them as part of our domestic law. In fact, on the
               facts of the case before this Court, it was directed that the
               authority to be appointed under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_19">Section 3(3)</a> of the
               Environment (Protection) Act, 1986

               ‘polluter-pays principle’”.

<p id="p_109">               The learned Judges also observed that the new concept
               which places the burden of proof on the developer or

               also become part of our environmental law.

               briefly but, in our view, it is necessary to explain their
               meaning in more detail, so that courts and tribunals or
               environmental authorities can properly apply the said
               principles in the matters which come before them.

</p><p id="p_112">               33. A basic shift in the approach to environmental
               protection occurred initially between 1972 and 1982.
               Earlier, the concept was based on the “assimilative
               capacity” rule as revealed from Principle 6 of the
               Stockholm Declaration of the U.N. Conference on Human
               Environment, 1972. The said principle assumed that
               science could provide policy-makers with the information
               and means necessary to avoid encroaching upon the
               capacity of the environment to assimilate impacts and it
               presumed that relevant technical expertise would be
               available when environmental harm was predicted and
               there would be sufficient time to act in order to avoid such
               harm. But in the 11th Principle of the U.N. General
               Assembly Resolution on World Charter for Nature, 1982,
               the emphasis shifted to the “precautionary principle”, and
               this was reiterated in the Rio Conference of 1992 in its
               Principle 15 which reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">                     “Principle 15.—In order to protect the environment,
                     the precautionary approach shall be widely applied
                     by States according to their capabilities. Where
                     there are threats of serious or irreversible damage,
                     lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a
                     reason for proposing cost-effective measures to
                     prevent environmental degradation.”

</blockquote><p id="p_113">               34. In regard to the cause for the emergence of this
               principle, Charmian Barton, in the article earlier referred to
               in Vol. 22, Harv. Envtt. L. Rev. (1998), p. 509 at p. 547

                      determination. If it is not possible to make a

                      sense to err on the side of caution and prevent
                      activities that may cause serious or irreversible
                      harm. An informed decision can be made at a later

               In other words, the inadequacies of science is the real
               basis that has led to the precautionary principle of 1982. It
               is based on the theory that it is better to err on the side of
               caution and prevent environmental harm which may indeed

               choose the least environmentally harmful activity. It is
               based on scientific uncertainty. Environmental protection
               should not only aim at protecting health, property and
               economic interest but also protect the environment for its
               own sake. Precautionary duties must not only be triggered
               by the suspicion of concrete danger but also by (justified)
               concern or risk potential. The precautionary principle was
               recommended by the UNEP Governing Council (1989).
               The Bomako Convention also lowered the threshold at
               which scientific evidence might require action by not
               referring to “serious” or “irreversible” as adjectives
               qualifying harm. However, summing up the legal status of
               the     precautionary     principle,     one      commentator
               characterised the principle as still “evolving” for though it is
               accepted as part of the international customary law, “the
               consequences of its application in any potential situation
               will be influenced by the circumstances of each case”.
               (See First Report of Dr Sreenivasa Rao Pemmaraju —
               Special Rapporteur, International Law Commission dated

                    developer/industrialist to show that his action is
                    environmentally benign.”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">               37. It is to be noticed that while the inadequacies of
               science have led to the “precautionary principle”, the said
               “precautionary principle” in its turn, has led to the special
               principle of burden of proof in environmental cases where
               burden as to the absence of injurious effect of the actions
               proposed, — is placed on those who want to change the
               status quo [Wynne, Uncertainty and Environmental
               Learning, 2 Global Envtl. Change 111 (1992) at p. 123].
               This is often termed as a reversal of the burden of proof,
               because otherwise in environmental cases, those opposing
               the change would be compelled to shoulder the evidentiary
               burden, a procedure which is not fair. Therefore, it is
               necessary that the party attempting to preserve the status
               quo by maintaining a less polluted state should not carry
               the burden of proof and the party who wants to alter it,
               must bear this burden. [See James M. Olson: “Shifting the
               Burden of Proof”, 20 Envtl. Law, p. 891 at p. 898 (1990).]

               toxic pollution in major threats to essential ecological

        environment protection, which is a facet of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Article 21</a>, was given

        involves millions of persons living in Delhi and NCR, whose right

        into this debate in greater details, our endeavour is to strive at

        religious practice. The question is as to whether it should be

        allowed to be continued in the present form without any

        regulatory measures, as a part of religious practice, even if it is

        proving to be a serious health hazard. We feel that <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_27">Article 25</a> is

        subject to <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_28">Article 21</a> and if a particular religious practice is

</p><p id="p_125">               The judicial wing, while undertaking the task of performing
               its judicial function, is also required to perform its role in
               this direction. It calls for an economic analysis of law
               approach, most commonly referred to as “Law and
               Economics” [ Richard A. Posner in his book Frontiers of
               Legal Theory explains this concept as follows:“Economic
               analysis of law has heuristic, descriptive and normative
               aspects. As a heuristic, it seeks to display underlying
               unities in legal doctrines and institutions; in its descriptive
               mode, it seeks to identify the economic logic and effects of
               doctrines and institutions and the economic causes of legal
               change; in its normative aspect it advises Judges and other
               policy-makers on the most efficient methods of regulating
               conduct through law. The range of its subject-matter has
               become wide, indeed all-encompassing. Exploiting
               advances in the economics of nonmarket behaviour,
               economic analysis of law has expanded far beyond its
               original focus on antitrust, taxation, public utility regulation,
               corporate finance, and other areas of explicitly economic
               regulation. (And within that domain, it has expanded to
               include such fields as property and contract law.) The
               “new” economic analysis of law embraces such nonmarket,
               or quasi-nonmarket, fields of law as tort law, family law,
               criminal law, free speech, procedure, legislation, public
               international law, the law of intellectual property, the rules
               governing the trial and appellate process, environmental
               law, the administrative process, the regulation of health and
               safety, the laws forbidding discrimination in employment,
               and social norms viewed as a source of, an obstacle to,
               and a substitute for formal law.”Posner also mentioned that
               this interface between Law and Economics might grandly
               be called “Economic Theory of Law”, which is built on a
               pioneering article by Ronald Coase [R.H. Coase, “The
               Problem of Social Cost”, 3 Journal of Law and Economics
               1 (1960)]:“The “Coase Theorem” holds that where market
               transaction costs are zero, the law's initial assignment of
               rights is irrelevant to efficiency, since if the assignment is
               inefficient the parties will rectify it by a corrective
               transaction. There are two important corollaries. The first is
               that the law, to the extent interested in promoting economic
               efficiency, should try to minimize transaction costs, for
               example by defining property rights clearly, by making them
               readily transferable, and by creating cheap and effective
               remedies for breach of contract.…The second corollary of
               the Coase Theorem is that where, despite the law's best
               efforts, market transaction costs remain high, the law

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                      Page 42 of 54</span>
               should simulate the market's allocation of resources by
               assigning property rights to the highest-valued users. An
               example is the fair-use doctrine of copyright law, which
               allows writers to publish short quotations from a
               copyrighted work without negotiating with the copyright
               holder. The costs of such negotiations would usually be
               prohibitive; if they were not prohibitive, the usual result
               would be an agreement to permit the quotation, and so the
               doctrine of fair use brings about the result that the market
               would bring about if market transactions were feasible.”] .
               In fact, in certain branches of Law there is a direct impact
               of Economics and economic considerations play
               predominant role, which are even recognised as legal
               principles. Monopoly laws (popularly known as “Antitrust
               Laws” in USA) have been transformed by Economics. The
               issues arising in competition laws (which has replaced
               monopoly laws) are decided primarily on economic
               analysis of various provisions of the <a href="/doc/109474639/" id="a_30">Competition
               Commission Act</a>. Similar approach is to be necessarily
               adopted while interpreting bankruptcy laws or even matters
               relating to corporate finance, etc. The impress of
               Economics is strong while examining various facets of the
               issues arising under the aforesaid laws. In fact, economic
               evidence plays a big role even while deciding
               environmental issues. There is a growing role of
               Economics in contract, labour, tax, corporate and other
               laws. Courts are increasingly receptive to economic
               arguments while deciding these issues. In such an
               environment it becomes the bounden duty of the Court to
               have the economic analysis and economic impact of its
               decisions."
</p>
<p id="p_126">
</p><p id="p_127">38)     Applying the aforesaid principle, in the first blush it may appear

        that the aforesaid argument has substantial force in it. However,

        that would be only one side of the picture as there are two contra

        arguments which are sufficient to take the sheen out of the

        aforesaid plea. First aspect is that the argument of economic

        hardship is pitched against right to health and life. When the

        Court is called upon to protect the right to life, economic effect of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                  Page 43 of 54</span>
        a particular measure for the protection of such right to health will

        have to give way to this fundamental right. Second factor, which

        is equally important, is that the economic loss to the State is

        pitched against the economic loss in the form of cost of treatment

        for treating the ailments with which people suffer as a result of

        burning of these crackers. Health hazards in the form of various

        diseases that are the direct result of burning of crackers have

        already been noted above.                     It leads to asthma, coughing,

        bronchitis, retarded nervous system breakdown and even

        cognitive impairment.             Some of the diseases continue on a

        prolonged basis. Some of these which are caused because of

        high level of PM2.5 are even irreversible. In such cases, patients

        may have to continue to get the medical treatment for much

        longer period and even for life. Though there are no statistics as

        to what would be the cost for treating such diseases which are as

        a direct consequence of fireworks on these occasions like Diwali,

        it can safely be said that this may also be substantial. It may be

        more      than      the    revenue        which    is   generated   from     the

        manufacturers of the crackers. However, we say no more for

        want of precise statistical data in this behalf.


</p><p id="p_128">39)     With this, we come to the most important issue, viz. whether there

        has to be a complete ban on display of fireworks during Diwali or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">IAs in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 &amp; Ors.                         Page 44 of 54</span>
        it can be controlled/regulated in a manner which may not result

        into air pollution or may be least intrusive.


</p><p id="p_129">40)     It would be significant to mention at this stage that there have

        been lots of efforts for production of firecrackers which do not

        contain harmful chemicals and thereby not causing air pollution,

        which are even termed as 'Green Crackers'. The Union of India

                   were 159 ug/m3 (about 4 times of AAQCVs) wand 35
                   ug/m3 (about 9 times of AAQCVs) respectively. Iron
                   was well within the prescribed limits. Aluminum is
                   used as fuel in fireworks in and to give white brilliant
                   sparkle. Ba is added to give only attractive green

                   Aluminum may cause dermatitis and having bio-
                   accumulation potential in case of long exposure. Ba
