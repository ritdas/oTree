                        Delivered in Open Court by
           Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dalip Singh, Judicial Member

</p><p id="p_3">1.   Reply of the Respondent No.5 has been filed today. The same is ordered

     to be taken on record. Copy of the reply has been furnished to the

     Applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.   We have considered the submissions of the Learned Counsel for the

     Applicant as well as the reply filed on behalf of the Municipal Council,

     Vidisha, the MP State Pollution Control Board and Respondent No. 6,

     M/s Satya Sai Agro Oils (Pvt.) Ltd. The State Government has adopted

     the reply filed by the MP State Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_5">3.   On 05.07.2014, this Tribunal, hearing the parties, had noted the concern

     of the Applicant which primarily is regarding the storm water drain

     being constructed by the Municipal Council Vidisha in accordance with

     the Detailed Project Report (DPR) prepared by it and approved by the

     State Government. It was submitted and recorded by this Tribunal that

     there is a likelihood that the storm water drain would be mis-utilised for

     carrying untreated sewage water upstream of the river Betwa which

     would cause serious health hazard since the drinking water supply (Water

     Works) site is located downstream of the point where the storm water

     drain is being constructed and is going to enter the river Betwa. It was


                                                                         Page 2
      submitted by the Applicant that the aforesaid storm water drain is

     constructed by the Municipal Council as per the DPR and plan prepared

     by it but it has not taken note of establishment of any sewage treatment

     plant and therefore would allow untreated sewage to enter upstream of

     the river and there being no means for taking such inflow up to the point

     of water works from where the drinking water supply would be made to

     the citizens of Vidisha, there is a likelihood of serious health hazard by

     consuming such polluted water.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.   We have perused the reply submitted by the MP State Pollution Control

     Board. The MPPCB has, so far as the factual position is concerned,

     accepted the fact that the storm water drain, to some extent, may carry

     untreated sewage and as per the present DPR, there is no provision for

     construction of any sewage treatment plant for checking untreated water

     including the sewage from entering the river Betwa as the existing

     sewage treatment plant is on the other side of the river which would not

     be of any use so far as the present storm water drain, under construction,

     is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.   This factual position is not in dispute and it is also not disputed that the

     above concern of the Applicant has not been taken into account while

     preparing the DPR for the construction of storm water drain as per the

     existing DPR. Therefore, we are of the view that the project would

     require the reconsideration and re-examination so as to seek the opinion

     of the MPPCB regarding the apprehensions which have been raised by

     the Applicant more particularly of allowing inflow of untreated sewage

     into the storm water drain and thereby enter into the river Betwa

     upstream the site of the water supply for the city of Vidisha.



</p><p id="p_8">                                                                           Page 3
</p><p id="p_9"> 6.   It was given out that while the construction work has commenced in

     accordance with the work order that has been issued for the construction

     of storm water drain, however, due to onset of the monsoon presently the

     work has been stopped and only about 15% of the work has been

     completed so far.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.   From the reply of the MPPCB also we would find that provisions with

     regard to the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

     more particularly provisions contained under <a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_2">Section 24</a>, <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_3">25</a> and <a href="/doc/61665724/" id="a_4">26</a> are

     required to be looked into as also the requirement for setting up of the

     sewage treatment plant in the present case at the suitable point alongwith

     the storm water drain to prevent untreated sewage from entering the river

     Betwa at the upstream point before the drinking water is drawn from the

     river.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.   We       would   accordingly   direct   that   the   Municipal    Council

     Vidisha/Respondent No. 5 shall resubmit its DPR to the Regional Office

     of the MPPCB at Bhopal and the MPPCB shall within four weeks

     examine the same with their suggestion in consultation with the

     Municipal Council for checking the inflow of untreated sewage into the

     storm water drain and thereby into the river and also setting up of

     sewage treatment plant at a proper location.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.   Since this requirement was necessarily to have been taken care of in the

     beginning itself, while finalising the DPR, and before the work was

     actually commenced, we would further direct that any additional

     cost/funds that may be required by the Municipal Council shall be made

     available by the State Government in this behalf so that the project is

     completed within a reasonable time frame without delay.


</p><p id="p_13">                                                                         Page 4
</p><p id="p_14"> 10.   Within four weeks, the MPPCB shall examine the matter with their

      suggestions and forward the same to the Municipal Council which in

      turn shall approach the State for any necessary approval including

      financial sanctions in this behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_15">11.   As regards the complaint of the Applicant with regard to Respondent No.

      6 is concerned, we find from the reply of the MPPCB, in Para No. 8 the

      aforesaid Respondent Industry, M/s Satya Sai Agro Oils (Pvt.) Ltd. has

      applied for the necessary consent and has got valid consent both under

      both the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>s. It was also submitted that continuous

      monitoring of the water and air samples at the site is being taken up and

      even the last inspection carried out on 21.03.2013 and 16.05.2014 do not

      show pollutants beyond the permissible limits. It was also submitted that

      necessary safeguards with regard to measures which are required to be

      taken under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a> have been taken and equipment

      installed by the Respondent No. 6.
</p>
<p id="p_16">12.   In view of the aforesaid, we would only direct that regular monitoring of

      the site and discharge from the plant of the Respondent No. 6 shall be

      carried out and Respondent No. 6 shall also take all necessary steps

      which are required for the operation of the said mechanism so that no

      effluent discharge without being treated is allowed to pollute the water as

      apprehended by the Applicant. We may also note that it was submitted

      by Respondent No. 6 that for augmenting their requirement of water at

      the plant they will also take suitable measures for utilisation of grey

      water after the same has been treated at the ETP so as to reduce the

      drawing up of the ground water and consumption of fresh water.




</p><p id="p_17">                                                                           Page 5
</p><p id="p_18"> 13.   It is also submitted that the Respondent No. 6 shall be undertaking

      extensive plantation programme within their premises in consultation

      with the MPPCB and complete within four weeks. The Respondent No.

      6 also undertakes that they would submit their Corporate Social

      Responsibility (CSR) Plan to the Regional Office, MPPCB and take up

      works for the same in consultation with the MPPCB as well as the

      Municipal Council, Vidisha.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.   Having said so, we would give liberty to the Applicant that in case the

      Applicant at any point of time feels aggrieved by any action on the part

      of the Respondent No. 6, the Applicant would be free to approach the

      Tribunal in this matter.
</p>
<p id="p_20">15.   One of the issues which have been raised in the petition and for which

      relief has been sought by the Applicant pertains to the encroachment by

      the Brick Kilns owners manufacturing bricks along the banks of river

      Betwa which is not only an encroachment but also having an adverse

      effect so far as the river and quality of water is concerned. We would

      accordingly direct the Respondent No. 4, District Collector, Vidisha to

      have the entire area inspected, monitor and remove all the

      encroachments and ensure that no unauthorised brick kiln is allowed to

      operate along the river Betwa and also ensure that in case there are any

      licences granted to such brick kilns, the terms and conditions of such

      licence are complied with.      Such of the brick kilns which are

      unauthorised or do not have any valid licence shall be removed

      forthwith.
