opposite party No.1-Union of India, represented through its Secretary,

Ministry of Environment and Forests seeking environmental clearance for

the said project. On 07.06.2003, Sterlite entered into a Memorandum of

Understanding (for short, "MOU") with the Government of Orissa for setting

up of the IMTPA Alumina Refinery and 3MTPA of Bauxite mining facilities

as well as for the installation of a 4 x 25 MW captive power plant, at an

aggregate investment of Rs.4000 crores. On 22.09.2004, opposite party

No.1-Union of India granted its approval for setting up of the said project

subject to the conditions stipulated in the said letter. On 14.09.2006,

opposite party No.1 issued the EIA Notification, 2006 which was in super

cession of the earlier Notification of 1994.

20.02.2008, the petitioner gave a representation to the Members of the

Expert Appraisal Committee (Industry) at the 78th meeting at New Delhi in

respect of the Terms of Reference (for short, "TOR") for clearance. The

proposal pertained to the expansion of the Alumina Refinery from 1MTPA to

6 MTPA. On 12.03.2008, opposite party No.1 issued TOR for preparation of

the Environment Impact Assessment Report (for short, "EIAR") as also the

Environment Management Plan Report by the petitioner. On 28.03.2008,

the Board of Directors passed a resolution in-principle for approval of the

expansion projects. On 03.11.2008, opposite party No.2 accorded consent

to the petitioner to operate, which was valid up to 31.03.2009. With an

objective of taking stock of the situation, opposite party No.2 carried out an

inspection of the Project and its premises between 03-05.12.2008,

subsequent to which a report was submitted. The report recorded the

preventive and remedial measures undertaken by the petitioner and

recommended certain other steps to be taken to mitigate the issue of

pollution. The report also noted that construction for the expansion of the

existing project had commenced. On 13.11.2008, the petitioner addressed a

letter to the Managing Director, Industrial Promotion and Investment

Corporation of Orissa Limited (for short, "IPICOL") seeking approval and

clearance of the expansion project under the single window policy of the

Government of Orissa in respect of foreign investment required for the said

expansion. On 17.12.2008, the petitioner addressed another letter to the

Managing Director, IPICOL furnishing further details as sought for by

stoppage of construction work with regard to the expansion project. On

29.01.2009, the petitioner filed its reply in response to notice dated

12.01.2009 issued by opposite party No.2 with a status report.

</p><p id="p_11">4.          On 21.03.2009, opposite party No.1 issued an advertisement

in two local newspapers about the public hearing to be held on 25.04.2009

in compliance with the EIA Notification, 2006 for grant of environmental

clearance for the expansion of the said project. On 30/31.03.2009, opposite

party no.2 conducted an inspection of the petitioner's project and recorded

the petitioner's consent to operate conditions prescribed by opposite party

No.2 and the petitioner's compliance in respect of the same. This pertains

to the existing projects. On 12.05.2009, the Member Secretary of opposite

party No.2 forwarded to the Secretary of opposite party No.1, a copy of the

proceeding of the public hearing conducted on 25.04.2009 in respect of the

proposed expansion. According to the petitioner, the said proceedings

certified that the overall opinion of the public was favourable towards the

expansion project.
</p>
<p id="p_12">5.          In May, 2009, subsequent to the public hearing and the

approval received at such hearing, the petitioner commenced construction

activities of the proposed expansion project. On 17.08.2009, the petitioner

submitted final EIA report to opposite party No.1. On 22.06.2009, the same

was placed before the EAC at its meeting. At the said meeting the

Committee sought additional information and also decided that a sub-

committee comprising members from the EAC shall visit the plant site in

order to assess the pollution control measures being adopted in the existing

Alumina Refinery to be augmented and suggest additional pollution control

measures for the proposed expansion project. On 31.08.2009, the minutes

of the meeting of the Expert Appraisal Committee held during 17-

18.08.2009 were approved by the Chairman of the Committee.

</p><p id="p_13">6.            On 01.09.2009, opposite party No.1 sought certain additional

information from the petitioner in the report of the proposed expansion

project. On 09.10.2009, opposite party No.1 sent another reminder letter to

the petitioner seeking required information. On 13.10.2009, the petitioner

responded to the above letters of opposite party No.1 and furnished all the

information sought, inter alia, clarifying that the show cause notices issued

by opposite party No.2 had since been complied with and opposite party

No.2 issued the consent to operate which was valid up to 31.03.2011.

</p><p id="p_14">7.            On 31.12.2009, opposite party No.2 wrote to opposite party

No.1 upon certain issues raised by an NGO on the proposed expansion. On

29.01.2010, the petitioner wrote to opposite party No.1 stating its readiness

to receive the Sub-Committee of the EAC at the project site. On 16.02.2010,

opposite party No.2 conveyed its consent to establish under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_13">Section 25</a> of

the Act, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_14">Section 21</a> of the Act, 1981 and Rules framed

party No.1 inspected the plant site and reported that the petitioner had

carried out substantial construction relating to the expansion for which

environmental clearance was yet to be accorded by the Ministry. Out of the

14 mines from which Bauxite was to be sourced, only one mine, namely

KJST Iron Manganese and Bauxite Mines of M/s. S.N. Mohanty had

obtained the environmental clearance, vide the Ministry's letter dated

28.01.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_17">9.             On 09.07.2010, the Sub-Committee of the EAC visited the

petitioner's site of the proposed expansion project. On 16.08.2010, the

Saxena Committee submitted its report and highlighted the factum of

construction     undertaken   by   the       petitioner   without   obtaining   the

environment clearance as per the EIA Notification, 2006. On 19.08.2010,

opposite party No.2 issued a circular bearing No.J-11013/41/2006-I.A.II(I)

as a clarification with respect to the activities that could be undertaken

without prior environmental clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_18">10.            On 31.08.2010, opposite party No.1 issued a show cause

notice to the petitioner placing reliance on paragraphs 1 and 2 of the EIA

Notification, 2006 as to why the Term of Reference issued for the expansion

should not be withdrawn. On 15.09.2010, the petitioner replied to the

above show cause notice. On 21.09.2010, opposite party No.1 informed the

petitioner about the personal hearing fixed for 30.09.2010 and also sought

further information from the petitioner. On 30.09.2010, the petitioner

submitted additional information on the list of queries mentioned by opp.

party No.1 in its earlier letter dated 21.09.2010. On 03.09.2010, a meeting

was held between the petitioner and opposite party No.1, the details of

which were recorded in the form of minutes. On 04.10.2010, pursuant to

the meeting held on 30.09.2010, the petitioner submitted further

information with respect to the queries raised at the meeting. On

20.10.2010, opposite party No.1 issued directions to the petitioner whereby

the TOR were withdrawn and the petitioner was directed to maintain status

quo and to undertake no further construction. On 28.10.2010, the

petitioner replied to the above directions issued by opposite party No.1 but

there has been no response to the same from the Government. Hence, the

present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_19">11.          Mr. Sundaram, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the

petitioner submits that the show cause notice and impugned direction have

been passed by opposite party No.1 without any application of mind and

without consideration of submissions made by the petitioner and on

reliance of irrelevant materials. As the expansion project involves no change

in the process or technology or the product mix, but is merely in respect of

enhancement of capacity, the provisions of paragraph 1 and 7(ii) of the EIA

Notification, 2006 have no application. The existing process of low

temperature and low pressure digestion and Bayer's process technology

would continue to be utilized in the proposed expanded project and there

would be no change in respect of either the process or the technology or

product mix. As the petitioner's industry falls under Item 3(a) of the

Schedule of the EIA Notification, 2006, which deals with "Metallurgical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                         9</span>




Industries (ferrous and nonferrous), for which no threshold limits have

been prescribed and therefore, paragraph-2 of the EIA Notification, 2006

has no application. The environmental clearance was essential at the stage

of setting up and establishing the existing refinery, in respect of which,

clearance have been obtained from the authorities concerned. It is only in

response to an Office Memorandum issued by opposite party No.1 on

16.11.2010, stipulating a procedure for grant of Environmental clearance

for the alleged violations of the EIA Notification, 2006, the petitioner

without prejudice to its rights and contentions and its belief that it is not in

fact in violation of any of the environmental norms, applied under the said

Office Memorandum to the opposite party on 22.11.2010.                    Non-

consideration of the said application by the opposite parties caused

irreparable and irremediable hardship and loss to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_20">12.          Opposite party       No.1 in its direction dated October, 20,

2010 did not allege any irregularity either in the EIA report submitted by

the petitioner or in the public hearing conducted by the petitioner and as

such the withdrawal of the TOR and the cancellation of the public hearing

by opposite party No.1 was illegal and arbitrary. The petitioner in the

instant case has merely commenced construction activities and it is

submitted that "expansion" as contemplated in the EIA Notification, 2006,

would and could only be when the petitioner commences operations from

the proposed expanded unit, i.e., when the factory is operationalized. The

impugned directions violates the petitioner's fundamental rights under

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_15">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      10</span><p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">13.         In carrying out the activities for preparation of the expansion of

the project there has been no violation of any of the pollution norms. The

petitioner has obtained all the necessary clearances and permissions

essential for the proposed expansion. The site preparation work has started

in May, 2009, after the public hearing proceedings were concluded in

respect of the proposed expansion. The estimated capital expenditure for

the project is around Rs.10,000/- crores, of which a sum of Rs.5,000/-

crores has already been committed till date and the ordering of the plant

and machinery is nearing completion. The proposed expansion currently

generates employment for around 10,000 families directly and around

15,000 families indirectly in an area like Lanjigarh. The Hon'ble Supreme

Court in IA Nos.1324 &amp; 1474 in W.P.(C) No. 202 of 1995 and IA Nos.2081-

2082 in W.P.(C) No.549 of 2007 on the Bauxite Mining Project for the

Alumina refinery, Lanjigarh, has specifically noted that "we have a picture

of abject poverty in which the local people are living in Lanjigarh Tehsil

including the tribal people. There is no proper housing, hospitals, schools

and people are living in extremely poor conditions which is not in dispute.

Opposite party No.1 has committed grave injustice to the petitioner in

withdrawing the TOR at the proposed site. The basic objective of the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 is to ensure that adequate safeguard had

been placed to prevent environment pollution and degradation of the

environment through a process of sustainable development.

</p><p id="p_23">14.         The petitioner's existing Alumina Refinery has adopted state of

the Art Technologies in all its areas of operation and became the first
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      11</span>




Alumina Refinery in the country and among the few in the world to

successfully implement the Zero Discharge System. The petitioner has

always complied with the conditions, guidelines or instructions issued from

time to time by the regulatory bodies like opposite parties herein as also

other Central and State Authorities. No compromise is made in design

procurement and operation in achieving the basic objective of the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_17">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986. The construction activities were not in

violation of the EIA Notification, 2006 or there has been no violation of any

of the pollution parameters. The petitioner has all along submitted six

monthly reports of the surrounding environmental conditions to opposite

party No.2 in respect of the existing project. These reports would go to

substantiate the stand of the petitioner that there has been no violation of

any of the pollution parameters at the existing refinery or as a result of the

construction activities undertaken with respect to the proposed expansion.

By issuing the impugned show cause notice and subsequent directions,

opposite parties committed a grave error and injustice in depriving the

petitioner of its legitimate expectation of setting up the proposed expansion

plan in respect of which all the necessary approvals and sanctions have

been accorded. Opposite parties are barred by the doctrine of promissory

estoppel in respect of the impugned actions, inasmuch as based on the

approvals granted by the authorities concerned as also the mute silence in

respect of the construction activities despite being aware of the same.

</p><p id="p_24">15.          Basing on the TOR issued to the petitioner, the petitioner has

undertaken large scale actions in order to ensure compliance with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       12</span>




same. The objections and submissions made by the petitioner in respect of

the allegations made in the show cause notice were not taken into

consideration by opposite party No.1 while passing the impugned directions

dated 20.10.2010. The show cause notice issued on 31.08.2010 was

defective since it was ambiguous and not clear with regard to the area of

violation by the petitioner as per paragraphs 1 and 2 of the EIA Notification,

2006. The petitioner being an environmentally conscious company, uses

caustic soda manufactured by Membrane Technology. The petitioner is

actively working on the "Zero Waste Concept" and has already commenced

manufacturing red mud, bricks by developing a process in collaboration

with the Institute of Minerals and Metals Technology, Bhubaneswar. The

petitioner uses state of the art technology like pipe conveyors for materials

movement, dry fog system for dust suppression, bag filters for dust

collection, wet scrubbing system for lime handling and has also maintained

and is further developing the green belt within the plant as also around the

periphery. The petitioner provides a rehabilitation colony with hospital and

schools for the rehabilitated villagers as well as the local population from

other villages. At the hospitals, medical treatment is provided free of cost.

Kalahandi is the most backward region in Orissa and in Kalahandi itself,

Lanjigarh is the latest developed. The lone project set up by the petitioner at

the site has had a major impact in eradicating poverty and is providing

opportunities to the poor and most deprived tribal population of the area to

merge into mainstream.

behalf of opposite party No.1 submits that on 3rd August, 2007, the

petitioner submitted an application under the provisions of EIA Notification,

2006 to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (opposite party No.1) for

expansion of alumina refinery capacity and captive power plant from 1 to 6

MTPA and from 75 to 300 MW respectively at Lanjigarh in the district of

Kalahandi in Orissa. After following the due procedure, the TOR for

preparation of EIA/Environment Management Plan (EMP) report including

conducting public hearing was prescribed by the Ministry on 12th March,

2008. The petitioner submitted the final report vide letter dated 22 nd June

2009 after completing the public hearing which was held on 25 th April,

2009 for seeking environmental clearance. The proposal was placed before

the Expert Appraisal Committee in its meeting held on 17th August, 2009

and the Committee sought additional information and also decided that a

sub-committee comprising members from the Expert Appraisal Committee

shall visit the plant site to assess the pollution control measures being

adopted in the refinery to be augmented and suggest additional pollution

control measures to be adopted for the proposed expansion and hence, the

proposal was deferred.

<p id="p_27">17.         The Ministry of Environment and Forest was informed by its

Eastern Regional Office at Bhubaneswar about the construction which was

undertaken by the petitioner before obtaining the environmental clearance

in violation of provisions of EIA Notification, 2006. The report of the Sub-

Committee of the Expert Appraisal Committee (Industry) who visited the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                     14</span>




site on 9th July, 2010 brought out that the petitioner has undertaken

substantial construction of 6 MTPA Alumina Refinery and 300 MW Captive

Power Plant. Dr. N.C. Saxena Committee brought out in its report dated

16.08.2010 that the petitioner had already proceeded with the construction

activity for its expansion from 1 MTPA to 6 MTPA without obtaining

environmental clearance. From their own submission, the petitioner had

confirmed that they have already completed 50-55% construction activity.

According to the petitioner, they had started construction activity in May,

2009 immediately after the public hearing which was over in April, 2009.

However, record of opposite party No.1 indicates that the construction for

expansion project was noticed in November, 2008. Opposite party No.1

issued show cause notice dated 31st August, 2010 for expansion of Alumina

Refinery and Captive Power plant.

directions were issued in accordance with <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_20">Section 5</a> of the Environment

(Protection) Act, 1986. The directions were issued on 20.10.2010 and TOR

issued on 12th March, 2009 for expansion of Alumina Refinery from 1 MTPA

to 6 MTPA and 75 MW to 300 MW CPP was withdrawn and consequently

the public hearing conducted on 25th April, 2009 was also cancelled. The

opposite parties were directed to maintain the status quo at the site and no

further construction shall be undertaken in respect of expansion of project.

The Secretary, Forest and Environment Department, Government of Orissa

was directed to take legal action under the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_21">Environment

(Protection) Act</a>, 1986 for violation of the EIA Notification, 2006.

</p><p id="p_31">21.          The petitioner vide letter No.VAL/MK/MOEF/10/010 dated

28.10.2010 requested opposite party No.1 for withdrawal of direction issued

under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_22">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 on 20th September, 2010 and

consideration of proposal for environmental clearance for expansion project.

The petitioner's matter was examined with reference to the Circular No.J-

11013/41/2006-IA.II (I) dated 16th November, 2010 issued by opposite

party No.1. Paragraph-4(i) of the Circular dated 16th November, 2010 issued

by the Ministry envisages that all such cases of violation which are

submitted to the Ministry/State Environmental Impact Assessment

Authorities for environmental clearance would be referred to the Expert

Appraisal   Committee/State      Expert    Appraisal     Committee     for   their

consideration based on the merit of the proposal. It is further envisaged

that after the said Committee makes its recommendations on the project,

the proposal will be processed on file for obtaining the approval of the

Competent Authority of the Ministry.
</p>
<p id="p_32">22.          The petitioner was further intimated that any consideration of

the fresh proposal for environmental clearance to be submitted by the

company shall not be construed as regularization/condonation of violation

of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_23">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and EIA Notification, 2006 which

took place due to undertaking of substantial construction activity without

prior environmental clearance by the company.
</p>
<p id="p_33">23.          Mr. Das submitted that opposite party No.1 does not agree

that on principle, approval of the petitioner's proposal was impliedly

granted. The Expert Committee in its meeting held on 31.08.2009 decided

to inspect the site to assess the pollution control measures being adopted

in the existing Alumina refinery and sought additional information. Since

appraisal of the project was not completed, the argument of the petitioner

that the environmental clearance would have been granted to the petitioner

within 45 days of the receipt of the recommendation of the Expert Appraisal

Committee, which in the instant case ought to have been granted by the

EAC within 45 days of 31 August, 2009, is not in line with the EIA

Notification, 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_34">24.          The petitioner did not indicate about the starting of

construction work while it applied for TOR and also in the EIA/EMP

appraisal process was not completed. As the petitioner violated the

provisions of EIA Notification, 2016 and final directions were issued to it

for withdrawal of Term of Reference issued in March, 2009 and

cancellation of public hearing held on 25th April, 2009. The process for

environmental clearance has to be started de novo. Therefore, the

petitioner vide letter dated 11.01.2011 was requested to submit fresh

proposal to the Ministry for obtaining environmental clearance for the

above project under the procedure laid down in EIA Notification, 2006.

<p id="p_37">27.          Admittedly, the EIA Notification, 2006 was published in the

Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part-II, Ministry of Environment and

Forests on 14th September, 2006. On 03.10.2007 the petitioner submitted

its application to opposite party No.1 for expansion of the project from 1

MTPA to 6 MTPA Alumina and power generation from 75 MW to 300 MW.

In Paragraph (1) of the EIA Notification, 2006, it is provided that the Central

Government directs that on and from the date of its publication, the

required construction of new projects or activities or the expansion or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                        20</span>

</p><p id="p_39">28.               In the instant case, the petitioner undertakes expansion of its

existing project for which prior environmental clearance has to be obtained.

</p><p id="p_40">29.               A conjoint reading of Paragraphs 1, 2 and 7(ii) of the EIA

Notification, 2006 makes it clear that the provisions contained in those

clauses of the said notification are applicable to the expansion project of the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_41">30.               Question Nos.(ii), (iii) and (iv) being interlinked, are dealt with

together.
</p>
<p id="p_42">31.               Admittedly, in the instant case, while the process for issuance

of environmental clearance was going on, and for that purpose various

directions were being issued to the petitioner for compliance, the petitioner

started     its    expansion    work.      According    to   the   petitioner,   prior

environmental clearance is not the pre-requisite or the precondition for

undertaking construction activities within an existing premise as the

environmental clearance has already been obtained in respect of the

existing project. The opposite parties were aware of sight preparation work

undertaken by the petitioner since November, 2006 and yet the opposite

party No.1 sought to issue the show cause notice almost two years later

and in the meanwhile impliedly permitting the petitioner to continue its

construction activities and investment of money. The petitioner has

invested huge sums of money and has thereby altered its position

irreversibly. It is the further case of the petitioner that alteration position is

irremediable and irreversible and the stoppage of work at this stage would

cause grave prejudice and irreparable hardship to the petitioner, incapable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                       22</span>




of being calculated in terms of money. The opposite party No.1 has ignored

the three objects sought to be achieved by <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_27">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,

1986, viz., protection of the environment, controlling of pollution as also the

sustainable   development     of   the     area.   The   petitioner   being   an

environmentally conscious Company, uses Caustic soda manufactured by

Membrance Technology. It is actively working on the "Zero Waste Concept"

and has already commenced manufacturing red mud bricks by developing

a process in collaboration with the Institute of Minerals and Metals

Technology, Bhubaneswar. It has taken precautions, right from the

conceptual stage of the project to ensure that the fugitive emissions during

construction and operations remain well within the applicable norms. The

petitioner uses state of the art technology like pipe conveyors for material

movement, dry fog system for dust suppression, bag filters for dust filters/

for dust collection, wet scrubbing system for lime handling and has also

maintained and is further developing the green belt within the plant as also

around the periphery. It also provides a rehabilitation colony with hospital

and schools for the rehabilitated villagers as well as the local population

from other villages, whereby, at the hospitals, medical treatment is provided

free of cost. The project set up by the petitioner at the site has had a major

impact in eradicating poverty and is providing opportunities to the poor and

most deprived tribal population of the area to merge into the mainstream.

The petitioner has not violated any of the pollution parameters at the

existing refinery or as a result of the construction activity undertaken with

respect to the proposed expansion.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                       23</span><p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">32.          Further case of the petitioner is that opposite party No.1 has

singled out the petitioner only for non-grant of approvals and clearances. In

case of other entities, namely, (i) Jindal Power Limited, Tammar, Raigarh,

Chattisgarh, (ii) Pohang Steel Company, (iii) Lavasa Corporation Limited,

and (iv) Steel Authority of India, Chiria Iron Ore Mines Project despite

violations of environmental regime being found and established, the MoEF

has sought to condone / regularize the same and has proceeded to grant

the requisite clearances / permissions to the said entities. It is alleged that

those actions of the MoEF are arbitrary, discriminatory, without any

rational nexus and are violative of the rights enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_28">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_45">33.          On the other hand, opposite party No.1 denying the above

allegation of the petitioner submitted that the case of the above four

companies and the petitioner are not similar. The petitioner has not applied

for the expansion project following the due procedure as is required in the

EIA Notification, 2006, as has been done by Jindal Power Limited. As and

when a proposal is submitted by the petitioner a similar procedure would

be followed as in the case of Jindal Power Limited. Similarly, the case of the

petitioner and Lavasa Corporation Limited are also not alike as the show

cause notice issued to Lavasa Corporation Limited was due to violations of

EIA Notification, 2006 and the construction work has been stopped. This is

a category 'B' under EIA Notification, 2006 and the due procedure is being

followed for appraisal of the project of M/s Lavasa Corporation Limited as

per the directions of MoEF on 07.01.2011. The project of M/s POSCO was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                      24</span>




accorded environmental clearance in 15th May, 2007 only the additional

conditions have been stipulated vide letter dated 31st January, 2011. The

case of POSCO is not a case of violation of EIA Notification, 2006 and the

EC issued in 2007 is not withdrawn. Similarly, project of SAIL about Chiria

Mines relates to Forest Advisory Committee, which has taken up the project

for clearance under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_29">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1986. Thus, this project at

present is not related to the EIA Notification, 2006 and therefore no

violation proceedings are being pursued by the Ministry in the case of SAIL.

</p><p id="p_46">34.         The specific case of opposite party No.1 is that the petitioner

vide letter dated 22 June, 2009 submitted the final EIA report after

completion of the public hearing which was held on 25 th April, 2009

seeking environmental clearance. The proposal of the petitioner was

placed before the Expert Appraisal Committee in its meeting held on 17th

August, 2009 and the Committee sought additional information and also

decided that a sub-committee comprising members from the Expert

Appraisal Committee shall visit the plant site to assess the pollution

control measures being adopted in the refinery to be augmented and

suggested additional pollution control measures to be adopted for the

proposed expansion.
</p>
<p id="p_47">35.         In the meantime, the Ministry of Environment and Forests

was informed by its Eastern Regional Office at Bhubaneswar about the

construction which was undertaken by the petitioner before obtaining

the environmental clearance in violation of provisions of EIA Notification,

2006. The report of the Sub-committee of the Expert Appraisal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                      25</span>




Committee (Industry) who visited the site on 9th July, 2010 brought out

that the Petitioner has undertaken substantial construction of 6 MTPA

Alumina Refinery and 300 MW Captive Power Plant. Dr.N.C.Saxena

Committee brought out in its report dated 16.08.2010 that the petitioner

had already proceeded with the construction activity for its expansion

from 1 MTPA to 6 MTPA without obtaining environmental clearance. It is

their own submission that the petitioner had confirmed that it has

already completed 50-55% construction activity. The only difference is

while according to opposite party No.1, the construction for expansion

project was noticed in November, 2008, petitioner's case is that it has

started construction activities in May, 2009 immediately after the public

hearing was over in April, 2009. In any event, the fact remains that the

petitioner has completed about 50-55% of expansion work prior to

obtaining environmental clearance, which is violative of provisions of EIA

Notification, 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_48">36.         Law is well settled that when the statute requires to do certain

thing in certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all. Other

methods or mode of performance are impliedly and necessarily forbidden.

The aforesaid settled legal proposition is based on a legal maxim

"Expressio unius est exclusion alteris", meaning thereby that if a statute

provides for a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it has to be

done in that manner and in no other manner and following other course

is not permissible. (See Taylor v. Taylor, (1876) 1 Ch.D.426; Nazir Ahmed

v. King Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253; <a href="/doc/1104087/" id="a_30">Ram Phal Kundu v. Kamal Sharma</a>;

and Indian Bank's <a href="/doc/1916813/" id="a_31">Association v. Devkala Consultancy Service</a>, AIR 2004

SC 2615).
</p>
<p id="p_49">37.         Moreover, the petitioner did not indicate the start of

construction work while it applied for Terms of Reference and also in the

EIA/EMP reports prepared for the expansion project.

</p><p id="p_50">38.         The stand of the petitioner that it has not violated any of the

pollution parameters in the existing refinery will not alter the position

because the petitioner is legally bound to ensure the various statutory

provisions. That cannot give licence to the petitioner to undertake

expansion activities without obtaining prior environmental clearance.
