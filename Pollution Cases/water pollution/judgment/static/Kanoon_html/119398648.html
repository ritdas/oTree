04/Dated: 13th March, 2014
</pre><p id="p_3">     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for
the State.
</p><p id="p_4">     Petitioners are apprehending their arrest in connection with the
case registered under <a href="/doc/112147/" id="a_1">Sections 21</a> of the Mines &amp; Mineral (Development
&amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957, <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Air Pollution Act, 1981 and
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_5">26</a> of the Water Pollution Act, 1974 .
</p><p id="p_5">     Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the
petitioners have been falsely implicated in this case; that the petitioner
No.2 is a sleeping partner of the alleged brick kiln; that the petitioner
No.1 had deposited the royalty amount of Rs. 45,658/- as per Annexure-2
and the same was accepted by the District Mining Officer as per
Annexure-2/1; that he had also applied for obtaining the N.O.C to the
Pollution Control Board, which was also received on 10.09.2012; that the
petitioners have not violated any provisions under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Pollution Control
Act</a> or under the Jharkhand Mines &amp; Mineral (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Regulation)
Act</a>; that they have been implicated with an ulterior motive.
</p><p id="p_6">     Learned A.P.P while opposing the prayer for bail of the petitioners,
has submitted that as per Annexure-2/1 shows that the petitioner No.1
had deposited the royalty amount after lodging of the F.I.R. and N.O.C.
has not been granted by the Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_7">     Considering the fact that amount was deposited by the petitioner
after lodging of the F.I.R and there is no N.O.C. from the Pollution
Control Board for the brick kiln, I do not find it to be a fit case for
granting bail to the petitioner No.1. Accordingly, the anticipatory bail
application of the petitioner No.1, namely, Manoj Kumar is hereby
rejected.
</p><p id="p_8">     Petitioner No.1 is directed to surrender in the Court below in
connection with Katkamsandi (Pelawal O.P.) P.S. Case No. 53 of 2013,
corresponding to G.R. No. 709 of 2013, pending in the Court of Judicial
Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribagh and Court below shall consider that the
petitioner No.1 had deposited the royalty amount and had also applied for
N.O.C. to the Pollution Control Board and pass necessary order without
being prejudiced.
</p><p id="p_9">                So far as the petitioner No.2 is concerned, it is evident that he is a
       sleeping partner of the said brick kiln, the petitioner No.2, namely,
       Santosh Kumar is directed to surrender in the Court below within two
       weeks from the date of this order and in the event of his arrest or
       surrender the Court below shall enlarge the him on bail on furnishing bail
       bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand) with two sureties of the like
       amount each to the satisfaction of Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class,
       Hazaribagh in connection with Katkamsandi (Pelawal O.P.) P.S. Case No.
       53 of 2013 corresponding to G.R. No. 709 of 2013, subject to the
       conditions as laid down under <a href="/doc/1692057/" id="a_8">Section 438(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C.
