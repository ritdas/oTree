                   WP(C).No. 32657 of 2008
            ---------------------------------------------
          Dated this the 18th day of August, 2009.

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Grievance of the petitioners is that the 4th respondent

company is functioning without obtaining         proper licence and

consent from the first respondent       Grama Panchayat and the

second respondent State Pollution Control Board, in a manner

causing nuisance and health hazards to the petitioners and their

family members.     The allegation is that inspite of repeated

complaints the authorities of the Panchayat and the State

Pollution Control Board are not taking any effective steps for

preventing the 4th respondent from continuing with their illegal

functioning.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   Ext.R4(a) is the licence issued by the first respondent

Panchayat for the year 2007-08, which was valid upto

31.3.2008. According to the 4th respondent renewal of licence

was not granted inspite of applications made in this regard.

Ext.R4(d) is the "consent to operate" issued by the second

respondent, under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_1">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC.32657/2008                   2</span>

The said consent was valid upto 30.6.2009. Learned Standing

Counsel appearing for the second respondent on instructions

submitted that inspite of application for renewal submitted by the

4th respondent no renewal is granted because of pendency of this

writ petition. Learned counsel appearing for the 4th respondent

submitted that the authorities of the second respondent Board

had already conducted inspection on the basis of application for

renewal    submitted   and   they    were    satisfied  about  the

precautionary measures taken for averting any apprehended

nuisance.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. Contention of the petitioner is that the 4th respondent is

not entitled to continue functioning because the Panchayat had

not renewed the licence.         It is an admitted fact that the

industry of the 4th respondent is situated in a declared industrial

area promoted by the Governmental agency, SIDCO.           On that

basis the 4th respondent contended that the industry is outside

the purview of the provisions of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act

1994. Learned counsel had pointed out a Division Bench decision

of this court in <a href="/doc/660425/" id="a_3">Pepsico India Holdings Limited vs. State of

Kerala</a> (2007(2) KLT 835), in which this court found that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC.32657/2008                   3</span>

industrial areas declared by the State Government will fall outside

the purview of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act 1994, in view of

<a href="/doc/930156/" id="a_4">section 1(2)</a> of the said Act, and consequently the Panchayat

cannot exercise any power with respect to issuance of licence to

any industries situated within the premise of an industrial area

declared by the State Government. Therefore it is clear that the

4th respondent Industry being situated in an industrial area is

outside the purview of the Kerala panchayat Raj Act 1994 and

notwithstanding non-renewal of the licence by the first

respondent Panchayat they are entitled to function the industry.

</p><p id="p_4">     4. Learned counsel for the petitioners points out that even

in cases of industrial unit situated within any declared industrial

area licence/registration under the provisions of the Industrial

Single   Window     Clearance    Board   &amp;    Industrial  Township

Development Act 1999 (Ker.) need be obtained.         Contention of

the 4th respondent is     that the unit was established prior to

enactment of the said legislation and therefore they could not get

registration/licence under the provisions of the said Act.

</p><p id="p_5">     5. As stated above, it is evident that the consent to operate

obtained by the 4th respondent stood expired as on 30.6.2009.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC.32657/2008                     4</span>

According to second respondent the consent was not renewed

because of pendency of this writ petition. The unit cannot be

functioned without consent to operate obtained from the second

respondent. Therefore it is obligatory on the part of the second

respondent    to take a decision as to whether the consent to

operate granted to the 4th respondent is liable to be renewed or

not.     Since the application for renewal has already been

submitted and the required formalities had already been complied

with they are entitled to continue functioning of the unit under

the deeming provisions contained in the relevant statute, is the

contention of the 4th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. Under the above circumstances it is only just and proper

in the interest of justice to direct the second respondent to take a

final decision with respect to renewal of "consent to operate",

considering the factual situation prevailing at the premises of the

4th respondent and after hearing objection if any of the

petitioners.  The second respondent will also take note of the

requirement for registration under the provisions of the

Industrial Single Window Clearance Board &amp; Industrial township

<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_5">Development Act</a> 1999 with respect to functioning of the 4th

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC.32657/2008                  5</span>

respondent's industry.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     7.   Hence the writ petition is disposed of directing the 4th

respondent to take a final decision with respect to renewal of

Ext.R4(d) consent, within a period of two months from the date

of receipt of a copy of this judgment, after affording an

opportunity   of   hearing  to   the   petitioners, taking   into

consideration of the observations made above.</p><pre id="pre_2">
