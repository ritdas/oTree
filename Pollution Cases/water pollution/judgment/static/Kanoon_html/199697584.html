ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.	The
present Criminal Miscellaneous Application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the
Code of Criminal Procedure has been preferred by the
applicants-original accused to quash and set aside the impugned
Complaint, being Criminal Case No. 1812/1986 pending in the Court of
learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ankleshwar filed by
respondent no. 2-original complainant - Gujarat Pollution
Control Board, Gandhinagar for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_2">Sections
25</a>, <a href="/doc/521753/" id="a_3">26</a> read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_4">Section 44</a> of the Water (Prevention of Control of
Pollution) Act, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.	Shri
Paresh Dave, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants
has stated at the bar that so far as the applicants nos. 1 and 2 are
concerned they have expired.  Under the circumstances, the present
Criminal Miscellaneous Application is dismissed has having been
abated so far as applicants nos. 1 and 2 are concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.	Now
so far as applicants nos. 3 to 5 -original accused nos. 6, 7 and 8
are concerned, it is submitted by Shri Dave, learned advocate
appearing on behalf of the remaining applicants that at the relevant
time this Court admitted the present application considering the
decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of M/S. Nicosulf
Industries &amp; Exports Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr Vs. State of Gujarat &amp;
Anr. reported in 2002 (2) GLH 1580.  Shri Paresh Dave,
learned advocate appearing on behalf of the applicants has fairly
conceded that the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of
M/S. Nicosulf Industries &amp; Exports Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr (Supra)
was carried to the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble Supreme in
the case of Gujarat Pollution Control Board Vs. Nicosulf
Industries &amp; Exports Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. reported in 2009
(2) SCC 171 has upheld the contention on behalf of the Gujarat
Pollution Control Board and has not accepted the decision of this
Court in the case of M/S. Nicosulf Industries &amp; Exports Pvt.
Ltd. &amp; Anr (Supra) so far as the Complaint filed by the
Officer of the Board under the authority of the Chairman and,
therefore, it is fairly conceded that the ground on which the
Criminal Miscellaneous Application was admitted will not survive.  So
far as other submissions pointed out in the application are all the
defenses of the applicants, which are required to be considered at
the time of trial and, therefore, it is requested to make suitable
observation that whatever defenses,which may be available to them,
under the law are kept open, which be considered at the time of
trial.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.	In
view of the subsequent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported
in Gujarat Pollution Control Board (Supra), the present
application deserves to be dismissed, so far as the contention on
behalf of the applicants with respect to the authorization of the
complainant who has filed the Complaint, and is accordingly
dismissed.  However, it is observed that whatever other defenses,
which might be available to the applicants, available under the law
are kept open, which be considered by the learned Magistrate in
accordance with law and on its own merits at the time of trial
(except the question of authorization of the complainant who has file
the Complaint).  Rule is discharged.  Ad-interim relief granted
earlier, if any, stands vacated forthwith.
