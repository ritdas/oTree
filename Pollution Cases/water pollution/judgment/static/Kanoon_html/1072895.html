     The petitioner was granted a building permit to erect a Mobile

Telecommunication Tower. On completion of that Tower, the

Panchayat took the stand that the User Certificate cannot be issued

without the clearance of the Pollution Control Board.         By interim

order dated 15.2.2008, the structure is numbered, provisionally.



</p><p id="p_2">     2.   The Environmental Engineer is a party in this Writ Petition.

The Panchayat was not unjustified in its stand because the

Environmental Engineer had issued Ext.R1(a).            But, there is no

provision of law pointed out, requiring the clearance of the Pollution

Control Board, except in cases, where the activities of the Tower

would result in activities referable to the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_1">Air Act</a> or <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>. To

that extend, it is for the Pollution Control Board authorities to insist

on clearance, but not to scuttle the issuance of the permit. Therefore,

this Writ Petition is allowed, quashing the impugned Ext.P2 and

directing the Panchayat to grant User Certificate and permit the

petitioner to operate without prejudice to the powers of the

Pollution Control Board to take action, in accordance with law, if

found necessary.
