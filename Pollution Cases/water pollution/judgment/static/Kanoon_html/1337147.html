ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">[1]	The
present appeal, under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973, is directed against the judgment and order of acquittal dated
28.12.2006 passed by the learned 2nd Additional Senior
Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jungadh in Criminal
Case No.7370 of 1993, whereby the accused has been acquitted of the
charges under <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_2">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_3">25</a> and <a href="/doc/249603/" id="a_4">47</a> r/w. <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_5">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">44</a> of the
Prevention of Water (Pollution and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_7">Control) Act</a>, 1981, leveled
against them. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">[2]	The
brief facts of the prosecution case are that the accused are running
business of manufacturing Textile Dyes at Village : Sabalpur,
District: Junagadh. It is alleged that the accused are required to
follow the norms and parameters which are provided by Pollution
Control Board in respect of their industrial and domestic effluent. 
The effluents are required to be brought to the specific parameters
by giving certain treatment and then after only effluent can be
discharged to the drainage. It is alleged that the accused were found
discharging their effluent which was untreated and was hazardous to
mankind and to environment and agriculturists.  Thereafter, a sample
was drawn from the premises of the accused and the same was analyzed,
it was found beyond the parameters. On inspection  at the site and on
completion of investigation, the complaint came to be filed in the
Court of learned Judicial Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_3">[3]	Thereafter,
the trial was conducted before the learned Magistrate. The
prosecution examined the witnesses and also relied upon the oral as
well as documentary evidence. After considering the oral as well as
documentary evidence, the learned Magistrate acquitted the accused
from the charges alleged against them, vide judgment and order dated
28.12.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_4">[4]	Being
aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated
26.09.2008 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamnagar in
Criminal Case No.7370 of 1993, the appellant has preferred the above
mentioned Criminal Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">[5]	I
have heard learned advocate Mr.K L. Dave for the appellant and
learned APP Ms.Mini Nair for the respondent No.1. I have also gone
through the papers and the judgment and order passed by the trial
Court. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">[6]	Learned
advocate Mr.K. L. Dave for the appellant has taken me through the
evidence of witnesses and documentary evidence and submitted that
from the above, it is established that the accused have not
successfully proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. It was
contended by learned advocate for the appellant that the judgment and
order of the learned Magistrate is not proper, legal and it is
erroneous. He has vehemently argued that the learned trial Magistrate
has not considered the evidence of the witnesses and the oral as well
as documentary evidence produced on record. He has vehemently argued
that  learned Magistrate erred in discussing the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_8">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_9">23</a> of the said Act and, therefore, the judgment and
order of the trial Court is deserved to be quashed and set aside.
Learned advocate for the appellant has relied upon the order of this
Court [Coram: D. H. Waghela,J.] dated 24.09.2009 passed in Criminal
Appeal No.471 of 1997 and submitted that the judgment and order
passed by the trial Court is deserved to be quashed and set aside. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">[7]	It
was further contended by learned advocate for the appellant that the
judgment and order of the trial Court is against the provisions of
law; the trial Court has not properly considered the evidence led by
the prosecution and looking to the provisions of law itself it is
established that the prosecution has proved the whole ingredients of
the evidence against the present respondent. Learned advocate for the
appellant has also taken this court  through the oral as well  as the
entire documentary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_8">[8]	At
the outset it is required to be noted that the principles which would
govern and regulate the hearing of appeal by this Court against an
order of acquittal passed by the trial Court have been very
succinctly explained by the Apex Court in a catena of decisions. In
the case of
M.S. Narayana Menon @ Mani Vs. State of Kerala &amp; Anr, reported in
(2006)6 SCC, 39,
the Apex Court has narrated
about the powers of the High Court in appeal against the order
of acquittal. In para 54 of the decision, the Apex Court has observed
as under:
</p>
<p id="p_9"> 54.
 In any event the High Court entertained an appeal treating to be an
appeal against acquittal, it was in fact exercising the revisional
jurisdiction. Even while exercising an appellate power against a
judgment of acquittal, the High Court should have borne in mind the
well-settled principles of law that where two view are possible, the
appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal
recorded by the court below. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">[9]	Further,
in the case of Chandrappa
Vs. State of Karnataka, reported in (2007)4 SCC 415
the Apex Court laid down the following principles:
</p>
<p id="p_11"> 42.	From
the above decisions, in our considered view, the following general
principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with
an appeal against an order of acquittal emerge:
</p>
<p id="p_12">[1]	An
appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider
the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.
</p>
<p id="p_13">[2]<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10">	The
Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or
condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the
evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of
fact and of law.
</p>
<p id="p_14">[3]	Various
expressions, such as,  substantial and compelling reasons ,  good
and sufficient grounds ,  very strong circumstances ,
 distorted conclusions ,  glaring mistakes , etc. are not
intended to curtain extensive powers of an appellate court in an
appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature
of  flourishes of language  to emphasis the reluctance of an
appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power
of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own
conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_15">[4]	An
appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal
there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the
presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental
principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be
presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent
court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the
presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and
strengthened by the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">[5]	If
two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence
on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of
acquittal recorded by the trial court. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">[10]	Thus,
it is a settled principle that while exercising appellate power, even
if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the
evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the
finding  of acquittal recorded by the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_18">[11]	Even
in a recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_11">State
of Goa V. Sanjay Thakran &amp; Anr. Reported</a> in (2007)3 SCC 75,
the  Court has reiterated the powers of the High Court in such cases.
In para 16 of the said decision the Court has observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_19"> 16.	From
the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that while exercising the
powers in appeal against the order of acquittal the Court of appeal
would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal unless the
approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest illegality
and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by any
reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be characterized
as perverse. Merely because two views are possible, the Court of
appeal would not take the view which would upset the judgment
delivered by the  Court below. However, the appellate court has a
power to review the evidence if it is of the view that the conclusion
arrived at by the Court below is perverse and the Court has committed
a manifest error of law and ignored the material evidence on record.
A duty is cast upon the appellate court, in such circumstances, to
re-appreciate the evidence to arrive to a just decision on the basis
of material placed on record to find out whether any of the accused
is connected with the commission of the crime he is charged with. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">[12]	Similar
principle has been laid down by the Apex  Court  in the cases of
State of
Uttar Pradesh Vs. Ram Veer Singh &amp; Ors, reported in 2007 AIR SCW
5553 and
in Girja
Prasad (Dead) by LRs Vs. state of MP, reported in 2007 AIR SCW 5589.
Thus, the powers which this Court may exercise against an order of
acquittal are well settled.
</p>
<p id="p_21">[13]	It
is also a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the
appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give
fresh reasonings, when the reasons assigned by the Court below are
found to be just and proper. Such principle is laid down by the Apex
Court in the  case of State
of Karnataka Vs. Hemareddy, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417,
wherein, it is held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_22"> &amp;
This court has observed
in Girija Nandini Devi V. Bigendra Nandini Chaudhary (1967)1 SCR
93: (AIR 1967 SC 1124) that it is not the duty of the appellate
court when it agrees with the view of the trial court on the evidence
to repeat the narration of the evidence or to reiterate the reasons
given by the trial court expression of general agreement with the
reasons given by the Court the decision of which is under appeal,
will ordinarily suffice. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">[14]	Thus,
in case the  appellate court agrees with the reasons and the opinion
given by the lower court, then the discussion of evidence is not
necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_24">[15]	I
have gone through the Judgment and order of the trial Court. I have
also perused the reasons assigned by the learned Magistrate.  From
the record, it clearly appears that the learned Magistrate has
considered the evidence of the complainant as well as oral as well as
documentary evidence. It appears that the procedure under the
provision of Rule 27 of the Gujarat Water (Prevention of Control of
Pollution) Act, which is mandatory is not followed by the Board. It
also appears that no Rojkam or panchnama was done at the time of
taking sample. It also appears that the complainant was not
authorized to file complaint against the respondents.  After going
through the judgment of the trial Court and also the record, it
clearly appears that the trial court has not committed any error in
acquitting the accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">[16]	Learned
advocate for the appellant is not in a position to show any evidence
to take a contrary view of the matter or that the approach of the
trial court is vitiated by some manifest illegality or that the
decision is perverse or that the trial court has ignored the material
evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_26">[17]	In
the above view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that the
trial court was completely justified in acquitting the respondents of
the charges leveled against them. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">[18]	I
find that the findings recorded by the trial court are absolutely
just and proper and in recording the said findings, no illegality or
infirmity has been committed by it. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">[19]	I
am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the court
below and hence find no reasons to interfere with the same. Hence the
appeal is hereby dismissed. If R &amp; P is received by this Court,
Registry to transmit back to the trial Court, immediately.
