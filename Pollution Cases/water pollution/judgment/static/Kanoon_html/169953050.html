<p id="p_1">         (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE J.B.PARDIWALA)


      By this writ-application in the nature of a public interest

litigation, the petitioner, a resident of Veraval, has brought to

our notice few problems regarding pollution caused by the

Seafood Industries in the area.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      Shorn of facts, the case of the petitioners is that the city

of Veraval is known for its fishing activities. There are large

number of fishing processing units situated in the GIDC at

Veraval, which exports prime quality of seafood overseas. It is

the case of the petitioners that the Government launched a

scheme through its Industries and Mines Department for

providing Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) and

Reverse Osmosis Plant (RO) for purifying the polluted water

used by the industries. The plants were installed by way of a

grant of Rs.4 crore. As on today, there are 68 odd industries

which are mainly related to fisheries and fish packing

industries functioning in the GIDC at Veraval.



</p><p id="p_4">     According to the petitioners, the CETP as well as the RO

plants are not working to the maximum. Since the CETP and

the RO plants are not functioning properly, it has resulted in

pollution which needs to be taken care of by the authorities.

Apart from the State authorities, the respondent no.5 Veraval

Industries Association is also before us. The petitioner has also

impleaded few other fishing industries as party respondents. It

is in the aforesaid background that the petitioner has prayed

for a mandamus upon the respondent no.1, viz. Gujarat

Pollution Control Board, to ensure due compliance of the

provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974. Various other reliefs have also been prayed for in

the petition.

     On notice being issued, the respondents have appeared

and have filed their respective replies.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     It appears from the affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of the

respondent nos.1 and 2, viz. Gujarat Pollution Control Board,

that pursuant to the order passed by this Court dated 2 nd

February 2012, various industries operating in the GIDC were

inspected and samples were drawn for the purpose of

examining, whether the industries were meeting with the

parameters fixed by the Board. It also appears from the

affidavit-in-reply that the CETP plants were found in operation

barring few deficiencies. However, overall compliance was

found by the GPCB. It also appears that on 21 st July 2012 the

officers of the Board had inspected the CETP plants of three

industries who are not the members of the Association and it

was found that the CETP plants were unable to meet with the

parameters, as a result, notices under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33A</a> of the

Water Act were issued against the three units, viz. M/s. J.M.Sea

Foods, M/s. Ocean Aquatic Products and M/s. King Fish

Products Pvt. Ltd. All the three units were asked to stop their

production for a period of three months and were also directed

to upgrade/modify their treatment system of the unit.

     Today, when the matter is taken up for hearing, Mr.Vyas,

the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the GPCB,

brought to our notice that even after the affidavit-in-reply was

filed in the year 2012, monitoring of the various industries in

the GIDC has continued. Samples are being drawn from the

outlet point as well as the inlet point of the CETP. According to

Mr.Vyas, every month a report as regards the parameters of

the effluent treated in the CETP is to be forwarded at the

Regional Office. According to Mr.Vyas, the situation at the

Veraval GIDC as on today is normal. No such major deficiencies

have been noticed. Mr.Vyas submitted that such monitoring

would continue periodically by way of surprise inspection.



</p><p id="p_10">     We inquired with Mr.Vyas about the present condition of

the Central Effluent Treatment Plant and the Reverse Osmosis

Plant, as according to the petitioners, both these plants are not

working upto the mark. However Mr.Vyas, on instruction, has

submitted    that         the   CETP   plant     is   functioning   to   their

satisfaction and as such there is no complaint in that regard.

behalf of the Association, has drawn our attention to the fact

that the private industries named in the reply of the GPCB are

not the members of the Association.

dispose of the same by issuing the following directions :



  (1)      The        Gujarat   Pollution     Control   Board   shall
     periodically inspect the fishing industries operating at
     GIDC, Veraval. Samples be drawn at the regular intervals
     with a view to ensure that the same are meeting with the
     parameters fixed by the Board, in accordance with the
     provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
  (2)      There shall be periodical inspection of the Common
     Effluent Treatment Plant and the Reverse Osmosis Plant.
     If they are not found to be functional or upto the mark,
     then necessary steps be taken immediately in that regard
     with the Association.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
  (3)      If some of the industries like the one named in the
     affidavit-in-reply filed by the Board are not the members
     of the Association, even then the Board shall periodically
     inspect those industries with a view to ensure that they
     are not causing any pollution. Samples of the trade
     effluent be regularly drawn with a view to see that the
     parameters fixed are adhered to.

GPCB has drawn our attention to the fact that the RO plant is

not functioning to their satisfaction. According to Mr.Vyas the

samples     drawn           indicate   presence      of   higher    amount     of

suspended       solid.       In   such    circumstances,      we     direct   the

Association to take care of this problem at the earliest and

rectify the deficiencies in the functioning of the RO plant. Such

corrective measures be taken by the Association within a

period of three weeks from today without fail. After everything

is taken care of, the Association shall inform the GPCB so that

the officers of the GPCB can visit and examine the RO plant.

Even if thereafter the Board is not satisfied with the

functioning of the RO plant, then it shall be open for them to

proceed in accordance with law.
