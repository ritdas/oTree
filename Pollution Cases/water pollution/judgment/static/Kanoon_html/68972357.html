COMMON ORDER:              (per Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice Sri Ramesh Ranganathan)


          The validity of the Telangana Teachers (Regulation of

Teachers)        Rules,     2018,     notified      in    G.O.Ms.        No.16,      School

Education (Service II) Department dated 06.06.2018 (the "2018

Rules" for short), is questioned in these Writ Petitions as being

arbitrary, illegal, unjust, in violation of Articles 14, 16, 21, 243G

and 371D of the Constitution of India, and contrary to the

provisions of the Telangana Districts (Formation) Act, 1974 read

with the A.P. Public Employment (Organisation of Local Cadres

and Regulation Direct Recruitment) Order, 1975, apart from being

contrary to the judgments in <a href="/doc/398430/" id="a_1">M. Kesavulu v. State of Andhra

Pradesh1</a> and <a href="/doc/1436963/" id="a_2">Government of A.P. v. P. Vema Reddy2</a>, and the

interim order of status quo passed in W.P. No.23267 of 2017 and

W.P. No.23274 of 2017 dated 31.07.2017. A consequential

direction is sought to strike down the Rules notified in G.O.Ms.

No.16 dated 06.06.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_80">          The petitioners herein are either teachers working in

Government schools, or teachers hitherto working in Government

schools who are presently working in schools under the control of

local bodies, or teachers appointed to and working in schools run

by local bodies.          They are aggrieved by the action of the State

Government in effecting transfers, and in prescribing the Rules,

notified in G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 06.06.2018, for effecting transfers

of Headmasters, teachers etc in Government schools and schools

under the management of local authorities throughout the State of

Telangana. As the validity of the 2018 Rules, which provides for

transfer, has been questioned on various grounds, it is necessary

in the first instance to examine the scope of Judicial review, under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, in matters relating to

transfers.
</p>
<p id="p_81">             The scope of interference by Courts, with orders of transfer

of a Government servant or an employee of a public sector

undertaking or a local body, is extremely limited. Transfer of an

employee, appointed to a class or category of transferable posts,

from one place to another, is an incident of service necessary in

public         interest   and   efficiency       in   public    administration.   No

government servant or an employee or a local authority has a legal

right to be posted forever at any one particular place or at a place

of his choice. (<a href="/doc/1831634/" id="a_4">Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan v. Damodar

Prasad Pandey3</a>; <a href="/doc/1484526/" id="a_5">Major General J.K. Bansal v. Union of India4</a>;

<a href="/doc/749405/" id="a_6">Union of India v. Janardhan Debanath5</a>; <a href="/doc/861198/" id="a_7">National Hydroelectric

Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Shri Bhagwan6</a>.).                          Transfer of a public

servant, on administrative grounds or in public interest, should

not be interfered with unless there are strong and compelling

grounds rendering the transfer order improper and unjustifiable.

(<a href="/doc/553937/" id="a_8">Chief General Manager, (Telecom) N.E. Telecom Circle v.

Rajendra Ch. Bhattacharjee7</a>).                Who should be transferred, and

posted where, is a matter for the administrative authority to

decide. Unless the order of transfer is vitiated by malafides or is

made in violation of any operative guidelines or Rules, Courts

3   (2004)   12 SCC 299
4   (2005)   7 SCC 227
5   (2004)   4 SCC 245
6   (2001)   8 SCC 574
7   (1995)   2 SCC 532
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>




should not, ordinarily, interfere with it. (Kendriya Vidyalaya

Sangathan3; <a href="/doc/220487/" id="a_9">Union of India v. S.L. Abbas8</a>; Major General J.K.

Bansal4; <a href="/doc/356696/" id="a_10">Abani Kanta Ray v. State of Orissa9</a>).

</p><p id="p_82">       A government servant, or an employee of a local body, has no

legal right to insist on being posted at any particular place.           A

person holding a transferable post, unless specifically provided in

his service conditions, has no choice in the matter of posting.

(Rajendra Ch. Bhattacharjee7).            Unless there is a term to the

contrary in the contract of service, a transfer order is a normal

incidence of service. (<a href="/doc/1690380/" id="a_11">Pearlite Liners (P) Ltd. v. Manorama

Sirsi10</a>). In a transferable post, an order of transfer is a normal

consequence,        and   personal       difficulties   are   matters   for

consideration of the department and not the Court.              (<a href="/doc/84189/" id="a_12">Rajendra

Roy v. Union of India11</a>). Unless the order of transfer is shown to

be an outcome of a malafide exercise of power or as violative of any

statutory provision (an Act or Rule) or is passed by an authority

not competent to do so, an order of transfer cannot be interfered

with as a matter of course or for every type of grievance sought to

be made. (<a href="/doc/146531721/" id="a_13">State of U.P. v. Gobardhan Lal12</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_83">       Courts should not, ordinarily, interfere with a transfer order

made in public interest and for administrative reasons.                 An

employee, holding a transferable post, has no vested right to

remain posted at one place, and is liable to be transferred from one

place to the other. Transfer orders, issued by the competent

authority, do not violate any of his legal rights. (Shilpi Bose v.



8 (1993) 4 SCC 357
9 1995 Supp (4) SCC 169
10 (2004) 3 SCC 172
11 (1993) 1 SCC 148
12 (2004) 11 SCC 402
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>




State of Bihar13; Major General J.K. Bansal4). Transfer is an

incident of service and is made in administrative exigencies, and

such orders should not be interfered with except where the

transfer has been made in a vindictive manner. (<a href="/doc/1398944/" id="a_14">Public Services

Tribunal Bar Assn. v. State of U.P</a>.,14; <a href="/doc/768239/" id="a_15">Tushar D. Bhatt v. State

of Gujarat15</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_84">          Whenever a public servant is transferred, he must comply

with the order. If, however, there be any genuine difficulty in

proceeding on transfer, it is open to him to make a representation

to the competent authority for stay, modification or cancellation of

the transfer order. If the order of transfer is not stayed, modified or

cancelled, the public servant concerned must carry out the order of

transfer. He would not be justified in avoiding or evading the

transfer      order    merely   on   the   ground   of   having   made   a

representation, or on the ground of his difficulty in moving from

one place to the other. If he fails to comply with the transfer order,

he would expose himself to disciplinary action under the relevant

Rules.        (<a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_16">Gujarat Electricity Board v. Atmaram Sungomal

Poshani16</a>; Tushar D. Bhatt15). When an employee does not join at

his transferred place, he commits a misconduct. (<a href="/doc/593688/" id="a_17">Novartis India

Ltd. v. State of W.B</a>.,17). Non-compliance with the transfer order

amounts to refusal to obey the orders passed by superiors for

which the employer can reasonably be expected to take appropriate

action against the employee concerned. (Pearlite Liners (P) Ltd.10).

</p><p id="p_85">          Orders of transfer should not be interfered with lightly by a

Court of law in the exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction, unless

13   1991 Supp (2) SCC 659
14   (2003) 4 SCC 104
15   (2009) 11 SCC 678
16   (1989) 2 SCC 602
17   (2009) 3 SCC 124
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     8</span>




the Court finds that either the order is malafide or that the Service

Rules prohibit such transfer or that the authority, who issued the

order, had not the competence to pass the order. (<a href="/doc/840152/" id="a_18">State Bank of

India v. Anjan Sanyal18</a>). A challenge to an order of transfer

should, normally, not be countenanced by Courts as though they

are appellate authorities over such orders.        Courts would not

substitute their own decisions, in the matter of transfer, for that of

the competent authorities. (Gobardhan Lal12; Kendriya Vidyalaya

Sangathan3; <a href="/doc/749405/" id="a_19">Union of India v. Janardhan Debanath19</a>; S.L.

Abbas8; <a href="/doc/1508554/" id="a_20">B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India20</a>; Shri Bhagwan6;

Major General J.K. Bansal4).
</p>
<p id="p_86">          Since the validity of the 2018 Rules are under challenge in

these Writ Petitions, it is necessary, before examining the rival

contentions urged by Learned Senior Counsel and Learned

Counsel on either side, to briefly refer to what these Rules provide.

Rule 1(2) of the 2018 Rules stipulates that these Rules are

applicable to Head Masters/Head Mistresses Grade-II (Gazetted),

School Assistants/SGTs, and other equivalent categories working

in Government/Zilla Parishad/MPP Schools in the State of

Telangana.        Rule 1(3) provides that these Rules shall come into

force with immediate effect ie on 06.06.2018. Rule 2 provides that

all transfers shall be made by way of online web counseling for

each erstwhile district/existing zone.        Rule 3 relates to the

schedule of transfers, and requires the Commissioner and Director

passed in W.P. No.23267 of 2017 dated 31.07.2017 whereby this

Court, while dealing with the amended Presidential Order date

23.06.2017, which sought to integrate services of Panchayat

School teachers and Government school teachers, had directed

maintenance   of   status   quo   with   regards    services   of   both

panchayats and government teachers.

complaint in W.P. No.23267 and 23274 of 2017 was that, if the

Presidential order is allowed to stand, the respondents would give

effect to the integrated seniority list that was prepared from 1998

onwards, and they would effect promotions basing on the said

integrated seniority list of teachers working in local bodies and

Government Schools; this Court had directed the respondents to

maintain status quo only in respect of promotions and seniority,

and not in respect of transfers; the respondent State is at liberty to

effect transfers, in the same management, duly maintaining

status-quo   in   all   other   respects;   and   as    this   Court,   in

W.P.Nos.23267 and 23274 of 2017, had directed the respondents

to   maintain status quo, the respondents cannot revise any

seniority list that has been prepared prior to the amendment to the

Presidential Order, and effect promotions; the Presidential Order

was amended vide        Notification    issued in GSR No.637(E) and

639(E) dated      23.6.2017 w.e.f. 20.11.1998; the             services of

teachers, working in local bodies and Government Schools, have

been integrated    by the amendment to the Presidential Order;

when a challenge was made to the said amendment, this Court

did not suspend/stay the said amendment                   made to the

Presidential Order; this Court only directed the         respondents to

maintain status quo; therefore the amended Presidential Order is

in force; as such, the State Government is entitled to              effect

transfers management wise,          without integrating them, and

without      disturbing    their   seniority   and     effecting   further

promotions, as per the status quo orders issued by this Court; and

as such G.O.Ms.No.16, dated 6.6.2018 is just and proper.

</p>
<p id="p_94">      In the aforesaid interim order we had observed that the

scope and ambit of the words "public employment", in Clause (1) of

<a href="/doc/1466428/" id="a_21">Article 371-D</a>, necessitated examination; the earlier efforts of the

State Government to frame Rules, and enact laws, was faulted in

M. Kesavulu1 and P.Vema Reddy2; both these judgments were

affirmed by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal Nos.4886-4901 of

2009 and 4878-4885 of 2009, granting liberty to the State

Government to send a proposal to the Union of India, for obtaining

approval of the President to integrate teachers of Panchayat

Samitis and Zilla Parishads, who were also Government servants,

with the existing local cadres of teachers, and as and when such

proposal was sent to the Union of India, the same was required to

be considered at an early date; while noting that the order of the

Supreme Court enabled the State Government to submit its

proposal to the Union of India for integration of teachers in local

bodies with teachers in Government Schools, to form one local

cadre, we had opined that the question which necessitated

examination was whether or not the amendment to the Presidential

Orders, impugned in the two Writ Petitions, were ultra-vires <a href="/doc/1715174/" id="a_22">Article

371-D(1)</a> of the Constitution of India, for it is only if the words

"public employment" were held to bring within its ambit,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                    15</span>




employees of local bodies also, could the President be held to have

the power to make the aforesaid Presidential Order.

</p><p id="p_95">      We had, thereafter, observed that, as this issue has a

bearing on the career prospects of all teachers in Government

schools who, as a result of the insertion of Clause 2(A) to

Paragraph-3 of the Presidential Order, now find themselves

integrated with teachers in schools administered by local bodies,

and as this issue has been under challenge before this Court for

the past more than 15 years, (ever since the judgment in M.

Kesavulu1), it was appropriate to hear the matter early.          Taking

note of the fact that the State Government had already taken

certain steps, in appointing teachers in local bodies to higher posts

in terms of Clause 2(A) of Paragraph-3 of the Presidential Order, we

had, while granting time to the State Government to file their

counter-affidavit, directed the respondents to maintain status-quo

as on the date of that order. The interim order of status-quo is still

in force as on date.
</p>
<p id="p_96">      The status-quo order passed by us was in the context of

Clause 2(A) of Paragraph-3 of the 1975 Presidential Order. Clause

2(A), inserted after Paragraph-3(2) to the 1975 Presidential Order,

prescribes that "the posts, belonging to each Non-Gazette category of

teachers in Mandal Parishad, Zilla Parishad and Government School in each

District, shall be organized into a separate integrated cadre."    While

teachers in local body schools are a distinct cadre, different from

that of teachers in Government schools (which alone were

organized as a local cadre under Para 3 of the 1975 Presidential

Order), the effect of Para 3 (2A) of the Presidential Order is to

integrate both of them into one common cadre in each District.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                  16</span>
</p><p id="p_97">      The effect of the order of status-quo passed by us is to

disable the State Government from integrating teachers in

Government Schools and teachers working in local body schools,

and in treating them as one common district cadre. Consequently

teachers presently working in local body schools cannot be

transferred to Government Schools and vice-versa, as long as the

order of status quo continues to remain in force, since such

transfers can only be effected if an integrated cadre of teachers, in

Government Schools and local body schools, in each district is

organized in terms of Para 3(2A) of the Presidential Order.

</p><p id="p_98">      Rule 5(5) of the 2018 Rules stipulates that all transfers shall

be effected within the present management.            Consequently,

teachers working in local body schools can only be transferred to

the management of local body schools and not to Government

Schools, and vice-versa. The aforesaid stipulation in Rule 5(5) of

the 2018 Rules has ensured compliance with the order of status-

quo, as it has avoided integration of teachers into a common cadre

as stipulated in Para 3(2A) of the 1975 Presidential Order.      The

order of status-quo, which disabled the State Government from

treating teachers working in local body schools and teachers

working in Government schools within the same district as one

integrated cadre, has not been violated by the 2018 Rules as the

distinction between local body schools and Government schools is

maintained, in effecting transfers, under Rule 5(5) of the 2018

Rules.   The mere fact that the 2018 Rules is applicable both to

teachers in Government Schools and local body schools matters

little, as transfer of teachers presently working in local body

schools is being effected only to other local body schools and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                     17</span>




transfer of teachers presently working in Government schools is

being effected only to other Government schools. The contention

that the 2018 Rules violates the status-quo order, passed by us in

W.P.No.23217 and W.P.No.23274 of 2017 dated 31.07.2017, is

therefore not tenable.
</p>
<p id="p_99">       It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that teachers,

who were hitherto working in Government schools and who were

transferred, in terms of the Rules notified in G.O.Ms.No.505 dated

16.11.1998 and G.O.Ms.No.538 dated 20.11.1998 to local body

schools, cannot be transferred to other local body schools since, in

terms of the judgments of the Division Benches in M. Kesavulu1

and P. Vema Reddy2, they are still required to be treated as

teachers working in Government Schools.
</p>
<p id="p_100">       As noted hereinabove some teachers, hitherto working in

Government Schools, were transferred to local body schools and

vice-versa in terms of the Rules notified in G.O.Ms.No.505 dated

16.11.1998 and G.O.Ms.No.538 dated 20.11.1998.               Ever since

then, they are working under the management of schools to which

they   were   transferred   (i.e.   if   they   were   transferred   from

Government Schools to local body schools, they are presently

working in the schools managed by local bodies; and if they had

been transferred in 1998 from local body schools to Government

Schools, they are presently working in Government Schools. This

unforeseen situation, these teachers find themselves in, is because

of the interim orders passed from time to time.           After both the

aforesaid G.Os were set aside by a Division Bench of this Court in

M. Kesavalu1, the said order of the Division Bench was carried in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                  18</span>




Appeal, and the Supreme Court stayed the contempt proceedings

initiated for non-compliance of the order of the Division Bench.

</p><p id="p_101">      Thereafter, the State Legislature enacted the A.P. School

Education Teachers and other Employees (Abolition of existing

service cadres and regulation of recruitment and conditions of

service) Act, 2005, and made Rules which were notified in

G.O.Ms.Nos.95 and 96 dated 25.07.2005, in terms of which

teachers in local body schools and teachers in government schools

were sought to be integrated into a local cadre. It is only in terms

of the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in P. Vema

Reddy2, whereby the 2005 Act and the 2005 Rules were struck

down, did the integrated common cadre cease to remain in force.

After the order of the Division Bench in P. Vema Reddy2, the

Government again approached the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal

Nos.4878-4885 and 4886-4901 of 2009 and SLP (Civil) No.35880

of 2011.   After the order of the Supreme Court, in the aforesaid

Appeals, on 30.09.2015, the Presidential Order was amended, and

Clause 2(A) was inserted to Para 3 of the 1975 Presidential Order

vide G.S.R. 639E dated 23.06.2017. In view of the interim order

passed by us in W.P.No.23267 of 2017 and W.P.No.23274 of 2017

dated 31.07.2017, directing maintenance of status-quo, these

teachers continue to work in the school management (to which

they were transferred in 1998) even as on date. Consequently they

are now being transferred from one school to another under the

same management i.e. the erstwhile Government school teachers,

who have been working in local body schools for the past two

decades ever since 1998, are being transferred only to other local

body schools; and teachers who were working in local body
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                  19</span>




schools, who were transferred to Government Schools in 1998, and

have been working in such Schools for the past twenty years, are

being transferred to other schools under the same management i.e

to other Government Schools.          Since the order of status-quo

disables both teachers working in local body schools and teachers

working in Government Schools to be treated as an integrated

cadre, it is only if teachers presently working in local body schools

are transferred to Government Schools and vice-versa, can the

order of status-quo be said to have been violated. Admittedly, no

such action has been taken by the State Government.             This

contention, urged on behalf of the petitioners, does not therefore

merit acceptance.
</p>
<p id="p_102">II. HAS THE AMENDMENT TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ORDER
    CEASED TO REMAIN IN FORCE CONSEQUENT TO THE
    ORDER OF STATUS-QUO PASSED BY THIS COURT?
</p>
<p id="p_103">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that as local

cadres have not yet been organized, in terms of the amendment to

the Presidential Orders dated 21-7-2017, the law, as it stood prior

to 21-7-2017, continues to remain in force; and a construction,

which will introduce uncertainty, friction and confusion into a

working of system, should be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_104">      The order of status quo, passed by this Court, would only

mean that the existing state of affairs, prevailing on the date on

which the said order of status-quo was passed, would continue

until further orders from the Court. That does not either eclipse

the amendment made to the Presidential Order, or render the said

2017 amendment illegal.      Quashing of an order results in the

restoration of the position as it stood on the date of the passing of

the order which has been quashed. The stay of operation of an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                             20</span>




order does not, however, lead to such a result. It only means that

the order which has been stayed would not be operative from the

date of the passing of the stay order, and it does not mean that the

said order has been wiped out from existence. (<a href="/doc/422729/" id="a_23">Shree Chamundi

Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Assn</a>.21).                       Even

when an order is suspended, it still exists and has operation in

other       respects     except    wherein       it   has   been   suspended.   A

suspension holds the law in abeyance and does not put an end to

the Law. (<a href="/doc/1017549/" id="a_24">State of U.P. v. Hirendra Pal Singh22</a>).                   The order of

status quo passed by us would not result in wiping, the 2017

amendment to the Presidential Order, from existence.                    It would

only result in the respondents being disabled from giving effect to

it, after the date on which the said order of status quo was passed.

The order of status quo dated 31.07.2017 only disables the

Government from implementing the amended Presidential Order,

and in organizing an integrated local cadre, as long as the status

quo order is in force. Any steps which the Government may take to

facilitate implementation of the amended Presidential Order at a

later date, would not, by itself, fall foul of Part III of the

Constitution or of the status quo order passed by this Court.

</p><p id="p_105">          It is no doubt true that a construction is to be rejected which

will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the working of

the system. (<a href="/doc/1902234/" id="a_25">Central Bank of India v. Ravindra23</a>; Principles of

direction avoiding collision with icebergs of inconsistency and

repugnancy. (Ravindra23; Farrell v. Alexander24).

</p><p id="p_106">          The uncertainty, with respect to teachers in local body/

Government schools, has resulted since the 1975 Presidential

Order still refers to the erstwhile 10 districts of the State of

Telangana, though 31 new districts have been formed, under the

Telangana District Formation Act, from 11.10.2016 onwards. Since

the State Government lacks the power to amend the Presidential

Order, this uncertainty would continue till the Presidential Order is

suitably amended by the President recognizing the newly formed

31 districts as local areas under the 1975 Presidential Order, or

the 2017 amendment to the 1975 Presidential Order is held valid,

in which event teachers in local body schools and Government

schools can be integrated into one common local cadre; and

thereafter the local cadre for both these categories of teachers

would be the erstwhile ten districts referred to in the Presidential

Order in all respects.
</p>
<p id="p_107">          While construing the 2018 Rules, a construction, which

would result in preserving the Constitutionality of the 2018 Rules,

should be adopted for it is a well-settled rule of construction of

statutes that where two interpretations are possible, one of which

would preserve and save the constitutionality of the particular

statutory         provision   while   the   other   would   render   it

unconstitutional and void, the one which saves and preserves its

constitutionality should be adopted and the other rejected. (Union

of <a href="/doc/1134697/" id="a_26">India v. Tulsiram Patel25</a>). The incongruity, as aforementioned,

notwithstanding, the 2018 Rules cannot be said to be illegal on the

ground that it refers to the erstwhile 10 districts of the State of

Telangana.        Suffice it to hold that the status-quo order has not

obliterated the 2017 amendment to the Presidential Order, and has

only rendered it inoperative for the present.

III. DOES TRANSFER OF TEACHERS WORKING IN LOCAL
     BODY SCHOOLS FALL WITHIN THE AMBIT OF THE
     PRESIDENTIAL ORDER?
</p>
<p id="p_108">          It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that in order to

meet a possible opposition, to a challenge to the rules, a reference

is made by the respondents to the Presidential Order; teachers,

working in the Zilla Parishad Schools, are not subject to the rigor

of the Presidential Order; posts in local body schools are partly

governed by the Presidential Order, and partly not; in view of Para

6(1) of the Presidential Order, direct recruitment in schools, under

the control of local bodies, is governed by the Presidential Order;

Para 5(1), which prescribes a local cadre as a unit for transfer, has

no application to teachers in non-government schools; the

Presidential Order applies only to direct recruitment in local body

schools, and not to transfers; consequently, the petitioners can

only be transferred within the newly constituted 31 districts; even

assuming that there is an amendment to the Presidential Order,

the posts of teachers working in Government schools and Zilla

Parishad schools have not, accordingly, been organized into local

cadres (in terms of the amendment); and Zilla Parishad teachers

would therefore be governed by the Rules issued by the State

either under the Panchayat Raj Act or under the A.P. Education

<p id="p_112">       Para 3 of the 1975 Presidential Order relates to organization

of local cadres. Para 3(1) requires the State Government, within a

period of 18 months from the commencement of the Order, to

organise classes of posts in the civil services of, and classes of civil

posts under, the State into different local cadres for different parts

of the State in the manner provided.        Para 3(2) requires posts,

belonging to the category of Junior Assistant, and to each of the

other categories equivalent to, or lower than that of a Junior

Assistant in each department in each district, to be organized into

a separate cadre.     The Presidential Order does not require all

classes of posts in the Civil Services of the State, or all classes of

civil posts under the State, to be organized into different local

cadres for different parts of the State, and it is only to the "extent"

and in the "manner" provided in the Presidential Order are such

posts required to be organized into different local cadres. (P. Vema

Reddy2). Panchayats, Mandal Parishads and Zilla Parishads are

local authorities both under Part IX of the Constitution and under

the provisions of the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1994. While the local

cadres, organized in the department of school education in

G.O.Ms. No. 529 dated 14-5-1976, included the posts of teachers

in government schools, it did not extend to the posts of teachers

under local authorities. Posts of teachers under local authorities

were, hitherto, not organized into local cadres. (P. Vema Reddy2).

</p><p id="p_113">       Para 3(2) of the Presidential Order requires categories of

posts of lower division clerks and below, in each "department" in

each District, to be organized into a separate local cadre. Para 3(3)

requires the posts belonging to each non-gazetted category, other

than those referred to in sub-paragraph (2), in each department in

each zone, to be organized into a separate cadre. Para 4 relates to

allotment of persons, and Para 4(1) requires persons, holding posts

required to be organized into local cadres, to be allotted to such

cadres by the State Government or any officer or authority

authorized by it in this behalf in accordance with the specified

principles and procedure.      Para 5 relates to local cadres and

transfer of persons, and Para 5(1) stipulates that each part of the

State, for which a local cadre has been organized in respect of any

category of posts, shall be a separate unit for the purposes of

recruitment, appointment, discharge, seniority, promotion and

transfer, and such other matters as may be specified by the State

Government, in respect of that category of posts.

</p><p id="p_114">      The distinction between posts in "departments" of the State

Government and posts under any "local authority" is clear from

Paras 6 and 8 of the Order. While the words "local cadre" have been

used in relation to posts in departments of the State Government

in Clause (i) of Para 6(1), when it comes to posts under a local

authority, the words used in Clause (ii) of Para 6(1) is "cadre" and

not "local cadre". A similar distinction is made between Clauses (i)

and (ii) in sub-paras (2) and (3) of Para 6 also. Similarly under

Clause (a) of Para 8(1), while the words ''local cadre" are used in

relation to the State Government, in Clause (b) for posts under a

local authority, the words used are "cadre" and not "local cadre". This

distinction is also maintained in Clauses C(1) and C(2) of Para 8(1)

and Clauses (a) &amp; (b) of Para 8(2).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                       27</span><p id="p_115">
</p><p id="p_116">        If local authorities were to be construed as departments of

the State Government, Clause (ii) of sub-paras (1), (2) and (3) of

Para 6 and Clause (b) and C(ii) of Para 8(1) and Clause (b) of Para

8(2) would be rendered inapposite surplussage.               It is only in

respect of classes of civil posts, in departments of the State

Government, does the Presidential Order require a local cadre to be

organized, and not in respect of posts under a local authority. It is

for this reason that, while cadres/posts of teachers in government

schools were organised into different local cadres, for different

parts of the State, in G.O.Ms. No. 529 dated 14.05.1976,

cadres/posts of teachers in schools under local authorities was

not. (P. Vema Reddy2).
</p>
<p id="p_117">        Though teachers, working in Panchayat Raj institutions,

were not organized into a local cadre, teachers in Government

Schools were organized as such in each district. Consequently, in

terms of Para 5(1) of the 1975 Presidential Order, each District is a

separate unit for the purposes of recruitment, appointment,

discharge, seniority, promotion and transfer of teachers in

Government Schools.       It is in terms of Para 5(1) of the 1975

Presidential Order that Rule 9 of G.O.Ms.No.11 dated 23.01.2009,

which relates to teachers in Government schools, stipulates that,

for the purposes of recruitment, appointment, seniority, discharge

for want of vacancy, promotion, transfer and reappointment, the

unit of appointment shall be the Revenue District.            Reading the

words    "Revenue    District"   in    the   adhoc   Rules    notified   in

G.O.Ms.No.9 dated 23.01.2009 as the existing 31 districts, would

render Rule 9 thereof ultravires the Presidential Order which

recognizes only the erstwhile 10 districts as the districts within
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                  28</span>




which alone should local cadres be organized and be treated as a

unit.
</p>
<p id="p_118">        As teachers working in Government schools were organised

as a local cadre in each District, in terms of the 1975 Presidential

Order, appointment, promotion, seniority, transfer etc of all

teachers in Government Schools can only be made within the

District and not beyond. Teachers working in Government schools

can, therefore, only be transferred within one of the erstwhile 10

Districts and not outside. The 1975 Presidential Order recognises

only the 10 Districts in the present State of Telangana as the

District within which a local cadre is required to be organised.

Creation of 31 Districts, with effect from 11.10.2016, has no

bearing on local area reservation to be provided in terms of the

Presidential Order.    The 10 districts, notified in terms of the

Presidential Order, would continue to be regarded as a local area,

unless and until otherwise amended on the directions of the

President. (G. Arun Kumar26). Since neither the State legislature

nor the State Government has the power to amend the Presidential

Order, they are precluded, as long as the 1975 Presidential Order

is not suitably amended, from prescribing the newly constituted 31

Districts as a unit to effect transfer of teachers in Government

schools. Teachers, in Government schools, can, therefore, only be

transferred within the 10 districts referred to in the Presidential

Order, and not within the newly constituted 31 Districts in the

State of Telangana.
</p>
<p id="p_119">        As the 1975 Presidential Order continues to govern teachers

working in Government schools, their unit of appointment,

transfer, promotion, seniority etc would continue to remain the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                            29</span>




erstwhile ten Districts of the State of Telangana, notwithstanding

creation of 31 new Districts, since the Presidential Order has not

yet been amended to provide for the new 31 Districts as a local

cadre, and it is within the erstwhile 10 districts alone, (each of

which is a unit for which a local cadre is organised), are

appointment, promotion, seniority, transfer etc required to be

made.
</p>
<p id="p_120">          While Paras 3, 4 and 5 of the 1975 Presidential Order do not

apply to teachers in local body schools, since such schools were

not organized as a local cadre under the Presidential Order, Para

6(1)(iv) of the 1975 Presidential Order stipulates that each district

shall be regarded as a local area for direct recruitment to all posts

of teachers under a local authority, carrying a scale of pay equal to

that of the posts in the Andhra Pradesh School Education

Subordinate Services. The provisions contained in para 6 and 8 of

the Presidential Order, relating to local areas and reservation in

favour of local candidates in the matter of direct recruitment to

posts, are applicable to posts borne on the establishment of a local

authority. In para-3, 4 and 5 of the Presidential Order, there is no

mention about the posts borne on the establishment of a local

authority, whereas para-6 and 8 refer to posts borne on the

establishment of a local authority. This clearly shows that Paras-

3,4 and 5 of the Presidential Order has no application to posts

borne       on    the    establishment          of   a   local   authority.   (M.P.

Ananthanarayana v. State of A.P.27; P. Vema Reddy2). As the

Presidential Order requires direct recruitment to the posts of

teachers in local body schools to be confined within a local area,


27   Judgment in W.P. No. 26072 of 2006 &amp; batch dated 28.06.2006 (DB)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                  30</span>




which is again a District, recruitment of teachers in local body

schools can only be made within the erstwhile ten Districts of the

present State of Telangana.
</p>
<p id="p_121">      It is only because Para 6(1)(iv) of the 1975      Presidential

Order required each district to be regarded as a local area for

direct recruitment to all posts of teachers under a local authority,

did Rule 9 of the Rules notified in G.O.Ms.No.12 dated 23.01.2009,

prescribed a "Revenue District" as a unit for recruitment of

teachers.   As it then stood, the Districts referred to in the

Presidential Order, and the Revenue Districts referred to in Rule 9

of G.O.Ms.No.12 dated 23.01.2009, were the same i.e the erstwhile

10 districts in the State of Telangana.
</p>
<p id="p_122">      Para 7 of the 1975 Presidential Order relates to local

candidates, and under sub-para (1) thereof, a candidate for direct

recruitment to any post shall be regarded as a local candidate in

relation to a local area, if he fulfills the conditions stipulated

thereunder. A local candidate is determined in relation to a local

area, and in terms of Para 6(1)(iv) of the Presidential Order the

local area, for direct recruitment to the posts of teachers, is each

district which, in the Table below Para 8 of the Presidential Order,

are the erstwhile 10 Districts of the State of Telangana.

Consequently, direct recruitment of teachers in local body schools

can only be made within these 10 Districts, notwithstanding that

the erstwhile 10 revenue districts have now been altered, and in its

place 31 new districts have been constituted.

</p><p id="p_123">      In view of the 1975 Presidential Order, which requires only

the erstwhile ten Districts to be treated as a unit even for

recruitment to local body teachers, the effect of the 2018 Rules
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                    31</span>




would now be that, while the erstwhile ten Districts would be the

unit for recruitment and transfer of teachers in local body schools,

the 31 Revenue Districts would be the unit for seniority, promotion

etc. While a problem would, undoubtedly, arise when promotions

are sought be made, and seniority is to be fixed in terms of the

existing Rules notified in G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009,

we are not required, in the present Writ Petitions, to examine the

issue of seniority and promotions, as the dispute relates only to

transfer of teachers, mainly working in local body schools.        Suffice

it to observe that the State Government, before initiating steps to

effect promotions and fix seniority of teachers in local body

schools, shall bear in mind these aspects and take necessary

remedial measures in this regard. As transfer of teachers working

in   local   body   schools   to   other   schools   under   the    same

management, in terms of the 2018 Rules, does not fall within the

ambit of the Presidential Order, the contention to the contrary,

urged on behalf of the petitioners, does not merit acceptance.


IV. DOES THE 2018 RULES FALL FOUL OF THE LAW
    DECLARED IN THE DIVISION BENCH JUDGMENTS OF
    THIS COURT IN M.KESAVULU AND P.VEMA REDDY?
</p>
<p id="p_124">       It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the 2018

Rules fall foul of the law declared by the Division Benches of this

Court in M. Kesavulu1 and P.Vemareddy2, which were confirmed

by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.4886-4901 and 4878-

4885 of 2009 dated 30.09.2015; in exercise of the powers

conferred by Section 3 of the District (Formation) Act, 1974, the

erstwhile 10 Districts were replaced by the newly formed 31

Districts with effect from 11.10.2016; when there is a change in

the law i.e., on the formation of 31 districts, under the District
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                  32</span>




Formation Act and the District Formation Amendment Act, the

geographical spread of each revenue district changes; the unit of

appointment, for the purpose of service conditions, can only be the

present Revenue District; this would be in tune with the fields of

Legislation both in respect of formation of districts, and with

reference to the law on public services; though the erstwhile ten

districts are no longer in existence from 11.10.2016 onwards,

strangely Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules stipulates that all transfers

shall be made within the erstwhile 10 districts which are not in

existence, consequent on formation of 31 Districts with effect from

11.10.2016; neither the unit of appointment nor the unit for any

other purpose has been defined in the 2018 rules; when the

erstwhile district has been disintegrated (bifurcated or trifurcated),

and as new districts have come into existence, the question of

transfers being made for each erstwhile revenue district, which is

not in existence, does not arise; in view of the law laid down, in M.

Kesavulu1 and P. Vemareddy2, the Presidential Order has no

application to Panchayat school teachers except with respect to

direct recruitment; hence, there is no embargo for effecting

transfers of Panchayat school teachers among the 31 districts;

strangely the State, alleging compliance with the Presidential

Order, has decided to effect transfers under the 2018 Rules to the

non-existent 10 districts; even if it is presumed that the

Presidential Order is applicable to Panchayat school teachers, even

then, as per para 5 of the Presidential Order read with Section 3 of

the Telangana Districts (Formation) Act, the respondents should

effect transfers within the existing 31 Districts, and not within the

10 Districts which are not in existence; ever since 11.10.2016 i.e.,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                    33</span>




from the date when the 31 Districts were formed, and had replaced

the earlier 10 Districts, the respondents have been effecting inter-

district transfers among the 31 Districts; and, while effecting

general transfers, the respondents are reverting to the erstwhile 10

Districts which are not in existence.
</p>
<p id="p_125">      The law declared by the Division Benches of this Court, in

M. Kesavulu1 and P. Vemareddy2, disabled the State Government

and the State Legislature from integrating teachers working in

Government schools and teachers working in local body schools

into one local cadre on the ground that, while the Presidential

Order had organised teachers working in Government schools into

a local cadre, it had not organised teachers working in Zilla

Parishad and Mandal Praja Parishad schools as such; and since

the power to organise local cadres is conferred only in terms of the

Presidential Order, the State Government is disabled from

organising an integrated local cadre of teachers working in

Government schools and teachers working in local body schools.

As a result of the judgments of both the Division benches in M.

Kesavulu1 and P. Vemareddy2, which has been affirmed by the

Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.4886-4901 and 4878-4885 of

2009 dated 30.09.2015, teachers in local body schools have not

been organised into a local cadre.
</p>
<p id="p_126">      Except   for   direct   recruitment,   the   pre-amended   1975

Presidential Order had no application to teachers in local body

schools.   In furtherance of their efforts to integrate teachers in

Government schools and local body schools, the approval of the

President was sought by the State Government, and as a result

Clause (2A) was inserted into Paragraph 3 of the 1975 Presidential
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                  34</span>




Order vide GSR No.639E dated 23.06.2017 which could also not be

given effect to in the light of the status quo order passed by us on

31.07.2017. As long as the status-quo order is in force, teachers

working in Government Schools and local body schools cannot be

integrated into a unified local cadre in terms of Para 3(2A) of the

Presidential Order.    Except for direct recruitment in local body

schools, which alone is governed by the pre-amended Presidential

Order, the unit of promotion, transfer etc need not be the erstwhile

10 districts. The question whether the State Government would,

therefore, be disabled from prescribing the erstwhile 10 districts as

a unit of transfer is a different matter, which we shall examine

later in this order.
</p>
<p id="p_127">      The 1975 Presidential Order, to the extent of direct

recruitment of teachers in local body schools, has prescribed the

erstwhile ten Districts as a local area.    As a result, even after

formation of the 31 districts w.e.f. 11.10.2016, recruitment of

teachers to Government Schools and local body schools is still

required to be made treating the erstwhile 10 districts as a local

cadre/local area respectively under the 1975 Presidential Order. It

is not in dispute that all the petitioners herein were recruited as

teachers in local body schools when the erstwhile ten Districts

were treated as a unit for direct recruitment.      But for the re-

organisation of the erstwhile ten Districts into 31 Districts by the

State Government, in the exercise of its powers under the

Telangana District Formation Act, even in terms of the Rules

notified in G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009, the unit of

appointment, transfer, seniority, promotion etc of teachers in local

body schools would have continued to be the erstwhile ten
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                   35</span>




Districts in the State of Telangana, as they were the Revenue

Districts referred to in the said Rules when they were made and

notified in G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009.

</p><p id="p_128">      As the Presidential Order still governs direct recruitment of

teachers in local body schools, and prescribes the erstwhile ten

Districts as the local area within the confines of which alone is

direct recruitment to be made, the State Government, in its

wisdom, has chosen to prescribe the erstwhile ten Districts as a

unit for transfer also. As the 1975 Presidential Order still governs

direct recruitment of teachers in local body schools, and obligates

the State Government to recruit teachers only within the local area

i.e within one of the   erstwhile ten Districts, and not within the

newly constituted 31 Districts, and as the endeavour of the State

Government, in terms of Para 3(2A) of the Presidential Order, is to

integrate local body school teachers and teachers in Government

Schools into one common local cadre, in case the status quo order

passed by this Court were to be vacated later, it cannot be said

that prescription of the erstwhile 10 Districts, as a unit of transfer,

is so irrational as to violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution

of India.
</p>
<p id="p_129">      The contention that transfers are affected to non-existent

Districts, while attractive at first blush, does not, on a detailed

scrutiny,   merit   acceptance.        The   apparent   incongruity   in

recruitment and transfers being made within the erstwhile 10

districts, and seniority and promotions required to be made within

the newly formed 31 districts, is because the 1975 Presidential

Order continues to recognise only the erstwhile ten Districts of the

State of Telangana, despite these ten Districts being reorganised
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                  36</span>




into 31 Districts from 11.10.2016.          The Rules notified in

G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009, which refer to the

Revenue Districts as the unit of promotion, seniority etc were made

when the "Revenue Districts" were the ten districts, and not the 31

districts which were formed on 11.10.2016, seven years, after the

Rules notified in G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 were made on 23.01.2009.

</p><p id="p_130">      The mere fact that the 1975 Presidential Order is not

applicable to matters, other than direct recruitment in local body

schools, does not mean that the State Government cannot make

Rules, in the exercise of its powers under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_36">Article 309</a>

of the Constitution of India, to provide for the erstwhile ten

Districts as a unit for effecting transfers as long as these Rules do

not violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.     The

contention that the 2018 Rules fall foul of the Division Bench

judgments of this Court, in M. Kesavulu1 and P. Vemareddy2, is

without merit.
</p>
<p id="p_131">V. IS THE 2018 RULES, WHICH PRESCRIBES THE ERSTWHILE
   10 DISTRICTS AS UNITS OF TRANSFER SO IRRATIONAL AS
   TO VIOLATE ARTICLES 14 AND 16 OF THE CONSTITUTION
   OF INDIA?
</p>
<p id="p_132">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that, since the

erstwhile ten Districts are no longer in existence consequent on the

formation of the 31 Revenue Districts by the State Government

w.e.f. 11.10.2016, the State Government had acted irrationally in

making the 2018 Rules providing for transfer of teachers in local

body schools to the non-existent 10 Districts. As the adhoc Rules

in G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009 prescribe a "Revenue

District" as a unit for promotion, seniority etc, it would be

incongruous that, while seniority and promotion of teachers in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                   37</span>




local body schools must be confined within the newly formed 31

districts, they can be transferred beyond the present district to a

neighbouring district, on the ground that these transfers are being

made within the erstwhile 10 districts; it would be incongruous for

teachers working in local body schools, to be transferred outside

the present 31 Districts, (which is the unit for promotion and

seniority), and still effect promotion and seniority only within the

31 Districts, even though he is no longer working in the said

District on his transfer outside the district; the impugned Rules

are irrational, arbitrary and in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the

Constitution of India; and the respondents have thereby violated

Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_133">      Since the 1975      Presidential Order has no application to

teachers working in local body schools in all aspects, other than

direct recruitment, the State Government is not obligated to effect

transfers of teachers, working in local body schools, only within

the erstwhile ten Districts. The State Government has, however,

chosen to stipulate, in Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules, that all transfers

shall be made for each erstwhile District i.e., the erstwhile ten

Districts of the State of Telangana. While the State Government

was not obligated to do so, since there is no such requirement,

with respect to teachers working in local body schools under the

Presidential Order, the question is whether Rule 2 of the 2018

Rules is liable to be struck down on that ground.

</p><p id="p_134">      As the 2018 Rules were made under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_37">Article

309</a> of the Constitution of India, such Rules are Legislative in

character and can only be struck down if they are ultravires Part

III or any of the provisions of the Constitution of India. Even if the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                        38</span>




source of power to make the 2018 Rules is traced to Sections 78

and 99 of the A.P. Education Act, conferment of rule-making power

by an Act does not enable the rule-making authority to make a

rule which travels beyond the scope of the enabling Act or which is

inconsistent therewith or repugnant thereto. (<a href="/doc/1245411/" id="a_38">State of Karnataka

v. H. Ganesh Kamath28</a>), and a protection given by the statute

cannot       be    nullified   by   Rules   authorised   by   the   Statute.

(<a href="/doc/1488944/" id="a_39">Management, D.T.U. v. B.B.L. Hajelay29</a>). Even if the 2018 Rules

are held to be subordinate legislation, as they were made under

Sections 78 and 99 of the A.P. Education Act, such Rules can be

impeached only if it is ultravires the Parent Act (i.e the A.P.

Education Act) or any other law in force or in violation of any of the

provisions of the Constitution. It is not even contended that the

2018 Rules fall foul of any law made either by Parliament or the

State Legislature. The only question is whether Rule 2 of the 2018

Rules contravenes Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India?

</p><p id="p_135">          It is only if the petitioners are held to have established that

Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules violates Articles 14 and 16 of the

Constitution, would we be justified in striking it down as ultravires

Part III of the Constitution. A complaint, of violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a>

of the Constitution, cannot be judged by adopting a doctrinaire

approach. It is not prudent or pragmatic to insist on mathematical

accuracy in view of the inherent complexities involved. (<a href="/doc/863726/" id="a_41">State of

Karnataka v. Mangalore University Non-Teaching Employees

Association30</a>). There is no requirement of mathematical exactness

for determining the validity, as long as it is not palpably arbitrary.

and accuracy is not what <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_47">Article 14</a> contemplates. As long as the

broad       features     of    the   categorisation   are   identifiable   and

distinguishable, and the categorisation is reasonably connected

with the object targeted, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_48">Article 14</a> does not forbid such a course of

action. (<a href="/doc/134314390/" id="a_49">Subramanian Swamy v. Raju36</a>; <a href="/doc/155411991/" id="a_50">Murthy Match Works v.

<p id="p_136">          The test ought not to be what would be a 'better' basis for

results in hostile discrimination and adoption of the criteria has no

reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. (Samaj

the provision is shown to be irrational or as manifestly wrong, that

the Court would reach out its lethal arm and strike down the

provision. (<a href="/doc/1887454/" id="a_58">Mohd. Shujat Ali v. Union of India45</a>).

</p><p id="p_137">          The question whether Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules is rational or

not must be examined in the context in which the Rules are made,

and the object sought to be achieved thereby. In examining the

constitutionality of a statute, it must be assumed that the

legislature or the Rule making authority understands and

appreciates the need of the people and the laws/Rules it enacts are

directed to problems which are made manifest by experience and

that the laws/Rules are enacted which are considered to be

reasonable         for   the    purpose      for   which     they      are    enacted.

Presumption is, therefore, in favour of the constitutionality of an

enactment or Rule. (<a href="/doc/4354/" id="a_59">Charanjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India46</a>;

Saki48</a>; <a href="/doc/591481/" id="a_62">Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India49</a>). In order to

sustain the presumption of constitutionality, the court may take

into consideration matters of common knowledge, the history of

the times and may assume every state of facts which can be

conceived        existing      at   the   time     of   legislation.         (Hamdard

endeavour to implement Para 3(2A) of the 1975 Presidential Order

as amended by GSR No.639E dated 23.06.2017, and integrate

teachers in Government schools and local body schools into one

local cadre, if and after the constitutional validity of Para 3(2A) of

the 1975 Presidential Order were to be upheld by this Court. They

are, however, disabled from doing so as at present, in view of the

order of status quo passed by a Division Bench of this Court. As

detailed hereinabove, the incongruity, in the erstwhile 10 districts

being treated as a unit of recruitment of teachers in local body

schools while it is the Revenue District for determining their

seniority, promotion etc, has arisen because the Presidential Order

still recognises only the erstwhile 10 districts of the State of

Telangana, though 31 districts have been formed on 11.10.2016.

Prescription of the erstwhile ten districts, as the unit of transfer, is

therefore not so irrational as to violate Articles 14 and 16 of the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_139">      Where    a   party   seeks   to   impeach   the   validity   of   a

categorization on the ground that it is so unreasonable as to offend

Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, the burden is on him to

plead and prove the infirmity, to set out facts necessary to sustain

the plea of irrationality, and to adduce "cogent and convincing

evidence" to prove those facts, for there is a presumption that every

factor which is relevant or material has been taken into account.

Unless it is unjust on the face of it, the onus lies upon the party

attacking the categorization to show, by pleading and placing the

necessary material before the Court, that it is so unreasonable as

to violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_63">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. (<a href="/doc/1264252/" id="a_64">State of Jammu and

unreasonable in its consequences, (<a href="/doc/682224/" id="a_66">Shri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd.

</p>
<p id="p_140">          It is no part of the respondent's burden to establish its

constitutionality. (Triloki Nath Khosa50). There is a presumption

that the governmental action is reasonable and in public interest,

and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is

wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest.

This burden is a heavy one, and it has to be discharged to the

satisfaction of the Court by proper and adequate material. The

Court cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the

Government is unreasonable or against public interest because

there are large number of considerations which necessarily weigh

with the authorities in taking action.               (<a href="/doc/994816/" id="a_68">Villianur Iyarkkai

any officer or class of officers or any teacher or class of teachers,

appointed or deemed to be appointed under the A.P. Education

Act, into an educational service for the State. Section 2(31) of the

said Act defines 'notification' to mean a notification published in

the State Gazette, and the word 'notified' to be construed

accordingly.   Section 99 is the Rule making power of the State.

Section   99(1)(a)   stipulates      that   the    Government         may,   by

notification, make rules to carry out all or any of the purposes of

the A.P. Education Act.
</p>
<p id="p_151">      Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act requires every Rule

made under the A.P. Education Act, immediately after it is made,

to be laid before each House of the State Legislature if it is in

Session, and, if it is not in Session, in the Session immediately

following, for a total period of 14 days which may be comprised in

one Session or in two successive Sessions; and if, before expiration

of the Session in which it is so laid, or the Session immediately

following, both Houses agree in making any modification in the

Rule, or in the annulment of the Rule, the Rule shall, from the date

on which the modification or annulment is notified, have effect

only in such modified form or shall stand annulled, as the case

may be; however, any such modification or annulment, shall be

without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under

that Rule.
</p>
<p id="p_152">      Section 99(3) is applicable to the 2018 Rules also and, as a

result, these Rules should, immediately after it is issued, be laid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                                48</span>




before each House of the State Legislature if it is in Session. The

earlier session of the Telangana State Legislature concluded on

24.03.2018 when the House was adjourned sine-die. Thereafter no

session of the Telangana State Legislature has been convened so

far. The 2018 Rules were made and notified in G.O.Ms. No.16 on

06.06.2018, and was published in the Telangana State Gazette on

14.06.2018. After the Rules were made on 06.06.2018, no Session

of either House of the Telangana State Legislature has been

convened till date. As the State Legislature is not in Session, the

requirement of Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act, for the

rules to be laid before each House of the State Legislature, is

incapable of compliance till the next Session of each House of the

Telangana State Legislature is convened.
</p>
<p id="p_153">          As is evident, from Section 99(1)(a) of the A.P. Education Act,

the Rules made thereunder would come into force from the date of

its publication in the State Gazette.               Since the 2018 Rules were

published in the Telangana State Gazette on 14.06.2018, they

came into force from that day. The Rules are valid from the date

on which they are made. Non-compliance with the laying clause,

in Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act, does not affect the

validity of the Rule or make it void, as it cannot be regarded as

mandatory. (<a href="/doc/1524072/" id="a_98">K.T. Plantation (P) Ltd. v. State of Karnataka61</a>).

When a statute requires the Rules to be placed before the State

Legislature, it is the obligation of the State to place the same before

the House at the earliest. However, the omission to comply with it

would not affect the validity of the Rules and their coming into

force. (K.T. Plantation (P) Ltd.61; <a href="/doc/281568/" id="a_99">Quarry Owners' Assn. v. State</a>

of Bihar62).       The legislature never intended that non-compliance

with the requirement of laying, as envisaged by Section 99(3),

should render the Rules void. Consequently non-laying of the

Rules before the House, or both Houses of the Legislature, cannot

result in nullification of the Rules. (<a href="/doc/1062704/" id="a_100">Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v.

State of Haryana63</a>; Craies on Statute Law; <a href="/doc/607649/" id="a_101">Jan Mohammad

Noor Mohammad Bagban v. State of Gujarat64</a>; <a href="/doc/65796/" id="a_102">Narendra Kumar

v. Union of India65</a>). The answer to the question, whether laying

of the Rules before the Legislature is mandatory or directory, or

whether laying is a condition precedent to their operation, or can

be neglected without prejudice to the effect of the Rules, would

depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, or the

wording of the Statute under which the Rules are made. (<a href="/doc/127264637/" id="a_103">State of

M.P. v. S.K. Dubey66</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_154">          Craies on Statute Law refers to three kinds of laying -- (i)

laying without further procedure; (ii) laying subject to negative

resolution; and (iii) laying subject to affirmative resolution. The

laying referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 99 is of the second

category because it contemplates that the Rule would have effect

unless modified or annulled by the House of legislature. (<a href="/doc/76884/" id="a_104">Hukam

Chand v. Union of India67</a>; S.K. Dubey66).       Even if Section 99(3),

by reason of the failure to place the Rules before the Legislature, is

presumed to have been violated, the said provision, having regard

to the purposes for which it is made, and in the context in which it

occurs, cannot be regarded as mandatory. (Jan Mohammed Noor

Mohammed Bagban64).           The laying of the Rules before the

legislature, under Section 99(3), is merely directory, and not

mandatory. Even if the Rules are not laid before the House at all,

even then non-compliance with the requirement of laying the Rules

before the legislature, would not be a ground to declare the Rules,

framed under the Statute, ultra vires and invalid.            (<a href="/doc/1396608/" id="a_105">Veneet

Agrawal v. Union of India68</a>; Jan Mohammad Noor Mohammad

Bagban64; Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd.63; Hukam Chand67; <a href="/doc/320068/" id="a_106">Bank

A.P. v. Toddy Tappers Coop. Society70</a>).           Where a statutory

provision is directory, Courts would not interfere to compel the

performance or punish breach of the duty created by such

provision, and disobedience of such a provision would not entail

any invalidity (Craies on Statute Law, Seventh Edn., at p. 229;

Tulsiram Patel25).
</p>
<p id="p_155">          The contention that the 2018 Rules require approval of the

State Legislature, before it would come into force, is not supported

by the plain language of Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act.

As noted hereinabove, the requirement of Section 99(3) is for the

Rules to be laid before both the Houses of the State Legislature for

a total period of 14 days in the session immediately following the

date on which the Rules were notified. The State Legislature has

the power either to annul or to modify the Rules laid before it.

Such annulment or modification is required to be notified in the

State Gazette and, on its being so notified, the Rules shall either

cease to exist if they are annulled, or operate in its modified form if



68   (2007) 13 SCC 116
69   (2003) 2 SCC 721
70   (2003) 12 SCC 738

they are modified. It is evident from Section 99(3) that laying of

the Rules, before each House of the State Legislature, is not a pre-

condition for the Rules to come into force, as even after the Rules

are so placed, and are even annulled or modified, the modification

or annulment (after it is notified in the State Gazette) would not

invalidate        anything        previously        done      under       the     Rules.

Consequently any action taken under the 2018 Rules, after its

notification in the Telangana State Gazette on 14.06.2018, till it is

modified or annulled by the State Legislature, would remain valid.

It is evident, therefore, that the 2018 Rules, which came into force

on its publication in the Telangana State Gazette on 14.06.2018,

need not await the approval of the State Legislature, on its being

laid before it, for it to come into force.

<p id="p_156">          Reliance placed, on behalf of the petitioners, on <a href="/doc/739978/" id="a_108">Union of

India v. National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd71</a>, is

misplaced.         <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_109">Section 16</a> of the Water (Prevention and control of

<a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_110">Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977, which fell for consideration in National

Hydroelectric Power Corpn. Ltd.71, read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "16. Power to amend Schedule I.--(1) The Central Government may, by
      notification in the Official Gazette, add to Schedule I any industry having
      regard to the consumption of water in the carrying on of such industry and
      the consequent discharge thereof resulting in pollution of any stream and
      thereupon Schedule I shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), be
      deemed to be amended accordingly.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            (2) Every such notification shall be laid before each House of Parliament,
      if it is sitting, as soon as may be after the issue of the notification, and if it is
      not sitting, within seven days of its reassembly and the Central Government
      shall seek the approval of Parliament to the notification by a resolution
      moved within a period of fifteen days beginning with the day on which the
      notification is so laid before the House of the People, and if Parliament
      makes any modification in the notification or directs that the notification
      should cease to have effect, the notification shall thereafter have effect only
      in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be, but without
      prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder."

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          While Section 16 (1) gave power to the Central Government

to add to Schedule I any industry, the procedure which was to be

followed was provided by sub-section (2). It is in this context that

the Supreme Court observed: -
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">         "When a notification is issued with a view to making an addition to
Schedule I, the same is required to be laid before each House of Parliament if it
is sitting and if Parliament is not in session then a time-limit of seven days is
prescribed from the reassembly of Parliament within which the notification must
be so placed. Sub-section (2) further requires that after the notification has
been so placed, then within fifteen days of the placing of the notification,
the Central Government has to seek approval of Parliament to the issuance
of the notification. Mere perusal of sub-section (2) shows that there has to
be a positive act of approval by Parliament to the issuance of the
notification before it can be held that Schedule I has been amended.
</blockquote><p id="p_157">Merely laying the notification before each House of Parliament is not
sufficient compliance within the provisions of <a href="/doc/457557/" id="a_111">Section 16(2)</a>. There is of
course no time-limit within which the Houses of Parliament are required to
pass a resolution once the Central Government has sought approval as
contemplated by sub-section (2), but in the present case the pleadings
disclose that no such approval was in fact sought for.

    During the hearing of the writ petitions before the Himachal Pradesh High
Court, an affidavit dated 19-7-1999 was filed by one Dr Jag Ram, Additional
Director in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. In
para 4 of the said affidavit, he states as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        That during the course of hearing on 5-7-1999/7-7-1999 before this
    Hon'ble Court reference was made to the averments made in para 5 of the
    aforementioned affidavit (dated 9-12-1998) by this respondent. In this
    connection, this respondent submits that the requisite records and bulletins
    of Parliament have been further examined. It was found that no resolution
    relating to the above notification dated 16-4-1993, had been moved."</blockquote><p id="p_158">

    We see no reason to disbelieve the correctness of the averment so made in
the said affidavit. The averment made is categorical and unequivocal, namely,
that no resolution relating to the notification dated 16-4-1993 had been moved
in Parliament. If no resolution had been moved, the question of Parliament
giving approval does not arise. Though the first step of placing the
notification in each House of Parliament had been taken, subsequent steps
leading to passing of the resolution were not even commenced with the
moving of the resolution. It is not necessary for us to consider what is the
effect of not moving the resolution within the time frame of 15 days as
prescribed by sub-section (2) as the present case is not where there has
been a delay in moving the resolution. There has been in fact a non-
compliance with the said requirement. With resolution not having been
moved at all, it cannot be held that there was a valid amendment of
Schedule I to the Act. The High Court, in our opinion, was, therefore, right in
coming to the conclusion that this levy and the purported realisation of the cess
was not in accordance with law.............." (emphasis supplied)

       As noted hereinabove, there are three different kinds of

requirements of laying. In National Hydroelectric Power Corpn.

Ltd.71, on which reliance is placed on behalf of the petitioners, the

notification required approval of Parliament for it to come into

force. It is in this context that the Supreme Court held that, since

the Rules have not even been laid before the House, the question of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                  53</span>




its according approval did not arise; and, consequently, no action

could be taken thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_159">      Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act does not require prior

approval of the State Legislature.    It falls in the second category of

laying before the House, and it is only if the State Legislature

either annuls or modifies the Rules would the Rules, after the

modification or annulment is published in the Telangana State

Gazette, operate in its modified form, or cease to remain in force on

its annulment.      Unlike in the present case where the laying

requirement, under Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act is

laying subject to negative resolution, in National Hydroelectric

Power Corpn. Ltd.71, the laying was of the third kind i.e laying

subject to affirmation and, consequently, failure to lay the

notification before Parliament was held to violate the laying

requirement under <a href="/doc/457557/" id="a_112">Section 16(2)</a> of the 1977 <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_113">Cess Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_160">      As the next Session of either of the Houses of the Telangana

State Legislature, after the 2018 Rules were notified in the

Telangana State Gazette on 14.06.2018, has not even been

convened till date, the question of the 2018 Rules being laid before

either of the Houses, of the Telangana State Legislature, does not

arise. The contention that the 2018 Rules are liable to be struck

down, for procedural violation of Section 99(3) of the A.P.

Education Act, 1982, is therefore not tenable.

VII. IS RULE 2 OF THE 2018 RULES A COLOURABLE
     LEGISLATION?
</p>
<p id="p_161">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the Learned

Additional Advocate General, in all his fairness, had submitted

that Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules was made keeping in mind their

intention of integrating the services of government teachers and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                            54</span>




Zilla Parishad Teachers; and this is, evidently, a colourable

legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_162">          It does appear that the intent, behind prescription of the

erstwhile ten Districts as an unit of transfer, is to give effect to

Para 3 (2A) of the Presidential Order; and to integrate teachers

working in Government schools, and local body schools, into one

common cadre, in terms of the 2017 amendment to the

Presidential Order as notified on 23.06.2017 at a later date.

</p><p id="p_163">          The doctrine of colourable legislation does not involve any

question of bona fides or mala-fides on the part of the legislature.

The whole doctrine resolves itself into the question of competency

of a particular legislature to enact a particular law. If the

legislature is competent to pass a particular law, the motives which

impelled it to act are really irrelevant. On the other hand, if the

legislature lacks competency, the question of motive does not arise

at all. Whether a statute is constitutional or not is thus always a

question of power. (<a href="/doc/775246/" id="a_114">Gajapati Narayan Deo v. State of Orissa72</a>; <a href="/doc/1634289/" id="a_115">P.

Vajravelu Mudaliar v. Special Deputy Collector</a> for Land

Acquisition73). When a court says that a particular legislation is a

colourable one, it means that the legislature has transgressed its

legislative powers in a covert or indirect manner. It adopts a device

to outstep the limits of its power. (P. Vajravelu Mudaliar73).

</p><p id="p_164">          Transgression by the legislature, of the limits of its

constitutional power, may be patent, manifest or direct, but it may

also be disguised, covert or indirect and it is to this latter class of

cases that the expression 'colourable legislation' has been applied.

(Gajapati        Narayan       Deo72;      P.   Vajravelu   Mudaliar73).   The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                       55</span>




legislature can only make laws within its legislative competence. Its

legislative field may be circumscribed by specific legislative entries

or limited by fundamental rights created by the Constitution. The

legislature cannot overstep the field of its competency, directly or

indirectly. The court will scrutinize the law to ascertain whether

the legislature by device purports to make a law which, though in

form appears to be within its sphere, in effect and substance,

reaches beyond it. If, in fact, it has power to make the law, its

motives in making the law are irrelevant. (<a href="/doc/948743/" id="a_116">Gullapalli Nageswara

Rao v. Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation74</a>; P.

Vajravelu Mudaliar73).
</p>
<p id="p_165">          The contention, urged on behalf of the petitioners, is that,

when power is exercised under Sections 78 and 99 of the A.P.

Education Act to make Rules, the power, under the proviso to

<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_117">Article 309</a>, cannot be exercised.          It is not even contended, on

behalf of the petitioners, that the Government lacks legislative

competence to make Rules, under Sections 78 and 99 of the A.P.

Education Act, providing for transfer of teachers.

</p><p id="p_166">          The bonafides of the Government, in making the 2018 Rules,

is irrelevant in examining whether or not the Rules so made is a

colourable legislation.        It is the competence of the Rule making

authority to make the Rules which is relevant. As it is evident that

the State Government has the power to make the 2018 Rules, the

contention, that these rules are a colourable piece of legislation,

necessitates rejection.

Rules, notified in G.O.Ms. No.10 dated 23.01.2009 which are

applicable to Zilla Parishad schools, prescribes a Revenue District

as a unit of transfer; likewise the Rules, notified in G.O.Ms. No.12

dated 23.01.2009, are applicable to local body schools only; Rule 2

of the 2018 Rules, which prescribes the erstwhile ten districts as a

unit of transfer, falls foul of the earlier rules which are still in

force; the 2018 Rules have only superseded the transfer rules

notified in G.O.Ms. No.15 dated 26.01.2009, and not the rules

notified in G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009; the rules, in

G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12, relate to aspects other than transfer also;

consequently, these Rules cannot be presumed to have been

superseded; there cannot be different units in different sets of

Rules, one for promotion and seniority, and the other for transfer;

as the Rules, notified in G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009,

prescribe the Revenue District as a Unit, the existing 31 Revenue

Districts constitute a unit not only for promotion and seniority, but

also for transfer; even if these rules, to the extent it provided for

transfer, are presumed to have been superseded by the 2018

Rules, and as the impugned Rules do not provide for promotion

and seniority, the rules in G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 dated

23.01.2009 would continue to govern promotion and seniority of

local body teachers; and the action of the respondents, in applying
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                  57</span>




the Presidential Order even for transfer of teachers in local body

schools, is ultravires <a href="/doc/1466428/" id="a_119">Article 371-D</a> of the Constitution of India, and

the Presidential Order.
</p>
<p id="p_169">      As reliance is placed on G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated

23.01.2009, on behalf of the petitioners, it is necessary to refer to

the said Rules to the extent they are relevant to the cases on hand.

G.O.Ms.No.10 dated 23.01.2009 are the adhoc Rules applicable to

the posts of Head Masters Grade-II (Gazetted) in Zilla Praja

Parishad Schools. Rule 2 of these Rules prescribes the method of

appointment as recruitment by transfer from Class I of the A.P.

School Educational Subordinate Service of Zilla Praja Parishad

Schools, and the appointing authority as the Regional Joint

Director of School Education of the Zone concerned.             Rule 8

prescribes the unit of appointment and thereunder, for the

purpose of appointment, seniority, discharge for want of vacancy,

transfer and reappointment, the unit shall be the Revenue District

concerned, except Hyderabad.
</p>
<p id="p_170">      G.O.Ms.No.12     dated   23.01.2009   are   the   adhoc      Rules

applicable to the posts of teachers in Mandal Praja Parishad and

Zilla Praja Parishad Schools. Rule 2, thereunder, prescribes the

method of appointment and the appointing authority. For the post

of School Assistant, Secondary Grade Teacher, Elementary Grade

Teacher/Higher    Grade    Teacher,    Language    Pandit    etc     the

</p>
<p id="p_171">      It is necessary to note that the adhoc rules, notified in

G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009, were made in the

exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 78 and 99 of the

Andhra Pradesh Education Act, 1982, and the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_120">Article

309</a> of the Constitution of India, and in supercession of the adhoc

Rules issued in G.O.Ms.No.182 and 183 dated 30.12.2008.            The

2018 Rules were also made in the exercise of the powers conferred

by Sections 78 and 99 of the Telangana Education Act, 1982 and

under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_121">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India, and in supercession

of all earlier Rules and Guidelines on transfer of teachers. As the

2018 Rules have superseded all the earlier rules and guidelines,

and as these Rules relate only to transfers, the corresponding

Rules relating to transfers, in the earlier adhoc Rules notified in

G.O.Ms.Nos.10     and   12   dated     23.01.2009,   have   also   been

superseded. Reliance placed by the petitioners on the 2009 adhoc

Rules is, therefore, misplaced.
</p>
<p id="p_172">      We also find no merit in the submission, urged on behalf of

the petitioners, that the 2018 Rules supersede only the Rules

notified in G.O.Ms.No.15 dated 26.01.2009. The Rules notified in

G.O.Ms.No.15 dated 26.01.2009 are titled as "the Andhra Pradesh

Teachers (General Promotions and Regulation of Transfers) Rules, 2009",

and relate to promotions and transfers in the categories of Head

Masters Grade-II Gazetted, School Assistants and SGTs and their

equivalent categories in the A.P. School Educational Service Rules,

and the A.P. School Educational Subordinate Service Rules

working in Government Schools, ZPP and MPP Schools in the

State. As the Rules, notified in G.O.Ms.No.15 dated 26.01.2009,

relate both to promotion and transfer, the contention that they are

applicable only to transfers and, consequently, it is only these

rules which are superseded by the 2018 Rules, which are also

applicable only to transfers, is not tenable.           The 2018 Rules,

notified in G.O.Ms.No.16 dated 06.06.2018, has, by the use of the

words "in supersession of all the earlier rules and guidelines on transfer of

teachers" made it clear that all the earlier Rules, on transfer of

teachers, stand superseded by the 2018 Rules, be it the Rules

notified in G.O.Ms.No.15 dated 26.01.2009 or the rules notified in

G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009.              In the absence of a

specific reference only to G.O.Ms.No.15 dated 26.01.2009, in the

2018 Rules notified in G.O.Ms.No.16 dated 06.06.2018, the

submission that the 2018 rules have superseded only the Rules

notified in G.O.Ms.No.15 dated 26.01.2009 does not merit

acceptance.
</p>
<p id="p_173">       It is true that, consequent on the 2018 Rules being made

and notified in G.O.Ms. No.16 dated 06.06.2018, and as it only

supersedes all earlier rules relating to transfers, the Rules notified

in G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 both dated 23.01.2009, in so far as it

relates to promotion and seniority, would still remain in force; and,

since they prescribe the Revenue District as a unit for promotion

and seniority, it does appear that the present 31 Districts would be

the unit for promotion and seniority unless the State Government

amends the Rules notified in G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 dated

23.01.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_174">      While Rule 8, of the Rules notified in G.O.Ms. No.10 dated

23.01.2009, stipulates that, for the purpose of appointment,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                   60</span>




seniority, discharge, transfer and re-appointment, the unit of

appointment shall be the Revenue District and Rule 9, of the Rules

notified in G.O.Ms. No.12 dated 23.01.2009, stipulates that, for the

purpose    of   recruitment,   appointment,    seniority,   discharge,

promotion, transfer and re-appointment, the unit of appointment

shall be the Revenue District, it must be borne in mind that these

Rules were made in January, 2009 nearly eight years prior to the

formation of the 31 Districts on 11.10.2016. During the relevant

time the Revenue Districts, and the Districts notified as a local

cadre for certain posts and as a local area for certain other posts,

were the same i.e., the erstwhile ten Districts of the present State

of Telangana.
</p>
<p id="p_175">      It is no doubt true that in the light of the 2018 Rules, which

prescribes the erstwhile ten Districts as a unit of transfer, there

would be an incongruity between the 2018 Rules and the Rules

notified in G.O.Ms. Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009 since, in the

absence of any amendment to the 2009 Rules, a Revenue District

would be the unit for seniority, promotion etc. The fact, however,

remains that, even if the 2018 Rules had not been made, there

would still have been an incongruity, since the Presidential Order

requires recruitment, even to local body schools, to be made within

a local area which is within one of the ten Districts referred to in

the Presidential Order.   As the Presidential Order has overriding

effect over all other laws in force, notwithstanding the Rules in

G.O.Ms.Nos.10 and 12 dated 23.01.2009 as it now applies to the

present 31 Districts, the erstwhile ten Districts are still required to

be treated as the unit for recruitment; and consequently, while the

erstwhile ten Districts would continue to remain the unit for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                     61</span>




recruitment, the present 31 Revenue Districts would be the unit

for seniority, promotion etc. It is not as if striking down the 2018

Rules would put an end to this incongruity which has arisen

because the Presidential Order has not been so amended as to

recognise the formation of the present 31 Districts in the State of

Telangana.

Rules made and notified in G.O.Ms.No.16 dated 06.06.2018, since

been specifically superseded by the 2018 Rules. Rule 4 in Part II

of the Rules notified in G.O.Ms.No.278 dated 20.06.1983 is in

conflict with the 2018 Rules; the erstwhile District Development

Officer is now the Chief Executive Officer in Zilla Praja Parishads;

and since 31 districts have now come into existence, it is the Chief

Executive Officer of the Zilla Praja Parishads, in each of the newly

India; the Government had been issuing orders, regulating service

conditions of teachers from time to time, by virtue of the provisions

contained in Sections 51 and 69 of A.P. Panchayat Samithis and

Zilla Parishads Act, 1959 (for short the "1959 Act"), finally repealed

by the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1994; under the said rules, notified

in G.O.Ms.No.278 dated 20.06.1983, part "II" was specifically

framed in respect of employees including teachers in Panchayat

Samithis and Zilla Parishads, and Part I specifically dealt with

teachers and teaching staff working in Government schools; as the

Government had already framed Rules, for teachers working in

Panchayat    Raj      Institutions,        the   question   that    arose    for

consideration was whether the          Government could            issue    G.O.

Ms. No.538 by virtue of the power conferred under Sections 78 and

99 of A.P. Education Act, and by virtue of the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_126">Article 309</a>

of the Constitution of India in respect of the same service; and in

effect the submission was when Rules were framed under the

Panchayat Raj Act, the said Rules occupy the field, and the Rules

framed under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_127">Article 309</a> cannot be said to override

the earlier Rules unless they are specifically repealed.

to disagree with this submission in view of the decisions of the

Supreme Court in A.B. Krishna75 and Chandra Prakash Tiwari76,

and accordingly held that it was incompetent for the Government

to issue the Rules in G.O. Ms. No.538. The Division bench

observed that the finding recorded by the Tribunal, that the rules

in   G.O.   Ms.    No.278,   dated     2.6.1983      treating   teachers      in

Government Schools as one unit and teachers working in

scheme of localisation in G.O. Ms. No.529 dated 14.5.1976, was

unwarranted; in the O.As. the challenge was not to G.O. Ms.

No.278 but to G.O. Ms. Nos.538 and 505 only; and, hence, the said

finding was being set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_181">      The law declared by the Supreme Court, in A.B. Krishna75

and Chandra Prakash Tiwari76, is that the rule-making authority,

under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_128">Article 309</a> of the Constitution and an Act is

the same, namely, the Government (to be precise, the Governor

under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_129">Article 309</a>, and the Government under the relevant

statutory provision), but the two jurisdictions are different; the

power under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_130">Article 309</a> cannot be exercised by the Governor, if

the Legislature has already made a law, and the field is occupied;

in that situation, Rules can be made under the law so made by the

Legislature, and not under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_131">Article 309</a> of the Constitution; the

Rules, made in exercise of the rule- making power given under an

Act, constitute delegated or subordinate legislation; but the rules

under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_132">Article 309</a> cannot be treated to fall in that category; and

therefore, on the principle of "occupied field", the Rules under

<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_133">Article 309</a> cannot supersede the rules made by the Legislature.

in various categories of teachers in Mandal Praja Parishads and

Zilla Praja Parishads, and prescribed the appointing authority.

Thereunder, the District Development Officer is the appointing

authority for the posts of Headmasters/Headmistresses, School

Assistants and Grade-I Pandits in respect of Zilla Praja Parishads

Schools and Mandal Praja Parisahd Schools, and all other

categories in Zilla Praja Parishad Schools.    Rule 11, in Part II of

Chairman, Zilla Praja Parishad or the President, Mandal Praja

Parishad as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_183">      The attention of the Division Bench, in M. Kesavulu1, does

not appear to have been drawn to the fact that the 1983 Rules

were also made in the exercise of the powers conferred by the

proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_134">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India, besides the Rule

making power conferred under the 1959 Act. As the 1983 Rules

were also made in the exercise of powers conferred under the

proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_135">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India, it can always be

Legislature on the matter (i.e an Act under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_139">Article 309</a> of the

Constitution of India), the rules made under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_140">Article

observed that the Governor possessed legislative power under the

Constitution; by <a href="/doc/1555093/" id="a_141">Article 168</a> the Governor of a State was a part of

the legislature of the State; the most obvious exercise of legislative

power by the Governor was the power given to him by <a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_142">Article 213</a>

to promulgate ordinances when the legislature was not in session;

under <a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_143">Article 213</a>, the Governor exercised power of the same kind

which the legislature normally exercises i.e., the power to make

laws; the heading of Chapter IV of Part VI of the Constitution, in

which <a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_144">Article 213</a> occurs, is "legislative power of the Governor"; the

power of the Governor, under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_145">Article 309</a> to make

appropriate rules, was of the same kind; it was a legislative power;

under <a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_146">Article 213</a>, the Governor substitutes for the legislature

because the legislature is in recess; and under the proviso to

<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_147">Article 309</a>, the Governor substitutes for the legislature because

the legislature has not yet exercised its power to pass an

power of rule making under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_148">Article 309</a> of the

possibility of inconsistent decisions on points of law, by different

Division Benches, a rule has been evolved, in order to promote

consistency and certainty in the development of the law and its

contemporary status, that the statement of the law by a Division

lesser number of Judges. (<a href="/doc/505842/" id="a_155">Union of India v. Raghubir Singh78</a>;

jurisdiction over the areas covered by the erstwhile 10 districts, till

new Zilla Parishads, Mandal Parishads and Gram Panchayats are

constituted in accordance with law. It is not in dispute that new

Zilla Parishads, Mandal Parishads and Gram Panchayats are yet to

be constituted, since elections to Panchayat bodes, have not been

held after the 31 new districts were formed vide G.O.Ms.No.249

dated 11.10.2016. Consequently, it is the very same erstwhile 10

districts which continue to have 10 Chief Executive Officers of Zilla

Parishads; and, even in terms of G.O.Ms.No.278 dated 20.06.1983,

it would only be the Chief Executive Officer of the erstwhile 10

districts (Zilla Parishads) who would be the competent authority.

availing the special provisions in G.O.Ms.No.61, dt. 24.5.2018, the

School Education (Service II) Department issued G.O.Ms.No. 16,

dated 06.06.2018 notifying the Telangana Teachers (Regulation of

of Head Masters, Grade II (Gazetted) and Teachers working in

root of orderly administration of law. (<a href="/doc/315635/" id="a_181">Mannalal Jain v. State of

operational guidelines, for transfer of teachers to be formulated.

The       Government      has,   instead     of   formulating    operational

guidelines, chosen to frame Rules instead. The question whether

the executive instructions, in G.O.Ms.No.61 darted 24.05.2018,

would have sufficed, and whether it was necessary to issue the

2018 Rules are wholly irrelevant in considering whether or not the

2018       Rules    are   constitutionally   valid.    Whether    executive

instructions would suffice, or whether Rules should be made, are

again matters for the Government to decide, and not the Courts to

2(31) of the A.P. Education Act requires Rules to be notified in the

Gazettee; and even under Section 15 of the A.P. (Telangana Area

General Clause Act 1308 Fasli), the same is the requirement.

</p><p id="p_211">      This contention does not merit acceptance as the 2018 Rules

notified in G.O.Ms.No.16 dated 06.06.2018 were published in the

Telangana Gazette on 14.06.2018, copy of which has been

enclosed along with the written submissions filed by the Learned

Additional Advocate-General.
</p>
<p id="p_212">XII. IS TRANSFER OF SEVERAL EMPLOYEES, JUST PRIOR TO
     THE 2018 RULES BEING NOTIFIED, A MALAFIDE
     EXERCISE OF POWER?
</p>
<p id="p_213">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the

respondents had transferred a select few teachers, numbering

around 300, within the existing the 31 new Districts, for

extraneous considerations, that too by relaxing the ban on

transfers, just prior to the issuance of the impugned Rules, to

ensure that these 300 posts are not shown in the present transfer

counselling; and this action on their part is malafide and is liable

to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_214">      While the documents annexed to the Writ Petition reflect

some teachers being transferred within the present 31 Districts,

the petitioners allege that such transfers were for extraneous

reasons. While transfer of a select few teachers, just on the eve of

the 2018 Rules being made and notified on 06.06.2018, does

create doubts on the legitimacy of such transfers, it is only if those,

who were extended the benefit of such transfers, are arrayed as

respondents in the Writ Petition, and are afforded an opportunity

of filing their counter-affidavits, can this question be examined.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                    77</span>
</p><p id="p_215">      As elaborate arguments were advanced in these Writ

Petitions, on several other issues, we had asked the Learned Senior

Counsel and the Learned Counsel for the petitioners, and the

Learned Additional Advocate-General appearing on behalf of the

respondents, whether these Writ Petitions could be finally disposed

of at the stage of admission itself. We had also pointed out that,

while the legal contentions urged by Learned Senior Counsel and

Learned Counsel on either side could be examined without the

respondents being called upon to file their counter-affidavit, this

contention, of transfers being effected for extraneous reasons,

could only be examined after counter-affidavits are filed by them.

</p><p id="p_216">      Both Sri S. Ramachander Rao and Sri M. Surender Rao,

Learned Senior Counsel, fairly stated that, with a view to enable

the Court to finally decide the Writ Petitions even in the absence of

counter-affidavits being filed by the respondents, they did not

press for an adjudication on this issue.              Learned Additional

Advocate-General, appearing for the State of Telangana, also

agreed that these Writ Petitions could be finally decided even

though no counter-affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

respondents.    We,   therefore,   refrain    from     adjudicating   the

contentions urged under this head.           Suffice it to leave these

questions open for consideration in independent legal proceedings,

if any, instituted by the petitioners herein later.

XIII: OTHER CONTENTIONS:
</p>
<p id="p_217">(A). IS RESORT TO WEB-COUNSELLING, FOR EFFECTING
     TRANSFERS, ILLEGAL?
</p>
<p id="p_218">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that Rule 2 of

the 2018 Rules mandates that transfers shall be made by way of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                   78</span>




online/web counselling, though none of the teachers have

knowledge of web counselling; if on-line/web counselling is

allowed, almost all teachers would be required to opt for more than

3000 schools which is an impossible task; as this on-line/web

counselling failed in the State of A.P, it had reverted to off-line

counselling; yet the respondents are insisting on web counselling;

and their action is arbitrary and illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_219">      Regarding the petitioners complaint of lack of knowledge of

web counseling, on the basis of which transfers are sought to be

effected, it can justifiably be contended that it would be difficult for

those, ignorant of its nuances, to exercise their option through this

process. Learned Additional Advocate-General would submit that

the process of web counseling has been resorted to only with a

view to avoid the possibility of officials being influenced, by those

who are now subjected to transfer, to transfer them to a place of

their choice. It is unnecessary for us to dwell on this issue since

difficulties, if any, faced by a section of the teachers would not, by

itself, justify the 2018 Rules being struck down.         Suffice it to

observe that if those, who are unfamiliar with the web counseling

process, seek assistance, the State Government should provide

them necessary guidance to enable them to exercise their option

through the web counseling process. As resort to web counseling

cannot, by itself, be said to violate Articles 14 and 16 of the

Constitution of India, we find it difficult to agree with the

submission, urged on behalf of the petitioners, that resort to the

web counseling process, for effecting transfers, is illegal and

unconstitutional.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                   79</span><p id="p_220">




(B). IS FAILURE TO GIVE SPOUSE CASES TOP PRIORITY, IN
     THE 2018 RULES, FATAL?
</p>
<p id="p_221">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that, while

effecting transfers in all departments, spouse cases are being given

first priority; strangely, in the impugned rules, instead of giving

first priority to spouse cases, the respondents are giving only ten

points which is nothing but class discrimination.

</p><p id="p_222">      While statutory Rules, or Rules made under the proviso to

<a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_184">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India, can be struck down if it is

contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, including Part-III

thereof, what the petitioners, in effect, seek from this Court is to

include spouse cases as the first priority in the 2018 Rules.      It

would be wholly impermissible for this Court to undertake any

such exercise, since that would not only result in judicial

legislation, but would also amount to the Court usurping the Rule

making power of the Government regarding which category should

be given top priority. These are all matters for the Rule making

authority to decide, and not for this Court to impose. It is only if

persons similarly situated are treated differently can the plea of

discrimination be sustained.      Whether spouse cases should be

given first priority, or whether such category of teachers should be

given 10 points instead, are matters for the Government, in its

wisdom, to prescribe and, save violation of Articles 14 and 16 of

the Constitution of India, no interference is called for.

(C). ARE PROMOTIONS REQUIRED TO BE MADE BEFORE
     EFFECTING TRANSFERS?
</p>
<p id="p_223">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that it is the

practice in vogue, for the last several years, that, before effecting

transfers, promotions are made; as per G.O.Ms. No.32 dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                       80</span>




12.09.2016, the respondents are required to effect promotions

every year; the respondents had effected promotions before

transfers in 2015; though the petitioners were awaiting promotions

for the last three years, and though there are vacancies, the

respondents, without giving promotions, are seeking to effect

transfers at the cost of students.
</p>
<p id="p_224">
</p><p id="p_225">       No Rule, either under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_185">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India

or under any Statute, has been brought to our notice which

obligates the State Government to always make promotions before

effecting transfers. The mere fact that such a practice is said to

have existed earlier cannot, in the absence of any such statutory

obligation on the Government to do so, be said to have violated any

of the petitioners rights. This contention is only to be noted to be

rejected.

XIV. IS RULE 4 OF THE 2018 RULES, IN MAKING THE

<p id="p_227">       It is contended on behalf of teachers, appointed and working

constituted 31 districts, who are alone the competent authority;

the DEOs of the erstwhile revenue districts should not have been

named as the competent authority for issue of transfer and posting

orders; and though the post of District Educational Officers, of the

erstwhile ten districts, are not in existence, strangely Rule 4 states

that, for effecting transfers, the District Educational Officers of the

the respondents, would submit that, in the place of the erstwhile

District Educational Officers, the Regional Joint Director of School

Education will be asked to issue transfer and posting orders duly

and management wise.
</p>
<p id="p_230">
</p><p id="p_231">      Rule 4 of the 2018 Rules relates to the competent authority

for issue of transfer and posting orders and, thereunder, the

District Educational Officer of the erstwhile Revenue District shall

consult the District Educational Officers of the newly formed 31

Districts in effecting transfers.        It is not in dispute that,

consequent on the formation of 31 new revenue Districts, District

Educational Officers have been appointed in each of these 31

Districts of the State of Telangana, and there is no post of District

Educational Officer now in existence in relation to the erstwhile ten

Districts.   Since the State Government has chosen to appoint

District Educational Officers in each of the new 31 Districts, and

these officers no longer exercise jurisdiction over the erstwhile ten

Districts, Rule 4, whereunder the District Educational Officer of

the erstwhile ten Revenue Districts are designated as the

competent authority to effect transfer of School Assistants/SGTs

and equivalent cadres, is irrational, since a non-existent authority

has been made the competent authority for issuing transfer and

posting orders.

</p><p id="p_233">        The 1975 Presidential Order does not prescribe who should

be the competent authority for appointment, promotion, transfers

etc.    It only requires a District to be treated as a unit for the

organisation of certain local cadres, and as a local area in certain

contingencies, and stipulates the erstwhile ten Districts as such

Units. As the 1975 Presidential Order has no application, in the

context of Rule 4 of 2018 Rules, the State Government was not

obligated to prescribe that the DEOs of the erstwhile ten Districts

should be the competent authority when there is no longer such a

post in existence.        Prescription of a non-existent competent

authority, as the person to effect transfers, is irrational and

unreasonable, and is in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the

Constitution of India.          Rule 4 of the 2018 Rules is therefore

ultravires Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, and is

liable to be struck down.

XV. CONCLUSION:
</p>
<p id="p_235">
</p><p id="p_236">        While we find no merit in the submissions put forth on

behalf of the petitioners, on all other contentions, as indicated

hereinabove, we are satisfied that Rule 4 of the 2018 Rules, which

prescribes the District Educational Officers of the erstwhile

Districts as the competent authority to effect transfers of teachers

in local body schools, (which post is no longer in existence

consequent on 31 District Educational Officers being appointed to

the newly formed 31 Districts), is ultravires Articles 14 and 16 of

the Constitution of India. Rule 4 of the Rules, notified in G.O.Ms.

No.16 dated 06.06.2018, is therefore declared unconstitutional.

All    the   Writ   Petitions    are,    accordingly,   disposed   of.   The

miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed. No

costs.
