<p id="p_2">[2]        Applicants have filed these petitions under

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. for quashment of the order dated

05.01.2015 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Dewas in Criminal Case No.168/2015 on 05.01.2015,

whereby took cognizance against the applicants under

<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_2">Sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_3">47</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 [in brief "the Act"].

[3]        Brief facts of this case are that non-applicant

No.1 filed a private complaint under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_5">Sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_6">47</a>

the Act stating that as per the report by the State Board

Analyst the company has caused water pollution on

account of the fact that treated factory effluent at outlet

of effluent treatment plant before reuse in plantation

was found to be contaminated. Thus, Company and its

Directors have committed offence under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_7">Section 44</a> and

<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_8">47</a> of the Act, 1974. On this basis learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Dewas vide order dated 05.01.2015 took

cognizance against the company and its Directors
 including the applicants. The applicants have filed these

petitions on the ground that there is no averment in the

complaint as to how the applicants are connected with

the offence. No specific role has been assigned to the

applicants except a bald statement that the applicants

are the Director of the company, hence, the order of

taking cognizance against the applicants for the

aforesaid offence be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_3">[4]        Non-applicant No.1 has filed the reply of

these applications stating that non-applicant No.2

company has applied for a valid consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_9">Sections

25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_10">26</a> of the Act, 1974. Consent for one year to the

non-applicant No.2 company has been granted on

29.06.2009 with general and special conditions,

thereafter it was renewed for three years with some

additional conditions. Non-applicant No.1 sent notice

dated 05.03.2012 to the Directors through non-applicant

No.2 for violating consent conditions. The consent was

again renewed on 27.09.2013. Non-applicant No.2 has

not complied the consent conditions, hence, a show

cause notice dated 15.07.2014 was issued to the
 applicants for filing their reply. However, they have not

filed any reply. As per the analyst's report dated

10.11.2014 it was found that the trade effluent was not

in the prescribed limit. The applicants are the Directors

of the company and have not filed any reply to the

show cause notice issued by the non-applicant No.1,

therefore, they are equally liable to the conduct of the

non-applicant No.2 company. Thus, these petitions be

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">[5]           I have heard learned Counsel for the parties

and perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">[6]           The question for consideration is that at the

time of commission of alleged offence whether the

applicants were incharge of and were responsible to the

company for conduct of the business of the company.

[7]      For this purpose it is useful to refer the judgment

of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sunil Bharti

Mittal V/s. CBI., [(2015) 4 SCC 609] in which Hon'ble

Apex Court held as under [See page 637 - Para 40 to

</p><p id="p_6">44) :-
</p><p id="p_7"> 40. It is abundantly clear from the above that
the principle which is laid down is to the effect
that the criminal intent of the "alter ego" of the
company, that is the personal group of persons
that guide the business of the company, would be
imputed to the company/corporation. The legal
proposition that is laid down in the aforesaid
judgment in Iridium India case is that if the
person or group of persons who control the
affairs of the company commit an offence with a
criminal intent, their criminality can be imputed
to the company as well as they are "alter ego" of
the company.
</p>
<p id="p_8">41. In the present case, however, this principle
is applied in an exactly reverse scenario. Here,
company is the accused person and the learned
Special Magistrate has observed in the impugned
order that since the appellants represent the
directing mind and will of each company, their
state of mind is the state of mind of the company
and, therefore, on this premise, acts of the
company are attributed and imputed to the
appellants. It is difficult to accept it as the correct
principle of law. As demonstrated hereinafter,
this proposition would run contrary to the
principle of vicarious liability detailing the
circumstances under which a Director of a
company can be held liable.
</p>
<p id="p_9">(iii) Circumstances when Director /person in
charge of the affairs of the company can also
be prosecuted, when the company is an
accused person.
</p><p id="p_10"> 42. No doubt, a corporate entity is an artificial
person which acts through its officers, Directors,
Managing Director, Chairman, etc. If such a
company commits an offence involving mens
rea, it would normally be the intent and action of
that individual who would act on behalf of the
company. It would be more so, when the criminal
act is that of conspiracy. However, at the same
time, it is the cardinal principle of criminal
jurisprudence that there is no vicarious liability
unless the statute specifically provides so.

</p><p id="p_11">43. Thus, an individual who has perpetrated
the commission the commission of an offence on
behalf of a company can be made an accused,
along with the company, if there is sufficient
evidence of his active role coupled with criminal
intent. Second situation in which he can be
implicated is in those cases where the statutory
regime itself attracts the doctrine of vicarious
liability, by specifically incorporating such a
provision.
</p>
<p id="p_12">44. When the company is the offender,
vicarious liability of the Directors cannot be
imputed automatically, in the absence of any
statutory provision to this effect. One such
example is <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_11">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881. In Aneeta Hada, the
Court noted that if a group of persons that guide
the business of the company have the criminal
intent, that would be imputed to the body
corporate and it is in this backdrop, <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_12">Section 141</a>
of the Negotiable Instruments Act has to be
understood. Such a position is, therefore, because
of statutory intendment making it a deeming
       fiction. Here also, the principle of "alter ego",
      was applied only in one direction, namely, where
      a group of persons that guide the business had
      criminal intent, that is to be imputed to the body
      corporate and not the vice versa. Otherwise, there
      has to be a specific act attributed to the Director
      or any other person allegedly in control and
      management of the company, to the effect that
      such a person was responsible for the acts
      committed by or on behalf of the company.

[10]                 With the aforesaid, it is apparent that in the

complaint no role attributed to the applicants except

the bald statement that the applicants are the Directors
 of the company, hence, the affairs of the company are

under their direct control and they are liable for conduct

and transactions of the company. Even there is no

averment in the documents annexed with the complaint

as to how the applicants are responsible for the conduct

of the business of the company. In the impugned order

of taking cognizance CJM while issuing process under

<a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_14">Section 204</a> of Cr.P.C. against the applicants without

ascribing any incriminating role to them, solely on the

basis that their company is accused and they have the

"alter ego" were vicariously liable. Hon'ble Apex Court

held that when a company is accused its Director can be

roped in only if there is sufficient incriminating

evidence against them coupled with criminal intent or

the statutory regime attracts the doctrine of vicarious

liability.
</p>
<p id="p_17">[11]         In the present case learned CJM did not

ascribe any incriminating role of the applicants or any

statutory regime which attracts vicarious liability,

therefore, the order of CJM issuing process against the

applicants is liable to be set aside, hence, it is set aside.
 However, it is made clear that it will be open to the

CJM to undertake the exercise of going through the

material on record and on that basis if he satisfied that

there is enough incriminating material on record to

proceed against the applicants, he may pass appropriate

orders in this behalf. Even if at this stage, no such

prima facie material is found but during the trial

sufficient    incriminating   material   against   these

applicants surfaces in form of evidence the CJM shall

be at liberty to exercise his powers under <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_15">Section 319</a> of

Cr.P.C. to rope in the applicants by passing appropriate

orders in accordance with law at that stage.

[12]         The impugned order dated 05.01.2015

passed against the applicants are hereby set aside with

the aforesaid liberty.
