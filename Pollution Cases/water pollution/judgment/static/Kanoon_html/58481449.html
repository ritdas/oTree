     labs etc., termed as Bio-medical Waste, is required to be disposed

     of in terms of the Rules framed by the Government of India, in

     exercise of the powers conferred upon it by <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_1">Sections 5</a>, <a href="/doc/30610064/" id="a_2">8</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_3">25</a>

     of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, known as the Bio-

     Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 (for short,

     'the Rules of 1998'), repealed now by the Bio-Medical Waste

     Management Rules, 2016 with effect from 28-3-2016. Central

     Pollution Control Board has on 25-9-2003 issued guidelines for

     establishment of Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facility

     (CBWTF).
</p>
<p id="p_12">  2. The petitioner with due permission of the competent authority

     established a Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Plant at

     Industrial Area, Bhilai for disposal of medical waste in Durg, Bhilai

     and Raipur cities for which requisite authorisation was granted

     under Rule 8 of the Rules of 1998 subject to conditions mentioned

     in the memo dated 7-4-2003 to establish and operate CBWTF for

     Durg, Bhilai and Raipur cities only.
</p>
<p id="p_13">  3. It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner is successfully

     running the said CBWTF whereas it is the case of respondents

     No.2 and 3 that the petitioner failed to maintain the said CBWTF

     leading to grant of consent to establish under the provisions of
                                                   W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

  'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>') and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution)

  Act</a>, 1974 (for short, 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a>'), to respondent No.5.

</p><p id="p_14">4. Thus, the petitioner seeks to challenge the consent granted on 31-

  3-2012 to respondent No.5 for establishing Common Bio-Medical

  Waste Treatment Plant for capacity of two ton per day at

  P.H.No.20, Khasra No.70/(1, 2, 5), Village Siltara, Dharsiwa, Distt.

  Raipur subject to fulfillment of certain conditions clearly providing

  that consent for operation as required under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a> and

  the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a> shall be granted to respondent No.5 after fulfillment

  of all the conditions mentioned in the memo dated 31-3-2012.

</p><p id="p_15">5. The petitioner has challenged the said order dated 31-3-2012

  preliminary on the ground that the petitioner has established

  CBWTF for Raipur, Durg and Bhilai, making its capital investment

  on land allotted to the petitioner in industrial estate on payment

  of premium and ground rent, and pursuant to selection and

  allotment of CBWTF, respondent No.2 has granted provisional

  authorisation on 7-4-2003 with a specific area prescription of

  Raipur, Durg and Bhilai cities only. The said authorisation was kept

  on renewing and latest authorisation is valid up to 6-4-2018 in

  which the petitioner has made huge capital investment as per the

  guidelines of Central Pollution Control Board and also made huge

  investment for up-gradation as per the direction of respondent

  No.2 in the financial years 2013-14 and 2015-14. The main ground

  raised in the petition is that the guidelines of 2003 issued by

  Central Pollution Control Board clearly bar installation of second
                                                   W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           Page 4 of 33</span>

  CBWTF in the same area until the minimum bed capacity of 10,000

  is achieved as it further prescribes the area restriction for second

  CBWTF and in the present case, the bar undisputedly attracts,

  therefore, the permission granted in violation of mandatory

  norms of the Central Pollution Control Board is illegal and without

  authority of law, as such, the order Annexure P-1 dated 31-3-2012

  deserves to be quashed. Establishment of CBWTF is a statutory

  assignment and specific procedure and power to establish the

  same has been given in the Rules of 1998 and therefore CBWTF is

  a public utility and as such, a private entrepreneur cannot be

  granted permission by mere asking.
</p>
<p id="p_16">6. Return has been filed by the State Environment Conservation

  Board controverting the allegations made in the writ petition and

  stating inter alia that the order Annexure P-1 granting consent to

  establish is an appealable order under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>

  and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a>. The order Annexure P-1 dated 31-3-2002 was

  passed way back and the writ petition has only been filed on 13-6-

  2016 as such there is delay of more than four years which has not

  been explained satisfactorily by the petitioner and on that

  ground, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed with exemplary

  costs. The guidelines issued by Central Pollution Control Board in

  the year 2002 are non-statutory in nature, they are rather only

  regulatory as well as recommendatory in nature, they have no

  statutory force, therefore, it cannot be enforced through the

  court of law.     There is no statutory provision in law for

  establishment of any number of CBWTF either under the
                                                   W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                           Page 5 of 33</span>

  provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 or under the

  Rules of 1998 and the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution

  Control Board. In the affidavit filed pursuant to the order of this

  Court, the Central Pollution Control Board had clearly stated that

  the guidelines are not mandated under the Rules of 1998 as

  amended. The CBWTF established by the petitioner has failed to

  perform the duty entrusted to it for which from time to time,

  order under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_13">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986

  has been passed for compliance of terms and conditions of the

  consent order and even the petitioner has submitted in writing

  that it may be allowed to close down the said plant, as it had failed

  to fulfill the terms and conditions of the consent granted to it.

  The National Green Tribunal has emphasised the need of further

  CBWTF in the State of Chhattisgarh finding the CBWTF available

  at present to be inefficient and inadequate, as such, writ petition

  deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">7. Private respondent No.5 has also filed a separate return strongly

  opposing the writ petition mainly on the ground of delay of more

  than four years which is said to be unexplained and inordinate in

  nature and further adopted the stand of respondents No.2 and 3

  that there is no bar in establishing further CBWTF in the State of

  Chhattisgarh, as the petitioner's plant was found non-functional

  by the State Environment Conservation Board which is clear from

  the return filed supported by documents and which clearly

  demonstrate that the petitioner has failed to fulfill the terms and

  conditions. Even otherwise, the plant has been established only
                                                   W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           Page 6 of 33</span>

  for Durg, Bhilai and Raipur cities, not for other areas and the

  guidelines issued by Central Pollution Control Board are only

  directory in nature, they are not mandatory in nature and are non-

  statutory in nature, therefore, they cannot be enforced through

  the court of law and there is no provision for fixing the areas, as

  such, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_18">8. Central Pollution Control Board also filed return as well as

  separate affidavit pursuant to the order of this Court.

</p><p id="p_19">9. Mr. Ajay Kumar Mishra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

  petitioner, had vehemently contended that there is absolutely bar

  in terms of clause D of the guidelines issued by Central Pollution

  Control Board on 25-9-2003 in shape of clause D which clearly

  restricts the establishment of CBWTF once the CBWTF is

  established to cater up to 10,000 beds at the approved rate by the

  prescribed authority, as 10,000 beds capacity has not exceeded at

  present, therefore, another CBWTF in the same area cannot be

  allowed to be established by order dated 31-3-2012 vide Annexure

  P-1. Replying to the delay caused in filing the writ petition, he

  would further submit that the petitioner was not aware of

  granting permission to establish another CBWTF at Raipur,

  therefore, it could not prefer writ petition questioning the order

  passed by respondents No.2 and 3 vide Annexure P-1 and as soon

  as the petitioner noticed the passing of order, immediately, the

  writ petition was filed questioning the grant of permission to

  establish CBWTF at Raipur. He would also submit that CBWTF is a

  public utility and therefore a private entrepreneur cannot be
                                                      W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              Page 7 of 33</span>

   granted permission by mere asking, as such, the writ petition

   deserves to be allowed and the order Annexure P-1 as also the

   consequential order which has been passed during the pendency

   of writ petition dated 29-1-2018 granting consent to operate

   under the provisions of the Water Air and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a>, deserve to

   be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_20">10. Mr.   Sudhir Kumar Bajpai, learned counsel appearing for

   respondents No.2 and 3, would submit as under: -

</p><p id="p_21">      1. Guidelines dated 25-9-2003 issued by Central Pollution

          Control Board have no legal basis nor force, as they are

          merely regulatory and recommendatory, not statutory in

          nature and therefore they cannot be enforced.

</p><p id="p_22">      2. While replying to the argument based on clause D of the

          guidelines, he would further submit that the restriction

          indicated in clause D is available against the petitioner as the

          CBWTF at one time can only be allowed to cater up to

          10,000 beds and it cannot be allowed to cater health care

          units situated beyond a radius of 150 kms. and as such there

          is no statutory prohibition in terms of establishment of

          another CBWTF where one CBWTF is already operating,

          particularly when the petitioner was granted permission to

          establish CBWTF for Durg, Bhilai and Raipur cities only. He

          would emphasize on the word 'cities' used in the permission

          granted to the petitioner on 7-4-2003.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      3. Learned counsel Mr. Bajpai would also bring to the notice of

          the court various complaints made from time to time taken
                                                    W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            Page 8 of 33</span>

         cognizance of by the Central Pollution Control Board as well

         as the order passed under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_15">Section 5</a> of the Environment

         (Protection) Act, 1986 directing the petitioner to rectify the

         defects and bring it in conformity with the consent granted

         under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a>. He also brought to the

         notice of the court two letters issued by the petitioner

         indicating its willingness and intention to close down the

         CBWTF unit and further, looking to the directions issued by

         the National Green Tribunal after passing of the order

         Annexure P-1 for establishing the need of further grant of

         CBWTF in the State of Chhattisgarh, the writ petition

         deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_24">11. Mr. S.C. Mehadia, learned counsel appearing for respondents No.5

   and 6, would submit that primarily, the writ petition deserves to

   be dismissed as it suffers from delay and laches. The permission

   having been granted on 31-3-2012 the writ petition has been laid

   on 13-6-2016 and such a delay of more than four years has not

   been explained properly. Mere saying that the petitioner was not

   aware of the order passed by respondents No.2 and 3 is not

   enough particularly when the petitioner's CBWTF is established at

   Durg, Bhilai and Raipur and the order has been passed by the

   original office / Board at Raipur. He would further submit that by

   no stretch of imagination, the petitioner's explanation that it was

   not aware of the impugned order, can be accepted.           On the

   prohibition of second CBWTF in the coverage area covered by the

   petitioners, he would submit that the guidelines are non-statutory
                                                    W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             Page 9 of 33</span>

   in nature, it is not regulatory in nature and clause D of the

   guidelines operate against the petitioner. The State Environment

   Conservation Board finding great and extreme need of

   establishment of CBWTF has directed for granting permission to

   establish CBWTF and recently, during the pendency of petition,

   even the consent to operate in terms of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Air

   Act</a> has been granted to respondent No.5 which has even not been

   questioned in the writ petition, therefore, the writ petition

   deserves to be dismissed with cost.
</p>
<p id="p_25">12. Mr.   V.V.S. Murthy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for

   respondent No.4, would submit that affidavit as directed by this

   Court on 17-5-2017 has been filed which has already been taken

   on record.
</p>
<p id="p_26">13. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered their

   rival submissions made herein-above and went through the record

   with utmost circumspection.
</p>
<p id="p_27">14. This Court by order dated 17-5-2017 framed following three

   questions and directed the respondents to submit specific

   information about the same: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          (A) Whether the statutory and regulatory framework

          governing establishment of Bio Medical Waste Treatment

          Plant, require any procedure to be followed in granting

          permission to any intending entrepreneur and if so, what

          procedure has been prescribed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          (B) Whether there is a statutory prohibition under any law to

          establish more than one Bio Medical Waste Treatment Plant

</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">15. In compliance of the order of this Court, parties including Central

   Pollution Control Board and State Environment Conservation

   Board have filed their affidavit which have already been taken on

   record.
</p>
<p id="p_29">16. This Court by order dated 30-8-2017 overruled the preliminary

   objection taken on behalf of respondent No.5 that reliefs claimed

   are covered by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_20">National Green Tribunal Act</a>,

   2010 and held that the subject matter of the writ petition is

<p id="p_30">17. Upon hearing the counsel for the parties at length and going

   through the record, following three main questions arise for

   consideration: -
</p>
<p id="p_31">      1. Whether there is any specific bar contained either in the

         Rules of 1998 or in the circular dated 25-9-2003 issued by

         Central Pollution Control Board for establishment of a

         further CBWTF during the establishment and operation of

</p>
<p id="p_35">   Answer to issue No.1: -
</p>
<p id="p_36">18. In order to answer this issue, it would be appropriate to notice the

   provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_23">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986

   and the rules made thereunder as also the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">Water

     Corporation of Delhi and also to the All India Institute of Medicine

     hospitals / nursing homes for disposal of waste generated by said

     hospitals and nursing homes.
</p>
<p id="p_44">  25. After the judgment of the Supreme Court in B.L. Wadehra (supra),

     the Rules of 1998 were enacted and the concept of CBWTF was

     evolved. By the said Rules, the treatment of Bio Medical Waste

     was made mandatory. The Rules of 1998 provide for collection,

     reception,     storage,   transportation,    treatment,   disposal   or

     handling of bio medical waste in every form and Rule 5 of the said

     Rules mandatorily prescribes that bio medical waste shall be

     treated and disposed of in accordance with the norms specified in

     the schedule. In Rule 3(3) of the Rules of 1998, "authorisation"

     has been defined to mean permission granted by the prescribed

     authority for the generation, collection, reception, storage,

     transportation, treatment, disposal and / or any other form of

     handling of bio-medical waste in accordance with these rules and

     any guidelines issued by the Central Government. Rule 7 of the

     Rules of 1998 specifically prescribes that every State Pollution

     Control Board shall have a prescribed authority for enforcement

     of the provisions of the Rules of 1998 in respect of all health care

     establishments     including    hospitals,   nursing   homes,   clinics,

     dispensaries, veterinary institutions, animal houses, pathological

     laboratories and blood banks of the Armed Forces. Sub-rule (3) of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                           Page 14 of 33</span>

   Rule 7 mandates that the prescribed authority shall function

   under the supervision and control of the respective Government

   of the State or Union Territory. Rule 8 of the Rules of 1998

   prescribes that every occupier of an institution generating,

   collecting, receiving, storing, transporting, treating, disposing

   and / or handling bio-medical waste in any other manner, except

   such occupiers of clinics, dispensaries, pathological laboratories,

   blood banks providing treatment / service to less than 1000

   patients per month, shall make an application in Form I to the

   prescribed authority for grant of authorisation. The Rules of 1998

   were amended with effect from 2-6-2000 whereby Rule 14

   provided specific provision for establishment of public utility of

   common disposal/incineration sites         and whereby specific

   obligation was cast upon the local bodies of the area concerned.

   Rule 14 of the Rules of 1998 prescribes as under: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">         "14. Common disposal/incineration sites.--Without

         suitable common disposal/incineration sites for the
         biomedical wastes generated in the area under their
         jurisdiction and in areas outside the jurisdiction of any
         municipal body, it shall be the responsibility of the
         occupier generating biomedical waste / operator of a

</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">26. It is pertinent to mention here that <a href="/doc/68540/" id="a_43">Section 5</a> of the Act of 1986

   to the Chairman, Central Pollution Control Board vide notification

   dated 27-2-1996.
</p>
<p id="p_46">27. The aforesaid scheme of the Rules of 1998 thus, comprehensively

   regulate management, handling and disposal of biomedical waste

   and the Rules do not speak about the coverage area of CBWTF

   and as such, neither the Act of 1986 nor the Rules of 1998

   restricts or prohibits the State Pollution Control Board from

   establishing more than one CBWTF in a particular locality. The

   Rules of 1998 were repealed by the Bio-Medical Waste

   Management Rules, 2016 (for short, 'the Rules of 2016'), which

   came into force with effect from 28-3-2016. However, Rule 7(3) of

   the Rules of 2016 clearly provides that "no occupier shall establish

   on-site treatment and disposal facility, if a service of common bio-

   medical waste treatment facility is available at a distance of

   seventy-five kilometer". In the instant case, the Rules of 1998 will

   be applicable, as the impugned order granting permission to

   establish CBWTF was granted by the State Pollution Control

   Board on 31-3-2012 as such, the Rules of 1998 as amended do not

   specify the criteria for coverage area of CBWTF and the Rules of

   2016 came into force with effect from 28-3-2016.

</p><p id="p_47">28. Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel, has placed great emphasis on

   clause D of the Guidelines for Common Bio-Medical Waste

   Treatment Facility issued by Central Pollution Control Board on
                                                    W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                Page 16 of 33</span>

    25-9-2003 to buttress his plea that CBWTF of respondent No.5 is

    barred to be established. The said Clause D of the guidelines

    issued states as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">         "D. COVERAGE AREA OF CBWTF

         In any area, only one CBWTF may be allowed to cater up
         to 10,000 bads at the approved rate by the Prescribed
         Authority. A CBWTF shall not be allowed to cater
         healthcare units situated beyond a radius of 150 km.
         However, in an area where 10,000 beds are not available
         within a radius of 150 km, another CBWTF may be
         allowed to cater the healthcare units situated outside
         the said 150 km."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">29. A focused glance of the aforesaid clause D of the guidelines would

    state that (1) only one CBWTF may be allowed to cater up to

    10,000 beds at the approved rate by the prescribed authority; and

    (2) the CBWTF shall not be allowed to cater health-care units

    situated beyond a radius of 150 kms., however, in an area where

    10,000 beds are not available within a radius of 150 kms., another

    CBWTF may be allowed to cater the health-care units situated

    outside the said 150 kms.. On the basis of aforesaid analysis, it

    can be said that the aforesaid guidelines do not restrict the

    number of units to be established in a particular area / district /

    locality. However, it gives the maximum number of beds that can

    be catered by one CBWTF and also it prescribes the maximum

    radius in which the CBWTF can be operated.           Therefore, the

    argument raised by learned Senior Counsel that it restricts the

    State Pollution Control Board to grant permission to establish or

    permission to consent another CBWTF in an area covered by the

    petitioner sans merit and deserves to be rejected.

</p><p id="p_49">30. The ancillary question would be whether the guidelines issued by
                                                      W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                            Page 17 of 33</span>

   the CPCB are statutory in nature which can be enforced by the

   petitioner by way of writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_50">31. This Court, as noticed herein-above, by order dated 17-5-2017

   directed the respective parties to file their affidavit as to whether

   there is statutory prohibition under the law to establish more

   than one plant of CBWTF in the periphery of 75 Kms., the rules or

   regulations. Central Pollution Control Board has filed its affidavit

   clearly stating that the guidelines published by CPCB in the year

   2003 were to facilitate setting up of new CBWTFs in the country,

   though such guidelines are not mandated under Bio-medical

   Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 1998 as amended.

   Further, CPCB has stated in the affidavit as under: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">         "In this regard, it is humbly that the objective of CPCB's
         earlier guidelines is to protect operational area of an
         already existing CBMWTF so as to provide effective
         services to member hospitals. Further, as per earlier
         guidelines, another facility was allowed close to existing
         facility but has to operate beyond the coverage of
         existing facility. In this regard, it is also submitted that
         mushrooming of multiple facilities in same area would
         bring in un-healthy competition among the facility
         operators which would result into operation of facilities
         in economically un-viable manner, leading to improper
         management of biomedical waste."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">32. Central Pollution Control Board has also stated that Rule 7(3) of

   the Rules of 2016 contains a bar to establish on-site treatment

   and disposal facility, if a service of a CBWTF is available at a

   distance of 75 Kms.
</p>
<p id="p_52">33. State Pollution Control Board has also filed affidavit clearly

   stating that the guidelines of 2003 issued by CPCB are regulatory

   as well as recommendatory in nature, but it is not mandatory in

   nature. It has also stated that the guidelines of 2003 fixed the
                                                       W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

      limit of operation of CBWTF, but it nowhere lays down that there

      cannot be any CBWTF within a distance of 150 Kms..

</p><p id="p_53">  34. After having noticed the stand of CPCB and State Pollution

      Control Board in which they have clearly stated that the

      guidelines of 2003 were not issued in terms of any statutory

      provisions under the Rules of 1998, it would be appropriate to

      notice a pertinent decision of the Supreme Court in the matter of

      <a href="/doc/59183655/" id="a_46">Syndicate Bank v. Ramachandran Pillai</a> and others2 in which

      Their Lordships of the Supreme Court have held that if

      administrative orders / decisions / executive instructions / orders /

      circulars - guidelines are not statutory in character, they are not

      law, they confer no legal right to seek a direction in a court of law

      for compliance with such guidelines even if there has been any

      violation or breach of such non-statutory guidelines and it has

      been held as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                 "6. If any executive instructions are to have the
           force of statutory rules, it must be shown that they
           were issued either under the authority conferred on the
           Central Government or a State Government or other
           authority by some statute or the Constitution.
           Guidelines or executive instructions which are not
           statutory in character, are not "laws", and compliance
           therewith cannot be enforced through courts. Even if
           there has been any violation or breach of such non-

           validly made in accordance with a statute (as in this case
           the Public Premises Act), cannot be interfered with,
           even if there has been any transgression of any

<p id="p_55">                 7. As the guidelines relied upon in this case were
           not issued in exercise of any statutory power under the
           Public Premises Act or any other statute, even if there
           was violation or non-compliance with the aforesaid
           guidelines by the appellant, relief to the appellant could
           not be denied by relying upon the guidelines. To do so
           would amount to reading the guidelines into the
           statute, which is impermissible. The only "remedy" of
           any person complaining of non-compliance with such
           guidelines, is to bring such violation to the notice of a
           higher authority.       We therefore hold that the
           enforcement of any right or exercise of any power by
           the appellant, under the Public Premises Act cannot be
           set at naught by relying upon or referring to the

      Sugars Limited v. Shree Renuka Sugar Limited and others 6 may

      be noticed herein profitably in which the challenge was to the

      radius of 15 kms. from the sugar factory of the appellant therein,

      in breach of clause 6-A of the Sugar (Control) Order, 1966. In that

      therein had already made huge investment in establishing the

            Unless it is established that violation of a directory

            not follow as a matter of course. A mandatory provision
            conceived in the interest of a party can be waived by
            that party, whereas a mandatory provision conceived in
            the interest of the public cannot be waived by him. In

             that law is an interdisciplinary subject where interface
             between law and other sciences (social sciences as well
             as natural/physical sciences) come into play and the
             impact of other disciplines of Law is to be necessarily
             kept in mind while taking a decision (of course, within
             the parameters of legal provisions). Interface between
             Law and Economics is much more relevant in today's
             time when the country has ushered into the era of
             economic liberalisation, which is also termed as
             "globalisation" of economy. India is on the road of
             economic growth. It has been a developing economy
             for number of decades and all efforts are made, at all
             levels, to ensure that it becomes a fully developed
             economy. Various measures are taken in this behalf by
             the policy-makers. The judicial wing, while undertaking
             the task of performing its judicial function, is also
             required to perform its role in this direction. It calls for
             an economic analysis of law approach, most commonly
             referred to as "Law and Economics"11. In fact, in certain

11 Richard A. Posner in his book Frontiers of Legal Theory explains this concept as
   follows:
</p>
<p id="p_60">          "Economic analysis of law has heuristic, descriptive and normative aspects.
   As a heuristic, it seeks to display underlying unities in legal doctrines and
   institutions; in its descriptive mode, it seeks to identify the economic logic and
   effects of doctrines and institutions and the economic causes of legal change; in
   its normative aspect it advises Judges and other policy-makers on the most
   efficient methods of regulating conduct through law. The range of its subject-
   matter has become wide, indeed all-encompassing. Exploiting advances in the
   economics of nonmarket behaviour, economic analysis of law has expanded far
   beyond its original focus on antitrust, taxation, public utility regulation, corporate
   finance, and other areas of explicitly economic regulation. (And within that
   domain, it has expanded to include such fields as property and contract law.) The
   "new" economic analysis of law embraces such nonmarket, or quasi-nonmarket,
   fields of law as tort law, family law, criminal law, free speech, procedure,
   legislation, public international law, the law of intellectual property, the rules
   governing the trial and appellate process, environmental law, the administrative
   process, the regulation of health and safety, the laws forbidding discrimination in
   employment, and social norms viewed as a source of, an obstacle to, and a
   substitute for formal law."

          branches of Law there is a direct impact of Economics
          and economic considerations play predominant role,
          which are even recognised as legal principles.
          Monopoly laws (popularly known as "Antitrust Laws" in
          USA) have been transformed by Economics. The issues
          arising in competition laws (which has replaced
          monopoly laws) are decided primarily on economic
          analysis of various provisions of the <a href="/doc/109474639/" id="a_54">Competition
          Commission Act</a>. Similar approach is to be necessarily
          adopted while interpreting bankruptcy laws or even
          matters relating to corporate finance, etc. The impress
          of Economics is strong while examining various facets
          of the issues arising under the aforesaid laws. In fact,
          economic evidence plays a big role even while deciding
          environmental issues. There is a growing role of
          Economics in contract, labour, tax, corporate and other
          laws. Courts are increasingly receptive to economic
          arguments while deciding these issues. In such an
          environment it becomes the bounden duty of the Court
          to have the economic analysis and economic impact of
          its decisions.</blockquote><p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">          44. We may hasten to add that it is by no means
          suggested that while taking into account these
          considerations, specific provisions of law are to be
          ignored. First duty of the Court is to decide the case by
          applying the statutory provisions. However, on the
          application of law and while interpreting a particular
          provision, economic impact/effect of a decision,
          wherever warranted, has to be kept in mind. Likewise,
          in a situation where two views are possible or wherever
          there is a discretion given to the Court by law, the Court
          needs to lean in favour of a particular view which
Posner also mentioned that this interface between Law and Economics might
grandly be called "Economic Theory of Law", which is built on a pioneering article
by Ronald Coase [R.H. Coase, "The Problem of Social Cost", 3 Journal of Law and
Economics 1 (1960)]:
</p>
<p id="p_63">       "The "Coase Theorem" holds that where market transaction costs are zero,
the law's initial assignment of rights is irrelevant to efficiency, since if the
assignment is inefficient the parties will rectify it by a corrective transaction.
There are two important corollaries. The first is that the law, to the extent
interested in promoting economic efficiency, should try to minimize transaction
costs, for example by defining property rights clearly, by making them readily
transferable, and by creating cheap and effective remedies for breach of
contract...
</p>
<p id="p_64">       The second corollary of the Coase Theorem is that where, despite the law's
best efforts, market transaction costs remain high, the law should simulate the
market's allocation of resources by assigning property rights to the highest-
valued users. An example is the fair-use doctrine of copyright law, which allows
writers to publish short quotations from a copyrighted work without negotiating
with the copyright holder. The costs of such negotiations would usually be
prohibitive; if they were not prohibitive, the usual result would be an agreement
to permit the quotation, and so the doctrine of fair use brings about the result
that the market would bring about if market transactions were feasible."

             subserves the economic interest of the nation.
             Conversely, the Court needs to avoid that particular
             outcome which has a potential to create an adverse
             effect on employment, growth of infrastructure or
             economy or the revenue of the State. It is in this

      show that the petitioner's CBWTF plant was not functioning at all

      in accordance with the rules and the guidelines. The plant of the

      Control Board and Central Pollution Control Board and it was

      found that the petitioner was not complying with the rules and

      13-2-2012 and 13-8-2012 of the petitioner wherein the petitioner

   alternative arrangement is made. In the instant case, respondent

   No.5 has already proceeded with establishment of its CBWTF

   plant and as stated, it had invested a sum of ₹ 3 crores in the

   establishment of the plant and is ready for operation.         The

   petitioner was even not interested in continuing to operate the

   present unit and has asserted that it is operating the plant till

   alternative arrangement is made or direction for closure is issued

   by respondent No.2. Thus, it appears from the record that since

   the petitioner expressed its willingness to close the unit finding

   difficult to run the same, the petitioner was already found

   deficient in performing the duty and application of respondent

   No.5 was pending since 2011, respondents No.2 and 3 decided to

   consider and grant consent to respondent No.5 to establish

   CBWTF on 31-3-2012. In these circumstances, respondents No.2

one at Korba around 0.5 acres of land. Besides the remaining two

CBWTFs at Raigarh and Bhilai-Durg (by the petitioner) are having

only ¼th of the land than the one actually required. It was further

held that the plants installed in the State for the purpose of

treating the bio-medical waste are not at all adequate in number.

There are only four CBWTFs in the State, out of which only two

are having incinerators, as per the relevant law. Sufficient number

of CBWTFs are to be installed which is to be determined in

accordance to total number of waste generated. The Tribunal

finally held that but in the State of Chhattisgarh, the CBWTFs

established are totally inadequate, as for instance in the entire

division of Surguja and Bastar which are 150 Kms., away do not

have even a single CBWTF. The State of Chhattisgarh consists of

27 districts and it has only four CBWTFs though there should be

one of such at every 150 Kms., and finally issued number of

   establishment of further CBWTF at Raipur by respondents No.2

   cannot be held that there is any legal bar for establishment of

      and in constant touch with respondents No.2 and 3. Therefore,

      the petitioner's stand that they were not aware cannot be

      accepted.      Delay of 51 months is an inordinate delay.           The

   player of the same field running the CBWTF located at Raipur

   allowed respondent No.5 to construct the plant making huge

   investment and when the plant is said to be ready for operation,

   at the fag end, the writ petition has been filed and as such, the

   delay occurred is unacceptable to the Court being unexplained

   and inordinate as well, therefore, the writ petition also deserves

   to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches.

   Answer to issue No.3: -
</p>
<p id="p_75">43. Whether the grant of consent to establish CBWTF is grant of State

   largess? / Whether proper procedure for setting up and operation

   of CBWTF has been followed?
</p>
<p id="p_76">44. In this regard, the procedure prescribed in the 2003 guidelines,

   issued by Central Pollution Control Board, for granting permission

   to setup/establish CBWTF may be noticed herein profitably which

   states as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">         "K. SETTING UP AND OPERATION OF CBWTF

         Setting up and operating a CBWTF requires compliance
         with a number of regulatory requirements/provisions.
         The important requirements/provisions are listed
         below:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">         (i) Municipal Corporations, Municipal Boards or Urban
         Local Bodies, as the case may be, shall be responsible
         for providing suitable common disposal/incineration
         sites for the bio-medical waste generated in the area
         under their jurisdiction and in areas outside the
         jurisdiction of any municipal body, it shall be the
         responsibility of the occupier generating bio-medical
         waste/operator of a bio-medical waste treatment
                                                   W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                           Page 30 of 33</span>

         facility to arrange for suitable sites individually or in
         association, so as to comply with the provisions of these
         rules (Bio-medical Waste Management &amp; Handling)
         Rules).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">         (ii) The local body such as a Municipal Body or any
         Private Entrepreneur, whoever wishes to set up a
         CBWTF, shall submit a detailed work-plan of proposed
         CBWTF to the concerned State Pollution Control Board
         (SPCB)/Pollution Control Committee (PCC) for
         evaluation and issue of "Consent To Establish". The
         work-plan should include complete details of the
         project such as site details, coverage area,
         infrastructure set up, transportation of bio-medical
         waste, operating procedure etc.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">         (iii) The SPCB/PCC upon receipt of such work-plan shall,
         review the proposal and "Consent to establish" shall be
         issued to the proponent with the required conditions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">         (iv) Once the proponent establishes the necessary
         infrastructure, the site and the resources shall be
         inspected by the SPCB/PCC for the adequacy of the
         facility/equipment. Upon satisfactory recommendation,
         the authorization under the Bio-medical Waste
         (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, shall be issued with
         necessary condition to the proponent."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_77">45. Thus, the above-stated guidelines permit making of an application

   by a person interested including private entrepreneur and

   detailed procedure has been indicated in the said guidelines for

   processing and granting consent to establish the CBWTF.

</p><p id="p_78">46. Apart from the guidelines issued by CPCB, the Rules of 1998 has

   prescribed the procedure for treatment and disposal of

   biomedical waste.     Rules 3(8) and 3(9) of the Rules of 1998,

   respectively, define "occupier" and "operator of a bio-medical

   waste facility". Rule 4 defines duty of occupier. Rule 5 prescribes

   treatment and disposal of bio-medical waste. Rules 7(4) and 7(5)

   provide as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">         "(4) The prescribed authority shall on receipt of Form I
         make such enquiry as it deems fit and if it is satisfied
                                                      W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                              Page 31 of 33</span>

           that the applicant possesses the necessary capacity to
           handle bio-medical waste in accordance with these
           rules, grant or renew an authorisation as the case may
           be.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">           (5) An authorisation shall be granted for a period of
           three years, including an initial trial period of one year
           from the date of issue. Thereafter, an application shall
           be made by the occupier/operator for renewal. All such
           subsequent authorisation shall be for a period of three
           years. A provisional authorisation will be granted for
           the trial period, to enable the occupier/operator to
           demonstrate the capacity of the facility."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_79">47. Rule 8(2) of the Rules of 1998 obliges the operator of a bio-

   medical waste facility to make an application in Form I to the

   prescribed authority for grant of authorisation and under Rule

   8(4), authorisation for operating a facility for collection,

   reception, treatment, storage, transport and disposal of bio-

   medical waste shall be issued by the prescribed authority subject

   to terms and conditions of authorisation. Rule 14 of the Rules of

   1998, which has been brought in force with effect from 2-6-2000,

   imposes responsibility to Municipal Corporations, Municipal

   Boards or Urban Local Bodies for providing suitable common

   disposal/incineration sites for the bio-medical wastes generated

   in the area under their jurisdiction. Rule 14 further mandates the

   responsibility of the occupier generating bio-medical waste/

   operator of a bio-medical waste treatment facility to arrange for

   suitable steps individual or in association to comply the Rules of

   1998.
</p>
<p id="p_80">48. Thus, the permission/consent to establish CBWTF has to be

   granted as per the Rules of 1998 read with the guidelines of CPCB

   2003 and procedure prescribed therein has to be followed while

   granting consent to establish. The above-stated procedure has
                                                          W.P.(C)No.1509/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                    Page 32 of 33</span>

          been followed in the instant case by respondents No.2 and 3. No

          land has been allotted to respondents No.2 and 3 for

          establishment of CBWTF, only permission to establish CBWTF has

          been granted as per the Rules of 1998 and the guidelines of 2003

          subject to terms and conditions mentioned in Annexure P-1 dated

          31-3-2012 and it cannot be held that such permission could not

          have been granted without open and transparent selection of

          eligible agency.   The argument raised in this behalf is hereby

          rejected. Thus, the issue is answered against the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_81">       49. Having answered all the three issues against the petitioner as

          above and as a fallout and consequence of aforesaid discussion, I

          do not find any merit in the writ petition.      The writ petition

          deserves to be and is accordingly dismissed, leaving the parties to

          bear their own cost(s).
