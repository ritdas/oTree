             The present petition has been filed by the petitioner challenging

the judgment/order dated 03.11.2017 passed by Addl. Sessions Judge,

Ludhiana     whereby his appeal against the judgment and order dated

06.10.2016 passed by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana was dismissed

and his conviction under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_1">Section 44</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 was upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             The present criminal case was initiated by Punjab Pollution

Control Board, Patiala alleging that the present petitioner was running a

motor garage at Doraha, District Ludhiana. In the said motor garage, water

was used for services of vehicles, however, necessary permission was not

obtained from the Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Considering the evidence led on file and arguments of the

parties, Chief Judicial Magistrate convicted the present petitioner under

<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">Section 44</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 for

violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> of the Act. The punishment of one year and six

months of imprisonment was imposed upon the petitioner along with a fine

of Rs.5,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              The above said order of conviction was challenged by way of

appeal before Addl. Sessions Judge, Ludhiana.            The appeal was also

dismissed. Therefore, the present petition has been filed before this Court.

</p><p id="p_5">              At the very outset, learned counsel for the petitioner submits

that out of total sentence of one year and six months, the petitioner has

undergone imprisonment for a period of 8 months. Learned counsel for the

petitioner submits that he does not intend to contest the petition on merits of

the case. He is restricting his revision petition only to the extent of quantum

of punishment. Further argument of learned counsel for the petitioner is

that the petitioner is the first offender and therefore, the punishment be

considered for reduction to the extent of the sentence already undergone by

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              Learned counsel for the respondent does not dispute the fact

that the petitioner has already undergone more than 8 months of

imprisonment out of total punishment awarded to him. However, it is

submitted that the petitioner be put to an undertaking that he will not

commit the same offence again when he comes out from the custody in the

present case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              Keeping in view the above, this Court finds it appropriate and

justified to accept the submission made by learned counsel for the

petitioner.   Accordingly, it is ordered that the sentence awarded to the

petitioner in the present case is reduced to the sentence already undergone

by him. The petitioner shall be released from the custody forthwith.

             However, it is made clear that if the petitioner intends to further

operate the motor garage, then necessary permission from the Board would

be obtained by him.
