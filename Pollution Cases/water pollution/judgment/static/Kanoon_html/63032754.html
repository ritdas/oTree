KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J.

<p id="p_1">               Ludhiana is the most affluent, prosperous and largest city of

Punjab. The city stands on the old bank of river Sutlej, which is situated

on the northern side of Ludhiana city, approximately 15 kilometers away

from the City Center. Ludhiana is also known as Manchester of India,

being one of the most industrialized towns of northern India. The

industries housed in Ludhiana are engaged in manufacture of woolen

garments, cotton and synthetic yarns. As per a survey, 95 percent of the
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                      3
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


country's woolen industry is located in Ludhiana. 30 percent of the

country's cotton industry is also based at Ludhiana. 1/3rd of the total

power available in the State of Punjab is consumed in Ludhiana only.

The steel based industry situated in this city consists of cycle and auto

parts and foundries. Besides this, rubber based industry manufactures

tyres and tubes. As much as 70 percent of the country's cycles and cycle

parts are also manufactured at Ludhiana.
</p>
<p id="p_2">               Industrialization and development had their fallouts too.

What ails Ludhiana is suffered by Budha Nullah.
</p>
<p id="p_3">               Budha Nullah is a seasonal water-stream and passes

through the highly populated Ludhiana district. As per the survey carried

by the Department of Science, Technology and Environment; Budha

Nullah originates from village Kumbh Kalan and its confluence point with

the river Sutlej is near village Valipur. Budha Nullah has a sinuous

course and the width of the channel varies from place to place. It is a

flooding stream during the rainy season.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               Five writ petitions, out of which two have arisen out of a suo-

motu notice taken by this Court, have been on the board of this Court for

long. They all concern Ludhiana and Budha Nullah. The issues raised in

these writ petitions essentially are the concerns of all well-meaning

citizens, i.e. how to make Ludhiana and Budha Nullah pollution-free and

ensure public hygiene so that the contaminated water passing through

Budha Nullah, which ultimately merges in the river Sutlej, does not

become a source of health hazard and cause epidemic. During the

course of various hearings, CWP No.7036 of 2005 titled as '<a href="/doc/106885038/" id="a_1">Nirbhai

Singh v. State of Punjab</a>' became the lead case to evolve a

comprehensive plan and strategy to make Ludhiana and Budha Nullah
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                    4
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


free of the ill-effects of rapid, haphazard and unplanned industrial

growth.
</p>
<p id="p_5">               Industrialization and technological progress had caused a

negative impact on the environment in terms of pollution and

degradation, and had stressed the environmental system due to

accumulation of the stock of wastes. Pollution of water, air and

atmosphere are the bye-products of economic development, particularly

industrialization and urbanization. It is an admitted fact that air and water

pollution in the developing countries cause heavy toll of human life

through ill-health and premature mortality. It is the poverty struck

population, i.e. lowest strata of the society, which suffers most from the

onslaught on the nature. Therefore, the first writ petition viz. CWP

No.7036 of 2005 titled as '<a href="/doc/106885038/" id="a_2">Nirbhai Singh v. State of Punjab</a>' in which

suo-motu notice was taken, originated out of a complaint received by the

Chief Justice of this Court from a prisoner of Central Jail, Ludhiana.

Nirbhai Singh was undergoing rigorous imprisonment for ten years. In

his communication addressed to the Chief Justice of this Court he stated

that 10/12 chemical factories situated in front of the jail emit black smoke

after 5.00 p.m. till the early morning; due to which inmates of the jail

suffer from chest/cough ailments throughout the night and itching in their

eyes. A grievance was made that the smoke emitted from the chimneys

of the factories engulfs the barracks of the jail and makes the prisoners

feel as they are confined in gas chambers. It was stated that the

prisoners are reminded of the treatment meted to the Jews by Hitler in

the gas chambers. A clarion call was given to redress the grievance of

the petitioner. This communication was received in the Chief Justice

Secretariat on 9th November, 2004. An Administrative Judge of this Court
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                  5
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


directed the District and Sessions Judge, Ludhiana to submit his report

after visiting the Central Jail, Ludhiana. In its report, the District and

Sessions Judge, Ludhiana submitted that the dyeing mills are situated

along Budha Nullah in front of the jail compound and these dyeing mills

were constructed in the year 1991. The Deputy Commissioner,

Ludhiana, who was requested to initiate necessary action, shifted the

responsibility to the Punjab Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred

to as, 'PPCB'), saying that the dyeing units have received their licences

from the PPCB. The PPCB and the 24 dyeing mills passed the blame

upon Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana stating that the entire city's

waste/garbage is thrown on the banks of Budha Nullah near the factories

and when the same is set on fire smoke emanates out of it which creates

pollution in the jail. Since nobody was ready to own-up the responsibility,

the Administrative Judge recommended that the communication received

from the convict requires judicial intervention.

</p><p id="p_6">               Therefore, the Court suo-motu took cognizance and issued

notice on 6th May, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_7">               The PPCB in its reply stated that the smoke emitted by nine

industries was within the permissible limits prescribed by the Board

whereas, in case of two industries the concentration of particulate matter

was found to be beyond the said limits. It was further stated that every

day 400 tons of municipal solid waste from various parts of the city were

brought to the dumping site at Tajpur road and the dumping site is near

the industries and at a distance of 500 meters from the Central Jail,

Ludhiana. It was further stated that a number of trucks carrying municipal

solid waste of Ludhiana city move on the road passing in front of the

Central Jail, Ludhiana. The trucks carrying the municipal solid waste are

also not in a good condition and a lot of smoke and soot is emitted from
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                    6
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


their exhaust pipes. After the above said reply was filed by the PPCB, a

notice was issued to the Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana.

</p><p id="p_8">               The Joint Commissioner, Ludhiana in its affidavit dated 27th

July, 2005 stated that the Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana has a

dumping ground in the area of village Jamalpur, which is spread over an

area of approximately 16 acres. The solid waste generated within the city

is duly lifted and transported in covered-body trucks to the dumping

ground and sometimes incidents of fire had taken place, however, the

fire was immediately doused off. In the affidavit, it was further stated that

Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana had already purchased approximately

21 acres of land in the area of Noorpur Bet on payment of Rs.1.25 crores

for setting up of a Solid Waste Treatment Plant, for which a

memorandum of understanding has already been entered into with a

Canada based company.
</p>
<p id="p_9">               Thereafter, again the District and Sessions Judge, Ludhiana

was asked to submit a status report. On 23rd August, 2005 in its status

report, the District and Sessions Judge stated that 28 dyeing units are

operating in front of the Central Jail and furthermore, migrant labourers

and rag-pickers set the garbage on fire and as such foul smell is emitted

causing discomfort to the prisoners.
</p>
<p id="p_10">               When the Court was in the midst of redressing the grievance

of the prisoners, a national daily newspaper (The Tribune) published a

series of articles under the heading of 'Killer Drains of Punjab'. One of

the articles in its edition published on August 28, 2006 was under the

heading of 'Killer Drain I - Budha Nullah gets more septic - 3 lakh

kilolitre sewage discharge daily'. The article stated that from the banks of

Budha Nullah at Badi Haibowal, one will witness something utterly

grotesque and due to low water and shockingly high untreated domestic
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                  7
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


and industrial sewage discharge, the Nullah has ceased to flow. It raised

the concern that for lack of water for dilution of waste and unabated

discharge of raw sullage into the Nullah, jet black stinking water is

carried by the Nullah and there is no semblance of life. It was observed

that one will find animals stuck in the sludge and chunks of freshly

scraped animals' flesh, mainly of pigs, whose meat is openly sold from

the outlets thriving on the Nullah's banks. It was further reported that

daily industrial effluent discharge of 60,000 cubic metres comprising

poisonous heavy metals like arsenic, chemicals like cyanide, harmful

pesticides and toxic organic compounds are thrown in the Nullah. The

stench emitted from the Nullah is lethal. People have to endure this as

they have no other choice. The article further quoted a Professor from

the PGI's Community Medicine Department, who stated that if remedial

measures are not taken, there can be severe outbreak of diseases,

some of which have high mortality. The correspondent stated that Budha

Nullah, once the lifeline of Ludhiana, is victim of official apathy, as 95

percent of the total waste is discharged by the Municipal Corporation in

the Nullah. Furthermore, 12 Municipal Committees throw waste into the

river Sutlej and Ludhiana Municipal Corporation was the maximum

contributor of pollution load to the river through Budha Nullah. It was

further mentioned that Ludhiana, a thriving, affluent and prosperous

town; had no Solid Waste Material Treatment Plant. Disposal of the

waste into Budha Nullah was conceived as a temporary solution and

continuous discharge of pollution into Budha Nullah had contaminated

Ludhiana city's drinking water sources. Furthermore, the water from the

Nullah was used for drinking purposes and was a cause of massive

outbreak of gastroenteritis. The second part of the article was carried by
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                    8
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


The Tribune in its edition dated 29th August, 2006 and the third part in

edition dated 30th August, 2006. In these articles, an incident of a

resident of Ludhiana city was reported, who was carrying toxic lead in

her bloodstream for years. According to the Gastroenterologist of

Repute, increased number of patients with lead poisoning caused by the

industrial pollution of ground water were arriving at the hospitals of

Ludhiana. It was stated that in the residential areas, which are situated

near Budha Nullah, the lead poisoning has been reported in high

numbers as electroplating and battery manufacturing units were

contributing to the pollution load.
</p>
<p id="p_11">               A Division Bench of this Court took suo-motu note of the

news items published in The Tribune on 28th August, 2006; 29th August,

2006 and 30th August, 2006, and observed that the most prosperous

town of the State is on the verge of a huge human tragedy, and thus,

intervention of the Court was called for to take immediate and radical

remedial measures. The suo-motu notice taken on the articles published

in The Tribune was assigned CWP No.13881 of 2006 and was titled as

'Court on its own motion v. State of Punjab'.
</p>
<p id="p_12">               During the pendency of these two writ petitions, i.e. (1) CWP

No.7036 of 2005 titled as '<a href="/doc/106885038/" id="a_3">Nirbhai Singh v. State of Punjab</a>' and (2)

CWP No.13881 of 2006 titled as 'Court on its own motion v. State of

Punjab', on intervention of the Court various steps were taken to clean

the Budha Nullah of pollutants. Then another writ petition viz. CWP

No.14744 of 2007 titled as 'Sant Singh Namberdar and others v. State

of Punjab and others' was filed by various residents of village Beniwala

stating that this Court should take immediate steps for construction of a

drain to Budha Nullah, as due to the stoppage of drain, which carried the
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                    9
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


waste through the village pond to Budha Nullah, there is accumulation of

sewer water and rainy water in the village due to overflowing of pond of

the village. It was urged that it is causing health hazard. The grievance of

the petitioners was a result of the action taken by the authorities to close

all the drains, which from various villages carried sewer, sludge and

pollutants to the Budha Nullah.
</p>
<p id="p_13">               When demand of the villagers was being dealt with, industry

also came forward raising its own demands by instituting a writ petition

viz. CWP No.4472 of 2009 titled as 'Tajpur Road Dyeing and

Industries Association v. Union of India and others'. In this writ

petition, a prayer was made that the CPCB be directed to release the

subsidy to the extent of 25 percent of the cost of setting up of Common

Effluent Treatment Plant (hereinafter referred to as, 'CETP') under the

'Centrally Sponsored Common Effluent Treatment Plant Scheme'. One

of the grievances made was that the request of the Dyeing Association

that they should be allowed to discharge industrial wastes after treatment

into Budha Nullah as water was fit to be discharged into the drains and

watercourse, was denied on the grounds, wholly untenable. It was urged

that the reasoning advanced by the officers that the experience of 40/50

years shows that the treatment plants were not running regularly and

there was no guarantee that the system would run in a foolproof manner

should be rejected. In this writ petition, essentially it was prayed that the

industry be also allowed to co-exist and the directions issued by the

PPCB on various dates under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as, 'the 1974 Act')

be kept in abeyance.
</p><p id="p_14"> Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                       10
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


               Another writ petition, viz. CWP No.8970 of 2009 titled as

'Dyeing Effluent Treatment Society v. Union of India and others' was

filed by the Dyeing Effluent Treatment Society making a similar prayer as

was made in CWP No.4472 of 2009 titled as 'Tajpur Road Dyeing and

Industries Association v. Union of India and others'.

</p><p id="p_15">               Since the issues raised in all these five writ petitions overlap,

it will be necessary for us to give the gist of various studies carried out

under the aegis of this Court, status reports submitted by various

agencies, recommendations of various committees appointed and the

detailed orders passed in the last five years. This Court has

monitored/goaded the all concerned to take active steps for eradication

of various ills, facilitated clearance of bottlenecks, cracked whip for

stoppage of all sources which polluted and caused contamination in the

water carried by Budha Nullah to the river Sutlej. As the Court proceeded

with the problem, which was gigantic in nature, it surfaced that till the city

life of Ludhiana improves Budha Nullah cannot be saved.

</p><p id="p_16">               This Court on 19th December, 2006 considered the status

report submitted by PPCB on 16th December, 2005 and also the status

report submitted by the Executive Engineer of PPCB on 19th December,

2006. After considering the reports, this Court observed that the problem

of pollution in Ludhiana city is multi dimensional and the same has

occurred on account of unplanned industrialization of the said town. The

Court also noticed that no proper sewerage treatment plant has come

into existence and the effluents are discharged in the sewer and the

same inclusive of industrial waste is being discharged in Budha Nullah,

as no solid waste treatment plant commensurate to the waste generated

by the city has been set up. After appraisal of the status reports, the
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                    11
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


Court was aghast to note that even though four biomedical treatment

facilities were established they were not sufficient to cope up with the

biomedical waste which originated daily. The Court called upon all

concerned to take corrective measures to deal with the waste and

effluents in a comprehensive manner. It also called upon the PPCB, the

Municipal Corporation and the Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana to act in

cohesion and draw out a plan taking totality of circumstances so that

effluents and the waste do not pollute the air, water and cause soil

erosion. All the above said three authorities were directed to submit their

reports to the District and Sessions Judge, Ludhiana who was called

upon to verify the reports with the aid of any agency having necessary

expertise.
</p>
<p id="p_17">               It will be pertinent to note that the Secretary to Government

of Punjab, Department of Science, Technology and Environment had

filed an affidavit on behalf of the Chief Secretary, Punjab, in which it was

stated that Budha Nullah for the past many decades carries the domestic

effluent of Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana and treated/partially treated

effluent of various industries located at Ludhiana. In this affidavit it was

stated that as per the study conducted by PPCB in August 2006, Budha

Nullah carried the pollution load in terms of organic matter (biochemical

oxygen demand) as 90 ton per day and total heavy metals as 4.5 ton per

day respectively, and the total discharge of sewage effluent by the

Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana in Budha Nullah was about 500 million

litres per day (MLD). Furthermore, the industrial effluent discharged

directly or indirectly through sewer into the Budha Nullah was about 60

MLD and the majority of discharge in the Budha Nullah was of sewage

effluent without any treatment. It was informed to the Court that as a
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                    12
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


remedial measure, Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board

(hereinafter referred to as, 'PWSSB') was in the progress of installing

three Sewage Treatment Plants (hereinafter referred to as, 'STP') at

village Bhattian, Balloke and Jamalpur, and these STPs will ultimately be

treating 311 MLD of sewage. It was assured to the Court that the STP at

Bhattian was likely to be commissioned by the end of December, 2006

and the other two STPs would be commissioned by the end of June,

2007. It was further stated that 864 industries discharge about 60 MLD of

effluent into the Budha Nullah and out of these, 816 industries had

installed their Effluent Treatment Plants (hereinafter referred to as,

'ETP') to treat the effluent. Out of the remaining 48 industrial units which

are very small, 9 units were in the process of installing ETPs and the

remaining 39 had not installed the same. The PPCB had issued

directions under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_6">Section 33-A</a> of the 1974 Act as amended in 1988 for

closure of 15 units and the action was initiated against 24 units, and the

opportunity of personal hearing was afforded to them. The Government

in its affidavit suggested that following strategy has been drawn for

cleaning of Budha Nullah:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        Stoppage of wastewater/municipal waste into Budha Nullah.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        Release of additional water from Sutlej into Budha Nullah.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        Re-modelling of Budha Nullah.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        Bio-fencing along the banks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        Development of catchment area.

waste water into the Budha Nullah through unauthorized outlets be

immediately stopped. The Committee further suggested that the

encroachments on the land of Budha Nullah be removed and the

possession be taken. PWSSB was called upon for early completion of

STPs. The Irrigation Department (Drainage) was asked to prepare all

technical details and cost estimate for diverting adequate quantity of

water from Sirhind Canal to Budha Nullah through Nillon drain and the

Forest Department was called upon to prepare a plan for developing a

green belt on the banks of Budha Nullah. The Committee further

observed that the various industrial units had not set up ETPs for

treatment of their effluent, therefore, a CETP be installed by the PSIEC

and public awareness be also created for preservation of environment.

The Committee also noted that the dairy waste generated from dairy

complexes based at Tajpur road and Haibowal is another source of

pollution.

<p id="p_25">               As a follow-up measure, the Deputy Commissioner Ludhiana

also called a meeting of District Level Coordination Committee for

prevention and control of pollution in Budha Nullah.

project to clean Budha Nullah and to coordinate the community based

initiatives to achieve the desired objectives. Another meeting was held

on 15th May, 2006 under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary Punjab,

which was attended by very high functionaries of the State. It was

followed by various other meetings held on 23rd June, 2006 and 17th July,

2006 under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary Punjab.

in the various meetings have been given to show that the State was

aware of the problem, its root cause and the initiatives required. But

since the necessary will was lacking this Court had to cajole, pat and

wherever necessary prompt and compel by making observations and

issue directions to all the officials to coordinate and act as a team in right

earnest for solving the problem and achieving the objectives stated in

various meetings. The Court has to assume this role, as who were

responsible to govern were lacking necessary sensitivity to the human

misery.

<p id="p_28">               Thus, on 29th January, 2007 the Court noticed that the

Committee constituted by the Chief Secretary had not perused the

suggestion on the following terms of reference:

<p id="p_29">Chawla, Vice Chancellor, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences,

Faridkot; and Dr.Daljit Singh, Principal, Dayanand Medical College &amp;

Hospital, Ludhiana. It goes without saying that these members have

achieved eminence in their field of activity. The Expert Committee further

constituted a Sub-Committee called Public Health Sub-Committee and

its members also hold very eminent positions in their respective fields of

expertise. The Expert Committee considered overall effects and

consequences of pollutants thrown in Budha Nullah, on human health

and environmental degradation. The Expert Committee concluded that

the pollution and environmental degradation has led to Faeco-oral

bacterial diseases, Faeco-oral viral diseases, Parasitic diseases,

Systemic toxicity of heavy metals, systemic toxicity of chemicals and

other serious disorders. The finding of the Expert Committee was that

the effect of the pollution on environment is disastrous. The water was

having extremely high turbidity, much beyond the permissible limits and

the dissolved oxygen in the water was nil. The findings of the Expert

Committee were summed up in the order dated 29th January, 2007 as

under:
</p><p id="p_30"> Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                             18

               "... ... ... chemical toxins &amp; heavy metals as well as
       variety of aromatic &amp; aliphatic compounds, normally not
       present in river water and in a high concentration. There is a
       possibility of high concentration of toxic substances like
       amoniacal compounds, nitrites, nitrates, minerals normally
       not present in river waters. The likely source is industrial
       effluents     as    well     as    sewage,      as   there   is   heavy
       microbiological load in the form of bacteria (E coli, shigella
       spp, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp etc.), which is an
       indicator of faecal contamination and evidence of entero viral
       contamination. Likely source is sewage and animal waste.
       There is evidence of absence of species of aquatic flora and
       fauna, which are normally present in fresh water streams.
       Likely reason is anaerobic and toxic condition of the stream
       water. There is evidence of progressive biological and
       chemical pollution of soil on both banks on the river upto
       1200 meters. Evidence of presence of toxic chemicals/heavy
       metals in the food chain i.e. Vegetable and other crops
       cultivated in areas along the water course/irrigated with its
       water, reveal evidence of contamination of subsoil water
       table with chemicals as well as microbiological agents.
       Extremely unaesthetic conditions exist. The nallah, has an
       unsightly appearance a foul odour and a potential to breed
       mosquitoes &amp; other insects. These pollutants flow into river
       Satluj, wherein there is evidence of pollution for a
       considerable distance downstream. This has potential of
       disastrous consequences of aquatic flora &amp; fauna, human
       health &amp; agriculture of areas downstream, the confluence of
       Buddha Nallah with Satluj river."
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">               The recommendations of the Expert Committee suggested

measures for sewage disposal; disposal of industrial effluents; disposal

of animal excreta; disposal of slaughterhouse waste and provision of

piped water supply and regulation of village waste disposal. The

Committee further recommended that on sustainable basis there should

be restoration of Budha Nullah, of its width and flow of natural water. It

further recommended lining of Budha Nullah to check the seepage of

pollutants into the ground water, separate flow of sewage, tree

plantation, monitoring of water quality and restriction against drinking

water along the course of Budha Nullah. The Committee further called

upon the Government to regulate or issue a notification to prevent the

irrigation of vegetable crops on the periphery of Budha Nullah with its

water full of untreated toxic raw sewage.
</p>
<p id="p_33">               It was further noticed by the Court in its order dated 29th

January, 2007 that a Committee (hereinafter referred to as, 'the P.Ram

Committee') has been constituted under the chairmanship of P.Ram,

IAS, Principal Secretary to Govt. Punjab, Department of Technical

Education as a Project Coordinator and N.S. Tiwana, Executive Director,

Punjab State Council for Science and Technology as a Nodal Officer.

Project Coordinator and the Nodal Officer were directed to submit a

status report after evaluating the reports submitted by the Committee

constituted by the PSHRC.
</p>
<p id="p_34">               In pursuance of the order dated 29th January, 2007, the

P.Ram Committee submitted its status report dated 26th February, 2007

which forms a part of CWP No.13881 of 2006. The Committee informed

the Court that major decisions are required to be taken by the concerned

to achieve the objectives of cleaning of Budha Nullah. The Committee

noticed that the Court would do a great service to the citizens of Punjab

if it could persuade the Government to notify the master plan of all cities

of Punjab in the next one year and qua Ludhiana within three months.

Underlining the importance of master plan, the Committee stated that

what makes a State worth living is its environment. The environment is a

result of infrastructure of the city, i.e. roads, water supply, sewerage,

electricity, schools, colleges, market places along with the arrangement
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                           20
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


for transportation of the people including parking. The Committee stated

that the master plan includes incentives and mechanism to encourage

the citizens of the city to make optimum use of natural resources. It

stated that due to the lack of master plan in Ludhiana, the regulatory

authorities are not in a position to control the location of industries,

hazardous activities in the non-conforming areas. The concluding part

under the heading 'Master Plan' in the report submitted by the P.Ram

Committee reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">               "This has now become a bane because of untold
       miseries to the inhabitants by the polluting industry. The
       State Govt. has made efforts on one or the other occasion
       to develop special areas for shifting one particular type of
       industry so that a Common Treatment Plant could be
       installed for them. But each time, it has failed to achieve
       this due to lack of political will. Once a Master Plan is
       notified, it might be much better to direct the Association of
       each industry to find ways and means for locating all these
       industries in one area and develop it according to their
       needs. This might be much quicker and much more
       successful than the Govt. route.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">               Till the Master Plan is notified, the Govt. should ban
       locating any new industry in Ludhiana and expansion of
       existing units."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">               The P.Ram          Committee        observed   that   the sanitation

comprises collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of sewage,

storm water, solid waste including hazardous waste, biomedical waste

and plastic waste, as well as providing safe and reliable water supply,

electricity, roads and transportation system. The Committee also

suggested the options for disposal of treated sewage alternatives and

utilization of treated sewage for irrigation of land. It further stated that the

STPs to be commissioned will be inadequate as they will be treating only
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                   21

311 MLD, whereas the discharge of the city may be to the tune of 750

MLD. The Committee further stated that the reliable projections for the

next 30 years should be drawn and adequate STPs should be installed.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">The Committee further stated that the STPs being installed are basically

for domestic sewage. It apprehended that in case a substantial industrial

trade effluent is allowed to flow into the STPs, their biological system

may not work properly. Therefore, a separate treatment plant for

industrial effluents should be set up. The Committee further stated that

4.5 tons of heavy metal was daily discharged through the effluents of the

city into the Budha Nullah. Therefore, a CETP for treating the waste from

electroplating industry was necessary. The Committee stated that nearly

500 electroplating units in Ludhiana were called upon to form a Special

Purpose Vehicle for making arrangement for transport of their effluents

and its treatment through CETP. The Committee noticed that the growth

of Ludhiana from a small town to a metropolitan city necessitated the city

planners to foresee the future expansion, which according to the

Committee was imminent. The Committee felt that there was an urgent

need to draw a comprehensive plan to deal with the storm water, solid

waste, hazardous waste, biomedical waste, plastic waste, garbage and

cow dung. The Municipal Corporation was also called upon to set up a

treatment facility for animal waste generated by the slaughterhouse,

which was being thrown into the Budha Nullah. The Municipal

Corporation was reminded of its duty to take cognizance and stop

dumping of husk ash by some industries and other users in and around

Budha Nullah. Regarding the role of Municipal Corporation, the

Committee observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">               "(i)   This brings us, within the city limits, to the
       question of existence of Budha Nallah itself. It is common
       knowledge as also brought out by the Expert Committee
       appointed by the Human Rights Commission that a lot of

       garbage is being thrown by the locals into the Budha Nullah.
       As a matter of fact, the section of Budha Nullah has
       substantially been reduced by dumping of solid waste over
       the years. The Municipal Corporation, instead of banning
       solid waste and removing solid waste already dumped, has
       constructed roads on the dumped solid waste, thereby
       reducing the cross-section of Nullah. It has, therefore,
       become a violator itself in terms of encroaching/damaging
       the Budha Nullah.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">               There are a lot of other encroachments too. P.Ram
       Committee had directed the Municipal Corporation to
       demarcate the alignment of Budha Nullah with the help of
       Department of Irrigation which is the owner of the land of
       Nallah and the district revenue authorities. The Department
       of Forests and some NGOs would help in erecting pillars and
       barbed wire fencing. The Municipal Corporation has been
       directed to remove temporary encroachments immediately.
       In case of permanent encroachments, the Department of
       Irrigation would file cases before the Sub Divisional
       Magistrate for evicting the encroachers. Thereafter, the
       Department of Forests with the help of NGOs would provide
       bio-fence in the shape of Vetiver grass, shrubs and trees so
       as to arrest the flow of any chemicals including fertilizers and
       pesticides in the non-point run off into the Budha Nallah."

               On 28th February, 2007, this Court called upon the Chief

Secretary to Govt. of Punjab to file an affidavit setting out a minimum

timeframe dealing with all the points and recommendations contained in

minutes of the P.Ram Committee. Furthermore, the Chief Secretary was

also called upon to hold regular meetings to monitor the implementation

of the recommendations of P.Ram Committee so that effective steps

necessary for solving the problem are initiated to achieve meaningful

results. In pursuance of the order dated 28th February, 2007, the Chief

Secretary Punjab filed an affidavit, wherein it was stated that a deadline

was fixed to finalize the master plan of Ludhiana city before 29th

February, 2008. In the affidavit it was stated that with regard to the

domestic sewage and industrial effluents, STP at Jamalpur with a

capacity of 48 MLD was being commissioned and the work was in

progress. Another STP at Bhattian to treat 111 MLD was commissioned
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                  25

and was under stabilization, whereas the work for setting up of STP with

a capacity of 152 MLD at Balloke was in progress. It was further stated

that the PWSSB has been directed to prepare a plan for tertiary

treatment &amp; recirculation in consultation with the Municipal Corporation

and such a scheme was to be financed by the Municipal Corporation.

Furthermore, the Municipal Corporation had shifted dumping of solid

waste and garbage from Budha Nullah to other places and 75 persons

who had thrown the garbage were prosecuted by the Municipal

Corporation. Furthermore, additional land of 21 acres was acquired by

the Municipal Corporation in Noorpur Bet area for management of solid

waste. In the affidavit it was further stated that demarcation of the area

along Budha Nullah was in progress and a memorandum of

understanding was to be signed with an NGO for converting both sides

of Budha Nullah into the green belt. A proposal to set up biogas plant to

generate 9 megawatt power to take care of dairy waste was also

planned. The Municipal Corporation was also called upon to submit a

plan for storm water drainage and the Department of Industries and

Commerce had constituted a Special Purpose Vehicle for commissioning

of CETP.

<p id="p_41">               However, while noticing the initiatives being taken and the

promises made by the Chief Secretary in its affidavit, this Court in its

order dated 10th May, 2007 noted that no effective steps have been

taken for removal of slums and encroachments which have come up

along Budha Nullah. It was further noticed that for treatment of effluents

by the textiles, dyeing and electroplating units, the PPCB has not taken

effective steps.

<p id="p_42">               On 18th July, 2007, this Court had passed a detailed order

wherein it was recorded that the recommendations of the P.Ram

Committee were considered in a meeting conducted by the Chief

Secretary, Punjab on 28th June, 2007 and thereafter a presentation was

made to the Chief Minister, Punjab on 6th June, 2007 and that another

meeting was held on 12th July, 2007. The Committee acquainted the

Court with the following facts:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">       (a)     That the master plan of Ludhiana shall be notified on or

               before 29th February, 2008 and neither any new industry nor

               the expansion of any existing industry shall be permitted

               within the municipal limits of Ludhiana, except in the already

               earmarked areas, till the master plan is notified.

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">       (b)     The meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary

               Punjab took note of the observations of the Nodal Officer

               that not only Ludhiana is discharging its domestic sewage

               into river Sutlej but it is also receiving the sewage from the

               towns right from the starting point in Himachal Pradesh. It

               was suggested by the P.Ram Committee that the Municipal

               Corporation Ludhiana has an option either to use the treated

               sewage on the land for irrigation or impart tertiary treatment,

               after which the sewage can be re-circulated for many

               purposes in the city of Ludhiana. The Committee further

               suggested that by discharge of such effluents by any activity

               into the river, it cannot be permitted to be polluted as the

               water from the river is a major source of consumption for the

               inhabitants of Ludhiana.

       Commissioner, Municipal Corporation Ludhiana, it has been
       stated that the estimated cost of augmentation of sewerage
       treatment plant at Jamalpur from 48 mld at Ludhiana is
       Rs.19.38       crores,    cost    of    augmentation         of    sewerage

       treatment plant at Bhutan from 111 mld to 211 mld at
       Ludhiana is Rs.46.98 crores, cost of augmentation of
       sewerage treatment plant at Balloke from 152 mld to 252 mld
       at Ludhiana is Rs.35.64 crores, cost of construction of new
       main pumping station and sewerage treatment plant of 177
       mld at Balloke is Rs.156.77 crores and cost of construction
       of new main pumping station and sewerage treatment plant
       of 165 mld at Bhamian is Rs.131.09 crores and the total
       estimated cost of these five works would be Rs.389.86
       crores. Municipal Corporation Ludhiana is not in a position to
       bear this cost and, therefore, Government of Punjab has
       been requested to fund these projects.

       which has also been filed before us, the wastewater in
       Ludhiana is directly discharged into Budha Nallah. The
       proposal for intercepting wastewater inflows in the Budha
       Nallah is yet to materialize. Thus, Budha Nallah continues to
       be receptor of sewage, industrial effluent, solid waste and
       other wastes. Approximately 540 million liter per day (mld) of
       wastewater is discharged into Budha Nallah, and about 100
       mld is directly discharged into Sutlej river from the sewage
       treatment plant, out of which about 60 mld is on account of
       industrial effluents. The treatment capacity created/being
       created for 311 is domestic sewage. There is, thus, a gap of
       about 270 mld.

Ludhiana are required to be connected with the drainage system so that

the sewer and sullage is processed by STPs. On September 18, 2008,

this Court directed that the Chief Secretary Punjab should hold a

meeting and coordinate with the concerned departments including the

PPCB for implementation of the recommendations of the P.Ram

Committee. On 11th December, 2008, the Chief Secretary submitted a

status report and stated that the Government has received an interim

report from the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute,

Nagpur (hereinafter referred to as, 'NEERI'). It was ordered that the

Chief Secretary should discuss the interim report submitted by NEERI

and file a progress report. On 29th December, 2008, a meeting was held

under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary Punjab, wherein the findings

of the interim report submitted by NEERI were considered. The

Committee was acquainted that as per the study conducted by NEERI,

the main findings are as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">               "i.    Whereas the quality of the river water is A-
       Class (BOD less than 5mg/1, D.O. 8.2 mg/1) immediately
       upstream of the outfall of STP Bhattian, it gets deteriorated
       to E-Class (BOD 32 mg/1 with DO as nil) immediately
       thereafter. Similarly the quality of river water is rendered E-
       Class after its confluence with Budha Nallah.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">               ii.    Since no dilution is available in Budha Nallah,
       direct discharge of domestic sewage or industrial effluents,
       including washings from cattle sheds, needs to be
       controlled in view of the contamination of receiving surface
       water bodies and possibility of groundwater contamination
       in future too.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">               iii.   Out of the three STPs only STP at Bhattian is
       operational under stabilized conditions and the remaining
       two STPs at Balloke and Jamalpur are still under
       stabilization though being commissioned in June 2008. In

       addition the flows in these two STP are below the designed
       capacity, whereas excess flow is being received at STP
       Jamalpur. No methane generation is achieved on a
       sustainable basis from the STPs of Balloke and Jamalpur.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">               iv.     Out of total 272 textile dyeing units, 65 units
       were monitored by NEERI. The ETPs in only 43 units were
       found operational, while in the remaining 22 units ETPs
       were not operational. Only 4 units were found to be meeting
       the stipulated norms for discharge into the inlet surface
       waters.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_75">               v.      In case of textile units discharging onto land, it
       was observed that partially treated effluents with residual
       color are discharged onto land for irrigation. In view of the
       possibility of groundwater contamination and deterioration
       in soil fertility in future, due to continuous application, it is
       necessary for the industry to ensure that the treated
       effluents discharged must meet the standards for inland
       surface water with no residual color through upgradation of
       the existing ETP based on scientific design and their
       effective operations.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_76">               vi.     Out of total 349 electroplating units, 327 units
       are members of CETP. Out of the 22 electroplating units
       with individual ETPs 20 units were monitored. Only two
       units were found to conform to the standards for discharge
       into inland surface water.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_77">               vii.    The CETP for electroplating units meets the
       discharge norms for inland surface water with respect to all
       the parameters including heavy metals except TDS,
       chlorides and sulphates. The remaining small scale units
       with individual ETP should join the CETP for ensuring
       effective treatment of toxic effluents. The CETP may be
       upgraded for zero liquid effluent discharge including reject
       management.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_78">               viii.   The medium and large scale electroplating
       industries at individual level need to upgrade the ETPs
       aiming at zero liquid effluent discharge.

               ix.     State regulatory authorities must strictly monitor
       the upgradation of ETPs and the quality of effluents
       discharged and should not allow the discharge until the
       ETPs are upgraded and perform efficiently to meet the
       design norms.
</p><p id="p_57">               x.      Existing STPs treating combined effluents will
       not perform optimally when operated at designed capacity
       until the individual ETPs are upgraded and operated
       efficiently to meet the prescribed standards for inland
       surface waters including complete color removal.
</p><p id="p_58">               xi.     The incoming husk from cattle sheds are not
       only hindering the operation of pumps at STP Balloke, but
       the UASB reactors inlet and outlet are getting choked, and
       thick carpet of floating husk is formed at the surface of the
       reactors requiring regular cleaning. It is therefore necessary
       to segregate the cattle dung washings and restrict its
       discharge into the drains leading to STP.
</p><p id="p_59">               xii.    The average flow of STP Jamalpur was
       observed to be around 65 MLD against the designed
       capacity of 48 MLD. This flow needs to be controlled for
       stabilizing the UASB system. Once stabilized and operated
       at designed flow, it is necessary to assess plant
       performance since the ratio of domestic sewage to industrial
       effluents in combined wastewater received at STP is quite
       high.
</p><p id="p_60">               xiii.   It is observed that the finally treated effluent
       from STP Bhattian conforms to the norms for discharge into
       inland surface water. The treated effluent is still toxic as the
       bioassay test reveals that 100% mortality within 24 hours
       exposure. The toxic nature of treated wastewater may have
       toxicity effect to biological life if the receiving water body
       does not have sufficient flow to provide adequate dilution to
       bring down the concentration to safe level. The DO
       concentration in the final treated effluents ranged from nil to
       0.1 mg/1 indicating that polishing pond is not providing any

<blockquote id="blockquote_91">               To formulate the overall view and have the entire gamut of

the problem facing Ludhiana city and Budha Nullah, which has

ecological ramifications, it is necessary to take a brief note of the study

carried by the CPCB. The CPCB assessed the existing situation of the

pollution problem and suggested remedial measures to maintain water

quality of river Sutlej. The study area of CPCB included Ludhiana, which

as per the census of 2001 had a population of 13,95,053. The CPCB

further noticed that Ludhiana was having eight large integrated knitwear

factories, roughly 6,000 small to medium sized knitwear factories, 10 big

hosiery yarn mills and 150 small to medium sized worsted and woolen

yarn industries. There were also firms manufacturing bicycles, machine

tools, sewing machines, generators, diesel engines, tyres &amp; tubes and

other consumable goods. CPCB stated that the municipal sewage

having quantity of 500 MLD, dyeing effluent of 100 MLD and

electroplating effluent of 4 MLD quantity are being discharged into the

Budha Nullah. Thus, as per CPCB the total discharge of effluents directly

or indirectly into the Budha Nullah amounted to 604 MLD, whereas STPs

in the Ludhiana city had a capacity of 311 MLD. The locations of three

examination of STP-1 and STP-2 at Bhattian and Jamalpur respectively,

it was stated that these STPs were underutilized. Thus, CPCB concluded

that the sewage generation, capacity and treatment has a wide gap and

is grossly inadequate.</blockquote><p id="p_72">

electroplating industries in Ludhiana, 388 industries had become

members of CETP while the remaining 46 industries had not done so.

CPCB further stated that the water quality of river Sutlej at Ludhiana after

meeting Budha Nullah was observed to be grossly polluted in terms of

BOD, which is an important indicator of water pollution. Furthermore, the

BOD value was more than ten times than its desired level. The

               This Court on 9th August, 2010 called upon PPCB to submit

a status report. In the affidavit filed by Tejinder Kumar, Environmental

Engineer, Regional Office, Ludhiana, it was stated that there are two

major sources of water pollution in Ludhiana, i.e. domestic effluents and

industrial effluents. It was estimated that about 350 MLD sewage/sullage

is generated within the limits of Municipal Corporation Ludhiana and the

same is discharged into the Budha Nullah. PWSSB has installed three

STPs with a capacity 111 MLD at village Bhattian, 152 MLD at village

Balloke and 48 MLD at Jamalpur to treat the sewage of Ludhiana under

Sutlej Action Plan. Therefore, the total treatment capacity as per PPCB

for the domestic effluents was 311 MLD viz-a-viz generation of 350 MLD.

The STP at Bhattian was underutlized as only 80 MLD waste water was

reaching the STP due to silting of certain sewerage lines as well as non-

connectivity of certain areas of the sewerage system to the said STP.
 Civil Writ Petitions No.7036 of 2005; 13881 of 2006;                    43
14744 of 2007; 4472 of 2009 and 8970 of 2009


According to the status report, all the three STPs were not giving the

desired results for COD and TSS Parameters. It was further mentioned

that the efficiency of these STPs is hampered as a result of mixing of

industrial effluent with the domestic sewage due to common conveyance

system and this issue would be sorted out after the CETP for dyeing

industries is proposed. Regarding industrial effluents, it was submitted

that the main contributors are electroplating and dyeing industries. About

200 MLD of waste water from the industries is generated within Ludhiana

city, out of which 150 MLD is generated by small scale dyeing units of

which 130 MLD is from five clusters of dyeing units and 20 MLD from

scattered units; whereas 50 MLD is generated from the large and

medium dyeing units. All these units have their individual ETPs. It will be

apposite here to reproduce the following portion of the affidavit filed by

the Environmental Engineer:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_100">               "... ... Board is maintaining a strict check on these
       industries since some of these industries have tendency of
       discharging waste water without treatment to save on the
       running cost of Effluent Treatment Plants. Presently, the
       industries of Ludhiana are discharging their effluents into
       public sewers leading to one of the three STPs installed by
       Punjab Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Board. However, these
       STPs have been designed for the treatment of domestic
       sewage and therefore, the mixing of industrial effluents with
       the domestic sewage in the sewerage system results in
       hampering of smooth operations of STPs. There is a
       proposal to install two Common Effluent Treatment Plants
       (CETPs) of capacity 100 MLD and 38 MLD at Tajpur Road
       and Bahadurke Road, respectively. The land for 100 MLD
       Common Effluent Treatment Plant at Tajpur Road has been
       identified, whereas, the identification process of land for
       second Common Effluent Treatment Plant at Village
       Bahadurke is at final stage. There are about 200 dyeing
       industries existing in these 5 clusters, which will join three

       Common Effluent Treatment Plants. The large scale dyeing
       industries will also upgrade their individual effluent treatment
       plants so that the quality of effluent discharged from such
       industries is at par with the treated effluent discharged from
       the Common Effluent Treatment Plants."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_101">               It was further stated in the affidavit that the pollution load

from electroplating industries is higher as their effluent contains heavy

metals. The affidavit further stated as under:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">               "In order to make sure the treatment of effluents
       generated from these small scale industries, a Common
       Effluent Treatment Plant for small scale electroplating
       industries has been made operational. It is being run under
       PPP mode by SPV of industries formed by the Department of
       Industries &amp; Commerce. The Common Effluent Treatment
       Plant has been installed by M/s JBR Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,
       Phase-VIII, Focal Point, Ludhiana. All the small scale
       electroplating industries have been persuaded to join
       Common Effluent Treatment Plant. The effluents generated
       by different electroplating industries is being collected and
       transported to the Common Effluent Treatment Plant site for
       treatment. The CETP is working on the zero liquid discharge
       technology and no effluent is discharged into Budha Nallah.
       The treated effluent from the electroplating CETP is reused
       by dyeing industry adjoining to the CETP. With the
       installation of the Common Effluent Treatment Plants for
       small scale electroplating industries, the discharge of
       untreated electroplating effluent into Budha Nallah has been
       effectively controlled leading to reduction in the conc. of
       heavy metals in the Budha Nallah. Strict monitoring and
       check is being kept by the Board to detect any case of
       diversion of effluent."</blockquote>

                   Blanket (UASB) is high and if it can be reduced
                   efficiency of UASB in terms of BOD and COD will
                   improve further.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_106">                  STP Jamalpur mainly receives industrial effluent
                   and efficiency of BOD and COD removal is low as
                   compared to the other 02 STPs. Efforts must be
                   made to augment more sewage in the plant to
                   improve the performance of the plant.

                   generation (778 MLD) and its treatment capacity
                   (311 MLD) in Ludhiana, there is an urgent need to
                   augment the sewage treatment capacity in the city
                   besides optimizing the operation of existing STPs.
                No industry should be permitted to discharge
                   untreated/partially treated effluent either into Budha

Balloke were within the permissible limits, except Total Coliforms

(T.Coli). Furthermore, the various parameters of STP at village Jamalpur

were within the permissible limits, except Biochemical Oxygen Demand

(BOD), Total Coliforms (T.Coli) and Iron (Fe). This affidavit further stated

that 816 industries were visited by the PPCB to monitor/ensure the

regular operation of ETPs and air pollution control devices. Out of the

274 samples collected, 53 samples involving 48 industries were found to

be not achieving the prescribed standards and out of these 48 industries,

33 industries were given notices under <a href="/doc/81392085/" id="a_12">Section 33-A</a> of the 1974 Act for

their closure. Two industries were refused consent to operate under the

1974 Act and action was to be initiated against 11 industries. One

industry had closed down on its own and out of the 11 industries, 6 have

upgraded the ETPs and remaining 5 industries even though have also

upgraded the ETPs but the same were under stabilization. The PPCB

further identified eight large and medium industries engaged in the

process of electroplating, which were discharging their effluents into the

sewer leading to Budha Nullah. It was stated that the PPCB was

following the policy of persuasion and pressure for all the units to switch

to Zero Liquid Discharge technology. The industries had installed

reverse osmosis (RO) systems followed by multiple effect evaporators

(MEE) to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge.

cause great human misery and catastrophe.
</p>
<p id="p_90">               It is also a well settled legal proposition that the Courts

interfere only in Governmental matters in the interest of good

governance. Governance and its process has been duly defined,

Law in Public Interest Litigation, 'public interest litigation is thus, an

effective instrument of law and legal services delivery towards ensuring

administration of justice and enforcing constitutional standards and

prescriptions in the conduct of the State; particularly as regards the

weaker sections of the community.'

               In the perspective of above, we can note with satisfaction

that under the aegis of this Court, the P.Ram Committee, NEERI and

CPCB have conducted studies and have submitted their reports. They

have been duly taken into consideration by the High Powered Committee

constituted under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary of the State.

Furthermore, PSHRC has also got a study conducted from eminent

experts. The necessary inputs, as to what is required to be done by the

State Government in the form of suggestions, are already available. The

Committee of Chief Secretary has taken note of the suggestions and

necessity of initiating immediate preventive and future remedial

measures. We are also aware that it is not a part of our job to run day-to-

day affairs of the State. Neither we have the necessary expertise nor

specialization, nor are even we aware of the constraints of the State

Government and its resource limitation. We have no reason to doubt that

the State Government spends each penny wisely and that too, to take

care of the immediate concerns of the citizens. Thus, it is not for us to

say in what particular manner and as to how the State should tackle the

problem which has been caused due to neglect of Budha Nullah. Suffice

it to say, various bodies like PSHRC, the P.Ram Committee, NEERI and

CPCB have brought to the notice of the State Government as to what is

required to be done by it. As stated earlier, the Chief Secretary in various

deliberations, meetings and the affidavits filed before us has also agreed

that the steps suggested by the above said bodies, require immediate

attention of the State for discharging its statutory functions towards

community health, safety, ecology and for ensuring a dignified living to

the citizens of Ludhiana. Therefore, we shall refrain to give our advisory

opinion while exercising jurisdiction in public interest litigation. However,

we shall expect that the State Government, Municipal Corporation,

PPCB and the District Administration in consultation, in tandem and in

harmony with the CPCB and Ministry of Environment Union of India,

shall take all active steps for resolving the problem faced by Budha

Nullah and Ludhiana city. While doing so, we have no doubt that the

considering their grievance that by stoppage of flow of village drains into

health of villagers of the villages around Budha Nullah.

processes which form a part of the governance, this Court shall be

hesitant to enter into the scrutiny of all details of governance by the

various instrumentalities of the State. We are also sanguine that while

taking necessary action for the redressal of grievances of all, the State

Government shall balance the interests of all concerned including the

industry. They will do well to harmonize the competing demands and will

perform their bit to synthesize divergence of opinion.

concerned, we are of the view that no direction as prayed for can be

issued as industry for its profits and gains cannot show its back to

responsibilities and demands, towards betterment of the community. The

industry cannot turn blind towards its social role. Let industry at first

instance install CEPT or achieve zero liquid discharge as prescribed by

expert bodies. Thereafter, it may raise claim before the appropriate

forum for disbursal of subsidy. As and when the same is done, we are of

the view that the State Government shall take a pragmatic view and

consider the demands of the industry raised in these two writ petitions,

while balancing the legitimate concerns of all classes or sections of

people.
