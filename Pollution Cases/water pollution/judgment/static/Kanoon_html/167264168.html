I state that, I have decided to discontinue industrial operations of my concern M/s KJ Metal Industries at its present site at No.163, S.N.Chetty Street, Royapuram, Chennai - 600 013 and to relocate the same to a new location.  There are machineries, that includes melting furnace, rolling machine etc, worth of several lakhs lying idle inside my above mentioned closed unit and the same may be permitted by this Hon'ble forum to be removed from my above mentioned closed unit and the same may be permitted by this Hon'ble forum to be removed from my above mentioned closed unit.  As almost all machineries were attached to earth, a short span of one month may be required for the completion of entire process of removal of all machineries, that includes mobilization of funds, manpower etc.  Further, sufficient lighting arrangement is required during the process of removal machineries.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	4.	I state that the above mentioned premises at No.163, S.N. Chetty Street, Royapuram, Chennai - 600 013 was leased to me and subsequent to the removal of machineries.
