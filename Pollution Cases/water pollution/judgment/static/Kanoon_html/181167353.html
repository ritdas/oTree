CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 10-11-2017

                Heard Mr. Siya Ram Shahi, learned counsel appearing for

    the petitioner and Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned senior counsel

    appearing of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (hereinafter

    referred to as 'the Board').
</p>
<p id="p_14">                The petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 19.8.2017

    at Annexure-3, whereby the establishment of the petitioner had been

    directed to close its operation, inter alia, on grounds of not obtaining

    permission of 'Consent to Operate' as stipulated under the Water

    (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred
 Patna High Court CWJC No.13308 of 2017 dt.10-11-2017                              2




         to as 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>') and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

         Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>').

</p><p id="p_15">                      Mr. Shahi, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

         has invited the attention of this Court to a letter of the Regional

         Officer of 'the Board' that even when a show cause notice has been

         issued by the Regional Officer on 17.8.2017 fixing the date on

         12.9.2017, the order of closure has been passed on 19.8.2017.

</p><p id="p_16">                      Mr. Kishore, learned senior counsel appearing for 'the

         Board' has invited the attention of this Court to the 'Consent to

         Establish' order at Annexure-2 to submit that clause (i) of the

         condition specifically stipulates that the petitioner would have to

         obtain 'Consent to Operate' under the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>' prior to

         commissioning of plant which has not been done by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_17">                      Responding to the argument, Mr. Shahi submits that

         although complaint was received in respect of Chintu Agro Food

         Industry but it is proceeding against the said complaint that the

         petitioner has been subjected to penalty.

</p><p id="p_18">                      I have heard learned counsel for the parties and I have

         perused the records.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                      The order at Annexure 2 and the notice at Annexure R5/B

         of the counter affidavit of 'the Board' are operating in different

         field. While it is the failure on the part of the petitioner to obtain
         Patna High Court CWJC No.13308 of 2017 dt.10-11-2017                                  3




                  'Consent to Operate' order as mandated in the 'Consent to Establish'

                  order present at Annexure 2 which has led to the order dated

                  19.8.2017 at Annexure-3 directing him to close his establishment, on

                  the other hand the notice dated 17.8.2017 is a notice under the

                  'Consent to Establish' order for failing to observe with the

                  stipulations present therein and for which an opportunity was

                  granted to the petitioner to represent on 12.9.2017.

</p><p id="p_20">                               It is undisputed that until passing of the impugned order at

                  Annexure 3, no application for obtaining 'Consent to Operate' was

                  filed by the petitioner which, according to Mr. Shahi, has been done

                  subsequently.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                               In the circumstances no cause is made for indulgence or

                  for interference with the notice under challenge impugned at

                  Annexure 3 or the show cause at Annexure R5/B of the counter

                  affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                               The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
