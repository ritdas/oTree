JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON):

</pre><p id="p_1">1.      By this common order, we shall dispose of two appeals, being

Appeals No. 68 of 2012 and 69 of 2012, as common questions of

law on somewhat similar facts and grounds arise for consideration

in both these appeals. Appeal 69 of 2012 was argued as the lead

case.
</p>
<p id="p_2">FACTS:
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.      We may, at the outset, refer to the facts of both the cases

giving rise to the present appeals. The State Pollution Control

Board, Odisha, (for short the 'Board'), is a statutory body,

constituted under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>') and the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short the 'Air


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                      2</span>
 Act'). The Board, in exercise of its powers, introduced bank

guarantee system vide its Resolution No.17617 dated 18th August,

2003. The said resolution reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "A number of Acts &amp; Rules have been enacted for the
     purpose of preventing pollution from different sources &amp; for
     protection of the environment. Basing on these Acts, the
     Central Pollution Control Board, State Govt. &amp; the State
     Pollution Control Boards are empowered to file complaint
     cases resulting in the closing down of defaulting industries
     through disconnection of electricity &amp; water supply. There is
     hardly any other provision to pressurise defaulting industries
     to install required pollution control system or to impress upon
     them to upgrade their existing pollution control systems so as
     to comply with the prescribed norms. The Hon'ble Supreme
     Court of India, while dealing with different public interest
     litigations on environmental matter, has laid down different
     principles in order to pressurise the industries to control
     pollution or to restore the environmental degradation through
     "Polluter to Pay" principle.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           It has been experienced that the orders of closure and
     disconnection of electricity etc. served on the industries at
     times create social problems like non-payment of wages to its
     workers due to lack of adequate provisions in the Act. Under
     such prevailing circumstances, a new instrument namely
     Bank guarantee system has been introduced by the West
     Bengal Pollution Control Board. Such an imposing of Bank
     guarantee has already come up before the judicial scrutiny in
     the Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta in the matter of WP5938(W)
     of 2000 wherein the letter has notionally endorsed the State
     Board to monitor the policy of Bank Guarantee towards
     effective pollution control.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          Introduction of Bank Guarantee system in respect of
     defaulting industries within the purview of State Pollution
     Control Board, Orissa was under the active consideration of
     the Board for some time past. This matter was placed before
     the Board in its 75th meeting held on 27.06.2003. After going
     through the concept paper prepared by the C.P.C.B., the
     Board unanimously resolved to introduce the Bank guarantee
     system for the defaulting industries in the following manner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     a)   Industry that fails to install necessary pollution control
          equipment so as to meet the prescribed standard.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     b)   Industry whose pollution control equipment are
          inadequate to meet the prescribed standard.
          At the first instance, show cause notice will be issued to
          the defaulting industry indicating the intention of issuing

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                    3</span>
           direction for closure. Then the industry will be asked to
          furnish a time bound action plan for installation of
          pollution control equipment or up gradation of the
          existing pollution control system. Simultaneously the
          industry will be asked to furnish Bank Guarantee of a
          stipulated amount for implementing the action plan. If
          the industry fails to comply within the timeframe, the
          amount of Bank Guarantee will be forfeited. Alternately if
          compliance is ensured in time the amount of Bank
          guarantee will be released. The industries, those will be
          asked to furnish Bank Guarantees are to be decided on
          case by case basis through a committee. Chairman, State
          Pollution Control Board has been authorised by the
          Board to constitute a committee, that will decide the
          procedures to be adopted including the quantum of Bank
          Guarantee submitted to this effect. However, the
          minimum Bank Guarantee should not be less than 10%
          of the pollution control equipment necessary for the
          purpose. The amount so forfeited will be utilised
          faithfully     for    pollution    control     abatement
          schemes/programmes of the said industry.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                The original Bank Guarantee will be retained in the
          Accounts Section of the Head Office and the cashier will
          be responsible for its safe custody. Photo copies of the
          said instrument will be tagged to the concerned industry
          file endorsing simultaneously to the Law Officer. A
          register will be maintained by the cashier reflecting the
          following entries.

<p id="p_4">3.   In Appeal 68 of 2012, the Board had granted consent to

operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a> in respect of Respondent Unit's Sponge

Iron plant on 24th July, 2007, valid till 31st March, 2011. This

consent was issued after inspection of the premises. Thereafter, on

28th March, 2008, the Board issued a closure notice to the

respondent-unit in terms of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                   4</span>
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act. In its notice, it was stated that, on the

basis of inspection conducted on 15th March, 2008, a number of

deficiencies were noticed in the working of the unit and there was

no compliance with the conditions of the consent. The deficiencies

noticed were as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">             Bag filters attached to Kiln-I &amp; II were not functioning
              properly thereby causing heavy Leakage in between
              heat exchanger and bag filter,
             Profuse leakage observed from the emergency cap and
              slip rings of both the rotary kilns,
             Accumulation of dust and fugitive emission was
              observed near bottom of all the bag filters attached to
              cooler discharge, intermediate bin, product house and
              stock house,
             Heavy fugitive emission was observed due to improper
              collection and handling of dust of bag filters at rotary
              kilns,
             Internal drains are not maintained properly,
             No water sprinkling is made on the internal road and
              heavy dust accumulated on the internal road.
              Approach road to the factory is not black topped,
             Neither soil cover nor water sprinkling arrangement
              has been provided in solid waste dumping area,
             House keeping is poor and heavy dust is accumulated
              near bag filter area, below kiln area, product house
              and stock house causing fugitive emission."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">4.   Vide    letter   dated   7th   May,   2008,   the   Board   informed

Respondent No.1 (for short also 'the industry'), inter alia, that as a

result of non-compliance and to consider the request of Respondent

No.1 for permitting the unit to function, subject to such conditions,

as may be imposed, Respondent No.1 had to furnish a performance

bank guarantee for a sum of five lakh rupees, valid for three years

and an affidavit in the prescribed proforma.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.   Respondent No.1, in compliance with the letter dated 7th May,

2008 of the Board, furnished the performance bank guarantee and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                        5</span>
 the affidavit on 8th May, 2008, undertaking that in the event of

deliberate violation of the conditions stipulated, the bank guarantee

amount may be forfeited in part or in full. On this condition, the

industry was permitted to function on 12th May, 2008.

</p><p id="p_8">6.   The Board carried out an inspection of the plant of

Respondent No.1 and found operation of the industry satisfactory

and that the non-compliances mentioned in the notice letter dated

7th May, 2008 had been complied with. The Board, vide its letter

dated 4th June, 2008, directed Respondent No.1 to install and

commission ESP in respect of the two kilns operated at its Sponge

Iron plant and phase out the gas cleaning plant within six months.

The industry was inspected again on 27th December, 2008 and the

inspecting team made the following observations:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "Both the kilns (50 TPD each) were in operation. Heavy fugitive
     dust emission was found to be taking place from Product
     House, I-Bin, coal circuit, kiln feed chutes and cooler
     discharge building. Most of the tanks/pits (for dust handling
     purpose) connected to the hoppers of GCPs and bag filters
     were dry and not covered leading to emission of dust from the
     pits. There was minor leakage of flue gas from the emergency
     caps of both kilns though both the GCPs were in operation.
     Emission from the stack connected to GCPs was visibly high."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">7.   In its inspection report, various deficiencies were noticed and

the Board issued a show cause notice dated 24th February, 2009,

calling upon Respondent No.1 to show cause as to why the consent

to operate granted by the Board may not be revoked. This show

cause notice was responded to vide letter dated 3rd March, 2009

and it was stated that they were taking appropriate steps to ensure

compliance with the conditions imposed by the Board. Again on

23rd March, 2010, the inspecting team of the Board visited the unit

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                    6</span>
 of Respondent No.1 for verification of the operational status of

different pollution control equipment and for assessment of the

overall   environmental   compliance    by   the   industry.   Certain

deficiencies were pointed out in its report and again a show cause

notice was issued on 21st May, 2010, requiring Respondent No.1 to

show cause as to why the consent to operate may not be revoked.

The Board, vide its letter dated 27th June, 2011, also called upon

Respondent No.1 to extend the validity of the bank guarantee uptil

30th June, 2012. This was not done and the Board again issued a

reminder on 17th October, 2011 to Respondent No.1 for extending

the bank guarantee, as required. On 8th November, 2011, the

industry of Respondent No.1 was again inspected and an inspection

report dated 11th November, 2011 was prepared. Respondent No.1,

after inspection, submitted the bank guarantee on 3rd April, 2012

for a sum of five lakh rupees, valid till 30th June, 2012. Thereafter,

no action was taken by the Board. In fact, vide order dated 4th April,

2012, the Board granted consent to Respondent No.1 to operate till

31st March, 2013.     The Assistant Environmental Scientist, the

Environmental Engineer and the Sr. Environmental Engineer of the

Board made a recommendation on 24th April, 2012 that the bank

guarantee be forfeited in view of non-satisfactory performance and

non-compliance with the environmental clearance conditions, and

as a result thereof, the Board, vide its letter dated 26th May, 2012

requested the Indian Overseas Bank to forfeit the bank guarantee

amount of five lakh rupees. The Bank, vide its letter dated 5th July,

2012 intimated the Board that the bank guarantee amount of five


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                     7</span>
 lakh rupees stood forfeited and submitted a bank draft of five lakh

rupees in that behalf. The action of the Board was challenged by

Respondent No.1 by filing an appeal before the appellate authority

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.   It is the case of the Board that Respondent No.1 admitted even

before the appellate authority that the environmental clearance

conditions were not complied well within the stipulated time.

Despite that, the appellate authority, vide its order dated 8th

November, 2012 allowed the appeal preferred by Respondent No.1

and set aside the order dated 26th May, 2012 of the Board.



</p><p id="p_11">9.   Aggrieved by the order dated 8th November, 2012 passed by

the appellate authority, the Board has preferred the present appeal

contending that the resolution of the Board requiring an industry to

furnish a bank guarantee is in accordance with law. The Board has

been vested with the power of issuing direction of closing an

industry, and therefore, is requiring the industry to furnish a bank

guarantee as a condition for grant and continuation of the consent,

and it being less rigorous, would be permissible in law. It is a

financial tool to achieve sustained compliance with the prescribed

environmental parameters. The decision of the Board is not penal

but is regulatory and compensatory in nature. Both these aspects

are essential requirements for a clean and decent environment and

are in consonance with the preambles of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water

Act</a>. The industry has committed persistent violation of the terms

and conditions of the consent order and the prescribed parameters.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                   8</span>
 It has caused a serious injury to the environment.      Show cause

notices on different dates were served upon the industry and even a

number of inspections were conducted, including on 23rd March,

2010 and 3rd January, 2013, which showed that the industry had

always been committing breach of the consent order. Resultantly,

the bank guarantee had rightly been invoked and forfeited. It is

further contended that the appellate authority has failed to

appreciate the real controversy in issue and has taken into

consideration irrelevant matters and grounds. Thus, its order is

liable to be set aside. The industry has taken the benefit of running

its unit by furnishing the bank guarantee and that too without any

protest. Thus, the industry cannot be permitted to challenge the

correctness of such condition.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">10. As opposed to this, the contention on behalf of the private

respondent-industry is that the Board is not vested with any power

to ask for a bank guarantee. Such exercise of power is not backed

by any statutory provision. The imposition of such condition is

punitive in nature, and is therefore, beyond the scope of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Section

31A</a> of the Air Act. However, if any penalty is to be imposed, it has

to be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VI of the Air Act.

Recourse to any other provision by implication or otherwise would

be impermissible. Asking for furnishing of the bank guarantee itself

is a penalty and so is its invocation. The only power vested with the

Board is to prosecute the industry or direct its closure in

accordance with law. The invocation of the bank guarantee, in any


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                    9</span>
 case, is not as per terms of the bank guarantee as there was no

deliberate act/default on the part of the industry and in fact it had

made all efforts to take anti-pollution measures.     The industry is

not a polluting industry, and therefore, the encashment of the bank

guarantee is bad in law. According to the respondents, the order of

the appellate authority does not call for any interference.



</p><p id="p_14">11.   In this appeal and in all the matters before the Tribunal, the

stand of the Central Pollution Control Board (for short the 'CPCB') is

that a bank guarantee can be asked for as it is in line with the

doctrine of corporate social responsibility. The degradation of

environment caused by the industry or any damage to the

environment has to be made good by the industry. The industry has

been a persistent defaulter and any direction to comply with the

conditions of the consent order is in conformity with law.



</p><p id="p_15">12.   The CPCB, in its 126th meeting, approved that the amount of

bank guarantee to be furnished by a non-compliant industrial unit

to the State Board shall be 10% (minimum) or more in specific

cases of the cost of pollution control equipment. In this meeting, it

was decided that in case of the non-compliant industrial unit, a

bank guarantee would be furnished by the unit concerned to the

State Board. This was primarily to achieve compliance of the

prescribed environmental standards within a reasonable time

frame. The CPCB approved the model prepared by West Bengal

Pollution Control Board in that regard.

<p id="p_16">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                    10</span>
</p><p id="p_17"> 13. Now, we may notice the facts in Appeal No.69 of 2012. The

necessary facts, as noticed by the appellate authority, are that the

respondent-industry, in this case, is engaged in the business of

manufacture of sponge iron and billet as well as generation of power

in its industrial plant at Purunapani under Joda sub-division of

Keonjhar district. The consent to operate the unit was granted by

the Board and it was extended from time to time. The Board, while

intimating the appellant that the compliance position has been

verified by its Regional Office, Sambalpur, directed the appellant

vide its letter dated 12th June, 2009 to furnish a performance bank

guarantee in favour of the Board to the tune of Rs.17.50 lakhs,

valid for three years, supported by an affidavit as per the proforma

prescribed. The industry, vide letter dated 18th June, 2009,

furnished the bank guarantee and also filed an undertaking. It was

stated that in the event of deliberate violation of the terms

stipulated in the letter dated 12th June, 2009, the bank guarantee

would be liable for forfeiture in part or full. On 20th July, 2009, the

Board, considering the application of the appellant for renewal of

the consent, issued the consent order to operate the industry, valid

till 31st March, 2010, under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a>. On 20th November,

2009, the industry wrote a letter to the Senior Environmental

Engineer of the Board seeking extension of time to complete the

installation of bag filters since it had already placed purchase order

for supply and erection of bag filter system as well as to complete

the concreting of the internal roads, etc. The Board, vide its letter

dated 30th November, 2009, directed the industry to furnish a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                     11</span>
 report within 10 days stating the requisite steps and rectification

measures taken for compliance with the issues mentioned therein.

This was replied to vide letter dated 3rd December, 2009 pointing

out that it had already submitted a few photographs of the

concreting and black topping of the internal roads which could not

be done because of prolonged monsoons. It also stated that the

installation of bag filters would be completed by January, 2010 and

water sprinklers and black topping/concreting the road would be

done by the end of March, 2010 positively. The Board then asked

the industry to furnish a compliance report. The industry asked for

extension of time to comply with these conditions. Vide letter dated

17th May, 2010, the industry informed the Board of the requisite

steps that it had taken, including installation of fixed topping/water

sprinklers along side the internal roads to contain fugitive

emissions due to vehicular traffic. The industry put up a claim that

it had complied with the conditions and was adhering to the

prescribed standards. Vide its letter dated 8th June, 2010, the

Board granted consent to the industry to operate till 30th

September, 2010 and directed the industry to complete the required

jobs of (i) upgradation of bag filters as per the recommendations of

the I.I.T., Kharagpur; (ii) installation of pneumatic dust handling

system at hoppers of all bag filters; and (iii) concreting/black

topping of remaining part of the internal roads. This was required to

be done by 30th September, 2010 failing which the bank guarantee

was liable to be forfeited. The industry, vide its letter dated 21 st

August, 2010, informed the Board that it had complied with all the

 recommendations of the team of IIT, Kharagpur, and that no further

compliance was required. On 27th November, 2010, the Board

granted consent to operate till 31st March, 2011. Thereafter, on 7th

July, 2011, the Board issued a show cause notice under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Section

31A</a> of the Air Act, directing the appellant to fulfil the requirements,

as laid down by the IIT, Kharagpur, failing which a direction for

closure of the industry would be issued without giving any further

opportunity. In reply, the industry, vide its letter dated 20th July,

2011, requested the Board to grant time till 31st December, 2011 to

complete the remaining work. The relevant part of this letter reads

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     "..... In our compliance report, it was clarified that existing bag
     filters in CD and PH area, not only satisfy all the norms
     suggested by IIT, Kharagpur, but are superior to their
     recommendations, except the fan capacity. It is also explained
     that the fan capacity was based on the main duct size which is
     related to number of suction points, number of bags used, air
     to cloth ratio and motor rating. Since all the existing
     parameters were superior to the recommendation of IIT,
     technically, there was no need to increase the capacity of fans
     which could adversely affect the system.

complied with the directions issued from time to time and was

operating in accordance with law.

the Board to return the bank guarantee since it had complied with

all the conditions. The Board did not return the bank guarantee in

terms of the request of the industry and instead decided to invoke

the same. At this stage, it may be noticed that the Board had

inspected the industry on 29th January, 2010 to verify the non-

compliance of the consent-conditions and to assess the present

operational status. An inspection report dated 17th/20th February,

2010 was prepared wherein it was stated as under:

          (NOC), the industry was to seek Environmental Clearance
          from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt. of
          India. However, the coal washery along with dust
          extraction system was installed inside the premises and
          was ready for operation without obtaining Environmental
          Clearance from the MoEF and consent to operate from the

the industry stating that several opportunities had already been

given and sufficient time had been granted to comply with the

requirements but the directions of the Board had not been fully

implemented. The industry was asked to show cause by 7 th August,

2011 as to why it be not closed in terms of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Section

extension of time till December, 2011 was sought by the industry

vide letters dated 20th July, 2011 and 30th July, 2011. The industry

was also inspected on 23rd August, 2011, particularly with respect

to upgradation of bag filters, installation of pneumatic dust

handling system at the bag filters and at the ESP. It was noticed

that these had not been provided by the industry. It was then

informed by the industry that it would be installing the said

systems by 31st December, 2011. On this assurance, the consent

was renewed till 31st March, 2012 vide order dated 23rd September,

2011. The relevant direction of the said order reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">          "You are directed to complete the installation of PDHS at

<p id="p_24">19. The industry, vide its letter dated 21st March, 2012, informed

that it had complied with the conditions and requested the Board to

inspect the premises. The industry was again inspected on 24th

March, 2012 and the inspection report dated 24th March, 2012 was

prepared and the consent to operate was extended till 31 st March,

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">     (e) To what relief, if any, the appellant is entitled to?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">24. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">The Water Act</a> was enacted keeping in view the problem of

pollution of rivers and streams, which had assumed considerable

importance and urgency in the recent years as a result of growth of

industries and increasing tendency of urbanisation to ensure that

the domestic and industrial effluents are not allowed to be

discharged into the water bodies without adequate treatment. Thus,

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Act</a> had provided for prevention and control of water

pollution and maintenance or restoration of wholesomeness of

water as well as for establishment of bodies/Boards required to

achieve these purposes. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Then the Air Act</a> was enacted keeping in

mind the increasing industrialisation and the tendency of the

majority of industries to congregate in areas which are already

heavily industrialised. The problem in relation to air pollution was

felt to be more acute in those heavily industrialised areas which are

densely populated. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_20">The Air Act</a> was thus to provide for prevention,

control and abatement of air pollution and also for establishment of

the Boards to attain the said objective and to perform the functions

connected therewith.

<p id="p_33"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                        18</span>
</p><p id="p_34"> 25. A very significant aspect of these Acts was the constitution of

the Boards to exercise the powers vested and the functions which

they were required to perform under the respective Acts. Presence of

any pollutant in the atmosphere is air pollution under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a>,

and any contamination of water or alteration of the physical,

chemical or biological properties of water by any means is pollution

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_22">Water Act</a>.

<a href="/doc/1966744/" id="a_24">Section 4</a>, State Pollution Control Boards are to be constituted.

under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_28">Section 16</a> of the Air Act, the main function

of the CPCB is to improve the quality of air by preventing,

 controlling or abating air pollution in the country. This is the

fundamental function of the CPCB. Without prejudice to the

generality of this function, the CPCB is to perform advisory

functions, plan and co-ordinate the activities of the State Boards,

provide training, collect requisite data and most importantly plan

and execute a nation-wide programme for prevention, control or

abatement of air pollution, and with this purpose in mind, the

CPCB is required to lay down standards for quality of air. Besides

the specific functions, it is obligatory on the CPCB to perform such

other functions as may be prescribed. The State Boards have also to

perform similar functions but greater emphasis has been laid in

<a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_29">Section 17</a> of the Air Act on the advisory functions of the State

Boards where it is required to advise the State Government

concerned with respect to suitability of any premises or location for

carrying on any industry which is likely to cause air pollution. The

State Board is also required to inspect air pollution control areas to

ensure adherence to air quality standards. The State Board has also

to perform functions, as may be prescribed by the CPCB or the

State Government.

<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">28. Most importantly, under both <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_30">Sections 16</a> and <a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_31">17</a> of the Air

Act, the CPCB and the State Board respectively have to perform

such other functions and such other acts as may be necessary for

the proper discharge of these functions and generally for the

purposes of carrying into effect the purposes of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_32">Air Act</a>. If one

analyses these provisions co-jointly or conjunctively, it does not

admit of any ambiguity that prevention, control or abatement of air

 pollution is the ethos of the functions of the Boards. In the scheme

of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_33">Air Act</a>, every State Government, in consultation with the

State Board, is required to issue a notification and declare, in such

manner as may be prescribed, any area or areas within the State as

air pollution control area or areas for the purpose of this Act. Thus

it is only in a duly notified area in terms of <a href="/doc/1384966/" id="a_34">Section 19</a> of the Air Act

that the action for violation and for enforcement of the provisions of

the Act could be taken by the Board.        The prescribed standards

under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_35">Air Act</a> shall have over-riding effect over other legislations

including the provisions of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_36">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1939. <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_37">Section 21</a>

of the Air Act makes it mandatory that no person shall, without

previous consent of the Board, establish or operate any industrial

plant in an air pollution control area. <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_38">Section 21(1)</a> of the Air Act is

prospective while the proviso to this sub-section contemplates that

even the existing units have to take permission/consent of the

Board and make appropriate application for that purpose from the

date of coming into force of this Act. The application for obtaining

consent has to be dealt with expeditiously by the Board. Thus, this

Act squarely applies to all industries, either existing or which are

expected to be established in any air pollution control area. After

following the prescribed procedure and making such inquiry as it

may deem fit, the Board shall, by an order in writing and for

reasons to be recorded in writing, grant the consent applied for

subject to such conditions and for such period, as may be specified

in the order or refuse such consent in terms of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_39">Section 21(4)</a> of the

Air Act. The State Board can cancel this consent or refuse further


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                      23</span>
 consent but it can do so only after granting a reasonable

opportunity of being heard to the affected party. <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_40">Section 21(5)</a>, of

the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_41">Air Act</a> makes it incumbent upon every person to whom consent

has been granted by the State Board to comply with the conditions

and these conditions would primarily relate to installation of control

equipments, which will control and prevent the air pollution.

Similarly, fixing of chimney or such other general conditions may be

imposed by the Board. To put it simply, compliance with conditions

in relation to prevention and control of air pollution, as imposed by

the Board, is the paramount obligation of the person wanting to

establish or carry on any industrial plant in the area in question.

But for such compliance, such person would not be able to

establish or carry on such industrial activity. The conditions of the

order would have to be complied with at all times. The conditions

imposed by the Board in terms of Sub-sections (6) and (7) of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_42">Section

21</a> of the Air Act shall be binding even if they are varied in

accordance with the prescribed procedure or even upon transfer of

interest in the industrial plant. The Board has the power to inspect

an industrial unit wherever it apprehends that emission of any air

pollutant in excess of the prescribed standards is likely to occur by

reason of any person operating an industrial plant or otherwise in

any air pollution control area. The Board may thereupon approach

the court in terms of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_43">Section 22A</a> of the Air Act and the court may

even restrain such person from discharging any air pollutant. The

Board is empowered to take air emission samples and make regular

</p><p id="p_49">29. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_45">Section 31A</a> vests a very wide power in the Board where in

exercise of its powers and performance of its functions under the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_46">Air Act</a>, it may issue any direction in writing to any person, officer

or authority and such directions would include closure, prohibition

or regulation of any industry or operation and stoppage or

regulation of supply of water, electricity or any other service to the

industrial plant. This power is unfettered and has an over-riding

effect over all the laws subject to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_47">Air Act</a> and

subject to any specific direction issued by the Central Government

in that behalf. The power to issue directions under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_48">Section 31A</a> is to

be exercised in consonance with the principles of natural justice

and is appealable to the National Green Tribunal          in terms of

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_49">Section 31B</a> of the Air Act. Sections 37 to 39 of Chapter VI of the Air

Act deal with certain penal actions which can be taken by the

Board. If any person fails to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_50">Sections

21</a> and <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_51">22</a> or directions issued under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_52">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act, he

could be punished with imprisonment which may extend to a term

not less than one year and six months but may extend to six years

and with fine. <a href="/doc/1255168/" id="a_53">Section 39</a> of the Air Act imposes a generic

punishment of imprisonment uptil three months or with fine which

may extend to Rs.10,000/- or with both wherever a person

contravenes any of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_54">Air Act</a>. No court, inferior to

that of a Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate of the first

 filed by the Board or any officer authorised in this behalf who has

given notice of not less than sixty days of the alleged offence.



</p><p id="p_50">30. From the above analysis, it is clear that the Board has

preventive, punitive and curative powers. While reading the object

and reasons in conjunction with <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_55">Sections 16</a> to <a href="/doc/656953/" id="a_56">18</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_57">Section 31A</a>

of the Air Act, it is clear that the powers of the Board to issue

directions are to be exercised with the primary object of prevention,

control and abatement of air pollution. The most fundamental

aspect of environmental law is prevention and control of pollution

and to provide clean and healthy environment and wholesome water

to the society at large. As already noticed, the provisions of <a href="/doc/700405/" id="a_58">Section

17(1)(a)</a> casts upon the Board an obligation to do things and

perform such acts as may be necessary for the proper discharge of

its functions and generally for the purpose of carrying out the

purposes of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_59">Air Act</a>. Upon analysis of the language of these

provisions, it is evident that besides performing the specific acts

and functions, the Board is entitled to do things or perform acts

which may be in aid thereto and for carrying out effectively the

purposes of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_60">Air Act</a>. Once it prepares a comprehensive

programme for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution,

and emission standards are prescribed, the Board then is required

to issue the order of consent to various applicant-units to establish

and operate their activities. The matter is not put to rest at that

stage but the Board is required to ensure implementation of the

terms and conditions of the consent order. It may then do such acts


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                    26</span>
 and deeds as may be necessary to ensure effective implementation

of the entire environmental programme. The powers vested in the

Board are thus of a very generic nature and are not restricted in

their scope and implementation.          These powers have to be

construed liberally and not so narrowly to the extent that it would

defeat the very purpose of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_61">Air Act</a>.          It will be appropriate to

construe them in a manner that amplify their scope to the fullest to

the extent in line with the object of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">31. It may also be analysed here that <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_62">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act

gives power to the Board to issue directions. Such directions could

be issued, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, by

the Board to any person, officer or authority to comply with the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_63">Air Act</a>. The directions thus issued shall be

binding. The legislature has laboured to give wider connotation to

these provisions and has, therefore, provided an explanation to

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_64">Section 31A</a> and clarified that the power to issue directions would

include the power to direct closure, prohibition or regulation of any

industry, operation or process and even stoppage or regulation of

supply of electricity, water or any other service. This power is

'inclusive' and not exhaustive. An inclusive definition or explanation

would take within its ambit the power to do things besides what has

been spelt out. Such inclusion is specific and must not be restricted

by undue limitations. In the case of <a href="/doc/621517/" id="a_65">State of Bombay v. Hospital

Mazdoor Sabha</a> (AIR 1960 SC 610), the Supreme Court, while

dealing with an inclusive definition under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_66">Industrial Disputes

Act</a>, 1947 held that it was obvious that the words used in an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                        27</span>
 inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated as

restrictive in any sense. Where we are dealing with an inclusive

definition,   it   would   be   inappropriate   to   put   a   restrictive

interpretation upon terms of wider denotation. The legislature, in

its wisdom, has used different expressions like closure, prohibition

and regulation. While the first two are specific terms, regulation is a

generic term. It would take within its ambit other regulatory factors

or directions which may not amount to prohibition or closure. It

may be something short of these expressions and would still

achieve the object of ensuring prevention and control of pollution

and taking steps necessary for that purpose. Such an approach

would be in consonance with the maxim Noscitur a sociis. The

Wharton's Law Lexicon, 15th Edition explains 'regulation' as a word

of broad import having wide meaning comprehending all facets not

only specifically enumerated in the Act but also embracing within

its fold the powers incidental to the regulation envisaged in good

faith in the interest of the general public.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">32. Keeping in view the legislative scheme and the object of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_67">Air

Act</a>, it is evident that the Board is not incapacitated to issue a

direction which may not be prohibitory or of closure in substance

and application, but may be regulatory with an object to ensure

that anti-pollution devices and anti-pollution measures are adopted

to prevent and control pollution. For this purpose, the Board may

require an industry to furnish a bank guarantee which would serve

dual purposes. On the one hand, it would provide incentive to an

industry to install anti-pollution devices so as to ensure non-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                        28</span>
 encashment of the bank guarantee, while on the other, in the event

of default, resulting in pollution, the Board would be able to spend

that money for remedial purposes to control environmental

degradation or damage that has taken place as a result of such

default. Both these purposes would squarely fall within the

framework of law and the powers and functions of the Board. The

purpose of requiring a Unit to furnish a bank guarantee is not penal

per se. It is compensatory i.e. an amount which would be required

to be spent upon rehabilitation and restoration of the environment

due to the damage caused to it by default on the part of the Unit.

We shall be deliberating upon this aspect at some length

subsequently, but, at this stage suffices it to note that the Board

has jurisdiction to grant consent to establish and operate or revoke

the same, subject to such terms and conditions as it may deem fit

and proper within the ambit and scope of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_68">Section 21</a> of the Air Act.

Sub-Section 4 of Section 21 grants a statutory sanction to the

Board to record reasons and the conditions, subject to which the

order of consent is being given or is being refused. The proviso to

<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_69">Section 21(4)</a> further empowers the Board to cancel the consent

even before the expiry of the period for which it is granted, if the

conditions subject to which the consent was granted, are not

fulfilled.   Besides preventing and controlling the pollution, the

Board is commanded by the Legislature to ensure that the

conditions of the consent order are satisfied and are enforced.

These conditions would obviously relate to the twin objects of

ensuring emissions as per prescribed standards and prevention of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                  29</span>
 damage to the environment.     This is the paramount duty of the

Board. The intention of the Legislature to ensure implementation of

these facets is further elucidated by the language of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_70">Section 31A</a> of

the Air Act where the Board can issue directions as afore-mentioned

in exercise of its powers and performance of its functions under the

Act. Thus, there has to be a direct nexus between the directions

contemplated under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_71">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act and the powers and

functions of the Board as contemplated under <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_72">Sections 16</a>, <a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_73">17</a> and

other relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_74">Air Act</a>. Once these Sections are

read co-jointly, then it becomes clear that a direction which would

ensure compliance of the conditions of the consent order and

further the cause of prevention and control of pollution would be a

direction permissible under law.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">33. The procedure normally adopted by the Board is to permit the

industrial operations for a definite period upon furnishing of Bank

Guarantee for compliance and compensation, if required, and

during integrin permitting the industry to comply with the various

directions and the conditions stated in the consent order including

installation of anti-pollution devices. This helps the sustainable

development as industrial activity is not straightaway closed or

prohibited but is permitted to carry on subject to compliance with

the conditions imposed. Thus, it clearly falls in the domain of

regulatory regime as opposed to prohibitory or closure regime.


</p><p id="p_57">34. The Board is a statutorily constituted expert body and is,

therefore, competent to examine and even anticipate the likely


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                  30</span>
 damage to environment by such disobedience and thus to remedy

the wrong in a timely manner. It has been stated, time and again,

that the Board has not been constituted to perform empty

formalities.   In   fact,   it   has   to   prevent,   control   and   abate

environmental pollution and for achieving the purposes and

carrying out the purposes of the Act effectively, it frames guidelines

for taking effective measures. (Refer: <a href="/doc/252884/" id="a_75">Bihar State Pollution Control

Board &amp; Anr. v. Hiranand Stone Works &amp; Ors</a>. (AIR 2005 Pat 62)


</p><p id="p_58">35. For these reasons, we are of the considered opinion that

asking for the bank guarantee, as an interim measure, during

which the industrial unit is called upon to comply with the

conditions of the consent order, does not fall outside the ambit of

statutory powers vested in the Board.

</pre><p id="p_59">36. The rights and obligations under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_76">Air Act</a> do not fall in the

realm of contract.          They are a result of statutory regime

contemplated under these Acts. The right to carry on a trade or

occupation in terms of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_77">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India is

subject to the limitations stated under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_78">Article 19(6)</a> of the

Constitution. The law has been framed by the State in terms of the

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_79">Air Act</a> and other related Acts which places a restriction or a

limitation on carrying on of trade. This restriction is with regard to

such trade being subject to the limitation of the legislations in

relation to the prevention and control of pollution.        No person can

carry on an industry or trade activity without obtaining the consent

 of a Board in a regulated area. The terms and conditions of consent

so imposed by the Board do not attract the principles of contractual

jurisprudence but are purely in the field of regulation by the

Statute. With this clear dichotomy in mind, now we may proceed to

examine if the condition in regard to the furnishing of the bank

guarantee imposed by the Board is a penalty and therefore

impermissible without aid of a specific law or without being backed

by a specific provision of law.
</p>
<p id="p_60">
</p><p id="p_61">37. Penalty law is a law that defines an offence and prescribes a

corresponding fine, penalty or punishment.          Such laws are

construed strictly in favour of the person charged with the offences.

"Penalty" is legal or official punishment such as a term of

imprisonment.     It may also mean recovery of an amount as a

penalty measure in civil proceedings or an exaction which is not

compensatory in character [Refer: Karnataka Rare Earth v. Senior

Geologist (2004) 2 SCC 783; Dunny v. Swetman (1909) 1 Kings

Bench 776; <a href="/doc/519764/" id="a_80">Khemka and Company v. State of Maharashtra</a> (1975)

</p><p id="p_63">38. Being punitive is the essence of 'penalty'.       It is in clear

contradistinction to 'remedial' and/or 'compensatory'.      'Penalty'

essentially has to be for result of a default and imposed by way of

punishment.      On the contrary, 'compensatory' may be resulting

from a default for the advantage already taken by that person and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                   32</span>
 is intended to remedy or compensate the consequences of the wrong

done. For instance, if a Unit has been granted conditional consent

and is in default of compliance, causes pollution by polluting a river

or discharging sludge, trade affluent or trade waste into the river or

on open land causing pollution, which a Board has to remove

essentially to control and prevent the pollution, then the amount

spent by the Board, is thus, spent by encashing the bank guarantee

or is adjusted thereat and this exercise would fall in the realm of

compensatory restoration and not a penal consequence.              In

gathering the meaning of the word 'penalty' in reference to a law,

the context in which it is used is significant.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">39. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_83">The Air Act</a> provides a clear exposition of both penalty and

compensatory concepts. <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_84">Section 37</a> of the Air Act deals with the

penalties that can be imposed by the Court of competent

jurisdiction for violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_85">Sections 21</a>, <a href="/doc/1161070/" id="a_86">22</a> and

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_87">31A</a> of the Air Act. This provision and the scheme in this regard do

not admit of any ambiguity. On the other hand, it deals with the

regulatory measures and power to issue directions for implementing

the provisions of the Act in terms of <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_88">Sections 16</a>, <a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_89">17</a>, <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_90">21</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_91">31A</a> of

the Act. They operate in two distinct spheres which are incapable

of being interchanged. It is the responsibility of the Board to ensure

prevention and control of pollution on the one hand and compliance

and implementation of the conditions imposed under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_92">Section 21</a> of

the Air Act.   While imposing these conditions and dealing with

them, particularly their non-compliance, the Board has to keep in

mind the three basic and fundamental principles which are now

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                    33</span>
 statutorily stated in the Indian Environmental jurisprudence, i.e.

sustainable development, polluter pays principle and precautionary

principle. We may notice that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_93">Air Act</a>, 1981

and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_94">Water Act</a>, 1974 are para materia, except the specific

number       of   Sections,   for   instance,   functions    of   the     Board,

establishing or operating an industrial unit, inspection, analysis

reports and power to give directions are identically worded. Thus, it

is not necessary for us to deal with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_95">Water Act</a>

independently. It suffices to state that the directions have been

passed by the Board in exercise of the powers vested under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_96">Sections

31A</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_97">33A</a> of the Air Act and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_98">Water Act</a> respectively. As part

of discharge of its duties and functions, the Board must take such

precautionary steps as may be necessary to prevent and control the

pollution.        It must also, where the pollution has resulted

particularly from non-adherence to the conditions imposed under

<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_99">Section 21</a> of the Air Act, remedy such wrong and make the person

pay for such pollution.             This would be in the nature of

compensation and not punishment or a penalty, as understood in

law.   The        word   "compensation"     derived    from       Latin    word

'compensare',       meaning    weighed    together    or    balance;      means

anything given to make things equivalent of what the owner has

been deprived of; a return or loss or a damage sustained, an act

which a Court orders to be done or money which a Court orders to

be paid by a person whose act or omission causes loss or injury to

another, in order thereby the person indemnified may receive equal

value for his losses. Thus, when 'compensatory' is examined with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                              34</span>
 reference to the environmental law it would obviously mean an

amount equal to the damage done to the environment.                   This

amount is assessed on approximate basis by a specialized body like

the Board, at the time of imposition of such condition. Thus, it is a

figure rationally arrived at and is intended to provide for a given

situation in the interest of environment and is not a penalty in

intent and substance within the framework of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_100">Air Act</a>.              The

Supreme Court in the case of Karnataka Rare Earth (supra) was

dealing with the penalty and compensation payable under the

Mines and Minerals Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_101">Regulation Act</a>, 1957 and the

rules framed thereunder. The Court was concerned as to whether

the amounts payable to the State for loss of minerals owned by it,

claimed by the State, would be a penalty or compensation and held

as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">             "We are clearly of the opinion that the marginal
             note 'penalties' cannot be pressed into service for
             giving such colour to the meaning of sub-Section
             (5) as it cannot have in law. The recovery of price of
             the mineral is intended to compensate the State for
             the loss of the mineral owned by it and caused by a
             person who has been held to be not entitled in law
             to raise the same. There is no element of penalty
             involved and the recovery of price is not a penal
             action. It is just compensatory."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">40. Upon analysis of the above enunciated law, it is clear that a

fine   but     unambiguous      distinction      between    penalty    and

compensation has been accepted by courts and tribunals. Distinct

and    definite   consequences     flow   from    these    actions.   Their

distinctions are procedural as well as consequential. A penal action

cannot be permitted to take in its orbit, by process of overlapping,

 an action which is patently compensatory in nature. Striking a

balance    between     environmental   interest   and    sustainable

development would require the expert bodies like the Boards to

follow a path which would permit industrial growth and still protect

the environment without allowing any irretrievable injury to the

environment. In view of that, it will certainly be permissible in law

for an expert body to provide an opportunity to a unit to attain the

prescribed standards of emission or effluent discharge before it is

directed to be closed in exercise of the powers vested in the Board.

Such approach would be in consonance with the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_102">Air

Act</a>. More so, it will make a provision also to ensure restoration or

rectification of the environmental damage done by the unit at its

cost in the case of default.

<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">41. With some emphasis, it was contended before us that

furnishing of bank guarantee and its invocation would be a penal

action and, therefore, a specific power needs to be vested in the

Board enabling it to take such an action. In other words, the power

requiring furnishing of a bank guarantee should be required by a

specific legislative provision and cannot be implied from the

language of <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_103">Sections 16</a>, <a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_104">17</a>, <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_105">21</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_106">31A</a> of the Air Act. Reliance in

this regard has been placed upon the judgment of the Supreme

Court in <a href="/doc/519764/" id="a_107">Khemka Company v. State of Maharashtra</a> supra where the

Court was concerned with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_108">Central Sales Tax

Act</a>, 1956 and the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_109">State Sales Tax Act</a>, 1953. The question was

whether in the absence of a specific provision in the Central

legislation, an assessee would be liable for penalty for default in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                   36</span>
 payment of taxes within the prescribed time under the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_110">State Act</a>.

The majority view of that judgment reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">     "On a consideration of the provisions mentioned above, it
     seems to me to be clear that whatever may be the objects of
     levying a penalty, its imposition gives rise to a substantive
     liability which can be viewed either as an additional tax or as a
     fine for the infringement of the law. The machinery or
     procedure for its realization comes into operation after its
     imposition. In any case, it is an imposition of a pecuniary
     liability which is comparable to a punishment for the
     commission of an offence. It is a well settled cannon of
     construction of statutes that neither a pecuniary liability can
     be imposed nor an offence created by mere implication. It may
     be debatable whether a particular procedural provision creates
     a substantive right or liability. But, I do not think that the
     imposition of a pecuniary liability, which takes the form of a
     penalty or fine for a breach of a legal obligation, can be
     relegated to the region of mere procedure and machinery for
     the realization of tax. It is more than that. Such liabilities
     must be created by clear, unambiguous, and express enact-
     ment. The language used should leave no serious doubts
     about its effect so that the persons who are to be subjected to
     such a liability for the infringement of law are not left in a
     state of uncertainty as to what their duties or liabilities are.
     This is an essential requirement of a good government of laws.
     It is implied in the constitutional mandate found in <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_111">Section
     265</a> of our Constitution: "No tax shall be levied or collected
     except by authority of law""
</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">42. We are afraid that the respondents cannot take advantage of

the above judgment. It is for the reason that the facts and law of

Khemka and Company supra are distinct and distinguishable. In

that case, the Court was concerned with interpretation of fiscal laws

which are to be construed strictly. Here, we are concerned with a

social legislation and have to adopt a purposive construction. There

the Court was concerned with a revenue centric law while here we

are concerned with a law involving substantial question of

environment. There, the Court was also concerned with a pure

question of law relating to penalty while we are concerned with the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                                                    37</span>
 question      of    compensatory    relief   to   remedy   the   damage   to

environment. A taxing statute is to be strictly construed. The

subject is not to be taxed without clear words for that purpose and

also that every Act of Parliament must be read according to the

natural construction of its words. This is a settled principle.

Reference in this regard can be made to the case of <a href="/doc/62826152/" id="a_112">State of

Chhattisgarh v. VTP Construction</a> [(2008) 2 SCC 578)]. The Supreme

Court had returned a finding that it was not a mere procedure or

machinery for realisation of tax but even something more than that

and such liability must be created by some specific language. In the

case in hand, the regulatory regime under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_113">Air Act</a> permits

taking of harsher steps in the nature of closure and prohibitory

directions.        Therefore, permitting a unit to operate for a limited

period upon furnishing a Bank Guarantee for compliance of the

conditions/directions imposed in the consent order, being an order

of lesser gravity and consequences, would be permissible. It is in

the interest of sustainable development and is even beneficial to the

industry itself. The Bank Guarantee asked for is for compliance,

compensation for environmental restoration, if required, and is not

punitive in nature.

of Delhi High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/10484767/" id="a_114">Splendor Landbase Limited v.

Delhi Pollution Control Committee</a>, [(2010) 173 DLT 52] in support of

their action that imposition of condition of bank guarantee is of

law. It is further their contention that this judgment of the Delhi

 High Court was upheld by a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court

without dealing with the question of penalty in LPA 875 of 2010 -

<a href="/doc/147925760/" id="a_115">Delhi Pollution Control Committee v. Splendor Landbase Limited</a>. On

the other hand, the appellants have relied upon another judgment

of the single Judge Bench in the case of Delhi Regent Automobiles

Private Limited v. Government of NCT of Delhi (Writ Petition No.7516

of 2007) where the Court took the view that power to direct

furnishing of a bank guarantee was covered under the full range of

the powers vested in the authorities and rejected the challenge to

the power of the authorities. They have also relied upon a judgment

of the Calcutta High Court which did not discuss the legal issue

and also did not interfere in the direction requiring the units to

furnish a bank guarantee.
</p>
<p id="p_72">
</p><p id="p_73">44. In the case of Splendor Land Base Limited (supra), the learned

Single Judge dealt with different questions arising in the case.

Suffices it for us to notice that the cases related to the builders of

various properties in the NCT of Delhi who had constructed

shopping complexes or malls etc. had obtained environmental

clearance under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, and had

complied with the EIA Notification of 2006.        According to the

builders they were not required to obtain clearance under the Air or

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_116">Water Act</a> from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (for short

the 'DPCC') and the penalties, fines and the environmental damage

in the form of fixed sums of monies or by requiring the builders to

furnish bank guarantees as a condition to grant consent under the

Acts concerned was impermissible in law. The learned Single Judge

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                    39</span>
 of the High Court held that to the extent certain aspects have not

been covered by EIA Clearance, it would be certainly open for the

DPCC to examine those aspects and decide whether or not to grant

consent to establish under the two Acts.     Validity of the levy of

penalties for environmental damages was discussed in paragraphs

56 to 69 of the judgment and the Court took the view that

imposition of a pecuniary liability which takes the form of penalty

or fine for breach of a legal obligation could not be levied as there

was no statutory basis for a direction issued by the CMC/DPCC.

The power to levy a penalty on any party is in the nature of a penal

power and there has to be a specific power in the statute enabling

the authority to do so. With this reasoning, the Court concluded

that levying penalty by requiring furnishing of a bank guarantee

and making the grant of consent to establish under the Water and

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_117">Air Act</a> conditional upon payment of such penalties and furnishing

of such bank guarantees was not sustainable. This reasoning of

the learned Single Judge was concurred by the Division Bench of

the Delhi High Court and the Court also said that as per the

provisions of the Acts concerned, only the Courts can take

cognizance of the offences under the Acts and levy penalties.


</p><p id="p_74">46. It is evident from the above facts and the reasoning that there

was actual levy of penalty or damages by the DPCC and it was in

consequence of such imposition of penalty/damages that the Units

were called upon to furnish bank guarantees for granting of

consent.   In other words, bank guarantee was required to be

furnished in furtherance to the imposition of a penalty or damages

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                   40</span>
 in that case. It was not an act de hors the imposition of penalty

and had the element of punitive action. In the present case, it is

not a consequence of a punitive or penal action but is in exercise of

the powers vested in the Board in relation to recalling the

conditions of consent and ensuring their implementation while also

making compensatory provision for remedying the apprehended

wrong to the environment. In the cases in hand, the Board has not

imposed any penalty upon the units but has granted consent to

them on certain conditions, none of which is punitive.             They

squarely fall within the power of the Board to prevent and control

pollution in consonance with the scheme of the Acts concerned.

Thus, on facts, the judgments of the High Court in Splendor (supra)

do not have any application to the present case. In any case, we

are of the considered view that asking for a bank guarantee as an

interim measure for due performance of the conditions of the

consent order being compensatory in nature, is not punitive.


</p><p id="p_75">46. We have already noticed above that there is a clear distinction

between a penal and a compensatory provision. In such matters,

the paramount question that would normally fall for determination

before   a   court   or   tribunal   would   be   whether   the   action

contemplated is penal or compensatory. This issue shall have to be

decided with reference to the facts of the case, the provisions of the

law applicable and the intent of the authority concerned. Once it

falls in the 'compensatory' field, then it will necessarily be beyond

the purview of penalty. The Supreme Court, in the case of

Karnataka Rare Earth supra, had stated that recovery of price of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                      41</span>
 minerals is compensatory action of the State for the loss of the

minerals owned by it and there was no element of penalty. The law,

in this regard, was clearly stated by the Supreme Court in the case

of <a href="/doc/212683/" id="a_118">Director of Enforcement v. MCTM Corporation Pvt. Ltd. and Ors</a>.

[1996 (1) SCR 215] where the gravamen of the department was that

the respondents had failed to repatriate the foreign exchange lying

in Malaysia, which they had a right to receive in India and thus

there was contravention of the provisions of <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_119">Foreign Exchange

Regulation Act</a>, 1947. In that case, the authorities were performing

quasi judicial functions and did not act like courts but only as

administrators and determined the liability of the contravener for

the breach of the obligations imposed under the Act. Explaining the

expression, it noticed, "the expression 'penalty' is a word of wide

significance. Sometimes, it means recovery of an amount as a penal

measure even in civil proceedings. An exaction which is not

compensatory in character is also termed as a 'penalty'. When

penalty is imposed by an adjudicating officer, it is done so in

'adjudicator proceedings'   and not by way of fine as a result of

'prosecution' of an 'accused' for commission of an 'offence' in a

criminal Court..."
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">47. This approach had also been applied by the Supreme Court in

relation to environmental jurisprudence. The court distinguished

between compensation for remedying damage caused to the

environment on the one hand and penalty for causing pollution for

non-compliance on the other. Reference in this regard can be made

to the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_120">M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                                 42</span>
 [AIR 2000 SC 1997] wherein it was elucidated that compensating

degradation of environment caused due to non-adherence to the

prescribed standards was different than being penalised for causing

pollution and non-compliance with statutory obligation. Remedial

and restoration measures in relation to degradation of environment

resulting from default and the money spent would squarely come

under the head of compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">48. In that case, the Supreme Court was considering the question

relating to determination of quantum of fine for causing pollution

and proceeded to clarify that conviction orders or fine, as

contemplated under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_121">Air Act</a> etc. must proceed

by a trial in accordance with law and would not fall within the

ambit of <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_122">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India. Following the

principle stated in <a href="/doc/74515204/" id="a_123">M.S. Ahlawat v. Union of India</a>, it was observed

that under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_124">Article 142</a> of the Constitution, the Court cannot

altogether ignore the substantive provisions of a statute and pass

orders concerning an issue which can be settled only through a

mechanism prescribed in another statute. Having said so, the

Court, while referring to the case of <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_125">Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum

v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. clearly stated the principle that the violator

can be directed to pay compensation by way of costs for the

restitution of the environment and ecology of the area. In addition

to the specific provisions of the statute and the rules, the Court also

referred to Articles 48A and 51A(g) of the Constitution under which

the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment

and to safeguard forests and wild life of the country. Further, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                     43</span>
 Constitution casts a duty on every citizen to protect and improve

the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, wild life

etc. and the Court, thus, concluded that if a person, therefore, is

guilty of causing pollution, he has to pay damages (compensation)

for restoration of the environment and ecology. This would be

besides the damages which he is required to pay to the person who

has suffered on account of the act of the offender. This case thus

provides a concept for compensation for causing degradation of

environment by the polluter or violator.
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><p id="p_81">49. This enunciation clearly shows that what is not compensatory

in character can also be termed as a penalty, necessarily meaning

that what is compensatory in character would not be a penalty. The

term 'compensatory' would include something that is taken for

compensating      damage    to     environment       or   for   remedying   or

abatement of environmental degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">50. In   the     present   case,    the    general    Resolution    governing

industries, particularly    the defaulting industries, was passed by

the Board on 18th August, 2003, as has been noticed earlier,

intended to invoke the 'polluter          pays' principle and required the

industry to furnish a bank guarantee for compliance with the terms

and conditions of the consent order and installation of pollution

control equipment clearly stipulating faithful utilisation of the

amount for pollution control abatement scheme/programmes of the

said industry.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                            44</span>
</p><p id="p_85"> 51. An objective analysis of the said Resolution in the light of the

principles aforestated would clearly demonstrate that the bank

guarantee asked for was not penal in nature but was clearly

compensatory in its character and ensured prevention and control

of pollution and restoration of environment. It is founded on the

precautionary principle and is not beyond the statutory provisions

of the Act concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">52. Now, we may examine the judgment of another learned Single

Judge of the Delhi High Court in the case of Regent Automobiles Pvt.

Ltd. (supra).   In that case, the Court was concerned with the

provisions of the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act,

2000 (for short the 'DCETP Act') which had para materia provisions

to the Act in question here. The challenge by the petitioner in that

case was to the fixation of charges and recovery of dues towards

setting up of a common effluent treatment plant. Upon inspection,

deficiencies were noticed in the plant.   A visit by the Inspection

Team to the premises noticed the irregularities in the observance of

parameters laid down for the related industries.     After serving a

show cause notice the petitioners in those cases were directed to

furnish bank guarantees. The challenge was that the direction to

furnish bank guarantees for specific amounts was without any legal

authority. Rejecting this argument, the Court while referring to the

provisions of <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_126">Section 16</a> of that Act, which is para material to

<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_127">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act, came to the following conclusion:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">     "14. It is an established Rule of statutory interpretation that
     every provision, which confers a power should be construed in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                  45</span>
      its own terms, enabling the authority the full range of options,
     which may naturally fall within it. Asstt. <a href="/doc/6759/" id="a_128">Collector of Central
     Excise, Calcutta v. National Tobacco Co. of India</a> AIR 1972 SC
     2563; Jamaluddin Ahmad v. Abusaleh Najmuddin 2003 (4)
     SCC 257; likewise the express grant of a certain kind of power
     implies, in cases, exclusion of other powers. This Rule also
     iterates that everything necessary to carry out the purposes of
     the grant can be done by the authority entrusted with the
     power Ref. <a href="/doc/841465/" id="a_129">State of U.P. v. Poosu</a> AIR 1976 SC 1750; <a href="/doc/925018/" id="a_130">State of
     Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi Housing Co-operative Society</a>
     AIR 2003 SC 1043.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">     15. The petitioners' contention, though attractive that the
     power to issue directions cannot comprehend the issuance of
     directions to furnish guarantees, cannot be accepted. The
     power to issue directions, under <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_131">Section 16</a> extends to
     "regulate" the industry or unit. The expression "regulate" in
     the context, wherever used, has to be given the widest
     meaning. In a remedial or regulatory enactment, as the Act
     undeniably is, this expression acts as a crucial power conferral
     on the authorities - the extent of such power is even closure of
     the industry or unit. Such being the case, the court cannot
     limit the options available to statutory authorities to meet
     emerging challenges, towards ensuring compliance with the
     provisions. In given cases, the Commissioner may not deem it
     appropriate to take the extreme step of closing down the unit;
     yet, to ensure that good practices are put in place, he may
     issue specific directions, and as a measure to ensure
     compliance, require furnishing of guarantee, valid for a period,
     or as to enable him to invoke it, to remedy the harm, which is
     sought to be addressed by the Act or Rules framed under it. In
     arriving at this conclusion, the overriding nature of <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_132">Section 16</a>,
     which begins with a non obstante clause, cannot be lost sight
     of."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_88">53. From the above referred conclusion, it is clear that the Court

heavily relied upon the wide scope of the regulatory powers. This

judgment of the learned Single Judge was distinguished by the

Court in Splendor case (supra) holding that it was of no assistance

to the petitioners before it as the provisions of the DCEPT Act were

different and that the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_133">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_134">Air Act</a> did not contain

such provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                                    46</span>
</p><p id="p_90"> 54. The power to issue directions under Section 16 of the DCEPT

Act is vested in the appropriate Authority while the punitive and

penal consequences stated under <a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_135">Sections 17</a> and <a href="/doc/656953/" id="a_136">18</a> of that Act are

not vested in the Board. These are the penalties provided which

had to be inflicted by following the due process of law as

contemplated under that Act. The judgment in the case of Regent

Automobiles Pvt. Ltd. (supra) can be applied to the facts of the

present case with greater similarity.
</p>
<p id="p_91">
</p><p id="p_92">55. At this stage, we may also notice that there has to be a direct

nexus between the directions issued within the ambit and scope of

<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_137">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_138">31A</a> of the Air Act and the object sought to be

achieved by issuing such directions. This nexus should be relatable

to the functions and powers of the Board on the one hand and to

the object of the Act on the other. Once this twin test is satisfied,

then validity of such condition can hardly be questioned. We have

already held that such nexus in the present case does exist. The

purpose was to prevent and control pollution while permitting the

industries to operate, as opposed to the closure of the industries

and thus, obstructing the sustainable development.        For these

reasons, we hold that the plea of the respondent that the direction

for furnishing of the bank guarantee was punitive or penal, is liable

to be rejected.

judgment of the High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/10484767/" id="a_139">Splendor Landbase

view that the expression 'any direction' appearing in <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_140">Section 33A</a> of

the Water Act was not wide enough to include power to issue

directions in relation to furnishing of bank guarantees. The main

thrust of the judgment was on the fact that it returned a finding

that the industry was able to show cause that it was not causing

any pollution or violating any parameters. Firstly, we do not agree

with the principle stated in that judgment and secondly, in the

present case, the appellant has been able to demonstrate on record

that the conditions of consent order were not complied with despite

 stock house and iron ore screening section, had not yet started

blacktopping/concreting of internal roads and had not complied

with the conditions of the consent order dated 30th June, 2008. The

team found other deficiencies which were pointed out. Based upon

this inspection, the industry was issued a notice in terms of

<a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_141">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_142">31A</a> of the Air Act on 29th April, 2009 requiring the

industry to show cause as to why the consent be not refused and

closure direction be not issued against the industry until the

violations are rectified to the satisfaction of the Board, to which the

industry submitted its reply on 4th May, 2009 stating that it was

taking further effective measures to control the pollution within the

next few months. It also stated that the situation had improved

considerably. It based its defence on the fact that the plant was

located in a remote area and it was difficult to get men and

machinery and requested the Board that time be granted till 31st

December, 2009 to complete the work detailed in the notice. As is

obvious from the reply, there was no serious dispute with regard to

the default in compliance as well as resultant pollution from the

industry. While considering the application of the industry to

operate the plant, as submitted in March, 2009, the Board, in

furtherance to its Resolution, asked the industry to furnish a bank

guarantee for an amount of Rs.17.50 lakhs which was to remain in

force for a period of three years from the date of its execution and,

in the meanwhile, all necessary steps were required to be taken by

the industry to ensure that no environmental pollution was being

caused. In furtherance to this letter of the Board, the industry, vide

 its letter dated 18th June, 2009, without demur or protest and, in

fact, in continuation to its request for extension to operate,

furnished the bank guarantee along with an affidavit. It will be

useful to refer to the affidavit which had been furnished by the

industry assuring the Board of complete compliance. The relevant

extracts of the bank guarantee that permitted the Board to encash

the bank guarantee, in its discretion, reads as under:

close the industry under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_143">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act.


</p><p id="p_98">59. On 19th/24th September, 2009, the industry was inspected to

verify the compliance with the show cause notice dated 29 th April,

2009 and to examine the status of various pollution control

measures adopted by the industry. A detailed inspection report was

prepared and it was mentioned in the said report the steps that had

been taken by the industry as well as the steps which had not been

taken by it. Having received this inspection report, the industry,

vide its letter dated 20th November, 2009 requested the Board for

extension of time from 31st December, 2009 to 31st March, 2010 for

compliance with the conditions. In this letter, it was specifically

stated that due to unfavourable circumstances, the contractor did

not complete the job and had left half way and after persuasion and

with extra support extended by the industry, the contractor had

resumed the work and the industry required further time. The

request for further extension of time was allowed by the Board vide

its letter dated 5th January, 2010 to rectify the defects aforestated

by 31st March, 2010 positively and to furnish a compliance report.

The industry was again inspected on 29th January, 2010. During

this inspection, certain observations were made by the Inspecting

Team and it was found that various requisite steps had still not

been taken by the industry and furthermore the ambient air quality

monitoring result showed existence of pollution and emissions were

in excess of the prescribed parameters. Still, another inspection was

 conducted on 8th April, 2010. It was stated in this report that the

unit had not taken any steps towards installation of pneumatic

dust handling system at the bag filter hoppers. The ambient air

quality monitoring result still showed violations. Vide its letter

dated 8th June, 2010, the Board informed the industry about the

drawbacks noticed during the above inspection and warned the

industry that the bank guarantee would be liable to be forfeited and

renewal of the consent would not be granted if the needful was not

done. This state of affairs persisted. The unit was again inspected

on 5th May, 2011 and another letter dated 7th July, 2011, being a

show cause notice, was issued by the Board informing the industry

of its violations and the proposed action of the Board to pass

direction of closure under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_144">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act. The industry

was called upon to complete the upgradations and modifications of

the bag filter system as well as installation of pneumatic dust

handling system. This show cause letter dated 7th July, 2011 was

responded to in detail by the industry vide its letter dated 16 th July,

2011 wherein the industry explained its various difficulties

including those with the suppliers and stated that the work would

be completed by 31st December, 2011, thus, finally praying for

grant of time till 31st December, 2011 to complete the remaining

work which was in progress. This request was reiterated by the

industry vide its letter dated 30th July, 2011. On 23rd August, 2011,

the premises of the industry were again inspected and certain

deficiencies came to be noticed. In the inspection report, it was

noticed that the unit had placed a purchase order for a pneumatic

letter dated 5th September, 2011, the industry informed the Board

that certain modifications had been carried out by them and that

CD Bag Filter ID Fan and the Product House Bag Filter ID Fan had

been upgraded and requested that their consent be renewed. Vide

its order dated 23rd September, 2011, the Board granted the

consent to operate, valid uptil 31st March, 2012 and this consent

was for the purposes specified in the consent order relating to

1x350 TPD, 8 MW WHRB + 7 MW FBC Boiler + 2 x 10 T/IF subject

to strict compliance of the conditions stipulated in the consent

order and the industry was given three months' time to complete

the installation of PDHS at ESP/BFs hoppers. Vide its letter dated

21st March, 2012, the industry informed the Board that the consent

to operate is required for lifting of iron ore, coal and dolomite and

the consent, which was valid till 31st March, 2012, should be

further renewed. In furtherance to this letter, on 24th March, 2012,

the unit was inspected and a detailed inspection report was

prepared which was communicated to the industry on 27th March,

2012. In this report, it was noticed that the bank guarantee was

valid till 12th June, 2012 and whatever direction had been issued

had been complied with and the plant was operating efficiently. In

this report, it was also communicated that the ambient air quality

at certain points was exceeding the prescribed parameters. The

observations and recommendations, as stated in this inspection

report, were as follows:

stipulated in the consent granted earlier by the Board and it was

specifically stated that in case of failure of the working/installation

of pollution control devices or non-compliance with the stipulated

norms, steps shall be taken to stop the functioning of the process

been done by the industry within the stipulated time granted. Three

senior officers of the Board prepared a cumulative report for the

period starting from 24th September, 2009 to 24th/27th March, 2012

and after noticing various repeated defaults and non-compliances

by the industry, it recommended as under:

<p id="p_101">61. Taking a view on this recommendation, the Board directed the

Branch Manager, State Bank of India, vide its letter dated 26 th May,

2012, to invoke the bank guarantee and forfeit the same for non-

compliance. The bank guarantee was valid till 12th June, 2012. The

request of the Board was agreed to and the Bank actually encashed

the bank guarantee and credited a sum of Rs.17.50 lakhs to the

account of the Board towards full and final settlement of the claim

on the basis of the bank guarantee.

</p><p id="p_106">63. From the above narration, it clearly shows that the industry

has been a persistent defaulter and polluter. The parameters,

particularly relating to air and ambient air quality, were found to be

violative   of     the    prescribed   standards.   The   Board    provided

opportunity after opportunity and extended the time in favour of the

industry to completely carry out its directions and provide anti-

pollution devices. One of the letters aforenoticed written by the

industry to the Board further clearly showed that the former never

disputed the allegations of the latter. For various reasons, the

industry always prayed for extension of time which on most of the

occasions was allowed by the Board in the interest of the industry

and development. The bank guarantee was furnished by the

industry without demur or protest. In fact, the language of the

undertaking afore-reproduced clearly shows that the entire act of

the industry was voluntary and it accepted the conditions without

any protest either on facts or on law. It not only accepted such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                         56</span>
 conditions but even implemented the directions by furnishing the

bank guarantee and the undertaking. This obviously means that to

this entire process and the conditions therein, the industry had

acquiesced itself. Furthermore, it took advantage of the situation

and persuaded the Board to elect extension for compliance as

opposed to closure of operations of the industry. The Board, having

considered various factors and facets of the problem, permitted

extension while it had the power to issue order of closure in terms

of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_145">Section 31A</a> of the Air Act. Having persuaded the Board and the

Board having altered its action in a particular manner of which

advantage accrued to the industry, the industry would also be

estopped from challenging the correctness of that very action, the

benefit of which accrued to it over a long period right from 2009 to

2012. Objection, if any, that could be raised by the industry, had

been waived by it through its conduct and action. It is a case of

acquiescence on the one hand and on the other, the respondent

could even be estopped from challenging the correctness of that

very order, the benefit of which it had enjoyed. Estoppel is a rule of

equity and evidence. It bars or prevents one from asserting the

claim or right that contradicts what one has said or done before or

what has been legally established as true. Similarly, 'waiver' is

actual intent to abandon or surrender his right by a person i.e. a

right or an objection may be available to a person in law but the

person consciously not only waives that objection or right but in

fact, acts to the contrary. Like in the present case, if the

respondents actually believed that they could raise an objection


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                    57</span>
 with regard to the condition to furnishing of the Bank Guarantee,

they ought to have raised it right at the very initial stage but they

not only failed to raise such objection albeit acted to the contrary by

submitting a Bank Guarantee without demur and protest. At this

stage, we may also refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in

the case of <a href="/doc/1579938/" id="a_146">Chairman and MD, NTPC v. Reshmi Constructions,

Builders and Contractors</a> (AIR 2004 SC 1330), where the Court, as a

general principle, has held that one who intentionally accepts the

benefits of a contract or conveyance is estopped from denying the

validity or binding effect on him of such contract or conveyance.

The appellant Board has also relied upon the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the cases of         Shyam Telelink Limited, now

<a href="/doc/187516108/" id="a_147">Sistema Shyam Teleservices Limited v. Union of India</a>        [(2010) 10

SCC 165]; Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment

Corporation &amp; Anr. v. Diamond and Gem Development Corporation &amp;

Anr. [(2013) 5 SCC 470] and Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Ed.,

Volume 16(2), which state that "on the principle that a person may

not approbate and reprobate a special species of estoppels has

arisen. The principle that a person may not approbate and

reprobate expresses two propositions:
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_82">     (1) That the person is question, having a choice
     between two courses of conduct is to be treated as
     having made an election from which he cannot resile.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_83">     (2) That he will be regarded, in general at any rate, as
     having so elected unless he has taken a benefit under
     or arising out of the course of conduct, which he has
     first pursued and with which his subsequent conduct
     is inconsistent."</blockquote><p id="p_108">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                                     58</span>
</p><p id="p_109">      In other words, if one knowingly accepts the benefits of an

order, he is estopped from denying the validity or the binding effect

thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_110">WHETHER OR NOT INVOCATION OF BANK GUARANTEE IS
PROPER:
</p>
<p id="p_111">64. We have already discussed above that it was as a result of

persistent defaults on the part of the industry that the Board made

an objective assessment on the basis of various inspection reports

and then decided to invoke the Bank Guarantee rather than issuing

directions for closure of the unit. The industry had failed to

discharge its corporate social responsibility. It had done damage to

the environment which it was liable to make good. As a persistent

defaulter, it also raised no grievance against the encashment of the

bank guarantee which, it had furnished of its own accord and

without protest in furtherance to Board's letter dated 12th June,

2009. At no point of time during the period from 2009 to 2012, did

it raise the issue in regard to the power and authority of the Board

to ask for furnishing of the bank guarantee. On the contrary, it

enjoyed the benefits thereof by carrying on its activities, despite

being a defaulter. The data furnished in the inspection reports of

the Board leaves no doubt in our minds that the bank guarantee

had been invoked when on repeated inspections, it was found that

the industry is a persistent defaulter and thus, was causing air

pollution, particularly in relation to ambient air quality and after

issuing show cause notices to the industry from time to time. The

Board, thus, was fully justified in invoking the bank guarantee.

Ancillary but the most significant question that now arises for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                                                   59</span>
 consideration is whether the bank guarantee had been invoked as

per its terms. Clause 2 of the bank guarantee which we have

reproduced above states that the industry had three obligations -

</p><p id="p_112">(a) to operate and instal the existing and the requisite pollution

control system and/or other pollution control measures effectively

within the stipulated time, and (b) this was to be to the satisfaction

of the Board in terms of its letter dated 12th June, 2009, and (c) the

industry was to meet the standards prescribed by the Board.


</p><p id="p_113">65. In case of failure to comply with the same during the

stipulated period of three years, the bank guarantee would be

forfeited by the Board, the Bank having undertaken to pay the same

when demanded by the Board within the period of the guarantee.

The invocation letter issued to the Bank on 26th May, 2012 clearly

stated that the industry had failed to comply with such conditions

within   the   stipulated   time   and   several   environmental   non-

compliances were observed during the tenure of the bank

guarantee. This invocation was founded on the satisfaction of the

Board. That satisfaction, of course, has to be fair and not

subjective, but objectively arrived at. The Board having considered

various pros and cons, prepared a cumulative assessment of the

breaches committed by the industry and keeping in view its General

Resolution, took the decision to invoke the bank guarantee rather

than closing the industry at that stage. Such invocation, therefore,

is proper, in terms of the bank guarantee and not malafide. The

bank guarantee is an independent contract to the contract or order

in furtherance to which it is furnished and can be invoked as per its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                                     60</span>
 terms. The purpose is to ensure payment stated in the bank

guarantee. There are only two exceptions to the general rule for

encashment of the bank guarantee as per its terms - (i) a fraud in

connection with such bank guarantee that would vitiate the very

foundation of such a bank guarantee and (ii) where a special equity

in favour of the applicant exists which will result in an irretrievable

harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned when encashment

of the bank guarantee can be withheld or can be said to be illegal or

unjustifiable. Reference in this regard can be made to the judgment

of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1028714/" id="a_148">Vinetec Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v. HCL

Infosystems Ltd</a>. [(2008) 1 SCC 544] and <a href="/doc/1342691/" id="a_149">BSES Limited v. Fenner

India Ltd</a>. [(2006) 2 SCC 728] amongst others. The invocation of the

bank guarantee, which act stands completed by payment made to

the Board by the Bank, does not fall in any of the exceptions that

have been carved out in the judgments afore-referred.


</p><p id="p_114">66. The present case, certainly, does not fall in either of the above

categories. In fact, it is not the case put forward by the applicant.

Thus, we have no hesitation in holding that the invocation of the

bank guarantee by the Board, in its satisfaction, is justifiable and is

in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_115">
</p><p id="p_116">67. At this stage we may also deal with the merit or otherwise of

the order dated 8th November, 2012 passed by the appellate

authority. Primarily, two reasons appear to have weighed with the

appellate authority while allowing appeal against the order of the

Board dated 26th May, 2012. Firstly, that the Board was satisfied


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                                                     61</span>
 with the pollution control measures undertaken by the industry

and had indicated so in the Inspection Report dated 1st March,

2012. Secondly, there was required to be a deliberate violation on

the part of the industry to invite the consequences of invocation of

bank guarantee in terms of the affidavit filed by the industry before

the Board.   Both these reasons cannot be sustained by us.        Of

course, the Inspection Report dated 1st March, 2012 had indicated

that the industry was working satisfactorily.     But the appellate

authority ignored two very important facts from its consideration.

One that there were more than eight inspections that had been

conducted by various technical teams of the Board and in most of

them not only breach of the terms and conditions of the consent

order was noticed but it was also clearly mentioned that there was

serious pollution caused by the industry particularly in relation of

the ambient air quality.   The other being that before passing the

order dated 26th May, 2012, the Board had taken into consideration

the cumulative effect of the various inspections and a co-joint

report dated 22nd May, 2012 which was the basis for passing of the

impugned order. Both these aspects do not find even a mention in

the order of the appellate authority. The other reason can also not

be accepted by us because the affidavit filed by the industry before

the Board is not the foundation of encashment of bank guarantee.

We have already noticed that as per law the bank guarantee is an

independent contract and the bank guarantee does not use the

expression 'deliberate'. This is the word used in the affidavit. The

bank guarantee was required to be invoked/encashed strictly as per


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                                                   62</span>
 its terms. Under the terms of the bank guarantee, the industry had

undertaken to operate the existing pollution control systems and/or

other pollution control measures effectively to the satisfaction of the

Board. In the case of failure to comply the bank guarantee could be

forfeited. Thus, the primary and paramount consideration was the

satisfaction of the Board in relation to the upkeep and continued

maintenance of the anti-pollution devices. Even as per the letter of

the Board dated 7th May, 2008, the industry was to comply with the

conditions of the letter as well as the other conditions which may be

imposed by the Board from time to time, in default of which, the

bank guarantee was to be invoked.         In terms of this letter, the

industry was required to take all steps for continuous and

satisfactory environmental compliance, which the industry on its

own showing had failed. To read mens rea or the term 'deliberate'

into the bank guarantee would not be permissible.         Mens rea, as

understood in the criminal jurisprudence, strictly speaking, would

hardly have any application to the environmental jurisprudence. It

is governed by principles such as Polluter Pays Principle and

doctrine of absolute liability. The word 'deliberate' used in the letter

dated 7th May, 2008 has to be given its due and normal meaning in

relation to the facts and circumstances of the case taken

cumulatively and not in abstract. Various letters of the industry

clearly show that for a long period of more than three years they

were not able to maintain the environmental standards and were

not able to install the required devices.     Even in January 2013,

inspection of the industry had been conducted by a team of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                                      63</span>
 technical experts who found that there were visible flue gas

emissions, fugitive dust emissions which were impermissible and

required an appropriate action to be taken against the industry.


</p><p id="p_117">     For these reasons, we are not in a position to concur with the

view taken by the appellate authority.
</p>
<p id="p_118">
</p><p id="p_119">68. Before entering into the realm of general discussion and the

directions that the Tribunal needs to pass in the facts of the present

case and in the larger administration of environmental justice, we

may answer the issues/questions formulated by us in paragraph 24

of this judgment. The answers are as follows: -
</p>
<p id="p_120">
a.   Resolution of the Board for imposing a condition upon the

industrial plants/units to furnish a bank guarantee as an

interregnum for compliance and/or in the nature of compensation

cannot be held to be without the authority of law or jurisdiction, in

so far as it is not penal or punitive.
</p>
<p id="p_121">
b.   In the facts and circumstances of the present case, invocation

of the bank guarantee by the Board for non-compliance of the

conditions stated in the consent order and in view of the

undertaking furnished by the industry cannot be held to be penal

and impermissible under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_150">Air Act</a>.


c.   The order of the Appellate Authority suffers from apparent

errors of facts and law.     The appellate authority has taken into

consideration irrelevant matters on the one hand and ignored other



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                                                    64</span>
 relevant matters on the other. The order of the appellate authority,

thus, is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_122">
d.   The bank had furnished an unequivocal guarantee for

payment of the stated amount. In case of failure to comply during

the specified period to the satisfaction of the Board, the bank

guarantee could be forfeited. The bank guarantee has been invoked

by the Board as per terms of the guarantee.       Consequently, the

Board would be entitled to receive the guarantee amount, however,

would be entitled to use the same only for the purposes of

compliance and/or for making good the environmental loss or

degradation caused by the applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_123">
e.   The applicants' appeal is partially allowed and directions have

been issued in the larger public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_124">GENERAL DISCUSSION:
</p>
<p id="p_125">69. Having answered the formulated questions and dealt with the

specific pleas raised by the respective parties before the Tribunal,

now we need to divert ourself to questions of some significance

which call for issue of appropriate directions. First is that from the

facts on record, it is clear that the Board does not have appropriate

policy of inspection of industrial units in place. Sometimes,

inspections are being conducted after two months while on other

occasions, inspections are not conducted for years together. The

other matter relates to grant/renewal of consent at intervals which

can hardly sustain the scrutiny of law.
</p>
<p id="p_126">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                                                    65</span>
</p><p id="p_127"> 70. We are not oblivious to the fact that it may not be quite

appropriate to put any restrictions on the authority of the Board to

inspect industrial units as none is contemplated under the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_151">Air Act</a> but still the Pollution Control Boards

should have a clear and transparent 'inspection policy'. It would

serve the purpose of prevention and control of industrial pollution

better and would also facilitate inspection programme of the

Boards. The Boards should spell out, when inspections, at regular

intervals in the normal course, should be conducted. Of course, this

would be in aid and not in derogation to the right of the Board to

conduct surprise or need-based inspections. In the normal course,

regular inspections should be carried out, preferably on annual or

bi-annual (twice a year) basis. This would help maintaining proper

data of inspections as well as ensuring desired implementation of

the conditions, if any, imposed in the consent orders.


</p><p id="p_128">71. <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_152">Section 21</a> of the Air Act places restrictions, both on

establishment and operation of any industrial plant located in an

air pollution control area without previous consent of the Board.

The legislative intent behind this provision would lead to decipher

two concepts - one, the consent for the purpose of establishing an

industrial plant while the other for operation of that plant. The

purpose of this Section is to ensure that when a unit or an

industrial plant is given consent to operate, the unit ought to have

satisfied all the conditions stated in the order of consent to

establish and would have installed the requisite effluent treatment

plants and other anti-pollution devices to ensure that it causes no

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                                                  66</span>
 pollution. It necessarily implies that this is the rule and permitting

a unit to operate, subject to satisfaction of certain time bound

conditions, is an exception, that too a rare one. To adopt exception

as a rule is not the intent of this law. We are unable to appreciate

the practice adopted by the Boards for granting consents for short

terms like on an yearly or six-monthly basis and that too subject to

varied conditions. Consent to operate should be granted preferably

for a longer period and continuation should require maintenance

and operation of the plant ensuring 'no pollution'. It must not be

used as a device to hamper industrial development and cause

avoidable loss to the industry. The purpose should be prevention

and control of pollution. For better management of its affairs and

for ensuring prevention and control of pollution, the Board should

adopt the practice of granting consents for a substantial and

reasonable period while ensuring that the anti-pollution devices and

the Effluent Treatment Plants have been installed and the unit is

'compliant' and 'non-polluting' one. The scheme behind <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_153">Sections 21</a>

to <a href="/doc/1004117/" id="a_154">26</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_155">31A</a> of the Air Act is that the Board is empowered to

grant, refuse, renew and even cancel the consent. Wherever an

industry to whom the consent has been granted conditionally, fails

to satisfy or comply with the conditions imposed, the Board can

withdraw the said consent in accordance with law. Thus, there is no

purpose in law to grant consent for six months or three months, as

has been done in the present case. This certainly appears to us to

be an arbitrary exercise of powers. Greater obligation is placed upon

the Board, particularly in view of the Constitutional mandate to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                                                    67</span>
 prevent and control pollution and to ensure that a clean and decent

environment is provided to the public at large. This is the statutory

obligation upon the Board. The Board must formulate its policies in

a manner which will be in consonance with the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_156">Air

Act</a> and the Constitutional mandate and would better serve the

public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_129">
</p><p id="p_130">72. Thus, we direct that the Boards henceforth shall clearly

formulate their inspection policy, which should be fair, transparent

and objective. Further, we direct that all the Boards henceforth

shall grant consent to operate only to those units which have

satisfied the conditions imposed and have installed ETP/Anti-

pollution devices as directed under the order of consent to

establish. Such units should also be compliant and non-polluting.

The consent should be granted preferably for a period of two years

or even more. During the period thus allowed, the Board should

make inspections in terms of its 'inspection policy'.          If the

unit/industry is found to be defaulting, has failed to comply with

the conditions of the consent order or failed to install ETPs/Anti-

pollution devices and there is malfunctioning of the unit, the

consent should be revoked or renewal denied in accordance with

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_157">Air Act</a>. Such mechanism should be a rule

and its exception is to be in rare cases.
</p>
<p id="p_131">
</p><p id="p_132">73. Wherever the Board requires a unit to furnish bank guarantee

for compliance of conditions of consent order, installation of anti-

pollution devices and ensuring that it is a pollution-free unit, then,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                                                    68</span>
 in such cases, the Board should ensure that its order provides for a

'time targeted action plan'. In default of which and upon inspection,

such bank guarantee would be liable to be invoked/encashed for

environmental compensation and restoration purposes. Making

such provision would ensure, on the one hand, that the industry

does not cause avoidable pollution and on the other, the Board

performs its functions timely and effectively.
</p>
<p id="p_133">
</p><p id="p_134">74. In view of our detailed discussion supra, we partially allow

these appeals and set aside the order of the appellate authority

under appeal. We hold that the condition requiring the respondents

to furnish the bank guarantee is not penal and encashment thereof

is neither unjustified nor covered under any of the exceptions

stated in the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Vinetec

Electronics Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_135">
</p><p id="p_136">75. However, we further direct that the amounts received by the

Board against encashment of bank guarantee shall, in preference to

all other, be utilised for the compensatory purposes or restoration

of the degraded environment resulting from emission and discharge

of effluents and other pollutants in violation of the prescribed

standards by the industry. Remnant, if any, may be utilised for

installation of such effluent treatment plants/anti-pollution devices,

directed to be installed under the order of consent or otherwise in

the unit of the industry as it would help in bringing down the

emission/pollution levels and bringing it in line with the prescribed

parameters, thus protecting the environment. The Board shall have

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                                                    69</span>
 no authority or power to forfeit this amount and use it for any

other, including for its own, purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_137">
</p><p id="p_138">76. The appeal is, thus, partially allowed with the above

directions, however, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
