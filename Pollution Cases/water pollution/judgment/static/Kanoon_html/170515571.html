against him by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Ludhiana vide judgment

and decree dated 10.02.2012 as well as learned Additional District Judge,

Ludhiana vide judgment and decree dated 29.10.2014 and consequential

dismissal of its suit. Suit for recovery of `15,00,000/- filed by the plaintiff was

dismissed by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Ludhiana vide judgment

and decree dated 10.02.2012. Appeal filed by the plaintiff was also dismissed.

and 3 agreed to provide installation of an effluent treatment plant in the plaintiff

college and hospital on the terms and conditions as agreed upon between the

parties on 19.12.2000 (Ex.P7). It was agreed that work at the site would

commence within three days of placement of the order. Total period for

construction and for commissioning would be a maximum of eight weeks from

the date of placement of order. All finishing and site clearance would be

completed within 30 days of the period of commissioning. Any clarifications

required must be obtained before commencement of work at site/a week prior to

the need for such information. It was further agreed that the delays in

commissioning would be liable to enforcement of penalty at the rate of `10,000/-

for the first day of delay with further penalty at the rate of `5,000/- per additional

delay, subject to maximum of `1,00,000/-. After negotiation, the schedule of

payment was agreed upon as under:-

</p><p id="p_4">             The plaintiff pleaded that the defendant failed to complete the project

within the stipulated period and obtained payment of `10,34,750/- on fraudulent

misrepresentation with a mala fide intention to cause wrongful damage to the

plaintiff. The project remained incomplete till February, 2003. Number of

components of the Effluent treatment plant supplied to the plaintiff were of

unfinished and substandard quality. Number of defects were found in the civil

work and component of the plant. The plaintiff faced the risk of criminal action

under the provision of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>, 1974 and Bio- Medical Waste Rule 1998 as the

plant failed to meet the requirement specified by the Punjab Pollution Control

Board. Despite letters and reminders, the defendants failed to complete their part

of the contract in terms of agreement and specifically affidavit dated 22.12.2000

(Ex. P9) by defendants No. 2 and 3 (Ex.P9). The plaintiff was thus entitled to

recover the amount of `10,34,750/- alongwith interest and damages.

</p><p id="p_5">             Suit was resisted by the defendants. Written statement was filed

taking various preliminary objections. Averments on merits were controverted. A

counter claim was filed by the defendants seeking recovery of `6.80 lakhs

alongwith `2,45,160/- as interest. It was pleaded that the work was executed as

per the specifications. It was stated that the plaintiff was satisfied with the work

of the defendant and letter dated 03.10.2001             was written to the Director,

International      Testing Centre and letter dated 20.07.2002 to Environmental

Engineer to monitor all relevant parameters of the Effluent treatment plant. Bills

were raised for the total amount, however, only part payment was made.

written statement to the said counter claim of the defendants was also filed by the

plaintiff.

<p id="p_15">
            Evidence was led by both the parties to substantiate their respective

stands. Learned trial court on considering the facts and circumstances of the case

concluded that the plaintiff failed to prove that the Effluent treatment plant was

not successfully installed. Removal of discrepancies and short comings in the

project by itself would not entitle the plaintiff to recover this amount. Counter

claim filed by the defendants was also dismissed. Appeal filed by the plaintiff

was also dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Ludhiana vide

judgment dated 29.10.2014. Aggrieved therefrom, present appeal has been filed.

No appeal, it is submitted, has been filed by the defendants challenging the

dismissal of their counter-claim.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                   Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argues that

respondents No. 2 and 3 executed a specific affidavit dated 22.12.2000 (Ex.P9)

according to which the respondents are liable to refund the entire money

deposited with them once they failed to execute the project in its entirety or if

they abandoned the project. It is a specifically mentioned in Clause 7 of the

affidavit dated 22.12.2000 that in the event of non-completion of the project, they

would have no further claim whatsoever from the hospital for the material already

supplied by them or the work done by them. It is contended that procurement of

the reports from the Punjab Pollution Control Board were an integral part of the

terms and conditions of the agreement. Once the Punjab Pollution Control Board

found that necessary parameters were not met with, it is apparent that the Effluent

treatment plant was not installed as per the terms and conditions as specifically

mentioned in document (Ex.P5) i.e. the quotations submitted by the defendant

firm. Learned counsel refers to communication dated 05.02.2003 (Ex.P23) as

well as report of the Board (Ex.P24). It is, thus, prayed that this appeal be

allowed, impugned judgments and decrees dated 10.02.2012 and 29.10.2014

passed by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Ludhiana and the learned

Additional District Judge, Ludhiana, respectively, be set aside and suit filed by

the appellant be decreed throughout.

<p id="p_17">             I have heard learned counsel for the appellant and have perused the

file as well as photocopy of the record.
</p>
<p id="p_18">             The appellant filed the present suit seeking recovery of the amount in

question while pleading that the defendants/respondents had failed to

successfully install the affluent treatment plant, therefore, payment received by

the defendants/respondents should be recovered. There is no dispute that an

agreement was arrived at between the plaintiff and the defendants for installation

of the effluent treatment plant.       Payment of `10,34,750/- received by the

defendants is also not in dispute. Perusal of the record reveals that on installation

of the plant, various deficiencies and shortcomings were pointed out by the

plaintiff as are duly noted by the learned trial court. It is rightly held by both the

learned courts below that merely on the basis of discrepancies and shortcomings

in the effluent treatment plant, the defendants cannot be made liable to return the

amount of `10,34,750/-. As per affidavit dated 22.12.2000 (Ex.P9), which was

referred to by the learned learned counsel for the appellant, it is mentioned that in

case the defendants failed to execute the project in its entirety or abandoned the

project, the hospital will be refunded of the advance with the prevalent rate of

interest in the market. It is further stated that in the event of non-completion of

the project by the defendants, they would have no claim whatsoever from the

hospital for the material already supplied by the defendants to the hospital or the

work done by them for the hospital. A perusal of Ex.P7 i.e., the terms and

conditions of the agreement reveals that the schedule of payment has been

mentioned. The schedule of payment as mentioned in the said document was

admittedly arrived at after negotiation and the fresh schedule of payment was

drawn up which is so mentioned (handwritten) and available on Ex.P7. Learned

counsel for the appellant is unable to deny that Ex.P7 indeed refers to the

schedule of the payment to be given by the appellant to the defendants. Ex.P7

read in conjunction with Ex.P9 cannot be taken to mean that until and unless the

requirements specified by the Punjab Pollution Control Board were not met, it

would mean that the effluent treatment plant has not been successfully installed

or that the project had been abandoned by the defendants, thereby entitling the

appellant to recovery of the amount given to the defendants.           Furthermore,

payment of `10,34,750/- on 05.07.2001 after the issuance of letter (Ex.P12)

wherein certain deficiencies in the effluent treatment plant were highlighted,

reflects that the deficiencies, if any, must necessarily have been removed.

case has specifically mentioned that the terms and conditions were signed by Dr.

John Pramod on behalf of the plaintiff. It is not denied that Dr. John Pramod was

the Deputy Medical Superintendent with the appellant at the relevant time and he

was still in the employment of the appellant during the pendency of the suit.

Therefore, an adverse inference for not having examined Dr. John Pramod has

been rightly drawn by the learned trial court. The defendants sought to rely upon

the communications dated 03.10.2001 and 20.07.2002 (Mark 'A' and 'B')

purportedly sent by Dr. John Pramod on behalf of the appellant to the Director,

International Testing Center, 86A, Industrial Area, Panchkula and the

Environment Engineer, Punjab Pollution Control Board, Ludhiana in respect to

installation of the effluent treatment plant as per the instructions of the Punjab

Pollution Control Board.       It is relevant to note at this stage that PW3

K.T.Verghese has not specifically denied the sending of these communications by

Dr. John Pramod. He simply stated that he is not aware of the said letters, though

it is admitted that the same have been issued on the letter head of the Christian

Medical College, Ludhiana.
</p>
<p id="p_20">            It has been rightly observed by the learned trial court that the

plaintiff has not been able to prove that the effluent treatment plant was not

successfully installed. Both the learned courts below have rendered concurrent

findings of fact against the appellant on a wholesome and proper appreciation of

evidence on record which warrants no interference. In my considered opinion, no

question of law much less a substantial question of law is involved in this appeal.
