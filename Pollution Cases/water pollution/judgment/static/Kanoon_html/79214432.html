<p id="p_3">       Learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that, the applicant
 is innocent and he has falsely been implicated in the matter. The applicant
 has been implicated in the present crime on the basis of the memorandum
 under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_12">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act of the co-accused Prakash. It is also
 submitted that there is no evidence available on record to connect the
 applicant with the present crime. Investigation is over, charge-sheet has been
 filed and conclusion of the trial is likely to take long time.        In such
 circumstances, he prays that the applicant be released on bail.
