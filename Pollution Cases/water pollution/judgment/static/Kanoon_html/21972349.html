<p id="p_1">      The   petitioner   is   challenging   the   order   dated
26.10.2016, passed by the Uttarakhand Environment
Protection and Pollution Control Board, which has been
admittedly passed under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and
<a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    Learned counsel for respondent no. 2 submits that
this order is appealable before the National Green
Tribunal under <a href="/doc/105507060/" id="a_5">Section 16(c)</a> of the National Green
Tribunal Act as well as <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_6">Section 33-B</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. The aforesaid
provisions read as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "Section 16. Tribunal to have appellate
     jurisdiction.- Any person aggrieved by, -

     May file an appeal to the National Green Tribunal
     established under <a href="/doc/50331181/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> of the National Green
     Tribunal Act, 2010, in accordance with the
     provisions of that Act.)"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">3.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the petitioner
relies upon <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_15">Section 21(4)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     "<a href="/doc/142674224/" id="a_17">Section 21</a>. Restrictions on use of certain
     industrial plants.-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     (2......................
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     (3)....................
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     (4) Within a period of four months after the receipt
     of the application for consent referred to in sub-
     section (1), the State Board shall, by order in
     writing (and for reasons to be recorded in the
     order, grant the consent applied for subject to
     such conditions and for such period as may be
     specified in the order, or refuse such consent):
     Provided further that before cancelling a consent
     or refusing a further consent under the first
     proviso, a reasonable opportunity of being heard
     shall be given to the person concerned.)"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">4.        Petitioner would hence argue that the impugned
order has been passed without opportunity of hearing to
the petitioner. On this, however, the reply of the learned
counsel for respondent no. 2 would be that the said
provision will not come into operation, inasmuch as, it is
an admitted case that on the date when the impugned
order    was   passed,   there       was   no     consent    of   the
Uttarakhand      Environment         Protection    and      Pollution
Control Board in favour of the petitioner. Hence, this is not
a case of cancellation of the consent. Further the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>



impugned order clearly shows that the inspection of the
petitioner's unit was made on 08.09.2016 in presence of
the officials of the petitioner's company, wherein it was
found as under:
</p><p id="p_5">      "Unit is in operation without obtaining Air-Water
consent of the Board since 2007. During inspection, the
representative of the Unit did not show any document
related to establishment and consent obtained from the
other departments.
</p><p id="p_6">      Unit has established Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)
but during inspection, the ETP not found in operation.
</p><p id="p_7">      Unit    comes    under     orange   category.    The
representative of Unit did not submit copy of Environment
Clearance.
</p><p id="p_8">      Unit has not made proper arrangement for
management and handling of hazardous wastes."
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.         Considering the fact that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy to approach before the National Green
Tribunal, the writ petition stands dismissed on the ground
of alternative remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.          Let a certified copy of this order be issued
within a period of twenty-four hours on payment of usual
charges.
</p>
