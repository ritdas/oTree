<p id="p_1">     Heard. Case diary perused.
</p><p id="p_2">       This is the first application under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_2">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C, for grant of
 anticipatory bail. Applicants are apprehending their arrest connection with
 Crime No.1114/2018, registered at Police Station- Banganga, District- Indore
 for commission of the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/209076/" id="a_3">Sections 268</a>, <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_4">269</a>, <a href="/doc/1374604/" id="a_5">277</a>, <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_6">278</a>,

</p><p id="p_3">       Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the         applicants are
innocent, they have not committed any offence and have been falsely
implicated in the present crime. There is no legal evidence to connect the
present applicants with the crime. He further submits that the applicants are not
having any previous criminal antecedents. Conclusion of the trial is likely to
take sufficiently long time. He further submits that the applicants are ready to
abide by all the terms and conditions, which may be imposed by this Court.
Under these circumstances, he prays for anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_4">      Learned Public Prosecutor for the State opposed the prayer and prayed
for rejection of anticipatory bail application.
</p><p id="p_5">       Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the arguments
 advanced by learned counsel for the applicants, but without commenting on
 the merits of the case, I deem it proper to grant anticipatory bail to the
 applicants. Accordingly, the application filed by the applicants is allowed. It is
 directed that in the event of arrest, the applicants be released on bail, on their
        executing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees Fifty
       Thousand only) each and furnishing one solvent surety in the like amount to
       the satisfaction of Arresting Authority/Trial Court.
</p><p id="p_6">             The applicants shall further abide by the other conditions enumerated in
       sub-section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_7">             Certified copy, as per rules.
