<p id="p_1">      In this writ petition, the prayers sought are to direct the 1st

respondent to extend all benefits consequent to the annulling of

Ext.P6 order by appropriate modification to Ext.P15 order and also

to direct that the petitioner be allowed to continue as Member

and Chairman of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. A

declaration that Ext.P12 order of the 1st respondent is void ab-

initio is also sought for.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.     By Ext.P1 order dated 16/4/2005, the 1st respondent

appointed the petitioner as Member Secretary of the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to as 'Board' for

short). While the petitioner was continuing as Secretary, in

relation to the trial run conducted in the industrial unit of

M/s.Canon Granites Private Limited, Vigilance and Anti Corruption

Bureau had registered VC No.7/05 against         Sri.A.K.Surendran,

Environmental Engineer of the Board.          That trial run was

conducted pursuant to the judgment of this court in WP(C) No.

19759/05      filed  by   M/S.Canon    Granites   Private   Limited,

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   :2 :</span>



Subsequently, WP(C) No. 19757/05 was filed by the additional 3rd

respondent alleging foul play by the VACB and pursuant to the

orders passed by this Court, the investigation of the vigilance

case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation The

CBI completed investigation and filed its final report. Based on the

findings in the investigation report of the CBI, Ext.P3 memo of

charges dated 31/10/2008 alleging violation of Rule 3 of the

Kerala Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules,

1960 (hereinafter referred to as "the Rules" for short) and

statement of allegations were issued to the petitioner. On receipt

of the memo of charges and statement of allegations, petitioner

filed Ext.P4 explanation. The Government adopted the summary

procedure contemplated under Rule 16 read with Rule 11 of the

Rules and concluded the disciplinary proceedings by Ext.P6 order

dated 24/3/10 and a minor penalty of censure was awarded. This

order gives the background of the disciplinary action and

therefore, the relevant portion of the order, is extracted below for

reference:-
</p>
<p id="p_3">                The brief history of the case for which charges
          were levelled against him is as follows:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    :3 :</span>



                Based on the complaint of Shri Simon K.Francis,
         Director, M/s.Canon Granites Pvt. Ltd., that Shri
         A.K.Surendran, Environmental Engineer, Kerala State
         Pollution Control Board, Trichur was demanding bribe of
         Rs.15 lakhs from him for not showing him official dis-
         favour in the matter of conducting trial run in the
         premises of M/s.Canon Granites Pvt. Ltd. And for giving
         favourable report, a case in VC 7/2005 was registered
         by Dy.SP, Vigilance &amp; Anti Corruption Bureau, Trichur
         and a trap was laid on 28/5/2005 at about 7 pm in
         which one Shri P.Rajendran working in Sreebhavan
         Hotel, Ollur, received a packet containing Rs.2 lakhs
         from the complainant as per the directions of Shri
         A.K.Surendran     communicated      through  one    Shri
         K.N.Gopalakrishnan of Sreebhavan Hotel.

</p><p id="p_5">                Upon coming to know of the said trap, Shri
         A.K.Surendran and other officials of Kerala State
         Pollution Control Board, Trichur, namely Smt.Sindhu
         Radhakrishnan,    Assistant    Environmental  Engineer,
         Smt.Suseela Nair, Assistant Engineer, Smt.K.S.Vinaya,
         Assistant    Engineer  and     Smt.Bindu  Vinod,  Junior
         Scientific Assistant on daily wages, agreed among
         themselves to create false defence documents to show
         as if an adverse report had already been sent against
         M/s.Canon Granites Pvt. Ltd. Before the passing of the
         bribe money and thereby that there was no motive for
         the bribe amount being taken on behalf of Shri
         Surendran and, in pursuance of the said agreement, the
         said   officials namely    Smt.Sindhu    Radhakrishnan,
         Smt.Suseela Nair, Smt.K.S.Vinaya and Smt.Bindu Vinod
         unauthorisedly came to the District office of Kerala
         State Pollution Control Board, Trichur on 29/5/2005
         (Sunday) and Smt.Sindhu Radhakrishnan, Smt.Suseela
         Nair, Smt.K.S.Vinaya created a letter falsely dated
         28.5.2005 addressed to Standing counsel of Kerala
         State Pollution Control Board in the Honourable High
         Court of Kerala, Ernakulam, with a copy marked to the
         Member Secretary, Kerala State Pollution Control Board,
         Thiruvananthapuram conveying that the result of the
         conduct of the trial run at M/s Canon Granites (P) Ltd
         was adverse and Smt.Bindu Vinod falsely showed the
         dispatch of the said letter on 28/5/2005 in the dispatch
         register.

                The investigation of the said case was taken over
         by the Central Bureau of Investigation in compliance to
         the direction issued by the Honourable High Court of
         Kerala. During the CBI investigation, Shri Jeyaprasad
         has produced before the Investigating Officer, a photo
         copy of the said letter in which he has falsely and with
         the intention to support the false claim of Shri
         A.K.Surendran     and   others   the    said  letter  was
         dispatched on 28.5.2005, put his initial and date as
         28/5 with the intention of showing that the said letter
         was received by him before the passing of the bribe
         money and thereby to make it appear that there was no
         motive for the bribe being received on behalf of Shri
         A.K.Surendran     and   falsely   claimed    before   the
         Investigating officer that the said letter was received by
         him from Sri.A.K.Surendran on 28/5/2005, while passing
         through Trichur whereas the letter was made only on
         29.5.2005 dispatched thereafter and reached the office
         of the Member Secretary, Kerala State Pollution Control
         Board only on 3/6/2005.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                Shri SD Jeyaprasad in his written statement of
         defence read as 2nd paper above has denied the above
         charges and has requested to drop all further
         disciplinary proceedings initiated against him.

</p><p id="p_8">                Government have examined the statement of
         defence    furnished    by   Shri   S.D.Jayaprasad    with
         reference to connected records and found that the
         same is not satisfactory. Government also found that he
         had violated Rule 3 of Kerala Government Servants
         Conduct Rules, 1960, and hence he is found guilty of
         the charges levelled against him.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                In the above circumstances Government order
         that the punishment of 'Censure' be imposed on
         Sri.S.D.Jayaprasad, Chairman, Kerala State Pollution
         Control Board under Rule II of Kerala Civil Services
         (Classification, Control &amp; Appeal) Rules, 1960 for his
         above lapses, while holding the post of Member
         Secretary of Kerala State Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_10">                The disciplinary proceedings initiated as per the
         Memo of charges read as 1st paper above is disposed of
         as above."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 :5 :</span>
</p><p id="p_12">      3.   In the meantime, despite the pendency of the

disciplinary action against him, by Ext.P4(a) dated 31/8/2009, the

1st respondent appointed the petitioner as Chairman of the Board

for a period of one year. While he was continuing as Chairman,

Government issued Ext.P5 notification reconstituting the Board

with the petitioner as the Chairman.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      4.   Subsequent to the issuance of Ext.P6 order of censure,

Government issued Ext.P7 notice dated 27/3/2010 calling upon

the petitioner to show cause against the proposal to issue orders

amending the term of his appointment and to restrict it to

31/3/2010, so as to make it co-terminus with his date of normal

retirement from the Board's service. Petitioner challenged Ext.P7

before this Court in WP(C) No. 11235/10. In that writ petition, this

Court stayed the order, but gave liberty to the Government to

take appropriate action in the matter. Against that direction,

petitioner filed WA 905/10, which was disposed of by Ext.P8

judgment vacating the freedom given to the Government, and

directing expeditious disposal of the writ petition itself.

</p><p id="p_14">      5.   While the matter was thus pending, petitioner filed

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    :6 :</span>



Ext.P9 review petition under Rule 35 of the Rules seeking review

of Ext.P6 order awarding penalty of censure.                 While so, the

Government issued Ext.P10 order dated 14/6/2010 by which

Ext.P7 show cause notice was withdrawn and referring to the

findings in Ext.P6 order imposing censure, petitioner was called

upon to show cause why he shall not be removed from service.

The relevant portion of Ext.P10 notice reads thus;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "Government is of the opinion that in view of the
          punishment awarded to you vide G.O cited 2nd above
          and considering that you have been proven guilty of a
          misconduct, which is nothing short of moral turpitude
          your continuance as a member and Chairman of the
          Kerala State Pollution Control Board is not in public
          interest.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 Government proposes to remove you as member
          and Chairman of Kerala State Pollution Control Board as
          per Rule 5(3) of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of
          Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. You are directed to show cause if
          any against the proposed decision of Government
          within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice. If
          your reply is not received within the time limit it will be
          presumed that you have no reply to furnish and further
          action will be taken accordingly."</blockquote><p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">      6.   Producing Exts.P6 and P10 as Exts.P19 and P24 and

seeking to set aside both, petitioner filed WP(C) No. 20211/10

before this Court. The aforesaid two cases and the connected writ

petitions and appeals were heard by a Division Bench of this

Court.  These cases were disposed of by Ext.P10(a) judgment

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    :7 :</span>



rendered on 9th of November 2010. That judgment narrates the

entire history of the case and the relevant portion of the

judgment, contained in paragraphs 9 to 22, are extracted for

reference.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     9. W.P.(C) No.20211 of 2010 is filed with the prayer as follows:

</p><p id="p_18">                    "i.  issue a writ of certiorari or any other
       appropriate writ, order or direction quashing Exts.P19 and
       P24 orders;"
</p>
<p id="p_19">       Exts.P19 and P24 which are impugned in the said writ
       petition   are   proceedings     dated    24.03.2010     and
       14.06.2010 respectively. Earlier of the two proceedings
       is a Government Order, GO(Rt) No.22/10/Envt. by which
       the Government decided to award the punishment of
       censure to Jayaparasad for the misconduct alleged in the
       memo of charges dated 31.10.2008 referred to earlier. It
       is already noticed that such a punishment was awarded
       following a summary procedure contemplated under Rule
       16 of the Kerala Civil Services (Classification, Control and
       Appeal) Rules, 1960 without a regular departmental
       enquiry. The second of the abovementioned proceedings
       is a show cause notice consequent upon the imposition
       of    punishment mentioned earlier.           By the said
       proceedings, the Government called upon Jeyaprasad to
       show cause as to why he should not be removed from the
       office of the Chairman of the Kerala State Pollution
       Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_20">              10.   Coming to W.P.(C) No.11235 of 2010, the
       prayers are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_21">              "i.   issue a writ of certiorari or any other
       appropriate   writ,  order   or   direction  quashing    the
       operation and all further proceedings in pursuance to
       Ext.P6;
</p><p id="p_22">              ii.  issue a writ of mandamus or any other
       appropriate writ, order or direction commanding the
       respondents to permit the petitioner to continue to hold

       the office of the Chairman of the Kerala State Pollution
       Control Board, until his term of office, as contemplated
       under <a href="/doc/18708930/" id="a_2">Section 5(1)</a> of Act 6 of 1974 and <a href="/doc/171377607/" id="a_3">Section 7(1)</a>of Act
       14 of 1981 expires and the successor enters in office;"

       The impugned proceedings, Ext.P6 dated 27.03.2010, is
       already extracted earlier in this judgment. The substance
       of the said proceedings is that it is a notice calling upon
       Jeyaprasad to explain why his tenure as the Chairman of
       the Kerala State Pollution Control Board should not be
       confined to 31st March, 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_23">              11.   The main submission made in the said writ
       petition is   regarding the competence of the State to
       reduce the tenure of the office as proposed in the show
       cause notice dated 27.03.2010. The submission is that
       under <a href="/doc/1139216/" id="a_4">Section 7(1)</a> of the Air(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of
       Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 a member of the Board constituted
       under the said Act shall hold the office for a term of 3
       years from the date on which his nomination is notified in
       the Official Gazette, therefore the tenure statutorily fixed
       cannot be curtailed by the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_24">              12. Jeyaprasad was appointed as the Chairman of
       the Kerala State Pollution Control Board in exercise of the
       powers conferred on the Government of Kerala both

       <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 prescribed certain
       disqualifications.  Both the Sections stipulate that no
       person    who    suffers   any    one  of   the    specified
       disqualifications under either of the abovementioned
       Sections shall be a member of the State Pollution Control
       Board. Conviction for an offence which in the opinion of
       the Government involves moral turpitude is one of the
       disqualifications prescribed under both the enactments.

       dated 31.10.2008, if proved against Jeyaprasad, would
       render Jeyaprasad guilty of an offence (fabricating false
       evidence) under <a href="/doc/1905297/" id="a_14">Section 192</a> of the Indian Penal Code at
       the least and may also establish the commission of other

       offences like abetment etc. We make it clear that we are
       not recording any conclusive finding that Jeyaprasad is
       guilty of any such offence but only indicate that
       allegations made against him, if proved, are likely to
       result in such a consequence. In spite of the gravity of the
       allegations the State of Kerala never thought it fit to
       register a crime against Jeyaprasad much less investigate
       the same.
</p>
<p id="p_26">              14. The necessity to maintain the purity of the
       administration (in our opinion) squarely demands a
       proper investigation in accordance with law into such
       allegations and more particularly when the allegations
       are made by the State itself in a departmental
       proceedings. The primary responsibility of the State is to
       maintain law and order and also the constitutional
       obligation to provide a rational and clean governament
       oblige the State to investigate allegations of commission
       of crime whenever they come to the notice of the State.
       The State cannot act arbitrarily by selectively applying
       the law. That would be negation of the Rule of law. The
       background     in which the allegations of fabrication of
       false evidence is made against Jeyaprasad is already
       noticed.   The two cases against Surendran under the
       <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_15">Prevention    of  Corruption   Act</a>   are   already    being
       investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment
       [popularly known as Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI)]
       pursuant to an order of this Court dated 24.02.2006 in
       W.P.(C) No.19757 of 2005.      In the context of the said
       case, the allegations against Jeyaprasad, in our opinion,
       may also give rise to a charge of abetment. The State
       does not come forward with any explanation as to why
       such allegations are never subjected to any investigation
       in accordance with law. On the other hand, the State of
       Kerala which had initiated a departmental proceeding
       against Jeyaprasad by issuing the charge memo dated
       31.10.2008 strangely thought it fit to appoint him to be
       the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board by the order
       dated 31.08.2009 (some ten months after the initiation of
       the disciplinary proceedings), without concluding the
       same.     <a href="/doc/1001185/" id="a_16">Sections 8</a> and <a href="/doc/1556142/" id="a_17">6</a> of the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Pollution
       Control Act</a>s positively disqualify persons found guilty of
       offences involving moral turpitude.     The State cannot
       ignore the existence of such allegations which if proved
       would result in the conviction of a person for offences

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    :10 :</span>



       involving moral turpitude, while choosing people to hold a
       responsible public office. We are therefore of the opinion
       that this is a fit case where the State should be directed
       to register a criminal case in accordance with law on the
       basis of the allegations made in the memo of charges
       dated 31.10.2008 framed against Jeyaprasad. We direct
       accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_27">              15.   It is surprising to notice that while making
       appointments even to Class IV posts under the State the
       antecedents of the candidate are invariably verified, but
       in the instant case the State chose to ignore serious
       allegations existing on record in deciding the desirability
       of Jeyaprasad to a statutory high office. The statutory
       authority conferred on the State to appoint members of
       the Pollution Control Board necessarily implies an
       obligation on the part of the State to exercise that
       authority in good faith and the larger public interest.
       When the law prescribes definite disqualifications which
       render people suffering from such disqualifications unfit
       to hold public offices, the State cannot ignore the
       allegations which indicate the doubtful suitability of the
       person who is being considered for filling up a public
       office. Such conduct of the State would not be consistent
       with its constitutional obligations.    It is that failure on
       the part of the State which gives rise to the present
       exorbitant claims of Jeyaprasad.          Our Constitution
       designed with the high ideal of protecting the citizens
       from unfair and arbitrary exercise of State power can also
       be taken advantage of by citizens of doubtful credentials;
       when the various organs of the State wittingly or
       otherwise collaborate.
</p>
<p id="p_28">              16. The learned counsel appearing for Jeyaprasad
       very strenuously argued that though the          CBI filed a
       charge sheet against Surendran, it did not choose to
       make any indictment against Jeyaprasad and therefore
       the mere allegation in the charge memo may not be used
       as a factor for declining the exercise of jurisdiction under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_29">              17.     We regret our inability to accept the
       submission. The fact that the CBI did not choose to make
       any indictment against Jeyaprasad in the final report is for
       an obvious reason that the case which was investigated

WPC.No.20863/12

       by the CBI was a case of definite allegations of violations
       of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_20">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> against
       Surendran. Such an investigation was taken up by the
       CBI pursuant to an order of this Court. There was never
       any occasion or authorization for the CBI to examine the
       conduct of Jeyaprasad.
</p>
<p id="p_30">              18. The order of this Court entrusting investigation
       of the case by the CBI against Surendran came to be
       passed in W.P.(C) No.19757 of 2005 and same remained
       unchallenged by the State.        The circumstances under
       which such an order came to be passed are explained in
       the common judgment dated 09.10.2009 in W.P.(C)
       Nos.36185/07 and 36205/07 which are the subject matter
       of the appeals, viz. WA Nos.211/10 and 181/10 and the
       same read as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_31">       "Suspecting foul play by the VACB, the petitioner filed
       W.P.(C) No.19757/2005, seeking a C.B.I investigation,
       which was ordered by a Single Judge of this Court by
       judgment dated 15.7.2005, which was set aside by a
       Division Bench, on the ground that the 4th respondent was
       not heard before passing that order, directing the Single
       Judge to hear the matter afresh. The writ petition again
       came up before another learned Single Judge, who by
       judgment    dated   24.2.2006,     after  hearing   the   4th
       respondent also, directed the C.B.I. to take over the
       investigation, accepting the contention of the petitioner
       that the investigation by the VACB is not proceeding in
       the right direction, after referring also to the fate of the
       earlier case against the 4th respondent at the hands of the
       VACB.    Pursuant to the same, the C.B.I. has charge
       sheeted the 4th respondent, which case is also pending."

</p><p id="p_32">              19.  The second submission made on behalf of
       Jeyaprasad that a mere allegation of wrong doing cannot
       disentitle him to seek the constitutional remedy under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a> requires an examination.        In the normal
       circumstances the submission would be unexceptionable.
       But the consistent reluctance of the State in dealing with
       Jeyaprasad and Surendran in accordance with law, and in
       fact that at every stage this Court had to intervene to
       compel the State to act in accordance with law are
       factors which distinguish Jeyaprasad for a separate
       treatment.    Apart from that the manner in which

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    :12 :</span>



       Jeyaprasad dealt with Surendran in spite of the serious
       allegations against him is also a strong factor that should
       weigh with the Court in deciding whether the discretion
       should be exercised in his favour.         We desist from
       explaining those factors for the reason that any
       observation in that regard is likely to have an adverse
       effect on the investigation of the crime to be registered
       against Jeyaprasad.      Exercising the discretion under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> in a case with such factual background in our
       view is likely to promote a misconception that the judicial
       branch of the Constitution is not different from the other
       branches. No misconception could do more lasting injury
       to this Court and to the system of law. It is immaterial
       whether justice is done or not to Jeyaprasad.

</p><p id="p_33">              20. In the background of the facts narrated above
       the question arises whether this Court should really
       exercise the extraordinary jurisdiction vested in it by the
       Constitution under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a> to issue writs or orders in
       the nature of mandamus or certiorari. It is well settled
       that both the writs are discretionary in nature but not
       writs of right. The extraordinary jurisdiction is created for
       the protection of the fundamental rights of the subjects
       and to prevent the abuse of the State's power.          The
       jurisdiction is to be exercised either for the enforcement
       of a legal right of the subject or the enforcement of the
       legal obligations of the State. Courts have recognised a
       number of exceptional circumstances which justify the
       refusal to exercise the jurisdiction even in those cases
       where there is a clearly established legal right or
       obligation.
</p>
<p id="p_34">              21.   We are of the opinion that exercising the
       jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> in favour of a person whose
       credentials to hold a public office are highly doubtful and
       who would be disqualified to hold the public office in
       question     if the allegations made against him are
       investigated and proved before a competent criminal
       court, would be not a sound exercise of the discretion
       vested in this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
       of India.

       No.20211 of 2010 is dismissed. For the same reasons,

<p id="p_36">     7.     Aggrieved by Ext.P10(a) common judgment rendered

by this Court, petitioner filed SLP Nos.32934 - 32936/10 before

the Apex Court. In those SLPs, the Apex Court passed Ext.P12(a)

order dated 23/11/2010 granting leave confining to the direction

in Ext.P10(a), the Division Bench judgment, where it was directed

that FIR should be registered against the petitioner and that

direction alone was ordered to be stayed. The relevant portion of

the order reads thus:-

</p><p id="p_53">          7.     Government have examined the case in
          detail and came to the following findings:-

</p><p id="p_54">               (i)      The very premise that the dispatch of
               the letter on 28th May is helpful to the
               accused in the CBI case is not logical. Even if
               he head sent the report on 28th May 2005,
               he could have collected the bribe as the
               party (M/s.Canon Granites) would not be in
               the know of things. The knowledge of the
               party is more important from the point of
               view and had the accused in the CBI case
               created a record to show that the party was
               intimated about the existence of such a
               document, the argument would have had
               some force.
</p><p id="p_55">               (ii)     The eye witnesses testified to the
               effect that the district officer of Pollution
               Control Board had met the petitioner in this
               case at Trissur around 5 pm on 28.5.2005
               and the dispute is whether the report was
               handed over at the time or not.       It is not
               unlikely to have taken place.
</p><p id="p_56">               (iii)    Another pertinent issue is as to why
               CBI didn't enjoin the petitioner as an accused
               in the case if he had fabricated a document
               to save the accused. Fabrication of a
               document is a criminal act. Instead, they
               opted to recommend departmental action.
</p><p id="p_57">               Recourse     for  a   criminal   act   is   not
               departmental action but is prosecution. It
               makes the case of the review petitioner
               stronger.
</p><p id="p_58">               (iv)   The evidences furnished by CBI are
               substantially weakened subsequently when

                 two employees of the Pollution Control Board
                 Office,  Trissur   gave    statements   before
                 Magistrate under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_30">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C to the
                 effect that they have direct knowledge about
                 the dispatching of the report on 28.5.2005
                 itself as claimed by the petitioner in this
                 case.
</p>
<p id="p_59">           8.     In the light of the above, Government order
           that the decision to censure the petitioner be
           annulled retaining the option      to reconsider the
           matter as and when the case charged by CBI is
           finally decided. In case the Court finds that the
           review petitioner is culpable (as can be inferred
           from the stand taken by the court about the
           veracity of the argument of CBI that the document
           purported to be executed on 28.5.2005 was
           actually typed and dispatched on 29.5.2005 only
           or later), Government could initiate even major
           penalty.

<p id="p_60">           9.     As regards his request for cancelling the
           operation    of   G.O(Ms)     No.03/10/Envt.  Dated
           20.11.2010     terminating     his appointment    as
           Chairman and Member of the Kerala State
           Pollution Control Board cannot be considered in
           view of the unambiguous observations made by
           the Hon'ble High Court in its judgment dated
           9.11.2010     in WP(C) No. 11235/10 filed by
           Shri.S.D.Jeyaprasad, and also as it is not a matter
           under consideration in this file."
</p>
<p id="p_61">      14. It is on the strength of Ext.P15 order issued by the

additional 2nd respondent, this writ petition is filed and the main

relief sought is for his reinstatement as Chairman of the Board

and other consequential prayers are also sought. When this writ

petition was considered on 11th of September, 2012, this Court

prima facie felt that the conduct of the officer who issued Ext.P15

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 :19 :</span>



order amounted to contempt as defined in the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_31">Contempt of Courts

Act</a>. Therefore, he was impleaded as additional 2nd respondent

and notice was issued and the 2nd respondent has filed his counter

affidavit also.
</p>
<p id="p_62">      15. Learned senior counsel contended that the service of

the petitioner was terminated as per Ext.P12, based on the

punishment of censure awarded to him as per Ext.P6. Therefore,

according to him, since the censure imposed has been annulled

by Ext.P15 order, the basis on which his service was terminated

does not survive and as a consequence thereof, the petitioner is

entitled to be reinstated in service and granted other reliefs that

are sought for in the writ petition. To answer this contention of the

petitioner, reference to Ext.P12, which discloses the reasons for

his termination, is necessary. This order shows, that in addition to

the grave misconducts that were found against the petitioner,

Government have also stated that his appointment by Ext.P4(a)

Government order was for one year and that the same has

expired on 30/8/10.      So long as that second order remains in

force, even if it is assumed that for valid reasons, Ext.P6 has been

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                  :20 :</span>



annulled, that does not result in a situation where Ext.P12 looses

its efficacy. Therefore, this contention does not have any merit.

</p><p id="p_63">      16. However, there is yet another, a more serious aspect of

the matter, viz., whether Ext.P6 order could have been annulled

by the 2nd respondent at all. When this question was raised,

counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that in Ext.P14

judgment, this Court directed consideration of Ext.P13 and that in

Ext.P13, there was a prayer to reconsider the order of censure

also. Therefore, according to the learned senior counsel, the 2nd

respondent was well within his rights to reconsider Ext.P6 order

also.    In my view, this contention is totally untenable and

deserves rejection for the following reasons;

</p><p id="p_64">      (a)   In  Ext.P14    judgment,    this Court   only  directed

consideration of Ext.P13 and clarified that it shall be in

accordance with law. Therefore, if legally, it was impermissible for

the 2nd respondent to interfere with Ext.P6 order, he was duty

bound to decline interference. Therefore, the fact that by Ext.P13

judgment, this Court directed consideration of a review petition

does not mean that the statutory authority has the license to

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                 :21 :</span>



abuse his position in the manner it was done in this case. The 2nd

respondent should have remembered that in WP(C) No. 25661/11,

the petitioner had also sought a prayer for consideration of Ext.P9

seeking review of Ext.P6 and that was not granted by this Court.

Even that factual aspect was ignored by the 2nd respondent in his

over enthusiasm in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_65">      (b) As already seen, Ext.P6 order has been upheld by this

Court by dismissing WP(C) No. 20211/2010. Special leave sought

by the petitioner was not granted by the Apex Court as is evident

from Ext.P12(a) order. This shows that Ext.P6 order has attained

finality in all respects. Once the order has attained finality in the

hands of a constitutional court, thereafter, statutory authority

cannot annul the order and thus nullify the effect of the binding

judicial pronouncement.
</p>
<p id="p_66">      (c)   In the counter affidavit filed, 2nd respondent justifies

review petition and consideration of Ext.P15 contending that it is

the statutory right of a party to seek review. Therefore, according

to him, Ext.P15 order was passed by him in exercise of the review

powers available to the Government. Suffice it to say that the 2nd

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                :22 :</span>



respondent is making this assertion ignoring the fact that the

punishment of censure had attained finality at the hands of this

Court and Apex Court which have passed Ext.P10(a) judgment

and Ext.P12(a) order, upholding the same and that he could not

have thereafter tinkered with the order in any manner.

</p><p id="p_67">      (d)  That apart, unlike a routine administrative order, which

could   have   been   modified    or  even    recalled  in  certain

circumstances, even after it is upheld by a court of law, Ext.P6 is

an order passed under Rule II of the Rules. In a case where such

an order is upheld by this Court, a petition under Rule 35 seeking

its review, could not have been considered thereafter, unless,

permitted by this Court. Otherwise, inspite of the binding

judgments rendered by Constitutional Courts, parties will be at

liberty to pass fresh orders, upsetting the earlier ones upheld by

Courts. Such a course, will be allowing judgments to be nullified

and is impermissible.    Therefore, the contention that right of

review was available to the petitioner is no ground to sustain the

order.
</p>
<p id="p_68">      (e)   In compliance with the order dated 11th September,

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                   :23 :</span>



2012, the additional 2nd respondent filed an affidavit and

produced Ext.R2(a), the Government order dated 4/11/11 and in

para 5 of the affidavit, he has stated that;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           "the representation received dated 23/6/11 for review
           of the earlier orders on punishment and termination
           was rejected by Government vide communication
           dated 4/11/11."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_69">Rule 35 of the Rules specifically provide that there shall be only

one review and the above averments in the affidavit show that

the review power was already invoked by the petitioner by his

representation dated 23/6/11 and that was rejected by Ext.R2(a)

order. Once a review petition was rejected by the additional 2nd

respondent as per Ext.R2(a), he had no jurisdiction to entertain

Ext.P13, which is a second application made for review of the

order. In the counter affidavit, there is absolutely no explanation

for overlooking the statutory prohibition against entertaining

more than one application under Rule 35 of the Rules or for

reaching a contradictory finding in Ext.P15 order.

</p><p id="p_70">      (f)  Ext.R2(a) order produced along with the counter

affidavit refers to WP(C) No. 25661/11. That writ petition was

disposed of by Ext.P14 judgment on 8/11/11 and that too after

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                  :24 :</span>



adjourning the case atleast on four occasions for the Government

Pleader to obtain instructions in the matter. Therefore, if Ext.R2(a)

order was already passed on 4/11/11, and that too, on a different

review petition, the 2nd respondent had the duty to appraise this

Court of the same when the case was taken up for consideration

on 8/11/11. Even if there was a failure on his part in doing so,

the 2nd respondent should have sought review of the judgment by

making an appropriate application before this court rather than

taking refuge under the judgment and abuse his position.

</p><p id="p_71">     (g) In the counter affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent, it is

stated that;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">         "since Ext.P13 review petition dated 3/12/2010 was not
         traceable in this department, copy of the said review
         petition itself which was produced along with the writ
         petition was acted upon. This was so done because there
         was a peremptory direction by this Court in WP(C) No.
         25661/11 to positively consider the review application."</blockquote><p id="p_72">
</p><p id="p_73">     In my view, this is a puerile justification. As I have already

stated, before Ext.P14 judgment was rendered, 2nd respondent

had various opportunities to inform this Court that Ext.P13 was

not received by the Government. Even if he has not done so, he

could have declined to consider Ext.P13 for its non receipt, or he

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                 :25 :</span>



could have informed this Court of the unreceipt of Ext.P13, by

seeking a review of the judgment. Both these courses were not

adopted. Instead, the 2nd respondent has chosen to act upon a

review application which was not received in the Government and

even if it was received, the application was not a maintainable

one. As a result, suppression of a material fact committed by the

petitioner in obtaining Ext.P14 judgment went unnoticed.

</p><p id="p_74">      (h)   In his counter affidavit, 2nd respondent has placed

reliance on the observation in Ext.P10(a) judgment that this Court

did not record any conclusive finding that the petitioner is guilty

of any offence. A bare reading of the judgment would show that

such an observation was made in view of the direction to register

FIR against the petitioner, so that investigating officers could

investigate into the offences alleged against him, untramelled by

the findings in the judgment. Therefore, the aforesaid statement

in the judgment does not mean that it was open to the petitioner

or the 2nd respondent to nullify the judgment in any manner.

These show that attempt now made by the 2nd respondent is to

misinterpret the judgment of this Court to bestow unmerited and

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                :26 :</span>



undeserved advantage to the petitioner, and one cannot be

faulted, if conspiracy is suspected.
</p>
<p id="p_75">      (i)   The manner in which Ext.P13 was dealt with by the 2nd

respondent, to say the least, is strange. Power of review is

different from appellate power and the scope of an application for

review is narrow and is to be sparingly used to correct errors

apparent on the face of the record. Even if this traditional and

settled principle regarding the scope of an application for review

is relaxed, by no stretch of imagination can a reviewing authority

collect fresh evidence while dealing with an application under

Rule 35 of the Rules. Para 6 of Ext.P15 order shows that the 2nd

respondent allowed examination of 5 witnesses, while considering

Ext.P13. This procedure adopted is totally illegal and was without

any jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_76">      17. For these reasons, I am of the view that the

Government could not have issued Ext.P15 order annulling Ext.P6

order imposing penalty of censure.
</p>
<p id="p_77">      18. This judgment will be incomplete, if I do not comment

upon the conduct of the petitioner. Even in WP(C) No. 25661/11,

WPC.No.20863/12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    :27 :</span>



he has suppressed the representation dated 23/6/11 leading to

Ext.R2(a) and obtained Ext.P14 judgment for the consideration of

a review petition, which was not even received by the statutory

authority. That fact has been suppressed in this writ petition also.

Therefore, he is guilty of suppression of material facts and that

his conduct deserves to be condemned.
</p>
<p id="p_78">      19. In so far as the additional 2nd respondent is concerned,

the background of this case has been fully explained in Ext.P10(a)

judgment and therefore, it needs no reiteration. It is despite

Ext.P10(a) and Ext.P12(a) order passed by the Apex Court

confirming the same, he has now issued Ext.P15 annulling Ext.P6.

The vehemence with which he has attempted to justify his

conduct is reflected in his counter affidavit and it shows his

anxiety to sustain Ext.P15 and also to justify his willful conduct.

In Ext.P10(a) judgment, this Court held thus;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        Our Constitution designed with the high ideal of
        protecting the citizens from unfair and arbitrary exercise
        of State power can also be taken advantage of by citizens
        of doubtful credentials; when the various organs of the
        State wittingly or otherwise collaborate.</blockquote><p id="p_79">
</p><p id="p_80">      20. Ext.P15 order proves that these statements in Ext.P10

</p><p id="p_81">(a) judgment were prophetic. Further the consistent reluctance of

the State to deal with the petitioner in accordance with law and

that at every stage, this Court had to compel the State were taken

note of in paragraph 19 of the judgment. It is in that background

Ext.P15 order should be viewed. In my view, the conduct of the

2nd respondent as explained in the preceding paragraphs, prima

facie, shows that he has interfered with administration of justice,

and therefore is liable to be proceeded against under the

<a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_32">Contempt of Courts Act</a>. However, since the proceedings are in

relation to Ext.P10(a) judgment rendered by a Division Bench, any

decision in this matter has to be taken only by a Division Bench.</p><pre id="pre_2">
