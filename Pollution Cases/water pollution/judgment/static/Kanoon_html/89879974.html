<p id="p_1">                           The     appellant         had     approached       the    National     Green

                      Tribunal from an order dated 03.01.2017 of the Appellate

                      Authority   under       <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_1">Section      28</a>   of   the     Water   (Prevention    and

                      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as

                      ‘<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>’).          That Authority had set aside the consent

                      under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a> that was granted to the appellant and

                      had remanded the matter.             The National Green Tribunal in the

                      appeal    filed    by    the    appellant        has    decided    that    unless

                      ownership   is    first     settled       by   the     Civil   Court,     nothing

                      further   can     be    done.        It   is   only     thereafter    that   the

                      Pollution Board can grant consent and the tannery will have

                      to remain closed until this is done.

</p><p id="p_2">                           Having heard the learned counsel for both the sides,

                      it is clear that the National Green Tribunal’s order has

                      rendered the appellant much worse off than the Order against
