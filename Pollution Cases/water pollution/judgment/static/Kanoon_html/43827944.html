Biswanath Rath, J. Through this writ petition, the petitioner, a Company incorporated
            under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> sought for quashing the notice dated 6.11.2015
            and letter dated 24.11.2015 vide Annexures- 10 and 13 respectively and in
            the alternate sought for a direction against the opposite party no.1 not to
            act upon Annexures-10 and 13 during pendency of the appeal with an
            alternate prayer to extend the time                 frame for installation of the Online
            Stack Monitoring System by the State Pollution Control Board-opposite
            party no.1 to a reasonable period of time recording the undertaking of the
            petitioner not to start commercial production until installation of the aforesaid
            system.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2</span>
<p id="p_5">2.     The petitioner at the first instance came to this Court avoiding the
statutory appeal provision against such orders in Water (Prevention &amp;
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 read with Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 by filing W.P. (C) No.20587 of 2015 which matter was
disposed of by the order dated 20.11.2015 of this Court with leave to the
petitioner to agitate the issue by way of appeal before the competent
authority. Following the aforesaid direction, the petitioner preferred appeal
before the appellate authority. Unfortunately, for non-functioning of the
appellate authority, the petitioner was again constrained to move this writ
petition for the relief(s) indicated hereinabove.
</p><p id="p_6">3.     The factual matrix as available from the pleadings and the
submissions of the parties are as follows:-
</p><p id="p_7">       The petitioner-company was established in the year 2007 by setting
up a Sponge Iron Plant with other integrated facilities at Suniamuhan, Bali
Athagarh, Cuttack with investment of about eight crores and with capacity of
production to the tune of 30,000 tons per annum upon receipt of necessary
consent order from the opposite party no.1 in exercise of power under
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 read
with   <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_6">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
While the matter stood thus, Central Pollution Control Board in its letter
dated 5.2.2014 instructed all State Pollution Control Board to ensure that all
plants running under the State Pollution Control Board should install the
Online Stack Monitoring System. Consequent upon receipt of the above
communication, opposite party no.1 by letter dated 12.5.2014 directed the
petitioner-Company for installation of the Online Stack Monitoring System
by 31.3.2015 and         for this, the petitioner was required to furnish
performance bank guarantee to the tune of Rs.3,50,000/- i.e. 25% of the
proposed cost of installation at least by 31.3.2015 with a further condition
that failing installation of the      system, the bank guarantee         shall
automatically be forfeited and also with threat to initiate appropriate action
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>



against the company for such non-compliance.         Following the aforesaid
direction, the petitioner in order to comply the direction given therein,
furnished a bank guarantee of Rs.3,50,000/- on 21.5.2014 with the opposite
party no.1 and the bank guarantee stood valid for two years i.e. up to
20.6.2016. Depending upon submission of the bank guarantee, opposite
party no.1 issued a consent order to operate the plant for the year 2015-
2016 on 19.3.2015 and the consent order was to remain valid for the period
1.4.2015 to 31.3.2016. Simultaneously, the opposite party no.1 also issued
another consent order to operate the plant without any directive. The time
stipulation for installing the system by 31.3.2015 was further extended up to
30.6.2015 by virtue of a letter of the opposite party no.1 dated 6.4.2015. The
petitioner submitted that following such restriction and submission of the
bank guarantee assuring compliance of the installation the system, the
petitioner in the meantime called for the quotations for supply of all the
machineries for putting the system in place. In the process, M/s. Prima
Equipment, Vadodora, Gujrat, the supplier of the machine placed the sales
order conformation -cum- proforma invoice addressed to the petitioner for a
consideration amount of Rs.8,49,150.00 paise with a demand of 25% of the
entire cost of the machine, as advance thereby M/s. Prima Equipment also
assured the petitioner for making available the machine within a period of
three to four weeks. This fact was also brought to the notice of the opposite
party no.1. Further case of the petitioner is that while the petitioner was
making all arrangements for installation of the machine, the petitioner-
company faced a labour unrest resulting closure of developmental work in
the plant since 1.4.2015 which could ultimately      resolved by virtue of a
memorandum of settlement on the intervention of District Labour Officer,
Cuttack on 2.6.2015 which facilitated the petitioner-company to request M/s.
Prima Equipment for delivery of the machine with a view to install the same
within the target   period i.e. 30.6.2015. In the meantime, the company is
required to deliver the machine meant for the petitioner, delivered the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>



to some other company and in the process intimated the petitioner for
permitting it some more time for supply of the machine. Thus facing the
situation stated above, the petitioner was compelled to write a letter to the
opposite party no.1 on 22.6.2015 requesting for grant of more time for
installation of the machine indicating therein the developments taken place
in the meantime. Petitioner's further case is that when the petitioner was
preparing for commencement of the company i.e. production activities, the
labourers again resorted to strike from 15.10.2015 demanding higher salary
and other financial benefits thereby unilaterally causing stoppage of work.
Since the situation was beyond the control of the petitioner and
apprehending that the time stipulation fixed by the opposite party no.1 i.e.
30.6.2015 was going to lapse, the petitioner had no other option than to
request the opposite party no.1 for extension of time. It is alleged that to the
misfortune of the petitioner, the opposite party no.1 with an unrealistic
approach rejected the request of the petitioner.           In the meantime on
intervention of the Labour Officer, Cuttack       in the matter, there was an
attempt for resolving the labour dispute and to the utter surprise of the
petitioner, in the meanwhile, the petitioner was served with a notice dated
6.11.2015 thereby bringing to the notice        of petitioner-company that the
bank guarantee of Rs.3,50,000/- furnished by the petitioner             has been
forfeited with a further show cause notice under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_8">Section 31</a> (A) of the Air
(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 directing the petitioner for
showing cause within fifteen days as to why consent to operate granted in
favour of the petitioner till 31.3.2016 shall not be revoked and as to why
other appropriate legal actions should not be initiated against it.          Upon
receipt of the aforesaid intimation as well as the show cause, the petitioner
in its reply dated 12.11.2015 intimated the opposite party no.1 that the
factory has been practically remained close since 1.4.2015 resulting the
management failing installation of the machines and in the said response
petitioner also undertook that he shall not start the factory until installation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>



the Online Stack Monitoring System to be in place and thereby petitioner
once again requested the opposite party no.1 not to forfeit the amount
under the Bank guarantee. In the meantime, the petitioner-company
approached this Court against such orders and      as indicated hereinabove,
based on the permission of this Court, petitioner withdrew the writ petition
filed earlier and approached the appellate authority against the impugned
order under Annexure-10.
</p><p id="p_8">4.     During pendency of the appeal, the petitioner received a letter dated
24.11.2015 issued by opposite party no.1 (Annexure-13) declining to extend
the time stipulation on the plea that the Central Pollution Control Board
declined to extend the time beyond 30.6.2015. In assailing the orders under
Annexures-10 and 13, Miss Deepali Mohapatra, learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner-company contended that the bank guarantee remaining
valid till 30.6.2016.   The opposite partyno.1 is well aware of the labour
situation prevailing in the petitioner's factory premises since 1.4.2015 which
is a reason for petitioner's not being able to move ahead for installation of
the particular system. In spite of intervention of the Labour Officer, the
labour dispute could not be resolved for quite a long time. Necessary
machineries have already been dispatched to the petitioner through the
invoice dated 9.3.2016.      In the meantime, the petitioner has already
installed Online Stack Monitoring System and commissioned the same on
18.3.2016. The petitioner further contended that finding the installation of
the machineries, the Pollution Control Board being satisfied has already
renewed the consent order in the meantime for the period from 1.4.2016 to
31.3.2017 for operationalisation of the plant.       The plant is ready to
commence its production with effect from 21.3.2016.           In view of no
negligence on the part of the petitioner-company, the matter should not
have been viewed liberally by the opposite party no.1. Further, in view of
the grant of consent order for the period 2015-2016 to 2016-2017, all the
issues involving the bank guarantee remained infructuous. It is in these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       6</span>



premises, Miss. Mohapatra, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner-
company prayed this Court for interfering in the impugned actions of the
opposite party no.1 and for issuing suitable direction for treating the matter
concerning installation of the Online Stack Monitoring System as complete
and allow the bank guarantee to be recalled in favour of the petitioner-
company.
</p><p id="p_9">5.     In opposition, the opposite party no.1 in filing a counter affidavit
contended that the petitioner has failed in making a ground for interference
of the Court    in the impugned orders under Annexures-10 and 13. The
petitioner taking resort to labour strike for its not been able to commission
the system is not a ground for considering the case of the petitioner. In
spite of repeated request of the opposite party no.1 to the petitioner, the
petitioner did not comply the required direction and as such there is no
illegality at the instance of this opposite party. Notice for invocation of the
bank guarantee has been issued in strict compliance of conditions agreed
by both the parties.    In view of the strict conditions in the decision for
commissioning of the system, there is no requirement for compliance of
natural justice before invoking the bank guarantee. While denying all the
allegations against this opposite party, the opposite party no.1 vehemently
contended that petitioner since failed to comply the conditions, required in
the commissioning of the system, the orders under Annexure-10 and 13
remain valid and there is no scope for interfering in the same. Specifically
arguing on the question of forfeiture of the bank guarantee, learned counsel
appearing for the State Pollution Control Board vehemently urged that in
view of the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1988070/" id="a_10">Hindustan
Steel Works Construction Ltd. v. Tarapore and Co. and another</a>, AIR
1996 SC 2268 and       a decision of this Court     rendered in the case of
<a href="/doc/785881/" id="a_11">National Aluminum Co. Ltd., v. M/s.R.S.Builders (India) Ltd. and others</a>,
AIR 1991Orissa 314 submitted that the scope of interference of the Court in
such matters are limited to only fraud or where irretrievable injustice would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        7</span>



be done. It was argued that this Court has no scope for interference in the
matter. During pendency of the writ petition, the petitioner filed an affidavit
disclosing therein that consequent upon intervention of District Labour
Officer, a settlement was arrived on the disputes raised by the workmen.
Further, on receipt of assurance of the labourers to join work, in the
meantime, the petitioner has made full payment towards cost of the pollution
control equipment. The supplier also in the meantime dispatched all the
equipments. By filing an additional affidavit, the petitioner further contended
that in the meantime, the Monitoring System is already installed and
commissioned on 18.3.2016 and the opposite party no.1 has been intimated
regarding each development by letter dated 18.3.2916, consequent upon
which the Board i.e. the opposite party no.1 in the meantime has renewed
the consent order for the period from 1.4.2016 to 31.3.2017.
</p><p id="p_10">6.     By filing an additional counter affidavit enclosing therein a photo
copy of the inspection report dated 19.3.2016, the opposite party submitted
that upon receipt of the letter from the petitioner regarding installation of the
Online Stack Monitoring System, the opposite party no.1 made an
inspection on the spot of the Company on 19.3.2016 and upon receipt of the
report, the opposite party-Board has already granted a consent to operate in
favour of the petitioner up to 31.3.2017 as appearing under Annexure-18.
On the basis of this additional counter affidavit, Sri Mishra, learned counsel
further urged that the period for forfeiting of the bank guarantee remains
valid and there is no scope for interfering in the same.
</p><p id="p_11">7.     Heard learned counsel for the parties. The undisputed fact remains
that the State Pollution Control Board depending on the consent order
granted in favour of the petitioner vide Board's letter No.4135 dated
21.3.2014 intimated the petitioner furnishing a performance bank guarantee
for installation of the Online Stack Emission Monitoring System and the
consent order to operate beyond 30.6.2014 was to be considered only after
receipt of bank guarantee amount as to be determined by the Court. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         8</span>



issuing this letter, petitioner was directed to complete the installation and
commissioning the above system by 31.3.2015.                 consequent upon
submission of bank guarantee         with the opposite party no.1, the State
Pollution Control Board granted the consent order on 19.3.2015 under
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">Sections 25</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and
under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_14">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and
the consent order was to remain valid for 1.4.2015 to 30.3.2016. While the
matter stood thus, by letter dated 6.4.2015, considering the prevailing
situation in the plant site of the petitioner and considering the direction of the
Central Pollution Control Board, the opposite party no.1           intimated the
direction part of the Central Pollution Control Board contained in
communication dated 17.3.2015 reads as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "(a)All the industries will submit bank guarantee of 100%
                  of the cost of the online monitoring systems
                  (emission and effluent whichever applicable)          for
                  ensuring timely installation of online monitoring
                  systems by 30.6.2015 and such bank guarantee will
                  be discharged if they install the system before June

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (b) If the industries will not install the online monitoring

                 of the industry        shall be withdrawn and bank
                 guarantee shall be forfeited.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                     Issued direction to the petitioner to complete

                  consent conditions stipulated by the Board and
                  ensure uploading of real time data to the server of
                  the SPBC and CPBC by 30th June, 2015 failing

                 shall be revoked and bank guarantee shall be
                 forfeited."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">8.        Factual matrix as available from the pleadings as well as the
submissions of the respective parties, at this stage of the matter, is that
while the petitioner had already placed its order for purchase of online stack
monitoring system in order to ensure that the online stack monitoring
system reaches the plant site before the time stipulation at the instance of
the opposite party no.1. In the meantime, on 10.3.2015, M/s.Prima
Equipment also issued the sales order conformation-cum-proforma invoice
addressing the petitioner for a consideration amount of Rs.8.94,150.00
paise. This fact was also even brought to the notice of the opposite party
no.1. It is, when the machine was planned to be installed in the plant site
within the stipulated period, the petitioner-company witnessed labour unrest
and incidental problems involving the management and the workmen of the
company, things become so critical that none of the workmen joined their
work resulting complete closure of the plant site since 1.4.2015.         The
workmen even went to lock the plant from all its entry point and did not even
allow the management representative to get an entry to the plant premises.
On its approach to the District Labour Officer, the management arrived in a
sort of settlement with the workmen on 2.6.2015 whereby it was mutually
agreed to allow the operationalisation up to plant site. As per the petitioner,
it could only be possible at this point of time for making a request to M/s.
Prima Equipment to deliver the online stack monitoring system to be
installed by 30.6.2015.        To the ill luck of the petitioner, the company
intimated the petitioner that it had already delivered the machine meant for
the petitioner to some other company as the petitioner-company was not in
a position to receive the same for its engagement in a labour problem.
Petitioner under the circumstances requested the opposite party no.1 for
grant of some more time, but the request was rejected by the opposite party
no.1 by its letter dated 13.7.2015. This Court is unable to find a reason as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                          10</span>



to when the opposite party was aware that the petitioner-company is in fact
in a soup and not in a position to install the particular system in time, as to
why such request of the petitioner was turned down. This court is of the
view that looking to the difficulties arose at that point of time and which fact
was even well within the knowledge of the opposite party no.1, nothing
prevented the opposite party no.1 to take up the matter with the Central
Pollution Control Board and obtaining an extension order.                 The factual
matrix further reveals that when the petitioner was gearing up to install the
required system and to resume its production activities, the labourers again
resorted to strike from 15.10.2015 demanding higher salary including other
financial benefits and unilaterally restrained themselves from             doing any
work. Necessitating the intervention of the District Labour Officer again
made a joint inquiry in presence of both the sides on 3.11.2015, 20.11.2015
and 11.12.2015 and 11.12.2015. It is at this point of time, the impugned
order under Annexure-10 involving forfeiture of the bank guarantee was
issued. There is no denial to the fact that there was in fact labour unrest in
the petitioner unit from time to time. It also clearly reveals from the
documents attached to the additional counter affidavit filed by the opposite
party no.1 on 22.4.2016. From the document              under Annexure-A/1 along
with the additional counter affidavit of opposite party no.1, an inspection
report conducting an inspection of the plant site on the direction of the State
Pollution Control Board through one of its Regional Officer, there clearly
reveals the date of inspection as 19.3.2016. The report under the heading
"Operational Status" reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 "The plant was under shut down since 15.10.2015 due to
              labour strike and not started operation till date of inspection."</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">       From the very inspection report under heading "Status of installation
of Online Stack Monitoring" reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                "The unit has installed online stack monitoring system in the
              stack attached to common ESP of DRI Klin I&amp; II for the parameter
              PM &amp; SO2."</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                       11</span>
<p id="p_14">       From the reading of inspection report, it clearly reveals that the plant
remained shut down from 15.10.2015 till 19.3.2016 and that in the
meantime, the unit has already installed such online stack monitoring
system.    A document filed by the petitioner along with affidavit dated
16.3.2016 in support of its case, the petitioner has made a categoric
statement in paragraph-4 of the said affidavit that it is only on 1.3.2016 the
labourers given their consent to join their work and further they requested
the petitioner Management to start production work awaiting for a settlement
of the issue subjudice of a dispute before the District Labour Officer,
Cuttack. It is only, on this assurance, the petitioner made full payment of
the cost of the machineries in favour of M/s. Prima Equipment, on this
assurance, the petitioner made full payment of the cost of the machineries
in favour of M/s. Prima Equipment on 9.3.2015 and having response by
filing an additional affidavit dated 6.4.2016, the petitioner in paragraph-4 has
made a categoric statement that the online stack monitoring system was
installed and commissioned on 18.3.2016 in the plant of the petitioner and
getting intimation of the said installation, the opposite party no.1 renewed
the consent order from 1.4.2016 to 31.3.2017.
</p><p id="p_15">9.     From the above narrations, it is amply clear that the petitioner was
facing a situation all through which was not only beyond its control but was
even within the full knowledge of the opposite party no.1. The opposite party
no.1 even though filed an additional counter affidavit on 22.4.2016, nowhere
denied the above claims of the petitioner. It is in view of the above and
reading of the inspection report prepared by none else than an Officer of
the opposite party no.1, it is made clear that the plant of the petitioner was
shut down since 15.10.2015 due to labour strike and following the
installation of the Online Stack Monitoring System, already in place and for
its granting renewal consent order for the period          from 1.4.2016      to
31.3.2017, it is quite clear that the opposite party no.1 was all through
aware of the situations/impediments faced by the petitioner and on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                            12</span>



grant of consent order          for the period from 1.4.2016 to 31.3.2017,
operationalisation of the plant to the satisfaction of the system required is
already put in place by the petitioner even before commencement of
production. This Court feels that the situation for not being able to put the
system in place was beyond the control of the petitioner and the petitioner
cannot be found faulted. Further, from the reading of the communication
made by the State Pollution Control Board, Odisha dated 24.11.2015,
appearing at annexure-13, the reason assigned by the opposite party no.1
in the matter of forfeiture of bank guarantee is for               refusal to      grant of
extension by the Central Pollution Control Board beyond 30.6.2015 but in
absence of any material to support it, this Court doubts as to if any attempt
in this regard has been made or not. The additional counter affidavit filed by
the opposite party no.1 lacks any such supporting. Therefore, this Court
finds the communication dated 24.11.2015 remains unsupported.
</p><p id="p_16">10.    Now, coming to the decision cited from the side of the opposite
paerty no.1. In the case of <a href="/doc/1988070/" id="a_16">Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd. v.
Tarapore and Co. and another</a> (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
considering a matter of revocation of bank guarantee made it clear that
interference of the court is possible only in exceptional cases that is to say,
in the case of fraud or in a case where irretrievable injustice would be done,
if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed.
</p><p id="p_17">       In paragraph- 23 of the decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                   "We are, therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of
              law is that commitment of banks must be honoured free from
              interference by the Courts and it is only in exceptional cases, that
              is to say, in case of fraud or in a case where irretrievable injustice
              would be done if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed, the
              Court should interfere. In this case fraud had not been pleaded
              and the relief for injunction was sought by the
              contractor/respondent No.1 on the ground that special equities or
              the special circumstances of the case required it. The special
              circumstances and/or special equities which have been pleaded
              in this case are that there is a serious dispute on the question as
              to who has committed breach of the contract, that the contractor
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                               13</span>


                  has a counter claim against the appellant, that the disputes
                  between the parties have been referred to the arbitrators and that
                  no amount can be said to be due and payable by the contractor to
                  the appellant till the arbitrators declare their award. In our
                  opinion, these factors are not sufficient to make this case an
                  exceptional case justifying interference by restraining the
                  appellant from enforcing the bank guarantees. The High Court
                  was, therefore, not right, in restraining the appellant from
                  enforcing the bank guarantees."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">11.      From the scan of the facts involved in the case and on consideration
of the submission of learned counsel appearing for the respective parties
reading together with the view of the Apex Court noted hereinabove, this
Court finds the case of the petitioner falls in the compass of irretrievable
injustice. The bank guarantee remained in force for continuing interim
direction passed by this Court even continuing as on date. Consequently,
while declaring the impugned orders dated 6.11.2015 and 24.11.2015 vide
Annexures- 10 and 13 as bad in law, the same are quashed. So far as
prayer no.2 is concerned, in view of the admitted position that the petitioner
has already installed the Online Stack Monitoring System, the petitioner-
company, if not started production, be permitted to start its commercial
production forthwith.

made hereinabove but with no order as to cost.
