	This
	Writ Petition in the nature of a Public Interest Litigation has been
	preferred by the petitioners, who are residents of Block No.613 of
	Village Prempur, Taluka Himatnagar, District Sabarkantha redressing
	serious grievance as regard environmental pollution caused by stone
	crushing (quarry) unit run by respondents No.6, 7 and 8 have prayed
	for the following relief:

<p id="p_2">	"(A)
	To issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or

</p>
<p id="p_6">I.
</p><p id="p_7">	 ORIGIN AND GENESIS OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION :
</p>
<p id="p_8">	Facts
	relevant for the purpose of deciding this Public Interest Litigation
	can be summarized as under: 
</p>
<p id="p_9">1	Petitioners
	are agriculturists and are residing at Village Prempur situated in
	Taluka-Himatnagar of District- Sabarkantha and Village Pipodar,
	situated in Taluka-Himatnagar of District-Sabarkantha. It appears
	from the record that the petitioners had preferred Special Civil
	Application No.7293 of 2010 alleging environmental pollution being
	caused by respondent Nos.6 to 8. It was alleged that the respondent
	Nos.6 to 8 were using crushing machine (stone crushing unit) causing
	multiple environmental problems relating to health, hygiene and
	safety of the agriculturists of the surrounding area. Quarry lease
	was granted by respondent State Authority in Block No.651 of Village
	Prempur, adjoining to it are the agricultural lands. They
	highlighted before this Court that pollution is being caused by
	respondent No.6 to 8. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.2	It
appears that the Division Bench of this Court vide order dated
31.08.2010, disposed of the writ petition taking note of the fact
that respondent Nos.6 to 8 have closed the unit. However, with same
suitable observation the Division Bench disposed of the petition
being Special Civil Application No.7293 of 2010. We would like to
quote the order passed by this Court at the relevant point of time
with regard to the same subject matter:
</p>
<p id="p_11">	"The
petitioners preferred the writ petition alleging environment
pollution as being caused by respondents nos. 6 to 8. It was alleged
that the respondents nos. 6 to 8 were using crushing machine causing
multiple problems relating to health, hygiene and safety of the
agriculturists of the surrounding area. The quarry lease has been
granted by respondent State authorities in Block No.651 of Prempura.
Adjoining to it are the agricultural lands. They have highlighted the
pollution being caused by the respondents nos. 6 to 8. Learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the State referred to Collector's
report and submitted that a minimum distance of 200 mts. is
prescribed under the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules, 1963. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">Per
contra, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in a similar
case, Pollution Control Board has specified 1 km. to be safe distance
between crusher and human habitation. Reliance has been placed on
Supreme Court decision in Mohammed Haroon Ansari and another Vs.
District Collector, Ranga Reddy District (AIR 2004 SC 823). That was
a case where mining quarrying operations were seen to be causing
pollution, the expert committee appointed by High Court opined that 1
km. is safe distance between site under quarry lease and residential
locality or Ground Level Service Reservoir. Pollution Control Board
also specified 1 km. to be safe distance between crusher and human
habitation. The Supreme Court accepted the said position. In view of
such decision of Supreme Court, learned counsel for the petitioner
would contend that the respondent-State should modify the 1963 Minor
Mineral Rules in view of the report of the Pollution Control Board
and decision of the Supreme Court in Mohammed Haroon Ansari (supra). 
</p>
<p id="p_13">2.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Gujarat State Pollution
Control Board submits that the Board having found that the
respondents nos. 6 to 8 were causing pollution in the area cancelled
the Consolidated Consent and Authorization (C.C.A.) by order dated
21.07.2010. In view of the cancellation of such consent the
respondents nos. 6 to 8 cannot operate the crushing unit.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	3.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents nos. 6 to 8 while
accepting that they have closed the unit, submits that they be
allowed to apply for fresh lease in an area where the public in
general will not be affected. In this connection, we are not
expressing any opinion, but may only observe that the crushing unit
can be allowed to operate without causing pollution and affecting the
agricultural fields or human habitation or the health and hygiene of
the locality including the water reservoirs, etc. No further order is
required to be passed in this case. The writ petition stands disposed
of."
</p>
<p id="p_15">2.3	Record
also reveals that Respondent Nos.6 to 8 thereafter preferred Misc.
Civil Application No.2524 of 2010 in Special Civil Application
No.7293 of 2010 for review and recall of order dated 31.08.2011
passed by this Court. This Review Application was also disposed of by
the Division Bench vide order dated 24.11.2010. We would like to
reproduce Para 7 of the said order:
</p>
<p id="p_16">	"7.We
have heard counsel for the parties and noticed the statement.  We do
not want to make any observation with regard to the stand taken by
counsel for the respondents nos. 6 to 8 (applicants herein), but may
only observe that this Court generally records the statement of
counsel in verbatim, if orally made.  This Court by its order dated
31.08.2010 having not expressed any further opinion and having passed
any further order in the Special Civil Application No.7293 of 2010,
taking into consideration the fact that the unit of original
respondents nos. 6 to 8 (applicants herein) has been closed, the
question of recalling or modification of order dated 31.08.2010 does
not arise.  Respondents nos. 6 to 8 (applicants herein) will apply
for fresh lease in an area where public in general will not be
affected.  The statement made by counsel for the respondents nos. 6
to 8 (applicants herein) will not preclude them to make any
application in accordance with law, including application for grant
of fresh C.C.A.  In such a case, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board
before passing any order will take into consideration the safety of
the human inhabitation of the adjoining area.  The petition for
review stands disposed of with aforesaid observations. No costs."
</p>
<p id="p_17">2.4
	It is the case of the petitioners that in spite of clear observation
made by the Division Bench earlier in the point of time that crushing
unit may be allowed to operate without causing pollution and
affecting the agricultural fields or human habitation or the health
and hygiene of the locality including the water reservoirs, etc. the
authorities concerned namely respondent No.1- Collector, Sabarkantha
and respondent No.3- Gujarat Pollution Board has once again granted
permission to start the crushing unit which is only at a distance of
645 meters  from the residential locality and the agricultural
fields. It is also the case of the petitioners that Respondent Nos. 6
to 8 have started blasting operations which has caused substantial
damage to the residential houses including religious places like
mosque.  It is the case on behalf of the petitioner that the
permission has been granted by the concerned respondents in total
violation of the direction which has been issued by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in this regard wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has stated
that a distance of 1 kilometer can be said to be safe distance
between crushing unit and the residential locality. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">2.5	It
is in this background of the aforestated facts that the petitioners
are once again before this Court by way of this petition in the
nature of a Public Interest Litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	II.	 CONTENTIONS
OF THE PETITIONERS :
</p>
<p id="p_20">3.	Learned
Counsel Mr. J.V. Japee, vehemently argued that the authorities
concerned in flagrant disregard of the earlier orders passed by this
Court have granted permission to start the quarry in favour of
Respondent No.6 willfully ignoring and overlooking the objections and
representations filed by petitioners and other residents of
surrounding area regarding environment related problems.
</p>
<p id="p_21">4.	Learned
counsel also submitted that the petitioners had also highlighted
potential risk and hazards to the safety of life and property of the
people residing in the surrounding area. He has submitted that the
authorities concerned duly complied or/and ignored the objections and
representations of the petitioners. Mr.Japee brought to our notice
the photographs of the mosque and other residential houses which
indicates and suggest that cracks have developed due to vibration
caused by the  crushing unit which is only at a distance of 645
meters. Mr.Japee also vehemently submitted that it was specifically
pointed out to the authorities that on account of small particles of
stones being spread due to operation of the quarry the standing crops
also would get damaged. He submitted that authorities also ignored
the fact that there would be shortage of water on account of
necessity of water in the quarry. The agricultural labourers residing
in the agriculture fields would also be affected by the pollution
created by the operation of the  quarry unit. He submitted that
authorities very conveniently obtained NOC from some of the
relatives, friends and neighbours of respondent Nos.7 and 8 but
deliberately ignored the objection of the persons who are most
affected.
</p>
<p id="p_22">5.	Mr.
</p><p id="p_23">Japee invited our attention to the judgment of the Apex Court in the
Case of Mohammed Haroon Ansari and
another Vs. District Collector, Ranga Reddy District, A.P.
reported in AIR
2004 SC 823. Relying on this judgment of the Apex Court Mr.Japee
submitted that Supreme Court took serious note of the pollution being
caused
by operations of stone crushing/mining quarry. He submitted further
by inviting our attention to para No.8 of the judgment where the
Supreme Court has observed that the distance of 1 k.m. is a safe
distance between the site of the quarry lease and the residential
locality.
</p>
<p id="p_24">6.	Mr.Japee
therefore, submitted that this is a fit case where in this Court
should interfere and exercise power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution in public interest and grant reliefs as prayed for in
the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_25">III.	 CONTENTIONS
OF RESPONDENT NO.4, GEOLOGIST DIST.SABARKANTHA
:
</p>
<p id="p_26">7.	Learned
Assistant Government Pleader appearing on behalf of respondent No.4
submitted that there is no dispute to the fact that the distance
between the site and the residential locality is of 645 meters.
According to the learned AGP, this distance is a safe distance and
the pollution problem which is being apprehended by the petitioners
is not well founded, if respondent Nos.6 to 8 are permitted to
operate the quarry. Learned AGP  further submitted that necessary
permissions from the revenue authority have also been obtained by the
respondent. Learned AGP relied on Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966
more particularly Rule 22(7) which provides that no blasting or
mining operations should be allowed within 200 meters from Railway
lines, Dam, Roads, Hospitals, Buildings and residential area.
According to the learned AGP permission has been granted
in accordance with Rule 22(7)of Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966.
Learned AGP further submitted that as and when it has been found that
the lease holder has violated the terms of the lease action has been
taken and penalty of Rs.10.50 lac has been recovered from Respondent
No.6. Learned AGP also submitted relying on the affidavit-in-reply
filed by respondent no.4, Geologist that on inspection it has been
found that adequate measures are being taken by respondent no.6 to
meet with the conditions of the lease. Learned AGP, therefore,
submitted that there is no substance in this Public Interest
Litigation and the same deserves to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_27">IV.	 CONTENTIONS
OF RESPONDENT NO.3, GUJARAT POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD
:
</p>
<p id="p_28">8.	Learned
Counsel Mr. Sunil L. Mehta appearing for Gujarat Pollution Control
Board submitted that the Officers of the Board visited the unit on
02.06.2011 and it was found that there was no blasting activity and
the rubble stones from mines were in wet condition, thus preventing
dust from being spread in the air. It was also found by the officers
that water sprinkling was being regularly done and the unit had
installed wind breaking wall from RCC plates. He submitted that unit
has implemented all the suggestions as made by Gujarat Cleaner
Production Centre. Taking all these into consideration SPCB, thought
fit to issue an order revoking the earlier direction of closure under
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Section 31-A</a> of the Air Act and pass a fresh order of consent.
</p>
<p id="p_29">V.	 CONTENTIONS
OF RESPONDENT NO.6, PARTNER OF SAI QUARRY
:
</p>
<p id="p_30">9.	Learned
Senior Counsel Mr.Bhaskar Tanna submitted that respondent no.6 has in
all earnestness carried out all necessary modifications and
compliance of Gujarat Pollution Control Board given from time to time
and accordingly Gujarat Pollution Control Board has issued a consent
order in favour of respondent No.6 for a period of five years.
Learned Counsel submitted that affidavit filed by the Geologist would
show that Survey No.613 is at a safe distance of 645 meters from the
said quarry. Mr. Tanna further submitted that there are no
residential houses in that area as well as in the nearby vicinity. He
vehemently submitted that when all the authorities after due
consideration have thought fit to grant consent then in that case
this Court in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
may not grant any relief to the petitioners in the name of public
interest. He submitted that his client has invested huge sum to setup
the unit and at this stage if any orders adverse to respondent no.6
are passed then it may cause irreparable injury and will also cause
grave prejudice. He submitted that it is the fundamental right of
respondent No.6 to trade and carry on business.
</p>
<p id="p_31">VI.	 ANALYSIS
:
</p>
<p id="p_32">What
	can be gathered from the materials on record is that in the first
	round of litigation, the petitioners pointed out to the Court that
	the respondent Nos.6 to 8 were using crushing machine causing
	multiple problems relating to health hygiene and safety of the
	agriculturists of the surrounding area. We have noticed that at that
	point of time, the stand on behalf of the State Government relying
	on the Collector's report was that the minimum distance of 200
	metres is prescribed under the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966
	and, therefore, the unit of the respondent Nos.6 to 8 was far beyond
	the prescribed distance from the residential premises of the
	petitioners. We have also noticed that at that stage the petitioners
	pointed out to the Court that as per the decision of the Supreme
	Court in Mohammed Haroon (supra), the minimum distance
	between the crusher and human habitation must be 1 km. It was also
	pointed out to the Court that in view of decision of the Supreme
	Court in the case of Mohammed Haroon (Supra), the State
	should modify Minor Mineral Rules, 1966, so far as the distance part
	is concerned. We may only say at this stage that the Rules, 1966 are
	now replaced by the Rules, 2010.  Even while enacting the Rules,
	2010, it appears that the State Government has overlooked the
	decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Mohammed Haroon
	(supra) so far as distance part is concerned. Be that as it may,
	we shall deal with this issue at a later stage in our judgment. We
	have also noticed that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board submitted
	before the Court that the respondent Nos.6 to 8 were causing
	pollution in the area and, therefore, cancelled the consolidated
	consent and authorization (C.C.A.) by order dated July 21, 2010 and
	in this view of the matter, the respondent Nos.6 to 8 cannot operate
	the crushing units. Record also reveals that in the first round of
	litigation, the respondent Nos.6 to 8 accepted the fact before the
	Court that they have closed the unit as per the order of the Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board dated July 21, 2010. However, they pleaded
	that they may be allowed to apply for fresh lease in an area where
	the public in general will not be affected. We have noticed that the
	Division Bench in its order dated August 31, 2010, which we have
	referred to in the foregoing paragraph 22, observed without
	expressing any opinion that the crushing unit can be allowed to
	operate without causing pollution and affecting the agricultural
	fields or human habitation or the health and hygiene of the
	locality, including the water reservoirs.
</p>
<p id="p_33">It
	appears that once again the respondent Nos.6 to 8 applied before the
	Gujarat Pollution Control Board for fresh lease and the Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board  has granted consent to run the unit,
	subject to certain terms and conditions, which according to
	respondent Nos.6 to 8 are being scrupulously complied with. However,
	what is important once again is the distance at which the unit is
	being operated from the residential locality. It is an undisputed
	fact that the distance between the unit and the residential locality
	of the petitioners is about 645 metres i.e. for sure, less than 1
	km.. We are not able to understand as to why  the Gujarat Pollution
	Control Board  has ignored this aspect while granting consent, more
	particularly, when there is a decision of the Supreme Court in the
	case of Mohammed Haroon (supra) that a safe distance between
	a crushing unit and residential locality should be 1 km.. The
	judgment of the Supreme Court would be the law of the land within
	<a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_8">Article 141</a> of the Constitution of India and the Gujarat Pollution
	Control Board  could not have overlooked the judgment and granted
	necessary consent or permission to start the unit. Most disturbing
	feature of this litigation is complete misreading of Rule 22(vii) of
	the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules, 1966. It appears that taking
	shelter of this particular Rule, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board
	as well as respondent Nos.6 to 8 are of the view that since the
	distance between the unit and the residential locality is of more
	than 50 metres, as prescribed under the Rules, the Gujarat Pollution
	Control Board was well within its powers to accord permission in
	favour of the respondent Nos.6 to 8. For better understanding of
	this issue, we may quote Rule 22(vii) of the Gujarat Minor Minerals
	Rules, 1966, which reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_34">"Rule
22(vii) : The lease shall not carry on or allow to be carried on
any quarrying operations at any point within a distance of 50 metres,
if no blasting is involved 200 metres if blasting is involved from
the boundary of any railway line, except with the written permission
of the railway administration concerned or from the boundary of any
reservoir, canal, road or public works or buildings except with the
previous permission of Government. The permission of railway
administration or Government may, in granting such permission impose
such conditions as it may deem fit."
</p>
<p id="p_35">Plain
	reading of this Rule 22(vii) suggests that the quarrying operations
	can be permitted at any point within a distance of 50 metres, if no
	blasting is involved and if blasting is involved, then within a
	distance of 200 metres from the boundary of any Railway Line, except
	with the written permission of the Railway Administration concerned
	or from the boundary of any reservoir, canal, road or public works
	or buildings, except with the previous permission of the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_36">In
	our opinion, the position of law as understood by the respondents is
	completely misconceived and absurd. If the argument of the
	respondents is accepted, it would lead to a situation where the
	industrial stone crushing unit would come and say that they do not
	discharge, suspend particulate beyond the levels of parametres
	prescribed under the Act and, therefore, they should be allowed to
	operate the stone crushing unit in the heart of the city. In the
	first instance, Rule 22(vii) of the Rules, 1966 has no application
	because Rule 22(vii) is absolutely silent insofar as the distance to
	be maintained from a residential locality is concerned. The word
	"building" used in Rule 22(vii) would not suggest that
	it would include the residential locality and other structures like
	schools, temples, national highways, etc.. This problem has cropped
	up as according to us, there is no unified policy of Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board  or any guidelines framed by the Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board in this regard. What we have noticed is as
	and when the permission is prayed for to start a quarry unit, the
	Gujarat Pollution Control Board seems to be taking into
	consideration the guidelines as regards the parametres to be
	maintained as fixed under Schedule-I of the Environment (Protection)
	Rules, 1986. We shall quote Rule 37 of the Environment (Protection)
	Rules, 1986, which reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_37">"Rule
37 : Stone crushing unit : Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) : 
</p>
<p id="p_38">The
standards consist of two parts :
</p>
<p id="p_39">Implementation
	of the following pollution control measures :
</p>
<p id="p_40">(a)	Dust
containment cum suppression system from the equipment.
</p>
<p id="p_41">(b)	Construction
of wind breaking walls.
</p>
<p id="p_42">(c)
	Construction of the metalled roads within the premises.
</p>
<p id="p_43">(d)
	Regular cleaning and wetting of the ground within the premises.
</p>
<p id="p_44">(e)
	Growing of a green belt along the periphery.
</p>
<p id="p_45">Quantitative
	standard for the SPM :
</p>
<p id="p_46">The
	Suspended Particulate Matter contribution value at a distance of 40
	metres from a controlled isolated as well as from a unit located in
	a cluster should be less than 600 mg/Nm3. The
	measurements are to be conducted at least twice a month for all the
	12 months in a year."
</p>
<p id="p_47">It
	can be seen that so far as the above referred Rule 37 is concerned,
	it is also silent so far as the distance part is concerned. However,
	this would not preclude or prevent the Gujarat Pollution Control
	Board to make a unified policy and frame guidelines in this regard

	(supra), the Supreme Court was dealing with <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Environment
	(Protection) Act</a> (29 of 1986) and the same issue of minor quarries/

</p>
<p id="p_48">"8.		..
</p><p id="p_49">.. .. The affidavit of Pollution Control Board indicates that if
proper safeguards  are adopted as indicated in the said affidavit, it
will not cause any air, water or noise pollution, much less dust
articles affect the water supply system in GLSR or Osmansagar lake.
We, therefore, direct that the order made by the High Court is
modified by directing that the distance of 1 km. is a safe distance
between the site of the quarry leases and the residential localities
or GLSR or Osmansagar lake. The guidelines issued by the Andhra
Pradesh Pollution Control Board specified 1 km. to be safe distance
between crusher and human habitation from 17.1.1997. Prior to that it
was only 500 metres away national Highway and 100 metres away from
the State Highway, Major District roads and other roads. That is why
this Court granted an interim order earlier and directed that no
mining and stone crushing operations shall be carried on within a
distance of 1 km. from lake or reservoir and 500 metres from human
habitations."

We
	are of the view that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board is obliged
	in public interest to plan a comprehensive programme for prevention,
	control or abatement of air pollution and to secure execution
	thereof, it is authorised to take steps for prevention, control or
	abatement of area pollution. It is also authorised to take steps for
	prevention, control or abatement of air pollution in air pollution
	arise and is also entitled to do all such other things and to
	perform all such other acts as it may think necessary for proper
	discharge of its functions and generally for the purpose of carrying
	into effect the purposes of the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a>. In fact, it is
	the duty of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to prevent and
	control and in doing so, for achieving the purpose of the Act, for
	the purpose of carrying into effect the purpose of the Act, it must
	frame the guidelines. The guidelines must be in the form of general
	information to all the industrial units which are proposed to be
	established or operating in accordance with guidelines. We also deem
	fit to quote <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_13">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air Act, which reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_52">"31
: Power to give directions : Notwithstanding anything contained in
any other law, but subject to the provisions of this Act and to any
directions that the Central Government may give in this behalf, a
Board may, in the exercise of its powers and performance of its
functions under this Act, issue any directions in writing to any
person, officer or authority, and such person, officer or authority
shall be bound to comply with such directions.
</p>
<p id="p_53">Explanation
: For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that the power
to issue directions under this section includes the power  to direct-
</p>
<p id="p_54">(a)	the
closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or
process; or
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_55">(b)
	the stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity, water or any
other service."
</p>
<p id="p_56">From
	the language of <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_14">Section 31(A)</a> of the Act, it would be clear that the
	Board has authority to issue any direction in writing to any person
	and such person shall be bound to comply with such direction. The
	fact that the Board has not issued any guidelines then too the Board
	to achieve the object under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a> can issue a direction
	relating to closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry,
	operation or process. The Board can also issue a direction to an
	existing unit that it should shift its location. We are of the view
	that keeping in mind the seriousness of the issue in question, the
	Board must immediately frame appropriate guidelines insofar as
	granting permission to start quarry operation units (stone crushing
	units) like in the present case. In framing such guidelines, the
	Board may keep in mind the following factors :
</p>
<p id="p_57">Standards
	of quality of air and water laid down under the concerned Acts;
</p>
<p id="p_58">Existing
	concentration of various pollutions, including noise in the area;
</p>
<p id="p_59">The
	likely emission or discharge of environmental pollutants from the
	proposed industry, process or operation;
</p>
<p id="p_60">The
	topography and climatic features of the area;
</p>
<p id="p_61">Conservation
	of biodiversity of the area;
</p>
<p id="p_62">Environmentally
	compatible land-use in the area;
</p>
<p id="p_63">Net
	adverse environmental impact likely to be caused by an industry,
	process or operation in the area;
</p>
<p id="p_64">Proximity
	to a protected area under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological
	Sites and Remains Act, 1958;
</p>
<p id="p_65">Proximity
	to human settlement, state or national highway, railway, railway
	line (non-captive), besides proximity to river.
</p>
<p id="p_66">Likely
	process-hazards, including hazard likely to occur during handling,
	storage and transportation of the chemicals; and 
	
	  

<a href="/doc/1781078/" id="a_16">Provisions
	of the Wild-life (Protection) Act</a>, 1972 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_17">Environment
	(Protection) Act</a>, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_67">It
	is not disputed that in the State of Gujarat, about 1258 industries
	are involved in the business of crushing of the stones and allied
	matters. It is also not disputed that mushrooming of such industries
	is on the rise which is not effectively controlled by the State
	Executive. Such industries are scattered all over and not located
	within specified places. The pollution caused on account of the
	crushing of the stones can also not be disputed. Emission of dust
	emitted from the conduct of the business are surely to affect the
	lungs and other major organs of the people involved in the business
	and living in surrounding areas. At this stage, keeping in mind the
	nature of controversy, we deem fit to quote a paragraph of a
	Division Bench decision of Karnataka High Court in the case of
	<a href="/doc/1211290/" id="a_18">Obayya Pujary and others v. Member Secretary, Karnataka Pollution
	Control Board, Bangalore</a> reported in AIR 1999 Karnataka 157.
	Their Lordships of Karnataka High Court have observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_68">"The
air we breathe, is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with minor
constituents like carbon dioxide and trap gases. Pollutants are
substances which are not normally present in the air. Pollutants
in the form of dust, smoke, industrial and automobile exhaust,
gaseous and particulate matters, though not normally expected to be
present, yet are found in the air. Nature and amount of such
pollutants varies from place to place depending upon population,
vehicular density and location of industrial units etc. Lungs are the
major organs affected by the air pollution. The spectrum of
functional and pathological reactions of the lungs to various
exposures is wide. Chronic bronchitis and airways obstruction is the
result of long term exposure to air pollution. Organic matters
including dust can cause the allergic reactions producing allergic
alveolitis. Inorganic dust may get deposited in the lungs and produce
fibrosis. Exposure to dust may lower the lung defences and clearing
mechanism, resulting in infections particularly tuberculosis. Such
occupational exposures may also lead to causing lung cancer as well.
Such hazardous effects on health are likely to be caused on account
of the air pollution which is caused due to stone crushing. By stone
crushing a lot of thick dust is generated polluting the environment,
visible dust contains particles more than 50 u in diameter which
settle down in the nose and pharynx. Similar particles of 5-10 u size
remain suspended in air and are inhaled deeper. Such particles are
deposited in the tracheo-bronchial tree and lung parenchyma which is
likely to induce fibrosis."
</p>
<p id="p_69">Besides
	human beings, the animals and the vegetation including crops are
	likely to be affected unless protected. It is, therefore, the duty
	of the respondent State to take measures and effective steps for
	regulating the conduct of the business as has been done in many
	other States. The statement showing the details of the said
	industries is as under :

	right to 'life' is the most fundamental right as enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Art.
	21</a> of the Constitution of India. Such right includes all attributes
	of the life. <a href="/doc/1998756/" id="a_20">In Kharak Singh v. State of U.P</a>., AIR 1963 SC
	1295, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the term 'life'
	meant something more than mere animal existence. The inhabition
	against its deprivation extended to all those limbs and faculties by
	which the life is enjoyed. It equally prohibited the mutilation of
	the body by the amputation of an arm or leg, of putting out of an
	eye, or the destruction of any other organ by the body through which
	the soul communicates with the outer world. It postulates to be free
	from restrictions on the enjoyment of a decent, respectable and
	healthy life. Right of life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Art. 21</a> is a right of a person to
	be free from restrictions or encroachment. Whether imposed directly
	or indirectly brought about by calculated measures. <a href="/doc/595099/" id="a_22">In Bandhua
	Mukti Morcha v. Union of India</a>, AIR 1984 SC 802, it was held
	that it is a fundamental right of everybody to live with dignity.
	Such right would include all those rights which ensure a person's
	life meaningful, complete and worth living. Right to life would also
	include right to live in peace, to sleep in peace, enjoy health free
	from pollution. <a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_23">In Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1991
	SC 420, the Apex Court held that enjoyment of pollution free
	atmosphere was included in the right to life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_24">Art. 21.</a> The
	Court observed (para 7 of AIR) :-
</p>
<p id="p_72">	"Right
to live is a fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_25">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution and
it includes the right of enjoyment of pollution free water and air
for full enjoyment of life. If anything endangers or impairs that
quality of life in derogation of laws, a citizen has right to have
recourse to <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_26">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution for removing the pollution of
water or air which may be detrimental to the quality of life."
</p>
<p id="p_73">	However,
	such a right is not an absolute right and is obviously subject to
	reasonable restrictions. It is also controlled and regulated by
	needs of the society. It has to be kept in mind that rapid growth of
	the economy and the industrialisation is also the need of the
	mankind and attribute of and requirement of the decent, respectful
	and dignified life. While protecting the environment the industrial
	development cannot be completely ignored. In M. C. Mehta's case,
	(1992 (3) SCC 256) (supra), it was observed :-
</p>
<p id="p_74">	"We
are conscious that environmental changes are the inevitable
consequence of industrial development in our country, but at the same
time the quality of environment cannot be permitted to be damaged by
polluting the air, water and land to such an extent that it becomes a
health hazard for the residents of the area."
</p>
<p id="p_75">The
	Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/43168610/" id="a_27">Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v.
	State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, AIR 1987 SC 359, had observed :
</p>
<p id="p_76">	"Consciousness
for environmental protection is of recent origin. The United Nations
Conference on World Environment held in Stockholm in June 1972 and
the follow-up action thereafter is spreading the awareness. Over
thousands of years men had been successfully exploiting the
ecological system for his sustenance but with the growth of
population the demand for land has increased and forest growth has
been and is being cut down and man has started encroaching upon
Nature and its assets. Scientific developments have made it possible
and convenient for man to approach the places which were hitherto
beyond his ken. The consequences of such interference with ecology
and environment have now come to be realised. It is necessary that
the Himalayas and the forest growth on the mountain range should be
left uninterfered with so that there may be sufficient quantity of
rain. The top soil may be preserved without being eroded and the
natural setting of the area may remain intact. We had commended
earlier to the State of Uttar Pradesh as also to the Union of India
that afforestation activity may be carried out in the whole valley
and the hills. We have been told that such activity has been
undertaken. We are not oblivious of the fact that natural resources
have got to be tapped for the purposes of social development but one
cannot forget at the same time that tapping of resources have to be
done with requisite attention and care so that ecology and
environment may not be affected in any serious way, there may not be
any depletion of water resources and long term planning must be
undertaken to keep up the national wealth. It has always to be
remembered that these are permanent assets of mankind and are not
intended to be exhausted in one generation."
</p>
<p id="p_77">Again
	in <a href="/doc/497388/" id="a_28">Sri Sachidanand Pandey v. State of West Bengal</a>, AIR 1987 SC
	1109, the Supreme Court had held :
</p>
<p id="p_78">"Today
society's interaction with nature is so extensive that the
environmental question has assumed proportions affecting all
humanity. Industrialisation, urbanisation, explosion of population,
over-exploitation of resources, depletion of traditional sources of
energy and raw materials and the search for new sources of energy and
raw materials, the disruption of natural ecological balances, the
destruction of a multitude of animal and plant species for economic
reasons and sometimes for no good reason at all are factors which
have contributed to environmental deterioration. While the scientific
and technological progress of man has invested him with immense power
over nature, it has also resulted in the unthinking use of the power,
encroaching endlessly on nature. If man is able to transform deserts
into oases, he is also leaving behind deserts in the place of oases.
In the last century, a great German materialist philosopher warned
mankind : 'Let us not, however, flatter ourselves over much on
account of our human victories over nature. For each of such victory
nature takes its revenge on us. Each victory, it is true, in the
first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second
and third places it has quite different unforeseen effects which only
too often cancel the first.' Ecologists are of the opinion that the
most important ecological and social problem is the widespread
disappearance all over the world of certain species of living
organisms. Biologists forecast the extinction of animal and plant
species on a scale that is incomparably greater than their extinction
over the course of millions of years. It is said that over half of
the species which became extinct over the last 2,000 years did so
after 1900. The International Association for the Protection of
Nature and Natural Resources calculates that now, on average, one
species or sub-species is lost every year. It is said that
approximately 1,000 bird and animal species are facing extinction at
present. So it is that the environmental question has become urgent
and it has to be properly understood and squarely met by man. Nature
and history, it has been said, are two component parts of the
environment in which we live, move and prove ourselves.
</p>
<p id="p_79">In
India, as elsewhere in the world, uncontrolled growth and the
consequent environmental deterioration are fast assuming menacing
proportions and all Indian cities are afflicted with this problem.
The once Imperial City of Calcutta is no exception. The question
raised in the present case is whether the Government of West Bengal
has shown such lack of awareness of the problem of environment in
making an allotment of land for the construction of a Five Star Hotel
at the expense of the zoological garden that it warrants interference
by this Court. Obviously, if the Government is alive to the various
considerations requiring thought and deliberation and has arrived at
a conscious decision after taking them into account, it may not be
for this Court to interfere in the absence of mala fides. On the
other hand, if relevant considerations are not borne in mind and
irrelevant considerations influence the decision, the Court may
interfere in order to prevent a likelihood of prejudice to the
public. Whether a problem of ecology is brought before the Court, the
Court is bound to bear in mind <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_29">Art. 48-A</a> of the Constitution.
Directive principle which enjoins that 'The State shall endeavour to
protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and
wild life of the country' and <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_30">Art. 51</a> A (g) which proclaims it to be
the fundamental duty of every citizen of India 'to protect and
improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and
wild life and to have compassion for living creatures.' When the
Court is called upon to give effect to the directive principle and
the fundamental duty, the Court is not to shrug its shoulders and say
that priorities are a matter of policy and so it is a matter for the
policy making authority. The least that the Court may do is to
examine whether appropriate considerations are borne in mind and
irrelevancies excluded. In appropriate cases, the Court may go
further, but how much further must depend on the circumstances of the
case. The Court may always give necessary directions."

	Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_31">M. C. Mehta v. Union of India</a>, AIR 1987 SC
	1086 has ruled that enterprise which has engaged in a
	hazardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses a potential
	threat to the health and safety of persons working in the industrial
	unit and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute
	obligation to the community to ensure that no harm results to any
	one on account of such hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of
	the activity. A person engaged in such industrial activity is under
	an obligation to conduct his commercial activities with the highest
	standards of safety. If the enterprise is permitted to carry on any
	hazardous or inherently dangerous activity for profit, the law must
	presume that such permission is conditional on the enterprise
	absorbing the cost of any accident arising on account of such
	activity as an appropriate item of its overheads. In case of loss on
	account of such activity the enterprise is even liable to indemnify
	and compensate the sufferer. No person, therefore, can claim to have
	a right of carrying on any commercial activity which admittedly
	affects the health of others. The State, under these circumstances
	is under a constitutional obligation to provide safeguards for
	protecting the life and health of the citizens. There is no absolute
	right vesting in any citizen to carry on commercial activities of
	trade or occupation without limitation. The experts on the subject
	are of the opinion that the theory which governs our environmental
	laws, is what may be called a 'Policing Society Theory' envisaging
	the Legislature and the administration would perform their task
	acting as vigilant policemen entrusted to detect crimes by bringing
	the culprits to the Court. Failure on the part of the Executive or
	the Legislature to perform their constitutional obligation would
	cast a duty upon the judiciary to react and come to the rescue of
	the people by providing remedial measures, issuance of appropriate
	direction protecting the environment for the safety of life, the
	health and property of the citizens.

<p id="p_81">Right
	to freedom as enshrined in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_32">Art. 19</a> of the Constitution though
	fundamental, is not an absolute right and is always subject to
	reasonable restrictions which may be imposed in the larger interests
	of the society. Freedom of profession, trade and business as
	contemplated by Clause (1)(g) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_33">Art. 19</a> of the Constitution is
	always subject to the limits as may be imposed by the State in the
	interests of public welfare. The Supreme Court in various judgments
	held that there were certain activities which were inherently
	pernicious that nobody could be considered to have a fundamental
	right to carry them on as trade or business. The Supreme Court in
	<a href="/doc/1029264/" id="a_34">Cooverjee v. Excise Commissioner</a>, 1954 SCR 873 : (AIR 1954 SC
</p><p id="p_82">	220) has held that though a citizen has a right to carry on
	any business of his choice, there is no right to carry on any
	business inherently dangerous to the society. No citizen has a
	fundamental right to carry on business wherever he chooses and such
	a right can be subjected to reasonable restriction in the interests
	of general public. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/571901/" id="a_35">State of Maharashtra
	v. H. N. Rao</a>, AIR 1970 SC 1157, held that the reasonable
	restriction imposed has to be adjudged in the light of the nature of
	the right, danger or injury which may be inherent in the unbridled
	exercise of the right and the necessity of protection against danger
	which may result to the public by the exercise of the right. It
	further held :
</p>
<p id="p_83">	"In
adjudging the reasonableness of restrictions imposed upon the holding
or disposal of a carcass which is noxious, maintenance of public
health is the paramount consideration. Restriction imposed upon the
right of an owner of a carcass to dispose it of in the manner
indicated in the Act, being enacted solely in the interest of the
general public, cannot be deemed arbitrary or excessive merely
because they involve the owner into a small financial burden. Under
the Constitution a proper balance is intended to be maintained
between the exercise of the right conferred by <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_36">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_37">(g)</a>
and the interests of a citizen in the exercise of his right to
acquire, hold or dispose of his property to carry on occupation,
trade or business. In striking that balance the danger which may be
inherent in permitting unfettered exercise of right in a commodity
must of necessity influence the determination of the restrictions
which may be placed upon the right of the citizen to the commodity."

<p id="p_84">In
	the aforesaid view of the matter, we are left with no other option
	but to quash and set aside the order passed by the respondent Nos.3
	and 4 permitting the respondent Nos.6 to 8 to restart the quarry
	operations and we, accordingly, quash the same. However, it shall be
	open for respondent Nos.6 to 8 to put up a unit at a distance of 1
	km. from the residential locality and may seek appropriate
	permission or consent from the Board in this regard. It shall be
	open to the respondent Nos.6 to 8 to relocate themselves at a place,
	which is at a minimum distance of 1 km. from the residential
	locality and the Board upon inspection if is satisfied as regards
	the distance maintained, then in that case, the Board may grant
	fresh consent order in favour of the respondent Nos.6 to 8 in
	accordance with law.

<p id="p_85">Keeping
	in view the facts and circumstances of the case, the position of
	law, the interest of the Society and all those who are carrying on
	or intend to carry on business connected with the crushing of
	stones, we deem it proper to issue the following directions to the
	Gujarat Pollution Control Board in the public interest :
</p>
<p id="p_86">The
	Gujarat Pollution Control Board shall immediately formulate a policy
	regulating carrying on of business related to crushing of stones by
	prescribing reasonable conditions, including the guidelines and
	licences and their periodical renewals. While framing the
	guidelines, the  Gujarat Pollution Control Board shall keep in mind
	the factors which we have indicated in paragraph17 hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_87">The
	 Gujarat Pollution Control Board is hereby directed to submit its
	compliance report in the Registry of this Court on or before June
	11, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_88">			Copies
	of present judgment shall be furnished by the Registry to the
	learned Assistant Government Pleader appearing for the
	respondent-State as well as the learned counsel appearing for the
	Gujarat Pollution Control Board for taking up appropriate action and
	submission of compliance report within the period and time
