                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. to

quash     the     entire    proceedings       in   C.C.No.132/2009

(P.C.No.44/2008) on the file of J.M.F.C., Saundatti for the

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_2">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_4">26</a> of Water

Act and under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_5">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">44</a> of Water (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the order dated

21.01.2009 passed by it.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.         The   substance    of the      case   are    that    the

petitioner was a Chief Officer of Town Municipal Council,

Saundatti from 17.11.2006 till 01.06.2007. This being the

fact, the first respondent filed a private complaint against

the petitioner in P.C.No.44/2008.            It is the duty of Town

Municipal   Council,       Saundatti    to    maintain      and     keep

Saundatti Town clean and environment free from pollution

and effluent. The Council having been established on the

plain area, has allowed the discharg the entire untreated

sewage without any treatment to Malaprabha River as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              :3:</span>


such, the water of the said river is being polluted.     The

complainant made correspondence with the petitioner to

treat the sewage effluent in proper manner so as to avoid

the contamination of river water.    The petitioner did not

care the instructions in spite of several directions made by

the Pollution Control Board and did not comply with the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>. The petitioner had obtained

consent from the respondent No.1 for the period ending on

30.06.2005 on the condition to have its own treatment

plant to treat the sewage effluent prior to its discharge and

the petitioner had assured to comply with the terms and

conditions.     Thus, the main grounds of the complaint is

that effective steps were not taken to treat the sewage

effluent in proper manner so as to avoid the contamination

of Malaprabha river water which is used for irrigation and

for drinking.

<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.       Sri. M.G. Naganuri, learned counsel for the

petitioner would submit that, the petitioner in his official

capacity, was insisting the Government to install a plant

and as such, the petitioner was not the Chief Officer on the

date of inspection.   The petitioner is falsely implicated in

the alleged crime.    Hence, he prays for quashing of the

proceedings initiated against him.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4.     Sri G.I. Gachchinmat, learned counsel for the

respondent No.1 would submit that petitioner was also the

Chief Officer of the Town Municipal Council from the period

of 23.05.2003 to 10.01.2005. The petitioner is responsible

for the breach of consent. He would further submit that,

the matter falls within the domain of the trial Judge, as it

is open to the petitioner to urge his defence or justification

before the trial Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      5.     On the overall context and circumstance, I am

of the view that it is open to the petitioner to urge his

remedies before the trial Court. The petition is dismissed.

</p><p id="p_10">      A liberty to the petitioner is given to urge all remedies

before the trial Court.
