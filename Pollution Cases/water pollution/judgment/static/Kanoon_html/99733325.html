</pre><p id="p_2">                This Criminal Revision has been filed praying to set aside  the
order passed by the respondent in A4/11920/15, dated 01.09.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                2. The Revision Petitioner herein is running a private company,
doing the production of fish foods, fish oil and fish paste in the name of
'M/s.Hameed Marine Private Ltd'., situated at No.2/1D, Irukkandurai Village,
Radhapuram Taluk, Tirunelveli District.   In support  of his business, he
obtained permission and approval from the competent authorities, as per the
rules and regulations.  The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board issued a
consent order, for establishment of such Industry, as per <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">Section 25</a> of the
Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, as amended in 1988
and also issued consent to operate the unit for the year 2016 and renewed it
upto 31.03.2019, after inspecting the unit / company.  The land and building
plan were approved and No Objection Certificates were issued by the competent
authorities to run the company.  The Deputy Director of Heal Services,
Tirunelveli approved the site for manufacturing fish foods holding that the
site is found suitable from public health point of view. Whereas, in the
meantime, the petitioner was served with a Show-cause Notice, dated
12.03.2016,  issued by the first respondent herein, wherein it has been
stated that various complaints were received from that public that un-
breathable bad smell caused vomiting and dizziness to the people living in
Irukkandurai and nearby areas and also death of two goats have also been
reported, as per the enquiry report of the Tahsildar, Radhapuram, dated
09.03.2016 and to ensure the safety of public, a conditional order was passed
under <a href="/doc/1324337/" id="a_4">Section 133(1)(b)</a> of Cr.P.C., requiring the petitioner company to close
down the unit or if he objects to do so, appear before the first respondent
on 15.03.2016 and show-cause why this order should not be made absolute. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">                3. In compliance of the show-cause notice with conditional order
dated 12.03.2016, the petitioner appeared on 15.03.2016 and filed his
objections.  Thereafter, the impugned final order has been passed by the
first respondent under <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> of Cr.P.C., on 01.09.2016, directing the
petitioner to stop functioning of 'M/s.Hameed Marine Private Ltd.',
Irukkandurai, immediately, on receipt of the order, keeping in view of the
imminent threat to the public health and report compliance of the same and
any violation of the order will invite action under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_6">Section 188</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                4. Having challenged the above order, the present Revision
Petition has been filed against the first respondent at first instance and
thereafter, R2 to R5 were impleaded, as per order in Crl.M.P(MD)Nos.10748 &amp;
10747 of 2017, dated 22.02.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                5. The main contention of the revision petitioner in this
criminal revision is that the impugned order of the first respondent, dated
01.09.2016 was passed without affording reasonable opportunity to the
petitioner and also without appreciating any of the documents relied by the
petitioner and without examining any of the witnesses and hence, the impugned
order violating the principles of natural justice is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                6. Records produced by either side are perused.  Rival
submissions made by either side is also considered.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                7. Based on the complaints received by the District Collector,
Tirunelveli, dated 31.08.2015, and on various complaints from the public of
Irukkandurai Village and nearby areas and also the enquiry report of the
Tahsildar, Radhapuram, dated 09.03.2016 regarding un-breathable bad smell
emanating from the petitioner's Unit, caused vomiting and dizziness to the
people living in Irukkandurai and nearby areas, a show-cause Notice, dated
12.03.2016 with conditional order under <a href="/doc/572324/" id="a_7">Section 138(1)(b)</a> of Cr.P.C., was
issued to the petitioner / marine unit requiring him to close down the
functioning of the factory or to appear before the first respondent on
15.03.2016 to show-cause why this order should not be made absolute. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">                8. Issuance of sow-cause notice with conditional order, dated
12.03.2016, by the first respondent against the petitioner marine unit and
also appearance of the petitioner and filing his show-cause reply on
15.03.2016 are admitted by either side and thereafter, the impugned final
order under <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_8">Section 138</a> of Cr.P.C., was passed on 01.09.2016.  The impugned 
order discloses the fact that in the meantime, inspection of unit by the
first respondent along with Tahsildar,, Radhapuram,  and the Commissioner,
Valliyoor Panchayat Union and local enquiry with the villagers and also the
public travelling along Irukkandurai were made after 15.03.2016 and a
detailed report, dated 19.07.2016 of the Commissioner of Valliyoor Panchayat
Union and also the inspection remarks, dated 19.07.2016 of Tahsildar,
Radhapuram was received and considered for passing the impugned order.  
</p>
<p id="p_10">                9. No witnesses was examined for passing the final order.  The
alleged complainants / public were not examined.  No evidence was recorded by
the first respondent prior to the passing of the impugned order, except
receiving show-cause reply from the petitioner.  The documents relied by the
petitioner were not perused and considered by the first respondent.  The
impugned final order was passed by the first respondent by only taking into
consideration of the inspection remarks dated 19.07.2016 of Tahsildar,
Radhapuram and a report, dated 19.07.2016 of the Commissioner of  Valliyoor
Panchayat Union.   Local residents / complainants were not examined prior to
the passing of the impugned order.  After receiving the show-cause reply from
the petitioner on 15.03.2016, no opportunity was given to the petitioner to
putforth his case with records, which were relied on by him.  No opportunity
was given to the petitioner to produce the renewal of consent order to run
the petitioner's unit, dated 22.07.2016, passed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board till September 2019 for consideration by the first respondent
prior to the passing of the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                10. If the person against whom an order under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_9">Section 133</a> of
Cr.P.C., appears and show-cause against the order, the Magistrate shall take
evidence in the matter as in summons case.  The Magistrate, under <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_10">Section 138</a>
of Cr.P.C., is bound to take evidence in the manner as in a summons case.  If
the procedure relating to the summons case is not followed, the order will be
vitiated.  The complainants has to start proceedings by adducing evidence and
that the party showing cause may produce his own evidence, if so advised.  It
would be illegal to make absolute the conditional order without recording the
evidence, which requirement is mandatory.  Even if the party against whom the
order passed does not produce any evidence, it is incumbent on the Magistrate
to record the evidence of the complainant prior to making an order absolute.
Before making the conditional order final,  the recording of the evidence is
necessary.  Passing the final order without recording the evidence violates
<a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_11">Section 138</a> Cr.P.C.,and is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                11. In terms of <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_12">Section 138</a> of Cr.P.C., the Executive Magistrate
shall take evidence as in a summons case after the persons appeared to show-
cause against the order passed under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_13">Section 133</a> Cr.P.C.,   On considering
the materials available, the Executive Magistrate, shall make the conditional
order absolute.  In the present case, there is no such recording of evidence
of the parties concerned and even at the inception, a final order has been
passed without taking evidence.  The impugned final order is passed only on
the basis of the reports of the officials.  No opportunity is given to the
petitioner to putforth his objections with records, after passing the
conditional order, after filing the show-cause reply by the petitioner on
15.03.2016.
</p><p id="p_13">                12. The counsel appearing for the revision petitioner, in support
of his contentions, relied on an unreported judgment of this Court passed in
Writ Appeal in W.A(MD)No.330 of 2016 and CMP(MD)No.1904 of 2016, dated     
01.03.2016 in S.Natarajan Vs. The District Collector and 3 others.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                13. During pendency of this revision petition, the first
respondent has inspected the petitioner's Unit to verify the fact about the
construction of Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and a status report was also
filed by the first respondent stating that the petitioner has completed the
said construction, since the ETP is functioning in the petitioner's Industry.
As per the status report of the first respondent,  the Company is not causing
any pollution to the public, as rightly contended by the counsel for the
petitioner herein.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                14. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has given consent for
the industry to run the unit and renew the consent order to operate the unit
till September 2019.  The above order was also not considered by the first
respondent herein, prior to passing of the impugned order.      Considering the
above facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is inclined to set
aside the impugned order of the first respondent,  dated 01.09.2016, passed
in proceedings in A4/11920/2015.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                15. In the result, this Criminal Revision stands allowed by
setting aside the impugned order dated 01.09.2016 of the first respondent
herein.  However, the present order is without prejudice to the authorities
concerned, in moving afresh in accordance with law, if such a course is
considered appropriate.  No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous 
petition is stands closed.
