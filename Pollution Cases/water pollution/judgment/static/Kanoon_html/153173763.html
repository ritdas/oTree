                 correct the spelling of the name of the respondent no.3 in course of

                 the day.

<p id="p_2">                              Learned counsel for the State has produced the original

                 records of the tender process before this Court.

</p><p id="p_3">                              It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that

                 the tender has been wrongly rejected and work order has been

                 issued in favour of respondent no.3 on the non-est ground that the

                 petitioner had not attached the pollution certificate from the Bihar

                 State Pollution Control Board whereas the same has been done by

                 the respondent no.3.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                              The fact of the matter is that the respondent no.3 has

                 also not produced any pollution certificate issued by the Pollution

                 Control Board along with the tender papers rather the so-called

                 Pollution Control Certificate is in fact a Consent-To-Establish

                 (NOC) under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">sections 25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control

</p>
<p id="p_5">                                     As a matter of fact, according to learned counsel, no

                       such certificate could be issued before issuance of work order by

                       the authorities of the PMCH but they arbitrarily proceeded in the

                       mater.
