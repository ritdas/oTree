     Shri Yogesh Kumar Gupta, learned counsel for the

     Shri Pankaj Wadhwani, learned Public Prosecutor for
the non-applicant/State.
     Heard. Case diary perused.
     This is first bail application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C.
for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.351/2018

of Water Pollution &amp; <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_12">Control Act</a>, 1974. The applicant is in
custody since 11/10/2018.
     As per the prosecution case, on 10/10/2018 the police
Kshipra got an information from the informer on telephone,
that one person was cleaning his truck in Khan river(Naala)
situated at village - Shhana to Patwa and there was some
chemical is also floating in the Khan river, due to which, foam
is generated. On the basis of the said information, police
reached at the place of incidence and during investigation,
the accused has stated that he took the said chemical from
Geeta Shree Garden and the owner and of the said garden is
Manohar Porwal and the owner of the tanker is Yogendra
Chandrawat.    It is also alleged that due to said chemical
Jitendra, Liyakat and Naresh were injured.
     Learned counsel for the applicant submits that         the
present applicant is innocent and he has been falsely
           HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH :INDORE BENCH

                                  M.Cr.C. No.1154/2019
                               (Prakash Vs. State of M.P.)

          implicated in the present case. He submits that the present
          applicant is not the owner of the tanker nor he is the owner of
          the chemical. Only because he is a driver, he was driving
          the said tanker. The investigation is over, charge-sheet has
          been filed and conclusion of the trial is likely to take long
          time. In such circumstances, he prays that the applicant be
          released on bail.
                Learned Public Prosecutor for the non-applicant/State
          opposes the application and submits that as per oral and
          material evidence which has come in the case diary, there is
          ample evidence against the present applicant and, therefore,
          no case is made out for enlarging the applicant on bail.
                Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the
          parties and perused the case diary.
                After taking into consideration all the facts and
          circumstances of the case, I do not find it fit to release the
          applicant on bail.
                M.Cr.C. No.1154/2019 filed by the applicant has no
          merit and is accordingly dismissed.
