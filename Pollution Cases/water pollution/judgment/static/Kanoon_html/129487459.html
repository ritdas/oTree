                       Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board putting certain conditions on the
                       petitioner/Company causing grave danger to the environment where the
                       operational work under MOU is going on, this petition has been preferred
                       interalia contending that the other conditions are either complied or are in
                       process of compliance, however, the direction to deposit Rupees Ten Crore
                       by way of environmental compensation is without jurisdiction and not within
                       the domain of the M.P,Pollution Control Board. The order impugned has
                       been passed in exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water

                       either the application to determine compensation or its determination is a

                       Constitution of India is not warranted in this petition, therefore, the issue

                       expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, we dismiss this petition for
                       want of having an efficacious alternative remedy to the petitioner to take
                       recourse before the National Green Tribunal.
