                 Ombudsman in O.P.No.5 of 2007.                  The Division Bench of the High

                 Court of Madras in 2006(4) CTC 483 has categorically stated that

                 electricity must be supplied only to such buildings, which have

                 Court had directed to supply electricity without insisting for the

                 be given only on issuance of completion certificate. It also says that

                 they are in a position to supply electricity if the completion certificate

                 was issued only on the basis of the request letter from the petitioner

                 to supply electricity.     On said request the work which had to be

                 completed from the side of the electricity department was finished and
