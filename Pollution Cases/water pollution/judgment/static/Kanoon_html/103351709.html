Tribunal     on    30.01.2013.     Transferred        matter    was

registered    as   Original     Application       NO.11(THC)/2012.

All Dimasa Students Union Dima Hasao District Committee

filed an Original Application No.73 of 2014 before

National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench making serious

complaints with regard to rat-hole mining operation,

which has been going on in Jaintia Hills in the State

of   Meghalaya     for   last    many     years    without     being

regulated by any law. It was alleged that in the course

of rat-hole coal mining by              flooding water several

employees and workers have died. The applicant had also

brought before the Tribunal a detailed report of one

Dr. O.P. Singh, Professor, Department of Environmental

Studies,   North-Eastern        Hills    University,    Shillong,

Meghalaya where entire aspects of the coal mining in

the State of Meghalaya were discussed. The NGT admitted

the application and took the view that illegal and

unscientific mining neither can be held to be in the

interest of people of the area, the people working in

the mines nor in the interest of environment. After

hearing applicant, the Tribunal on 17.04.2014 passed

an order directing the Chief Secretary of Meghalaya,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                        6</span>


Director General of Police, State of Meghalaya to

ensure that rat-hole mining/illegal mining is stopped

forthwith throughout the State of Meghalaya and any

illegal transport of coal shall not take place until

further    orders       passed      by    the    Tribunal.    After   the

passing      of     the     order        dated     17.04.2014    various

applications        were     filed        before    the    Tribunal   by

different Associations and persons claiming interest

in the subject matter of the application. Application

No. 317/2019 was filed by Western Coal Miners and

Exporters Association for being impleaded in O.A. No.73

of   2014,    which        was   allowed.        Another     application

vacating the order dated 17.04.2014. Against order

dated 17.04.2014, C.A.No.5756 of 2014 was filed by a

coal mine owner. The miscellaneous application was also

filed   by    the    State     Coordination    Committee    of   the

Jaintia      Hills     District,      Meghalaya    (one     of    the

appellants before us) for their impleadment, which was

allowed. This Court dismissed the Civil Appeal filed

against   the       order    dated   17.04.2014    passed   by   the

Tribunal, however, granted liberty to the appellant to

approach the Tribunal for modification of the order.

The Tribunal also noticed in its order dated 09.06.2014

that    there       has      been    serious   air,      water    and

environmental pollution being caused by the illegal,

unregulated and indiscriminate rat-hole mining being

carried on in various parts of the State of Meghalaya.

Serious pollution to the upstream was also noticed. The

Tribunal, however, noticed that there are documents on

record to show that right from the year 2003, there has

been serious air and water pollution in the mining

areas of Meghalaya which is injurious and has not only

resulted in degradation of environment, particularly

the    streams      and     underground   water,   but    has    also

seriously jeopardised the human health. It was further

noticed that Transportation of coal in an illegal,

unregulated,        indiscriminate           and    unscientific       manner

has resulted in serious diseases to the people. The

report of the Committee dated 09.06.2014 was noticed

by    the    Tribunal.      By    order       dated       09.06.2014    while

permitting the transportation of the already extracted

coal lying in open near the mining sites, constituted

a     committee     for     supervising            such    transportation.

Various other directions were issued to the committee

as well as to the State and its authorities.



</p><p id="p_10">6.     By a subsequent order dated 01.08.2014 the Tribunal

noticed that the committee earlier constituted by order

dated       09.06.2014      failed      to    perform       the     functions

assigned to it, hence, a new committee was constituted.

The     Tribunal      from       time    to     time       issued    various

directions. We need to notice four orders passed by the

Tribunal       in   detail       which       are     subject      matter    of

challenge      in   these     appeals.         The    orders      which    are

subject      matter    in    these      appeals       are    orders     dated

25.03.2015, 10.05.2016, 31.08.2018 and 04.01.2019.

Order dated 25.03.2015


</p><p id="p_11">7.     In order dated 25.03.2015 NGT noticed that the

rampant,      illegal,    unscientific         and    life-threatening

mining activity, particularly rat hole mining is going

on in the State of Meghalaya for years. The NGT noticed

the report of Commissioner appointed by it and opined

that in spite of order dated 17.04.2014 fresh mining

was going on. The Tribunal also noticed that State of

Meghalaya has promulgated a Mining Policy of 2012 which

does    not    deal   with   rat        hole    mining.       The    State

Government was also directed to formulate and declare

Mining Policy and Guidelines for the State of Meghalaya

to deal with all aspects of mining, which Policy was

yet to see the light of the day. The Tribunal also

noticed      that   the   order    of    the    Tribunal       has    been

violated by illegal mining despite complete prohibitory

orders. It was noticed that the State Government has

found as many as 73 cases of illegal transportation of

coal    in    one   District.     Further,       15    more    cases    of

specific violation of the NGT orders had already been

registered by the State Government. In all 11 Districts

of State of Meghalaya, 308 cases of violation have been

registered and a total number of 605 trucks and 2675.63

tonnes of coal has been seized. The stand of the State

for a non-compliance and its inability to comply with

the direction was also noticed to the following effect:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        “(a) Lack of forces of carry out counter
        insurgency operations and implementation of
        NGT orders.

        and from the condition of previous approval
        of the Central Government under the Mine and
        Mineral Rule Regulation Act, 1957 in respect
        of reconnaissance, prospecting and mining of

Secretary, North East in the Ministry of Home, Central

Government shall, within a period of two weeks, hold a

meeting    with      the   Chief   Secretary   of   the   State   of

Meghalaya and other concerned Authorities and consider

the proposal of the State of Meghalaya. The Tribunal

also expressed its disapproval for the conduct of the

State     in   not    formulating     appropriate     Policy      and

Guidelines. The Tribunal further observed that the

mining    in   the     State   cannot   be     permitted,   unless

</p><p id="p_13">9.   The   Tribunal   also   noticed   that   there   is   huge

environmental degradation and pollution of the water

in the State of Meghalaya and observed that serious

steps are required to be taken for cleaning polluted

waterbodies, with the above objective the Tribunal

authorised the State Government to collect 10% on the

market value of the coal in addition to the royally

payable to it. In this regard following directions were

issued:

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         “It is also undisputable that there has
     been huge environmental degradation and
     pollution of the waterbody in the State of

     of restoration of the area in question, to
     bring to some extent, if not completely,
     restoration of ecology and environment in
     question. Serious steps are required to be
     taken for cleaning polluted waterbodies and
     ensure that no further pollution is caused
     by this activity and the activity which would
     be permitted to be carried on finally
     including transportation of coal. On the
     basis of `Polluter Pay Principle’. We direct
     that the State Government shall in addition
     to the royalty payable to it, shall also
     collect 10% on the market value of the coal

Order dated 04.01.2019

</p><p id="p_38">15. Justice Katakey submitted its report before the

Tribunal   on    02.01.2019.    Committee’s    various

proceedings which were part of the report were noticed

in detail by the NGT. In paragraph 21 of the order

following was noticed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     “21. Under issue number D, it was noted that
     the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board
     in its report in September, 1997 had noted
     that unplanned and unscientific coal mining
     activities were taking place. This had
     achieved dangerous dimensions in the last two
     decades creating ecological disturbance and
     adverse environmental impacts. This showed
     that though cognizance of the problem was
     taken in the year 1997, the problem continues
     even 20 years thereafter. The State Pollution
     Control Board had, in the year 1997,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                     20</span>


     recommended steps to check illegal mining
     including    generation    of    awareness,
     legislative measures, use of technology,
     carrying out of study but none of the
     recommendations were implemented even after
     21 years.”


</blockquote><p id="p_39">16. The Tribunal after considering the report of the

committee and other materials on record came to the

conclusion that the State of Meghalaya had failed to

perform its duties to act on the recommendation of the

report of the Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board

submitted in the year 1997. The Tribunal opined that

interim amount be deposited towards restoration of the

environment. Paragraphs 31 to 33 are as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     “31. Paying capacity and the amount which may
     act as deterrent to prevent further damage
     is also well recognised. Net Present Value
     of the ecological services foregone and cost
     of damage to environment and pristine
     ecology, the cost of illegal mined material,
     and the cost of mitigation and restoration
     are also relevant factors. The Committee may
     go into these aspects to determine the final
     figure.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     32. We are satisfied that having regard to
     the totality of factual situation emerging
     from the record, damages required to be
     recovered are not, prima facie, less than Rs.
     100 Crores. Accordingly, by way of an interim
     measure, we require the State of Meghalaya
     to deposit Rs. 100 crores within two months
     with the CPCB in this regard.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                     21</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       33. We have already noted the extent of
       damage found and the value of the illegally
       mined material, apart from clandestine mining
       for   which  sufficient    material  is   not
       available. The State had collected, as noted
       in the earlier order, royalty of Rs. 400
       crores which by now must be higher figure.”


</blockquote><p id="p_40">17. The State of Meghalaya has filed two appeals being

C.A.No.10720      of    2018    and    C.A.No.2968        of    2019.

C.A.No.10720 of 2018 has been filed questioning the

order dated 31.08.2018 passed by the Tribunal by which

the Tribunal directed that order of the ban of rat-

hole   mining    will    continue     and   further      constituted

Justice   B.P.    Katakey      committee    to    take    steps    for

restoration of the environment and rehabilitation of

the victims. The other Civil Appeal No.2968 of 2019

has    been    filed    by   the    State   of    Madhya       Pradesh

questioning the order dated 04.01.2019 by which State

of Meghalaya was directed to deposit interim amount of

Rs.100 crores towards restoration of the environment.

Garo Hills Autonomous District Council aggrieved by

the   perpetual        ban    of    coal       mining    by   order     dated

31.08.2018 without considering illegality of the ban

in the first place. The appellants are also aggrieved

by appointment of State Government receiver/custodian

of the extracted coal when there is no dispute of the

ownership of the coal and further the question of

vesting     of    the        coal    in    the     State       is     pending

consideration in this Court in C.A.No.5272 of 2016.


</p><p id="p_42">19. C.A.No.10907         of     2018      is     filed   by    Garo     Hills

Autonomous District Council which is aggrieved by the

order of the Tribunal dated 31.08.2018 by which it has

confirmed the ban on coal mining which was in force

for over four years and further direction by the

Tribunal to constitute a committee for the disposal of

funds in excess of Rs.400 crores. The appellants are

aggrieved by the above and alleged that the Tribunal

failed to consider that constituting the committee

without considering the roles and responsibilities of

the   District     Council          has   the     effect      of    virtually

excluding        the     Council          from     issues          concerning

the exclusive jurisdiction of the Council. The ban on

coal mining has effectively closed the doors on a major

source of revenue for the functioning of the District

Council, which is empowered in terms of Sixth Schedule

of the Constitution to collect taxes.

Owners, Coal Traders and Producers Association has

been filed against order dated 10.05.2016 by which

Miscellaneous Applications No.400 and 420 of 2016 were

dismissed. The appellants had prayed for modification

and clarification and/or recall of the final order

dated     31.03.2016     by   which    Tribunal     directed     for

vesting of the duly assessed already extracted coal

with the State of Meghalaya and refusing to extend the

time for transportation of the already extracted coal.

The   appellants   claim      for   propriety      rights   of   its

members    over   such    coal,     which   were   mined    as   per

prevailing custom prior to 17.04.2014.

Lber Laloo. The appellant has filed this appeal against

the order dated 25.03.2015. Aggrieved by the blanket

ban on mining activities imposed in the State of

Shri     Naphade     submits     that     jurisdiction        of   NGT

question      relating         to     environment        (including

enforcement        of    any     legal        right    relating    to

environment) is involved and such question arises out

of the implementation of the enactments specified in

Schedule      I.    The    jurisdiction         depends      upon   two

conditions     which       are    required      to     be    satisfied

cumulatively and they are: (1) substantial question

which relates to environment and (2) implementation of

the enactments specified in Schedule I. It is submitted

that Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_8">Regulation)

Act</a>, 1957(hereinafter referred to as “<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_9">MMDR Act</a>, 1957”)

not being specified in Schedule I, the National Green

Tribunal    could    not       have   exercised      jurisdiction    to

examine violation of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_10">MMDR Act</a>, 1957. It is submitted

that the NGT committed error in holding that the coal

mining in State of Meghalaya is unregulated. The NGT

proceeded on erroneous premise that the Tribals of

Meghalaya     cannot      do   coal    mining    without     obtaining

lease from the State Government. It is submitted that

Tribals who are owners of the land are also owners of

the sub-soil and the minerals in the land. The land in

the   State    of   Meghalaya         was   property    of    men   and

villages. The Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills

have different land tenure system of their own, which

does not provide for vesting of land or minerals in

the State right from pre-Independence period.

</p><p id="p_49">24. Shri     Naphade      submits     that   the   ownership   of

minerals vests with the owner of the land unless the

owner of the land is deprived of the same by some valid

process of law, for example, the provision contained

in   Land   Revenue      Codes   of   different    States,   which

categorically state that the ownership of minerals

exclusively vests in the State Government. However, in

the State of Meghalaya, there exists no such law that

deprives the owner of the land from owning the minerals

beneath it.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">25. Shri Naphade submits that under <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_11">MMDR Act</a>, 1957,

State has no legislative or executive power with regard

to coal, which is a major mineral. It can neither

exercise any jurisdiction of granting any mining lease

to the Tribals nor it has any jurisdiction to frame

any mining policy. It is submitted that the provisions

of   the    <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_12">MMDR   Act</a>   deal    with   lease   and   prospecting

licence. The Tribals of Meghalaya are owners of the

minerals located in their land. Since they are the

owners, there is no question of they being required to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                      28</span>


obtain either a prospecting licence or a mining lease.

The concepts of lease and licence necessarily involve

minimum two parties to the transaction- in case of a

license, there has to be a licensor and licensee.   The

owner of minerals cannot give licence or lease to

himself or grant a prospecting licence. The State is

not the owner of the minerals and, therefore, it cannot

on its own grant prospecting licence or lease as it

has no proprietary right in respect of such minerals.

State can neither be a licensor nor a lessor in such

situation.

NGT that the coal mining in the State of Meghalaya is

unregulated is fully erroneous. Referring to north-

eastern area under which the State of Meghalaya was

established as full-fledged State, it is submitted

that administration of Tribal areas is to be governed

that NGT failed to consider the relevant statutory

matrix including the provisions of Sixth Schedule and

legislation         framed      by     the    Autonomous            District

Councils. It is submitted that NGT has no jurisdiction

to     constitute     any     committee       for       the       purpose    of

enforcing its orders. The constitution of committees

including constitution of Justice B.P. Katakey, former

Judge of the Gauhati High Court by the impugned order

dated 31.08.2018 is beyond the jurisdiction of NGT.

The constitution of the committee is interference with

the jurisdiction of Autonomous District Council. It is

further submitted that NGT has also no jurisdiction to

create any fund. The Tribunal by constituting the

committee and by constituting a fund has created a

parallel       Government.       The     Tribunal         not       being    a

constitutional        court     it   cannot       issue       a   continuous

issued several directions to the State of Meghalaya to

frame     mining      policy     whereas          the    State       has     no

the Union to have taken under its control. Referring

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_14">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986, he submitted that

environment clearance for mining was required only

when area of mining was more than five hectares. In

Tribal     areas   of   State   of   Meghalaya,   mining    area

consists of small area which being not more than five

hectares, there was no requirement of obtaining an

environment clearance. He does not dispute that after

15.01.2016 by the EIA notification now the requirement

of area of being not more than five hectares having

been deleted environment clearance is required as on

date with regard to carrying mining operations. The

Tribals are dependent for their livelihood on coal

mining and, therefore, by complete ban on coal mining

with effect from 17.04.2014, large number of Tribals

are deprived from their livelihood and it is obligatory

for the State to espouse the cause of the Tribals, who

individually were not before the NGT. There being no

Tribal areas of State of Meghalaya and further minerals

are not vested in the State of Meghalaya, the NGT erred

in holding that State has failed to carry on its

obligation and failed to check coal mining in the State

of Meghalaya, it is Central Government which have all

jurisdiction and authorities under Act, 1957 to make

necessary Rules and issue necessary directions and

State alone cannot be blamed. Referring to Minerals

Concession Rules, 1960 framed under <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_15">Section 13</a> of MMDR

Act, 1957, it is submitted that even though Rule 13(f)

refers to mining application with regard to land of

which   minerals   vest   in   persons   other   than   the

Government, he submits that this provision shall not

apply for owner when he himself carries on the mining,

the question of taking lease may arise when owner of

the land give land to some other person to mine the

minerals.

It is submitted that by order dated 31.03.2016, NGT

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     “INTRODUCTON
     Meghalaya has a resource curse. Although, we
     have been endowed with abundant forests and
     minerals,    these    resources     have   not
     contributed to the good of our society,
     because they have been extracted without any
     regulation or concern for the larger common
     good.   This   unregulated,    narrow,   self-
     interest based use of natural resources has
     exacerbated     socio-economic     inequality,
     destroyed    the    environment,    heightened
     criminality,    and   torn   as    under   our
     egalitarian tribal social fabric.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">     It also violates <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_29">Section 39(b)</a> of the
     Constitution   which    provides   that   the
     ownership and control of the material
     resources of the community should be so
     distributed so as to best subserve the common
     good and, therefore, the State cannot
     distribute the material resource of the
     community in any way it likes. The process
     of distribution must be guided by the
     constitutional   principles   including   the
     doctrine of equality and larger public good.

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">     The National Green Tribunal’s landmark order
     regarding Unregulated and illegal coal mining
     in our state therefore came as a wakeup call
     for Meghalaya society at large. This order

        who want things to get back to business as

Shri Gonsalves submits that <a href="/doc/804828/" id="a_30">Section 4</a> of MMDR Act,

1957 by use of words “no person” clearly prohibits

mining operation without obtaining mining lease in

accordance with the Act. Referring to <a href="/doc/1824949/" id="a_31">Section 5</a>, he

submits that for Schedule A minerals permission of

Central Government is required which has not been

obtained. Shri Gonsalves submits that for mining, the

leases    are   required   and   permission   be     sought.   He

submits that there are 53 mines per kilometre in Tribal

areas of Meghalaya. He submits that all extracted coal

which is claimed to be lying assessed or unassessed in

1957 does not apply to State of Meghalaya is based on

an erroneous reading of the statutory provisions.



</p><p id="p_74">39. <a href="/doc/1632341/" id="a_40">Section 13</a> empowers the Central Government to make

rules    for    regulating        the   grant    of    reconnaissance

permits, prospecting licences and mining leases in

respect    of    land   in     which     minerals       vest   in    the

Government and also in respect of any land in which

the     minerals     vest    in     a   person     other    than     the

provisions from Rule 41 to Rule 52. Rule 41 stipulates

that the provisions of the said Chapter apply only to

the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in

respect of land in which minerals vest exclusively in

a person other than the Government. Therefore, mining

leases in respect of land where minerals vest in a

the   Union   of   India   in   the   Status   Report   dated

24.07.2018. Shri Gupta submits that approximate price

of coal is Rs.10,000/- per metric ton. Referring to

notice inviting tenders by the State of Meghalaya, it

is submitted that amount of Rs.1,000/- per metric ton

was contemplated. It is submitted that selling the

coal on much low price is causing loss to Revenue as

well as loss to other stakeholders. The allegations

have been by Shri Gupta that sale of coal at such low

price raises suspicion of under hand dealing. It is

submitted that legal position be laid down by this

Court and the orders of the NGT be upheld.

now claimed to be assessed is nothing but illegally

extracted coal. It is submitted that in pursuance of

several orders passed by NGT and this Court substantial

transportation of coal has been permitted, still the

enormous quantity of coal is claimed which is nothing

but an excuse to obtain an order of transportation of

such illegally mined coal. It is submitted that State

of Meghalaya is hand in glove with illegal miners.

Shri Gupta submits that the cost of winning coal by

rat hole mining is negligible and after payment of

royalty of Rs.675/- and Rs.485/- towards Meghalaya

Environment Protection and Restoration Fund i.e. total

payment of Rs.1160/-, the coal is transported. The

market price of the coal is approximately Rs.10,000/-

per metric ton. The claim of different applicants with

regard to unassessed coal is false. It is submitted

that all illegally mined coal should be vested in the

State and no permission of transport as prayed by the

different applicants be granted by this Court. Learned

senior advocate submits that all applications praying

for different directions deserve to be rejected.

   into the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam.
   The said river demarcates the Jaintia

   Project (KHEP) of NEEPCO (a Government
   of India undertaking)is one of the
   pioneering Hydro-Electric Project in the
   North Eastern Region of India. The Kopili
   Hydro-Electric Plant is a 275 MW
   storage     type    hydro    electric plant
   consisting of two dams which have
   created two reservoirs namely Kopili
   reservoir is used in the Khandong
   powerhouse through a 2759 metre tunnel
   to generate power. The tail water from
   this powerhouse is led to the Umrong
   reservoir is used in Kopili powerhouse
   through a 5473 metre tunnel to generate

   the Dima Hasao District (formerly known
   as North Cachar Hills District) of
   Assam, the catchment and reservoirs are
   spread in two states namely Meghalaya
   and Assam. It is further stated that
   the Kopili River and its tributaries
   feed water to the reservoirs of the project. The
   Kharkor is a major tributary of river Kopili
   and drains a vast area of Jaintia Hills
   Districts of Meghalaya. The Jaintia
   Hills being well known for coal mining
   areas is contributing acidic water in
   the form of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)
   to the river Kharkor through its
   different tributaries such as Urn Pai,

   etc. as these streams drain through
   the active and inactive coal mining
   areas of Jaintia Hills. The acidic
   water finally reaches to Khandong and
   Umrong reservoirs of KHEP. As a result,
   the water of the reservoirs has become
   highly acidic. The water pollution in
   streams of catchment area varies from
   brownish to reddish orange. The same
   polluted     water     through    various
   tributaries of rivers Kharkor and
   Kopili is perpetually reaching to the
   reservoirs of the KHEP. As a result, the
   water of reservoirs has become highly
   acidic. In recent years, it has been
   found that acidity of reservoir water
   is a major threat to equipments and
   machinery     due   to    corrosion/metal
   decay and erosion. Components such as
   cooling   water   header    pipe,   Bends,

“4.2.3   Coal Mining in Jaintia Hills

Extraction of coal has been taking place in
all three regions, however, 'major production
occurs in Jaintia Hills. The mining activity
in Jaintia Hills is a small scale venture
controlled by individuals who own the
land. Primitive mining method commonly
known    as   'rat-hole'    mining    is    in
practice in Meghalaya. In this method the land
is first cleared by cutting and removing the
ground vegetation and then digging pits
ranging from 5 to 100 m2 into the ground to
reach the coal seam. Thereafter, tunnels are
made into the seam sideways to extract the
coal which is brought into the pit by using
a conical basket or a wheel barrow
manually. Coal seams are reached            by
excavating the side edge of the hill slopes
and then coal is extracted through a
horizontal tunnel. The coal from the tunnel
or pit is taken out and dumped on nearby un-
mined area, from where it is carried to the
larger dumping places near highways for its
trade and transportation. Finally, the coal
is carried by trucks to the larger dumping
places near highways for its trade and
transportation. Entire road sides in and
around mining areas are used for piling of
coal which is a major source of air, water
and soil pollution. Off road movement of
trucks and other vehicles in the area
causes further damage to the ecology of the
area.

in the area, but simultaneously has led to
extensive environmental degradation and
erosion of traditional values in the
society. Environmental problems associated
with mining have been felt severely because
of the region's fragile ecosystems and
richness       of     biological        and      cultural
diversity.          The       indiscriminate             and
unscientific mining and absence of post-
mining treatment and management of mined
areas are making the fragile ecosystems more
vulnerable to environmental degradation and leading
to large scale land cover/land use changes.
The current modus operandi of surface
mining in the area generates huge quantity
of mine spoil or overburden (consolidated
and unconsolidated materials overlying the
coal seam) in the form of gravels, rocks,
sand, soil etc. which are dumped over a large
area adjacent to the mine pits. The dumping
of overburden and coal destroys the
surrounding vegetation and leads to severe
soil and water pollution. Large scale
denudation of forest cover, scarcity of
water, pollution of air, water and soil,
and degradation of agricultural lands are
some     of     the     conspicuous       environmental
implications of coal mining in Jaintia Hills.
Further, entire coal mining area of the
Jaintia Hills has become full of mine pits
and caves. These open, unfilled pits are
the places where surface water percolates
and disappears. As a result, smaller
streams and rivers of the area, which
served as life lines for the people, are
either completely disappearing from t he
f a c e o f t h e e a r t h o r b e co m i n g s e a s o na l
instead.         Consequently,         the     area       is
facing acute shortage of clean drinking
and irrigation water. Besides, a vast area
has become physically disfigured due to
haphazard dumping of overburden and mined
coal, and caving in of the ground and
subsidence of land.

Continuous discharge of Acid Mine Drainage
(AMD) and toxic chemicals from coal mines,
storage sites and exposed overburden have
polluted the river system of the area. Acidic
water on reaching to land and agricultural
fields   has    affected   the    traditional
agriculture and agricultural productivity
of the area (Das Gupta et al, 2002; Swer and
Singh, 2004)

"4.2.5 Degradation of Water Quality due to
Coal Mining
The water bodies of the area are the greatest victims
of the coal mining. The water bodies are badly
affected by contamination of Acid Mines
Drainage (AMD) originating from mines and
spoils, leaching of heavy metals, • organic
enrichment and silting by coal and sand
particles. Pollution of the safer is
evidenced by the colour of the water which
in most of the rivers and streams in the
mining area varies from brownish to
reddish orange. Low pH (between 2-3), high
conductivity,        high     concentration        of
sulphate, iron and toxic heavy metals, low
dissolved oxygen (DO) and high BOD are
some      of    the      physic-chemical         and
biological parameters which' characterize
the     degradation       of    water     quality.

</p>
<p id="p_155">The colour of the water in mining area
generally varies from brownish to reddish
orange. Siltation of coal particles,'
sand, soil etc. and contamination of AMD
and formation of iron hydroxide are some
of the major causes of change in water
colour. Formation of iron hydroxides [Fe
(CH) 31 is mainly responsible for orange or
red colour of water in the mining areas.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                                       70</span>


Iron hydroxide is a yellowish insoluble
material commonly formed in water bodies
of the coalfields. It is this material that
stains streams and responsible for red to
orange color of water. When elevated levels
of iron are introduced into natural waters,
the iron is oxidized and hydrolyzed,
thereby    forming   precipitate  of   iron
hydroxides.
</p>
<p id="p_156">The water in coal mining areas has been
found highly acidic. The pH of streams and
rivers varies between 2.31 to 4.01. Solids
such as fine particles of coal, sand, mud
and other mineral particles were found
deposited at the bottom of the water
bodies. Besides, water wa s also found
turbid    and   coloured  due   to  suspended
precipitates of iron hydroxides. D i s s o l v e d
oxygen was found to be low in water
bodies of coat mining areas, the lowest being
4.24 mg/L in river Rawaka and stream Metyngka
of Rymbai.

<p id="p_160">4.2.6 Causes of Deterioration of Water
Quality
Major causes of deterioration of water
quality, as evidenced by above observations are
AMD    discharge,    siltation     and    organic
enrichment. As in any other coal mining
area, Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is the main
source of water pollution in the coal
mining areas of Jaintia Hills. As discussed
in previous chapter, Amp is formed by a
series of complex geochemical and microbial
reactions that occur when water comes in
contact with pyrite (Iron sulfide) found in
coal and exposed rocks of overburden. Iron
sulfide in presence of oxygen, water and
bacteria forms sulphuric acid, is referred to as
AMD. In the process, iron hydroxide, a yellowish
orange   precipitate   is   also   formed.    The
prercipitate of iron hydroxide together with
other contaminants auses turbidity and
changes in colour of the water which reduces
the penetration of light and affects the
aquatic life. Extremely low pH conditions
in the water accelerate weathering and
dissolution of silicate and other rock
minerals, thereby causing the release of
other     elements     such     as    aluminium,
manganese, copper, cadmium etc. into the
water. Hence, water contaminated with AMD
is    often    coloured    and    turbid     with
suspended solids, highly acidic (low pH),
and    contains     high   concentration       of
dissolved metals and other elements. Most
of the streams and rivers of Jaintia Hills
in    coal   mining     areas    are    severely

  water has become highly acidic. The pH and
  other parameters of some AMD affected
  water bodies are summarized in Table 4.1.

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">     (i) The Meghalaya State Pollution Control
     Board in the month of September, 1997
     published a report entitled “ENVIRONMENTAL
     IMPACT OF COAL MINING IN JAINTIA HILLS
     DISTRICT”. The then Chairman of the said
     Board,   in   his   foreword,   has  admitted
     unplanned and unscientific coal mining
     activities in the State for more than hundred
     years, which achieved dangerous dimensions
     since last two decades and are creating
     ecological    disturbances     and   negative
     environmental impacts, to the extent that the
     very   existence   of   biological  life   is
     threatened in the coal mining areas of the
     State. It has also been admitted that no
     systematic efforts to study such impacts have
     so far been made by any institution. The then
     Member Secretary of the Board, in the
     preface, has projected the adverse impacts
     on the environment because of the coal mining
     activities. The pH level of in water almost
     all the rivers and streams was found to be
     below the required level. In some rivers and
     streams, the pH level was found to be as low
     as 2.4. The Meghalaya State Pollution Control
     Board, in the said report, has observed that
     the random discharge of AMD and acidic run
     offs from -40- the coal storage areas have
     also made the rivers, streams and even ground
     waters highly acidic. The ambient air quality
     of the coal mining and coal storage areas was
     also found to be degraded to certain extent.</blockquote><p id="p_168">

already    created     massive     ecological
disturbances and environmental degradation
because presently neither any pollution
control measures are adopted by the miners
nor any sincere efforts are made for
reclamation of the mine land”. In the said
report, the following recommendations were
made   to  minimize   the   overall   adverse
environmental   impacts    of   the    mining
activities:-
</p>
<p id="p_170">   (a) To generate social awareness among
   the public in general and the miners in
   particular     about      the     adverse
   environmental impacts and the health
   hazards associated with such unscientific
   and unplanned coal mining activities.

</p><p id="p_171">   (b) Preparation of the inventory of the
   mine owners, areas under mining and rate
   of land use change to get the first hand
   knowledge about the quantum of the
   efforts required for better management of
   these activities.
</p>
<p id="p_172">   (c) To enforce suitable legislations on
   the lines of the National Mineral Policy
   immediately for exploitation of coal in
   most sustainable manner.
</p>
<p id="p_173">   (d) To engage expert institution for
   finding out the most suited technologies
   for    the   coal    exploitation    with
   appropriate pollution control measures in
   order to ensure that the environment as a
   whole is not subjected to further
   degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_174">   (e) To engage the expert institution for
   finding out the suitable ways for
   rehabilitation of the mined land in phase
   manner so that the scarce land resources
   can be brought back to productive uses.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                                79</span>
</p><p id="p_175">   (f) To look for the alternative transport
   facilities    to     control    vehicular
   pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_176">   (g) To identify the suitable location for
   the storage of coal for sale with adequate
   facilities to treat dump run offs.
</p>
<p id="p_177">   (h) To study the aspect of the presence
   of trace elements in the surface and
   ground water because the low pH values
   increase the dissolution power of water.
   Large numbers of trace elements are
   always associated with the coal which
   gets dissolved in low pH waters. These
   trace elements are serious health hazards
   even in very low concentrations.
</p>
<p id="p_178">   (i) To introduce lucrative schemes for
   the aforestation in the most affected
   areas.
</p>
<p id="p_179">   (j) To develop the State Mineral Policy
   with   the   interaction  of   Government
   Agencies, Social Institutions, Local
   Elders and the Miners, keeping in view
   the specific land ownership system of the
   State.     Nothing    of     the    above
   recommendations have been implemented so
   far.
</p>
<p id="p_180">(ii) It is, therefore, evident that apart
from the water, air pollution, there is
degradation of surface land because of the
coal mining activities in the State of
Meghalaya. Despite publication of the said
report by the Meghalaya State Pollution
Control Board as back as in the year 1997,
no steps appeared to have been taken by any
authority to check the adverse environmental
affect and also to remedy the same.”

     and   specialised    statutory    bodies   and
     therefore did not deserve their appointment
     or nomination. While we fully commiserate
     with the NGT and share the pain and anguish,
     we are of the view that the Tribunal has, at
     law, exceeded its jurisdiction in directing
     the State Governments to reconsider the
     appointments and in laying down guidelines
     for appointment to the SPCBs, however well-
     meaning they might be. Therefore, we set
     aside the decision of the NGT, but note that
     a large number of disconcerting facts have
     been brought out in the judgment which need
     serious consideration by those in authority,
     particularly the State Governments that make
     appointments or nominations to the SPCBs.
     Such appointments should not be made casually
     or   without   due    application    of   mind
     considering   the   duties,    functions   and
     responsibilities of the SPCBs.”

failure   of    the   State   Government     to   appoint

professionals   and   experience   persons   to   the   key

positions in the State Pollution Control Board cannot

be classified as a primary dispute over which the NGT

could have jurisdiction. Following was laid down in

paragraph 21: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">     “21. As far as we are concerned, in the
     context of the Act, a dispute would be the
     assertion of a right or an interest or a claim
     met by contrary claims on the other side. In
     other words, the dispute must be one of
     substance and not of form and it appears to
     us that the appointments that we are
     concerned with are not “disputes” as such or
     even disputes for the purposes of the Act —
     they could be disputes for a constitutional
     court to resolve through a writ of quo
     warranto, but certainly not for the NGT to
     venture into. The failure of the State
     Government to appoint professional and
     experienced persons to key positions in the
     SPCBs or the failure to appoint any person
     at all might incidentally result in an
     ineffective implementation of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_83">Water Act</a>
     and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_84">Air Act</a>, but this cannot be
     classified as a primary dispute over which
     the NGT would have jurisdiction. Such a
     failure might be of a statutory obligation
     over which, in the present context and not
     universally, only a constitutional court
     would have jurisdiction and not a statutory
     body like the NGT. While we appreciate the
     anxiety of the NGT to preserve and protect
     the environment as a part of its statutory
     functions, we cannot extend these concepts
     to the extent of enabling the NGT to consider
     who should be appointed as a Chairperson or
     a member of any SPCB or who should not be so
     appointed.”

jurisdiction to entertain a particular cause is a

question which depends on the facts of each case. To

find    out   as   to   whether   NGT   has   jurisdiction   to

entertain a case, the case set up before the Tribunal

has to be looked into to answer the question. The

judgment of Techi Tagi Tara (supra) was on its own

facts and does not help the appellant in the present

case.

first of all, we need to notice the nature of land

Learned counsel for the parties are not at variance on

the question of nature of land tenure in the Hills

Districts of State of Meghalaya. By the North-Eastern
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                                                85</span>
<a href="/doc/318384/" id="a_87">Area Reorganisation Act</a>, 1971 the State of Meghalaya

was formed as independent full-fledged State. After

the enforcement of the Constitution the area, now

comprised in the State of Meghalaya, was included in

the State of Assam, the Administration and control of

which area was as per <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_88">Article 244</a> of the Constitution

of India read with Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.

In so far as the land tenure in the Hills Districts of

Meghalaya, there is no substantial change after the

advent of the Constitution. There was no payment system

of land revenue before the advent of the Constitution

in the Hills Districts of Meghalaya. Learned counsel

for the parties have referred to various materials

pertaining to the land tenure system prevalent in the

Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya. The lands in

the Khasi Hills District of Meghalaya come under two

divisions Ri Raid and Ri Kynti. Ri raid lands are

community lands which are set apart for the benefit

and   use   of   entire   community.   Ri     kynti   lands   are

privately    owned   lands   which     were    also   owned   by

community as well as by individuals. The owner of the

re kynti land is an absolute proprietor. The tenure

system in Jaintia Hills classified into two types of

lands, namely, Hali /irrigated land and High land.

Hali lands are further categorised in Raj land, service

land, village puja land and private land. Proprietary

right does not vest in the State in respect to majority

of lands which are either privately owned or owned by

the Tribal community. No system of payment of land

revenue is prevalent in the Hills District of Meghalaya

except lands which belong to State. For the purposes

of present case where the submission of the appellant

is that land in which mining operations of coal is

being done are lands belonging to Tribals who are

owners of the land as well as of the sub-soil, we

proceed with the assumption that Tribal is the owner

of the land. It is further the case of the appellant

that in Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya in land

which is privately owned by the Tribal or community

owned, the Tribals or the community or the clan are

owners of both surface right and sub-soil. It is the

case of the appellant that the State does not have any

right in sub-soil or minerals. The judgment of this in

of Mining and Geology and others</a>, 2013(9) SCC 725, is

relied on. This Court in the above case had occasion

to   consider   the   question   of   ownership   of   sub-

soil/mineral rights in reference to genmom lands in

Malabar area of the State of Madras. Holder of the

genmom rights also claimed not only as proprietor of

the soil but the owner of the minerals in the soil.

This Court laid down following in paragraph 58:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">     “58. For the abovementioned reasons, we are
     of the opinion that there is nothing in the
     law   which   declares   that    all  mineral
     wealth/subsoil rights vest in the State, on
     the    other   hand,    the    ownership   of
     subsoil/mineral   wealth    should   normally
     follow the ownership of the land, unless the
     owner of the land is deprived of the same by
     some valid process. In the instant appeals,
     no such deprivation is brought to our notice
     and therefore we hold that the appellants are
     the proprietors of the minerals obtaining in
     their lands. We make it clear that we are not
     making any declaration regarding their
     liability to pay royalty to the State as that
     issue stands referred to a larger Bench.”


</blockquote><p id="p_190">74. A Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/35662889/" id="a_90">Raja Anand

Brahma Shah vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh and others</a>,

AIR 1967 SC 1081, had laid down that prima facie owner

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                                     88</span>


reservation in the grant. In paragraph 13 following

has been laid down:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">     “13. In our opinion, a reading of the two
     sanads supports the case of the appellant
     that there is no reservation of mineral
     rights in favour of the Government. The
     expression used in the sanad of 1803 A.D. is
     “You ought to consider him the Raja of
     immovable jagir and of mahal and everything
     appertaining thereto belongs to him.” In
     effect, the grant to the Raja in the two
     sanads is a grant of the lands comprised in
     the   mahal    of   Agori   and    everything
     appertaining thereto and as a matter of
     construction the grant must be taken to be
     not only of the land but also of everything
     beneath or within the land. Prima facie the
     owner of a surface of the land is entitled
     ex jure to everything beneath the land and
     in the absence of any reservation in the
     grant minerals necessarily pass with the
     rights to the surface (Halsbury’s Laws of
     England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 26, p. 325). In other
     words, a transfer of the right to the surface
     conveys right to the minerals underneath
     unless there is an express or implied
     reservation   in   the  grant.   A   contract
     therefore to sell or grant a lease of land
     will generally include mines, quarries and
     minerals beneath or within it (Mitchell v.
     Mosley). It is manifest that when the sanad
     was executed in favour of the Raja the
     Government made over the land with all its
     capabilities to the Raja and merely imposed
     on him a fixed sum of revenue in lieu of all
     the rights the Government had as a proprietor
     of the soil. When neither of the parties knew
     undiscovered minerals underneath the land and
     the idea of reservation never entered their
     minds it cannot be held that there was any
     implied reservation in the grant. Nor can
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                                                          89</span>


     afterwards a distinction be drawn between the
     various rights that may exist on the land for
     the purpose of qualifying the original grant
     and importing into it what neither party
     could have imagined. It was argued on behalf
     of the respondents that the assessment was
     made on the agricultural income, but this
     circumstance cannot derogate from the rights
     conveyed to the Raja in the two sanads
     because no restriction was placed on the use
     of the land and the use by the Raja was not
     limited to agriculture.”


</blockquote><p id="p_191">75. Thus, looking to the nature of the land tenure as

applicable   in   the   Hills   Districts   of   State   of

Meghalaya, the most of the lands are either privately

or community owned in which State does not claim any

right. Thus, private owners of the land as well as

community owners have both the surface right as well

as sub-soil right. We are, thus, of the opinion that

Tribals owned the land and also owned the minerals,

which is an inescapable conclusion. We, thus, proceed

to examine the issues on the premise that in privately

owned land or community land minerals also vest in the

owner. We first need to consider as to whether the

provisions of MMRD Act, 1957 are applicable in the

Tribal area of Hills District of State of Meghalaya.

inapplicability of Act, 1957 with regard to the Hills

Districts of State of Meghalaya. At this juncture, we

may also notice the report of the Comptroller and

Auditor General of India for the year ended 31st March,

2013. In para 7.5.1 the report mentions:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                                          96</span>


     Meghalaya is endowed with sizeable deposits
     of valuable minerals like coal, limestone,
     uranium, granite and clay. Minerals being
     valuable resource, the extraction needs to
     be maximised through scientific methods of
     mining with aim to ensure extraction and
     utilisation of minerals. Besides, most of the
     mineral reserves are in areas which are under
     forest cover and hence, mining in the State
     has    environmental      implications.    In
     Meghalaya, individual and local communities
     have ownership over the land and the minerals
     and barring a few reserve forest areas, the
     State Government has no ownership over the
     minerals. The activities of the Mining &amp;
     Geology (M&amp;G) Department, Government of
     Meghalaya (GOM) are limited to collection of
     royalty on the minerals exported outside the
     State            besides           geological
     investigation/exploration of minerals. The
     Mines   and    Minerals    (Development   and
     <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_101">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 lays down the legal
     framework for regulation of mines and
     development   of    minerals.   The   Mineral
     Concession Rules, 1960 and the Mineral
     Conservation and Development Rules, 1988 were
     accordingly framed under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_102">MMDR Act</a> framed
     for conservation and systematic development
     of minerals and for regulating grant of
     permits, licences and leases. The GOM has
     introduced the Meghalaya Mineral Cess Act,
     1988 to mobilise additional revenue. Further
     with a view to facilitating systematic,
     scientific and planned utilisation of mineral
     resources and to streamline mineral based
     development of the State, the Meghalaya Mines
     and Mineral Policy, 2012 has also been
     notified with effect from 5 November 2012.”

State of Meghalaya.

the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, several statutory

obligations/jurisdictions have been conferred on the

State of Meghalaya, which shall be referred to later

in this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_208">
</p><p id="p_209">90. When under a Parliamentary enactment, State has

been given some statutory obligations, there is no

lack of jurisdiction in the State to frame policy to

give     effect    to    or   implement   the   jurisdictions

conferred on the State by Parliamentary enactments.

It is true that Mining Policy to be framed by the State

has to confine to the jurisdiction conferred on it as

per the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_110">MMDR Act</a>, 1957 and the Rules framed thereunder.

There are other related issues concerning Mining like

protection of environment and forests for which the

State has to declare its policy for implementation of

its objective.          Several other aspects relating to

mining     like,        rehabilitation,    reclamation   and

restoration have to be effectively implemented by the

State for which also, it may be required to frame a

policy.     We may further notice that Meghalaya Mines

and Minerals Policy, 2012 was already framed by the

State of Meghalaya, even before directions were issued

by the NGT.       In pursuance of NGT directions, it was

draft guidelines of 2015, which were prepared by State

of Meghalaya. We, thus, are of the view that direction

of   NGT   to   declare   Mining   Policy   by    the   State    of

Meghalaya cannot be said to be without jurisdiction.

However, the State in its Mining Policy can only

include those areas where it has jurisdiction under

the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_111">MMDR Act</a>, 1957 and the Rules framed thereunder.



</p><p id="p_210">91. A perusal of the entire Policy documents indicate

that Policy has been framed by the State as per the

Act, 1957 and Minerals (Concession) Rules, 1960.



</p><p id="p_211">92. The     Government    of   Meghalaya    has   also    made    a

request to the Government of India in the year 2015

Meghalaya from certain provisions of the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_112">MMDR Act</a>,

1957. After several deliberations, the Union of India

has communicated through its O.M. dated 12.03.2019

that it is not possible to accede to the request of

the   Government      of    Meghalaya     for     issuance    of

Presidential notification under Para 12A(b) of Sixth

Schedule. Thus, the request made by the State of

Meghalaya to issue exemption has not also been acceded

to.   The   request   of    the   State   of    Meghalaya    that

exemption    be   granted   by    Presidential    notification

under Para 12A(b) itself expresses recognition of the

State of Meghalaya that provisions of Act, 1957 are

applicable. We, thus, conclude that there is nothing

in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution which in any

manner exclude the applicability of Act, 1957 in the

Tribal areas of Hills District of State of Meghalaya.


Point No.3

</p><p id="p_212">93. We need to scan through the statutory scheme of

Act, 1957 to find out as to whether Parliamentary

minerals in so far as mining of coal from privately

Chapter V has a separate heading which is “Procedure

does not require any mining lease. The submission is

       of the land and the minerals below, or of the
       surface alone, or of the minerals alone. It
       has been said that a contract for the working
       and getting of minerals, although for
       convenience called a mining lease, is not in
       reality a lease at all in the sense in which
       one speaks of an agricultural lease, and that
       such a contract, properly considered, is
       really a sale of a portion of the land at a

</p><p id="p_244"> <a href="/doc/645212/" id="a_154">Section 105</a> of the Transfer of Property Act
       defines a lease of immovable property as a
       transfer of a right to enjoy such property
       made for a certain time, express or implied,
       or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price
       paid or promised, or of money, a share of

(Regulation &amp; <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_156">Development) Act</a>, 1957 affords
the guidance in this behalf. It says that the
holder of a mining lease or agent, etc. is
entitled to remove or consume the mineral.
It would mean destruction of the estate
leased out and appropriation thereof on
payment of consideration i.e. royalty.
Therefore, it is a right to enjoy immovable
property within the meaning of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_157">Section 105</a>
more so when, as in the instant case, it is
coupled with a right to be in occupation or
enter into possession for a specified period.
<a href="/doc/215365/" id="a_158">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act defines ‘mining
operations’ to mean any operation undertaken
for the purpose of winning any minerals. It
is true that no right, title or interest has
been created in the contractor over the
mining area. But he has been permitted to
remove and use the minor minerals in the
execution of the works as its (sic his) right
to enjoy immovable property spoken of in
<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_159">Section 105</a> which means the right to enjoy
the property in the manner in which that
property can be enjoyed. In Nageshwar Bux Roy
v. Bengal Coal Co.1 Lord Macmillan speaking
for the Board held that:
</p>
<p id="p_245">   “In considering the character and
   effect of acts of possession in the
   case of a mineral field, it is
   necessary to bear in mind the nature
   of the subject and the possession of
   which it is susceptible. Owing to the
   inaccessibility of minerals in the
   earth, it is not possible to take
   actual physical possession at once of
   a whole mineral field: it can be
   occupied   only  by   extracting  the
   minerals and until the whole minerals
   are exhausted the physical occupation
   must necessarily be partial.”

</p><p id="p_246">111.     The word mining lease has been given specific

meaning under Act, 1957. It is well settled principle

of   interpretation          that    the     provisions          of   an    Act

including definition of a term is to be interpreted in

a    manner    which        may   advance      the       object       of   the

legislation. The essential characteristic of mining

lease   is     that    it    is     granted       for    the     purpose     of

undertaking      mining       operation       and       mining    operation

means any operation undertaken for the purpose of

winning the mineral. Applying aforesaid definition in

the Minerals (Concession) Rules, 1960 under Chapter V

it cannot be said that no mining lease is contemplated

with respect to land where mineral vests exclusively

in a private person.

<p id="p_262">
</p><p id="p_263">123.      Chapter IV of the Mineral Concession Rules,

1960 deals with grant of mining leases in respect of

land in which the minerals vest in the Government and

Chapter    V   deals   with   procedure   for   obtaining    a

prospecting licence or mining lease in respect of land

in which the minerals vest in a person other than the

Government.       Chapter IV contains Rules 22 to 40 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">                                                        126</span>


Chapter V contains Rules 41 to 52 and the procedure and

manner of applying for mining lease and grant of lease

as contained in Chapter IV is not made applicable to

the procedure as given in Chapter V except that by

virtue of Rule 45(i) certain conditions of mining lease

as contained in Rule 27 under Chapter IV are made

applicable for mining lease under Chapter V.


</p><p id="p_264">124.      Rule 22(1) provides that an application for the

grant of a mining lease in respect of land in which the

minerals vest in the Government shall be made to the

State Government in Form I through such officer or

authority as the State Government may specify in this

behalf.    In Chapter V, there is no such rule, which

requires making an application for lease to the State

Government. There is a marked difference between the

rules contained in Chapter IV and rules contained in

Chapter V, few of which are relevant to notice for the

purposes of this case.       Rule 27(2) provides that a

mining lease may contain such other conditions as the

State Government may deem necessary in regard to the

matters    enumerated   therein.   Whereas   Rule   45(iii)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                                                     127</span>


provides that every mining lease may contain such other

conditions, not being inconsistent with the provisions

of the Act and these rules, as may be agreed upon

between the parties.    The above provision gives an

indication that in the lease executed by Chapter V, the

omission of word “State Government” in Rule 45(iii) is

indicative of the fact that conditions, which are to

be added has to be agreed upon between the parties.

Most important rule to be noticed is Rule 45 in this

context, which is to the following effect:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_109">     “45. Conditions of mining lease : - Every
     mining lease shall be subject to the
     following conditions :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_110">     (i) the provisions of clauses (b) to (l) and

       or commits a breach of any of the conditions
       of the lease, the lessor shall give notice
       to the lessee requiring him to pay the
       royalty or remedy the breach, as the case may
       be, within sixty days from the date of the
       receipt of the notice and if the royalty is

       time by giving not less than one year’s

</blockquote><p id="p_265">125.     It is provided in Rule 45(i) that in clauses

</p><p id="p_266">(c) and (d) of Rule 27 for the words “State Government”

the word “lessor” shall be substituted, which gives a

clear indication that State Government is not a lessor

in a lease granted under Chapter V.      Rule 27(5) and

Rule 45(iv) is also relevant to notice.       Rule 27(5)

provides as follows:-

       or remedy the breach, as the case may be,
       within sixty days from the date of the
       receipt of the notice and if the royalty or

       Government may, without prejudice to any
       other proceedings that may be taken against
       him, determine the lease and forfeit the
       whole or part of the security deposit.”


</blockquote><p id="p_267">126.        Under      Rule    27(5),     if   the    lessee   makes    any

default in the payment of the royalty or the payment

of dead rent or commits breach of any of the conditions,

the State Government shall give notice to the lessee

and determine the lease and forfeit the whole or part

of the security deposit.                  Whereas under rule 45(iv),

the said power has been vested in the lessor, which

also indicates that it is lessor, who will determine

the    lease      and    not    the       State   Government.         Other

provisions        of    Chapter       V    also    support     the    above

conclusion. Rule 47 provides for submission of copy of

licence or lease to the State Government within three

months      of    the    grant     of      such      licence   or    lease.

Requirement of submitting the licence or lease copy to

the State Government indicate that the State Government

is    not   the     authority,     who      is    granting     the   lease,

otherwise there was no requirement of submitting a copy

to the State Government, if it was contemplated that

State Government shall grant the lease.                        Rule 63 in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">                                                                   130</span>


Chapter    V     provides     that   previous     approval    of   the

Central     Government        to   be   obtained    through    State

Government, which is to the following effect:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_118">        “63. Previous approval of the Central
        Government to be obtained through State
        Government:- Where in any case previous
        approval of the Central Government is
        required under the Act or these rules, the
        application for such approval shall be made
        to the Central Government through the State
        Government .”


</blockquote><p id="p_268">127.      Our above conclusion is reinforced when we look

into the statutory regime regarding grant of mining

lease as per the Mineral Concession Rules, which were

in force prior to enforcement of Mineral Concession

Rules, 1960.          Prior to <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_190">MMDR Act</a>, 1957, earlier Central

Legislation which was governing the field was Mines and

Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_191">Development) Act</a>, 1948, under

which rules have been framed by Central Government

namely, Mineral Concession Rules, 1949.                  Rule 14 of

Chapter III contemplated application for prospecting

license.        Chapter IV of the Rules, 1949 contained the

heading “grant of Mining Lease in respect of land in

which     the     minerals     belong    to   Government”.         The

provisions       of    Rule   27   of   Chapter    IV   provide    for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">                                                         131</span>


application for mining lease and there were several

other rules under Chapter IV, which in substance have

been retained in Chapter IV of Rules, 1960.       Chapter V

of Rules, 1949 contained the heading “grant of mineral

concessions by private persons.”        As noted above, the

heading of Chapter V under Rules, 1960 is “procedure

for obtaining a prospecting licence or mining lease in

respect of land in which the minerals vest in a person

other than the Government.”      Rule 47 of Chapter V of

Rules, 1949 provide for “conditions in a mining lease”,

which are in substance similar as Rule 45 of Rules,

1960.      Rule 47(iv) of the Rules, 1949 was akin to

present Rule 45(i) of the Rules, 1960.       Rule 47(iv) of

the Rules, 1949 is as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_269">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_119">         “47. Conditions of mining lease : - A mining

the mining lease granted by private persons, i.e., the

category where the minerals were not owned by the

Government but was owned by private persons.                  Chapter

V of the Rules, 1960 contains substantially similar

provisions.    Thus, Chapter V of Rules, 1960 has to be

treated to be dealing with minerals owned by private

owners.      The   earlier    statutory      regime,    which     was

enforced as per Rules, 1949 made it amply clear that

mineral    concessions     are   to    be   granted    by     private

persons    also,   which    is   in    substances     retained     in

Chapter V of Rules, 1960.             Thus, mining lease to be

granted as per Chapter V of Rules, 1960 is mining lease

by the owner of mineral and similar concept has to be

borrowed and read in Chapter V as noted above.                Absence

of any procedure to make an application for mining

lease to the State Government in Chapter V of the Rules,

1960 and lessor being the private persons and not the

State     Government,      clearly     indicates       that     State

Government is not to grant the lease in respect of land

of privately owned/community owned owners.

owners of minerals, no authority is empowered to grant

any mining lease with regard to minerals, of which he

is the owner, it is the owner of the minerals may be

provisions contained in Rules, 1960 especially Chapter

V, a mining lease for minerals, which belongs to a

private owner or a community owner, it is not the State

Government,        which        is   entitled       to     receive     any

application or grant any mining lease, but it is the

private owner or community owner, who is entitled to

grant a lease for mining minerals owned by them.                     Issue

No.4 is answered accordingly.

</p><p id="p_274">131.      Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel

appearing for the State of Meghalaya has submitted that

State of Meghalaya has no control over the mining of

the coal by owners of the minerals since it is the

owners, who have right to carry on mining, which has

been traditionally going on in the State of Meghalaya

for last several decades.           To find out as to whether

State of Meghalaya has any statutory control over the

mining operations in State of Meghalaya, which is going

on for last several decades, we have to examine the

statutory provisions governing the field.

Act,    1957     and   Mineral    Concession   Rules,   1960   are

Meghalaya.       We, in the present case, are concerned with

the mining of coal, which is a major mineral as per the

Act, 1957 and Mineral Concession Rules, 1960.            Rule 42

of     Chapter    V    of   the   Rules,   1960   provides     for

restrictions on the grant of prospecting licence and

mandatory before grant of mining lease of coal.         Rule

63 provides that the approval of the Central Government

has to be obtained through the State Government.       Thus,

the State Government has to be aware that any previous

approval of the Central Government for mining coal has

been     obtained   or   not.    Thus,   restriction   being

statutory and without any exception State Government

cannot say that it has no role to play with regard to

mining of coal.     All applications for previous approval

of Central Government has to be routed through State

Government.   There are other rules in Chapter V itself,

which provides for control of the State government in

the mining of coal.     Rule 50 empowers the provision for

prohibition    of    working   of   mines   by   the   State

Government, which is to the following effect:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_130">       “50. Prohibition of working of mines:- If the
       State Government has reason to believe that

with the approval of the Central Government to direct

the parties concerned not       to undertake     any mining

operations of coal are being conducted without prior

approval of Central Government, State is not powerless

to direct the parties not to undertake any prospective

mining operations in the area.       The power given under

Rule 50 is not only enabling power, but is a statutory

obligation on the State to exercise the power in the

public interest.      Rule 51 requires a mining lease to

furnish   to   the   State   Government   such   returns   and

statements as may be prescribed.      Rule 52 provides for

penalty, which is to the following effect:-

District of State of Meghalaya is unacceptable and not

in a good spirit. Our country being governed by the

Constitution of India all the States are to implement

<a href="/doc/51092038/" id="a_195">Parliamentary Act</a>s in true spirit and in the present

case the State having been advised time and again by

Comptroller and Auditor General and being well aware

of its statutory obligation as noticed above it comes

ill from the State to contend before this Court that

there is no requirement of mining lease for winning the

minerals. The above stand of the State taken before

this   Court    gives     the   impression   that     instead    of

implementing        the    Parliamentary          enactment     and

regulatory regime for mineral regulation some vested

interests wants      to continue the illegal           regime of

illegal mining to the benefit of the few persons which

is unacceptable and condemnable. We, thus, conclude

that the State of Meghalaya has jurisdiction and power

to ensure that no mining of coal should take place

except   when   a    mining     lease   granted    under   Mineral

Concession Rules, 1960, Chapter V, as discussed above.

Point No.6

</p><p id="p_282">138.      One more point which needs to be considered is

as to whether power to allot land for mining purpose

is     vested     in     Autonomous      District        Council?     The

submission on behalf of one of the Autonomous District

Council which is the appellant before us as well as on

behalf    of     State    of   Meghalaya      is   that     Autonomous

District        Council     being       constitutional       authority

constituted under Schedule VI of the Constitution has

legislative       and    administrative       power.     Reference    to

various    legislation         framed    by   Autonomous      District

Council which received the assent of the Governor has

also been relied on. Para 3 of Schedule VI enumerates

the power of District Council and regional council to

make laws which we have extracted above.



</p><p id="p_283">139.      Certain legislation framed by District Council

has also been referred namely the Khasi Hills District

1959, all framed in exercise of power under para 3 of

Sixth Schedule. The power to make law entrusted to

Autonomous District Council under para 3 of Schedule

VI is power to make law referable to List 2 and List 3

of the Seventh Schedule. We have already noticed above

that with regard to regulation and development of

mineral, the Union has made declaration by <a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_196">Section 2</a>

of 1957 Act and the power of the State Legislature is

denuded in that respect. The logical corollary of the

above principle is that power of Autonomous District

Council shall also be denuded in so far as regulation

and development of minerals to the extent which is

covered by 1957 Act. We may refer to one Rule 4 of

United Khasi Jaintia Hills District (Trading by non

Tribals) Rules,1959, which contemplates form of licence

and one of the licence referred to is under Rule 4 is

licence in Form E. Rule 4 is as follows:

Jaintia Hills District (Trading by Non-Tribal) Rules,

1959   has      been   repealed   insofar   as   Jaintia   Hills

Districts are concerned by the Jaintia Hills Autonomous

have been placed before us repealing the Rules, 1959.

In Regulations, 2011, one aspect needs to be noted in

<a href="/doc/1588675/" id="a_198">Section    2</a>,    which   is   definition    clause.   By   clause

Regulations are only with respect to the “trade” as

defined in 2(viii).           The entire Regulations do not

refer to any kind of trade in mining of coal or mining

operations.     Thus, the Regulations, 2011 have nothing

to do with the mining of coal.

<p id="p_288">
</p><p id="p_289">142.     Constitutional provisions of Schedule VI are

also   relevant   to     be    noticed.    Paragraph    9   of    the

purpose of prospecting for, or extraction of, minerals.

minerals granted by government of the State. Schedule

VI which constitute the District Councils and Regional

Councils enumerates their powers.          Para 9 refers to

licences or leases for extraction of minerals granted

by the Government of the State. Para 9 only deals with

share of the royalties to District Councils as agreed

upon   between   the   Government   of   the   State   and   the

District Councils. Further paragraph 12(A)(a) itself

contemplates that any law made by District Council or

Regional Council which is repugnant to any law of the

State shall be void. Thus, the status of law made by

District Council or Regional councils has to give way

to the law made by the State. There can be no doubt

that District Council and Regional Council cannot make

       regulated. This aspect is recognised by the
       concepts of “sustainable development”. It is
       equally well settled by the decision of this
       Court in Narmada Bachao Andolan Vs. Union of
       India that environment has different facets
       and care of the environment is an ongoing
       process.   These   concepts  rule   out   the

       as it would depend on the facts of each case
       whether diversion in a given case should be
       permitted or not, barring “no go” areas
       (whose identification would again depend on
       undertaking of due diligence exercise). In
       such cases, the margin of appreciation

record has issued the order dated 17.04.2014 which

cannot be faulted in the facts and materials which are

on record in the present case. One more fact in the

above context need to be noticed i.e. after the order

dated    17.04.2014,   several   applicants   including     the

appellants    of   Civil   Appeal   No.5272   of   2016   filed

application for vacating the ban which was not acceded

to by the Tribunal. Subsequently the NGT permitted

transportation of coal till 15.05.2016 and directed

that after 15.05.2016, all coal within the State of

Meghalaya shall vest in the State.

<p id="p_300">150.      The tribunal after considering all pleas and

withdraw the ban. We do not find any error in the order

of NGT reaffirming its ban order in the facts of the

present case. But the question which has been raised

by the appellant before this Court is that whether the

complete ban as imposed by the NGT deserves to be

vacated or modified in the interest of the State and

tribals. The revenue earned by the State from coal

mining plays substantial part in the economy of the

State. It is also amply demonstrated from the record

that tribals are the owners of the land who carry on

mining of coal in their land by which they earn their

substantial livelihood.

<p id="p_301">

the mining is being carried out by the tribals cannot

be approved which is clearly in violation of statutory

regime under 1957 Act and 1960 Rules but in event the

mining is carried out by tribals or their assignees as

per the provisions of 1957 Act and 1960 Rules, there

can be no objections in carrying such mining under the

regulation and control of State of Meghalaya. We thus

clarify that in event mining operations are undertaken

by the tribals or other owners of hills districts of

Meghalaya in accordance with mining lease obtained from

the State of Meghalaya as per 1957 Act and Mineral

Concessions Rule, 1960, the ban order dated 17.04.2014

of the tribunal shall not come in its way of carrying

mining operations. The ban order is for the illegal

coal mining which was rampant in the State of Meghalaya

and the ban order cannot be extended to valid and legal

mining as per 1957 Act and 1960 Rules.

purposes. The Constitution of which committees are

investigation    and   report   by    experts    are   necessary

requirement in appropriate cases to come to correct

and environment. We do not, thus, find any dearth of

jurisdiction in the NGT to appoint a committee to

submit a report. We may further say that while asking

four corners of Rule 10A rather its jurisdiction is not

     enabling the Courts will readily infer a duty

there is no lack of jurisdiction in the NGT to direct

for appointment of committee or to obtain a report from

a committee in given facts of the case.

has    been   constituted   by   the   Tribunal,   namely,

“Meghalaya    Environment   Protection   and   Restoration

Fund”, it is useful to notice the observation of the

Tribunal in its order dated March 25, 2015 by which the

said Fund was created. The reasons for constitution of

Fund are self-explanatory which are to the following

effect:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_159">       “It is also undisputable that there has been
       huge environmental degradation and pollution
       of the waterbody in the State of Meghalaya,
       because of this illegal, unscientific mining.
       No one has even thought of restoration of the
       area in question, to bring to some 16 extent,
       if not completely, restoration of ecology and
       environment in question. Serious steps are
       required to be taken for cleaning polluted
       waterbodies and ensure that no further
       pollution is caused by this activity and the
       activity which would be permitted to be
       carried on finally including transportation
       of coal. On the basis of `Polluter Pay
       Principle’.   We   direct   that  the   State
       Government shall in addition to the royalty
       payable to it, shall also collect 10% on the
       market   value   of   the  coal   for   every
       consignment. Having heard the learned Counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_161">                                                       161</span>


       appearing for the parties and keeping in view
       the notifications of the Central Government
       dated 10.05.2012 and that of the State
       Government dated 22.06.2012, we may notice
       that in the report of Comptroller and Auditor
       General of India for the period ending 31st
       March, 2013 under 7.5.18 of Chapter 7 of
       which the invoice value of the coal has been
       taken Rs. 4850/- per metric tonne. Thus, we
       direct that the State Government shall in
       addition to the royalty payable to it, also
       collect 10% of the said market value of the
       coal per metric tonne from each person. The
       amount so collected shall be deposited in the
       account   to   be    titled   as   ‘Meghalaya
       Environment Protection and Restoration Fund’
       to be maintained by the State under the
       direct control of the Chief Secretary of the
       State of Meghalaya.

       restoration of environment and for necessary
       remedial and preventive measures in regard

</blockquote><p id="p_329">163.     As noticed above the NGT could have passed any

order or direction to secure ends of justice which

power especially conferred by Rule 24 as noticed above,

direction to constitute Fund is thus also saved under

such power.

(1)    NGT   by    constituting        committees        has   delegated

essential judicial power to the committee; (2) the

Constitution            of       committees         encroaches       the

constitutional scheme of administration of Tribal areas

Constitution.

committees.       The        various   instances     where     the    NGT

directed for report or investigation and submission of

report by committees were with the object of ensuring

the implementation of the orders passed by it and to

decide the environmental issues raised before it. In

no manner constitution of committee can be said to be

delegation of essential judicial powers of the NGT to

the committee.

<p id="p_333">166.      Now, we come to the Katakey committee which was

constituted        by    the      Tribunal     on    31.08.2018.       In

paragraphs 14 and 15, the Tribunal while directing for

</blockquote><p id="p_334">167.      The   Constitution    of   the   committee    and   its

functions entrusted were with the object to implement

the orders passed by the Tribunal. The Tribunal has

already    directed    for    preparing    a   scheme   for   the

restoration     of    the    environment   and   ecology.     The

environment and ecology restoration plan was submitted

before the Tribunal along with the affidavit dated

03.10.2017 as has been noticed in the order dated

02.01.2018 of the NGT. In the constitution of Katakey

committee, thus, it cannot           be said that essential

judicial functions were delegated to the committee by

the Tribunal. For the restoration of environment NGT

vide    its   order    dated    31.08.2018    has   directed      the

committee to submit its action plan and reports by e-

mail. The Tribunal, thus, had kept complete control on

all steps which were required to be taken by the

committee and issued directions from time to time. We,

thus, do not accept the submission of the appellant

that the essential judicial powers of the NGT had been

delegated to the committee. Looking to the enormous

work of restoration of environment which has to be

supervised on the spot the committee was constituted.

We,    however,   observe      that   the   State   is   always    at

liberty to obtain particular direction if aggrieved by

any act of the committee. The matter being pending

before the Tribunal of acts of the committee are under

direct control of the Tribunal and if the committee

oversteps in any direction the same can very well be

corrected by the Tribunal on the matter being brought

before it.

constitution      of     the     committee      encroaches        the

constitutional scheme of the Tribal areas. We revert

back to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Para 3

of the Sixth Schedule enumerates the powers of the

District Council and Regional Council to make laws.

The powers of the District and Regional Councils are

enumerated under paragraph 3. In the directions of the

Tribunal to constitute committee for transportation of

extracted minerals or for preparing time bound action

to deal with the restoration of environment and to

ensure its implementation, there is no interference in

the powers of the District or Regional Councils. Action

plan for restoration of environment is consequence of

Tribunal finding out that an unregulated coal mining

has damaged environment and has caused the pollution

including      water   pollution.         It   is   not    case      of   the

appellant that District and Regional Councils have

framed any law for restoration of environment which is

being    breached      by   the    committee        or    its   acts.     The

District and Regional Councils are free to exercise all

their powers        and the committee constituted by the

Tribunal       is   only    concerned     with      the    Environmental

degradation and illegal coal mining. The committees’

submitted       that       restoration        of    environment      requires

carrying out various projects and unless the State

provides        for     necessary            fund   and    finances,      the

restoration           of     damaged          environment       cannot     be

undertaken.           It is further submitted that State had

great hardship to the State of Meghalaya.             Ends of

justice be served in modifying the direction of NGT

to transfer an amount of Rs.100 Crores from the amount

lying in the MEPRF to the Central Pollution Control

Board.   The Central Pollution Control Board as directed

by the Tribunal (NGT) shall utilise the              aforesaid

could not have directed for vesting of coal in the

State. The submission is that members of the appellant-

association have proprietary rights in the coal with

which they could not be divested by the Tribunal. We

have already held that private owners of the land are

also owners of the minerals and the minerals belong to

the owners/Tribals. We have also found that coal mining

was illegally going on unregulated by any statutory law

in the Hills District of State of Meghalaya without

there being any mining lease. The entire mining was,

thus, is clear in contravention of <a href="/doc/749104/" id="a_233">Section 4(1)</a> of Act,

present is not a case where any kind of penalty has

been imposed on the miners except that the amount of

royalty as payable on mining of coal is being collected

by the State as penalty. It is true that the State

Government has power under <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_241">Section 21(5)</a> to recover

from such person the minerals so raised, or, where such

material    has    already   been   disposed   of,      the   price

State Government to exercise its power under <a href="/doc/60667211/" id="a_242">Section

the technical committees have submitted that it is

difficult to define with certainty that which coal was

mined prior to ban in 2014 and mined after 2014.                From

the above it is clear that the State Government itself

has come with a case that huge quantity of coal in the

four hills districts, which has been extracted is lying

waiting for orders of transportation.             Learned Amicus

Curiae and Shri Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior counsel

effort to stop the illegal mining, in spite of the ban

of   17.04.2014,    illegal        mining   of   coal   has     been

permitted and now such illegal mined coal has also been

assessed   and     State   also      supports    the    claim    of

transportation of the applicants on the guise that coal

lying in open is an environmental hazard.

meagre   price,    whereas     market    rate     of   the    coal    is

approximately Rs.10,000/- per MT.           In the present case,

we have noticed that illegal coal mining is going on

in spite of ban by NGT by its order dated 17.04.2014.

The Katakey committee report has also opined that all

the extracted coal lying in different districts is a

coal,    which    has   been     illegally      mined     after      the

imposition of ban by the order dated 17.04.2014.                     All

coals    being    illegally     mined,   the      State      is    fully

entitled to impose a penalty, i.e., to realise the

major mineral and useful for different industries and

also of a paramount importance.

     obligation to ensure clean environment to all

     its     citizens.     In        cases    pertaining   to

     facilitator and not as obstructionist.
