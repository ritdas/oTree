JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)



     The applicant is a resident of Delhi and claims that he has a

serious interest in environmental issues. It is stated by the

applicant   that   he     gives   due   importance    to   environmental

conservation and safety as it has an ultimate impact on the health

and safety of human beings, flora and fauna. The Environmental

Clearance (for short the 'EC') is granted for the purposes of due

protection of ecology, environment and public health and its

violation adversely affect either or all of them. Being affected by the

flagrant violations of the laws/EC by Respondent No.9, the

applicant   has    been     compelled    to   approach     the   Tribunal.

Respondent No.1, Ministry of Environment and Forests (for short

the 'MoEF'), is the nodal agency in the administrative structure of

the Central Government for planning, promotion, co-ordination and

over-seeing implementation of the country's environmental and

forestry policies and programmes. One of the primary concerns of

the MoEF are implementation of policies and programmes relating

 to conservation of the country's natural resources and while doing

so, it is guided by the principles of sustainable development and

enhancement of      human-well-being.      The      other   respondents,

including Respondent No.2, being a statutory body, is entrusted

with    the   implementation   of   environmental    laws    and   rules,

Respondent No.3, being a Board, is entrusted with the powers and

functions under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (for short the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>'); along with other responsibilities

under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short the

'<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment Act</a>'), Respondents No.4 and 5 are the executive

authorities of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi,

concerned with environment, housing and urban development. The

other respondents (Respondents No.6-8) are also executive or

statutory authorities who are responsible for carrying out various

duties and functions, as contemplated under different laws

including issuance of occupancy certificates, fire clearances and

other matters incidental thereto.

</p><p id="p_41">3.   Based upon this EIA Report and examining the various

factors, Respondent No.1, vide letter dated 27th November, 2006,

granted EC to Respondent No.9 with requisite specific and general

conditions for both the phases - construction and operation.


</p><p id="p_42">     As is evident from the above chart, the permissible area in

sq.m. was 72,660 and Respondent No.9 intended to construct

72615.9 sq.m. while providing car parking space for 1772 cars.

Some of the relevant conditions of the EC, reference to which would

be necessary for deciding the issues before us, read as under:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "(a)The installation of the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP)

         (Protection)  Act,    1986,    to   ensure     effective
         implementation of the suggested safeguard measures in

</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">4.   Reference to the above EIA Report, Occupancy Certificate,

Completion Drawing Site Plan and the Area Details, clearly shows

that these documents do not contemplate lower ground floor,

ground floor and upper ground floor. In the project, only ground

floor has been projected. According to the applicant, the comparison

of actual usage against the building plan and occupancy certificate

is significant i.e. nearly 24,691.974 sq.m. is being illegally misused

by Respondent No.9. Respondent No.9 is stated to have set up

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                      8</span>
 shops in the basements and multi-level blocks meant for parking.

The construction has been changed and it has been shown as lower

ground floor, upper ground floor, ground floor, etc., which is not so

prescribed either in the plans or the occupancy certificate. As per

the 'Mall Information' available on the website of Respondent No.9,

the area is shown to have been divided into LG, UG, FF, SF, TF.

This is a clever attempt to hide the fact inasmuch as Basement-1

and Multi-level Block (2P) are being used for commercial operations

as against the building plan sanctioned for parking. It is further

averred by the applicant that the unauthorised construction of

dozens of shops in the basement, ground floor and first floor of the

multi-level parking is a violation of the EC granted and the building

plans and is a fundamental change in the parameters on the basis

of which the EC was granted. The terms of the EC clearly provide

that the MoEF could add conditions as additional safeguards,

measures, etc. subsequently, if it was so found necessary, as there

has to be an effective implementation of the EC granted under the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">5.   The space meant for parking along with various unauthorised

constructions has been put to commercial use and Respondents

No.10 to 17 are some of the parties who are operating big show

rooms and shops in the non-permissible area in the Mall, and

particularly the underground basement 2P Block, which is

exclusively meant for parking. The above unauthorised and illegal

acts and deeds of the said respondents are in violation of the

conditions of the EC, contrary to EIA Report; violative of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                    9</span>
 sanctioned plans and are in turn hazardous to environment in

various respects. On account of drastic changes in construction

and breach of the EC, safety norms and parameters for public

health have completely changed. Respondent No.9 has committed

serious breach of conditions of the EC and has thereby created

environmental hazards for local population. It is the specifically

pleaded case of the applicant that on account of significant change

in commercial area by approximately 59%, the EC has become bad.

The parameters of population per sq.ft. have drastically been

changed. The population per sq.ft. has a direct impact on the area

in terms of water utilisation, sewage disposal, density of population,

standards of STP requirements and public amenities and facilities

with reference to parking area. This also drastically affects the

public health. The illegal extraction of underground water will

adversely affect the ground water level and other environmental

factors. According to the applicant, there is a clear violation of the

EC, Master Plan of Delhi (MPD) Regulations, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment Act</a> and

Rules made thereunder, Environmental Clearance Regulations,

2006 (for short the 'Notification of 2006'), <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_7">Water Cess Act</a>, 1977,

is a gross misuse of law and the complaint made by the applicant is

with regard to violation of building bye laws for using more space

for commercial activities than allowed under the then Floor Area

Ratio (FAR). Respondent No.9 has even challenged the jurisdiction

of the Tribunal on the plea that it does not fall within the subjects

which can be entertained by the Tribunal. According to this

respondent, the applicant has not raised any substantial question

relating to environment or with regard to the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a>

or any of the other Acts as specified in Schedule I to the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_13">National

Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 (for short the 'NGT Act').


</p><p id="p_47">7.    On merits, it is submitted that Respondent No.9 purchased

the plot in question measuring about 33,415 sq.m. in a public

auction held on 5th December, 2003 by the Delhi Development

Authority (for short the    'DDA'). The lease deed was executed in

favour of Respondent No.9 on 27.4.2004. The plot was even

converted from leasehold to freehold by the DDA and a conveyance

deed was entered into between Respondent No.9 and the DDA on

15th June, 2010. According to the Master Plan, 2001, an FAR of 100

was   permissible   for    commercial   development   in   the   non-

hierarchical commercial centres. When the Master Plan-2021 came

into force, an FAR of 125 was allowed for commercial development

in non-hierarchical commercial spaces, then the said respondent

was allowed an FAR of 125 on 7th February, 2007. Thus, the

answering respondent (Respondent No.9) became entitled to an

additional FAR of 10,500 sq.m. calculated @ 25% of the original

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                   11</span>
 FAR of 42,000 sq.m. Vide letter dated 11th August, 2010,

Respondent No.9 applied to the Dy. Director (CL), DDA, for

increasing the FAR in the Ambience Mall by 25% and thus, the said

respondent was entitled to increase the FAR in accordance with the

MPD-2021. The DDA can, it is stated, even grant the additional FAR

out of the utilised additional FAR of the entire District Centre and

open spaces as per its policy. Respondent No.9 has not committed

any breach of the EIA Report or the EC granted by the competent

authority. Para 5 of the EC letter dated 27th November, 2006 thus

stipulates that the project would require a fresh approval from the

MoEF in case of any change in the scope of the project. Since there

was no change in the scope of the project, Respondent No.9 did not

move the MoEF for any fresh look at the EC. It is stated that the

nomenclature of lower ground floor, ground floor or upper ground

floor has nothing to do with the EC or the building bye laws. It is

only for the purpose of convenience that such nomenclature is

provided. Respondents No.10 to 12 and 14 are using 10,190 sq.m.

of covered area in the basement, ground floor and first floor of Block

2(P), which is to be counted towards the additional FAR permissible

to Respondent No.9 under the MPD 2021. It is denied that an area

of 24,691.974 is being misused. It is also denied by Respondent

No.9 that the use of various portions of the Mall for commercial

purposes earlier earmarked for parking is in violation or defiance of

the EIA Report or the building plan or that the EC has become void

ab initio.

</p><p id="p_49"> 8.   Respondent No.9 has filed an additional affidavit on 2nd

September, 2013. In this affidavit, the said respondent, with some

elucidation, stated the historical background of his acquiring the

property in question, the delay in the project, other difficulties

caused by public authorities and pendency of cases before Supreme

Court of India and finally the implications and difficulties being

faced by the said respondent. According to Respondent No.9, the

Mall is a part of the entire project of 92 ha of the constraint area

and it was one of the projects of the DDA, which commenced in

1982. Then the DDA made allotments for different purposes and

plans were sanctioned on 28th February, 2005. It was stipulated

that the EC would be taken before issuance of the completion

certificate. The constraint area of the project was a buildable area in

December, 2003 when there was no requirement of any EC

clearance from the MoEF. According to Respondent No.9, the

Notification became applicable from 7th July, 2004. The balance

land of 2.3 ha was ordered to be restored to its timed glory. The

plots were auctioned by the DDA on 15th December, 2003 after

submission and consideration of the EIA Report by EPCA.

Respondent No.9 was entitled to use the additional FAR area in the

building. According to this respondent, the cost of the project was

Rs.643 crores but by the time the project got completed in August,

2009, the cost of the project increased to Rs.1,251 crores and

Respondent No.9 took Rs.1,193 crores from public sector banks

and financial institutions against mortgage of shops of the Mall at

the site in question. About 20.74 crores per month is being paid


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                     13</span>
 towards interest and instalment (EMI) and the present outstanding

in the loan accounts of public sector banks and financial

institutions is Rs.907 crores. As a result of the closure of the outlets

in the basement and underground floors, due to the order of the

Tribunal dated 12th July, 2013, revenue from the Mall has fallen

from Rs.12.00 crores to Rs.10.70 crores per month and thus, the

shortfall has also increased to Rs.10.04 crores per month from the

earlier shortfall of Rs.8.74 crores. On this premise, Respondent

No.9 prays for dismissal of the application.


</p><p id="p_50">9.   On behalf of the DDA, Respondent No.7, a detailed reply-

affidavit has been filed. In the reply, it has been stated that the

contention of Respondent No.9 regarding the provision of additional

FAR of 125 under MPD 2021 for commercial centres has been

answered as per Table 5.4 of MPD 2021 mentioning that the FAR

permissible for community centres/non-hierarchical commercial

centres stands increased from 100 to 125. This entry requires that

a maximum of 10% of additional ground coverage shall be allowed

for providing atrium. There is no restriction on height, as per Table

5.4, subject to clearance from AAI, Delhi Fire Service and other

statutory bodies. The enhancement in FAR, if approved by the

competent authorities, will be subject to charging appropriate levies

from the beneficiaries. The property in question was a plot of

33,415 sq.m. and the permissible built up area was 42,000 sq.m.

Respondent No.9 had requested for additional FAR in the existing

structure and the said request for additional FAR is not for

redevelopment of the said plot. Since Respondent No.9 purchased

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                      14</span>
 the plot in auction along with control conditions, any additional

FAR other than the permissible limit of 42,000 sq.m. of floor area

cannot be allowed in this case on the existing structure. The policy

decision for providing additional FAR in cases of redevelopment of

commercial areas was under consideration of the DDA but nothing

on already built up and approved plots can be permitted unless a

policy is formulated and approved.

<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">10. In this affidavit, it is also stated that in compliance with the

order of the Tribunal dated 29th August, 2013 and 5th September,

2013, inspection of the premises was carried out. It was noticed

that the upper ground floor was being used for commercial

purposes in addition to 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors for the same purposes.

Basement I and Basement II in Block 2 was being used for parking,

but vide order dated 12th July, 2013, the Tribunal had prohibited

the use of lower ground floor for commercial purposes as opposed

to parking and other purposes. In Block 2P, 1st floor was being used

for commercial purposes, upper ground floor was also being used

for commercial purposes, lower ground floor was locked, and upper

ground floor was required to be used for parking purposes.

However, Basement I and Basement II were being used for parking

purposes. There was misuse of the premises and it was duly

detected and identified by the officers of the Land Disposal

Department who attended the inspection and the misuse was

detected in relation to lower ground floor, ground level in Block 2,

which was locked. 1st floor of Block 2P was also locked. Basement II

as such.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">11. In the affidavit dated 12th July, 2013, the DDA has

categorically stated that the inspections have confirmed that the

basement of the aforesaid premises are being misused for running

of shops including Big Bazar instead of parking. Vide letter dated

10th May, 2013, received from M/s Ambience Developers Pvt. Ltd.,

misuse of the aforesaid premises has been admitted and it has been

requested to allow additional FAR as per the MPD 2021 and the

request was being examined as to whether the same could be

allowed by the competent authority. There were unauthorised

constructions and in so far as unauthorised shops under the

Basement are concerned, the same would be looked into by the

South Delhi Municipal Corporation. It is averred that it is not

disputed that neither EIA Report nor occupancy certificate nor

completion drawings contemplate a lower ground floor or an upper

ground floor and there is only one ground floor, which is provided.

As regards two level blocks i.e. Block 2P, it is submitted that the

same was to be used exclusively for parking. Vide letter dated 9th

September, 2004, the DDA had granted approval for construction of

third level basement, equal to the area of second lower basement

i.e. 29,875 sq.m. and the basement was to be used exclusively for

parking purposes. The height of each basement floor was to be four

metres (maximum level). The basement parking area could not be

used for parking of buses, trucks, etc. Height of the entry and the

exit points may be restricted accordingly.

</p><p id="p_56"> 12. It is evident from the above that the DDA, in its reply, has

pointed out that no permission for additional FAR had been granted

even till date. There was unauthorised construction, misuse of

space and violation of statutory provision in relation to the space

meant exclusively for parking purposes.

issued a notice dated 31st May, 2005 to M/s Ambience Mall, who

submitted their reply dated 5th July, 2005. They were permitted to

use each floor as per the sanctioned building plans. According to

this plan, second lower basement and first lower basement were to

be used for parking/services. The entire ground level and first floor

of Parking Block were also to be used for parking.

project in question is covered under Item No.8 (a) &amp; (b) of Schedule

to the Notification of 2006, as amended in December, 2009.

Category 'B' projects are projects appraised by the State Level

Expert Appraisal Committee (for short the 'SEAC') and approved by

the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (for

short the 'SEIAA). SEAC will appraise projects where the built up

area is more than 20,000 sq.m. and less than 1,50,000 sq.m. in the

case of Building and Construction projects. As the SEIAA was not in

place at the relevant time, the EC had been granted by Respondent

No.1, MoEF. Since SEIAA has now been constituted and is

functional, they are expected to deal with the matter and examine

the   violations   committed,   if   any.    It   is   stated   that   the

basement/multi-level blocks are meant for parking, as per the

building plan. The alleged use of basement and the multi-level

blocks for commercial operations would be in violation of various

building permission rules, laws and guidelines and in breach of the

EC granted to Respondent No.9, thereby creating environmental

hazards for the local population. The further stand of Respondent

No.1 is that there is a clear violation of Conditions (vii) and (viii) of

the EC.
</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">17. It is stated that the Expert Appraisal Committee, after due

consideration of the relevant documents submitted by the project

proponent and additional clarifications furnished in response to the

observations, which included EIA, had granted the EC. Condition

 from the roads adjoining the proposed project site must be avoided.

Parking should be fully internalised and no public space should be

utilised. The Condition No.(v) under Part B - General Conditions -

specifically provides that in case of any change in the scope of the

project, the project would require a fresh appraisal by MoEF. In

view of the apparent facts, the project proponent has violated both

these conditions.

</p><p id="p_70">18. Respondent No.3 (Central Ground Water Authority) has

submitted that it deals with carrying out scientific study and

analysis for efficient management of underground water resources

and acts as the regulator for management of ground water. In terms

of the reply of this respondent, Central Ground Water Authority has

declared the South and South-west Districts of Delhi, vide public

notice No.6/2000 dated 15th August, 2000 as critical and notified

areas and has already issued directions to all the ground water

users in the areas as well as to the Deputy Commissioners

concerned for the purpose of management and regulation of the

ground water in the said areas. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi,

has issued an order dated 18th May, 2010, stating that no person,

group, authority, association or institution is allowed to draw

ground water by tube-well or bore-well without prior permission of

the   designated    authority   i.e.   Delhi   Jal   Board.   In   these

circumstances, it was contended that the excessive use of

underground water without leave of the competent authority would

be adversely affecting the underground water level.

Officer, Delhi, in his reply, is that vide letter dated 20th December,

2004, the case was recommended for approval and the building was

inspected by the officers of the Department on 24th November,

2008. Having been satisfied with the available fire prevention and

protection measures, a No Objection Certificate was issued on 28th

November, 2008 in favour of Respondent No.9. Subsequent to the

enactment of the Delhi Fire Service Act, 2007 and Rules, 2010, the

frequency for renewal of the NOC was made mandatory for the first

time after every three years for commercial buildings. On the

request of M/s Ambience Mall and as per the provisions of the Delhi

Fire Service Act, 2007 and the Rules, 2010, the premises were re-

inspected on 1st April, 2013 and certain shortcomings were

observed, and therefore, the NOC was not considered.

respective pleadings, now we may also usefully refer to the fact that

their respective replies to the application. Primarily, they also

objected to the maintainability of the application and jurisdiction of

the Tribunal to entertain such applications on merits. All these

respondents (No.10-17) stated that they were bona fide occupants

of the areas in question and had entered into agreements with

Respondent No.9. Respondent No.9 had declared to them that these

areas could be legally used for the purposes of commercial activity.

According to them, they have not committed any breach of the

terms and conditions of the lease and for that matter of the law in

force and as such no adverse orders could be passed against them.


</p><p id="p_82">23. Respondent No.9 has also filed rejoinder to the replies filed by

different parties and has primarily reiterated the stand noticed by

us above and further averred that they have not violated any

conditions or bye laws in force. However, they have not disclosed

before the Tribunal if they have got the NOC from the Fire

Department, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and other

public authorities. They have also not disclosed that they have been

served with a notice by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and

other authorities in relation to putting up of partitions, using

the following questions arise for determination before the Tribunal:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     (i)     Whether the present application is maintainable and

             discloses a cause of action and whether the Tribunal has

             the jurisdiction to decide such question within the

             purview of the provisions of the NGT Act, 2010.

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">     (ii)    Whether    the   application   is   barred   by   limitation

             Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">     (iv)    What relief is the applicant entitled to?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_84">25. Since the question of maintainability of the present application

goes to the very root of the matter before the Tribunal and relates to

its jurisdiction, we must thus proceed to deliberate upon this issue

in the first instance. This contention on behalf of the respondents is

two-fold.     Firstly, the application does not give any facts or

constitute a cause of action for raising a civil case of substantial

question relating to environment and it does not arise out of the

implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I to the

NGT Act. Secondly, Respondent No.9 has used the spaces meant for

parking for commercial purposes in view of its entitlement to

enhance the FAR under the MPD 2021. It is a question relating to

building bye laws and is not connected with any environmental

issues. The Tribunal, thus, cannot entertain such an application.

to exercise its jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary

state of facts exist. On finding that the jurisdiction does exist, the

Tribunal will proceed further or do something more. The Tribunal

has been given jurisdiction by the legislature to decide the matters

in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Tribunal has a

limited jurisdiction. Where the Tribunal derives its power from the

statute that creates it and that statute also defines the conditions

under which the Tribunal can function, then it goes without saying

that before assuming jurisdiction in the matter, it must satisfy that

the conditions requisite for its acquiring seisin of that matter.

what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly. Statutory

exercise of power stands on a different footing than the exercise of

powers on judicial review. On the other hand, the contention of

the applicant is that Respondent No.9 has not only committed

violation of the bye laws but has also violated the conditions of the

EC and the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_19">Air Act</a> besides

 dated 27th November, 2006 is the EIA Report submitted by

Respondent No.9, and as such, it cannot violate the said report

without specific permission being granted by the authorities

concerned, and particularly re-examination of the EC granted by

the MoEF. Violation of the terms and conditions of the EC has

given rise to substantial question relating to environment. The

petitioner has stated facts and grounds to show that the petition

raises substantial question relating to environment. Thus, the

present application is maintainable and the Tribunal             has

jurisdiction to decide the issue at hand. In this backdrop, let us

now look into the scope of jurisdiction of this Tribunal in terms of

the provisions, objects and reasons of the NGT Act. The NGT Act

was enacted to provide for establishment of "National Green

Tribunal" for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to

environmental protection and conservation of forests and other

natural resources including enforcement of any legal right relating

to environment and giving relief and compensation for damages to

persons and property and for matters connected therewith or

incidental thereto. Clause 7(e) of the Statement of Objects and

Reasons provides a bird's eye view of the intent of the legislature

to give jurisdiction to the Tribunal. The risk to human health and

environment is a matter of concern for all. Keeping in view the

increased litigation in the field of environment, wide jurisdiction

was intended to be vested in the Tribunal.         Right to healthy

environment has been considered as a part of the right to life

under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India by the Supreme


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                        26</span>
 Court. Every citizen has a right to a clean and decent

environment, free of pollution of any kind. The expression

'environment' includes water, air and land and the inter-

relationship which exists among and between water, air, land and

human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro-organism and

property.   'Substantial   question   relating   to   environment'   is

explained in Section 2(m) of the NGT Act. We must clearly

understand that any damage to public health resulting from

environmental degradation will also be a substantial question

relating to environment.
</p>
<p id="p_88">
</p><p id="p_89">28. Under the provisions of the NGT Act, the Tribunal has been

vested with different jurisdictions. Further, it has a much wider

jurisdiction in terms of Section 14 of the NGT Act, whereunder it

can deal with and decide all civil cases where a substantial

question relating to environment (including enforcement of any

legal right relating to environment) is involved and it arises in

regard to implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule

I to the NGT Act. The Tribunal is also vested with the power to

order relief to the victims of pollution and restitution of property

damaged or restitution of the environmental damage for such

areas. Besides this general jurisdiction of a wide magnitude,

specific appellate jurisdiction is vested in the Tribunal in terms of

Section 16 of the NGT Act where the orders referred to under

clauses (a) to (j) of <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_21">Section 16</a> are appealable before the Tribunal.

Tribunal, are stated under Section 18 of the NGT Act. Thus,

 different jurisdictions spread across Sections 14, 15 and 16 of the

NGT Act can be invoked by a person who falls within the ambit of

Section 18(2) of the NGT Act. The right to appeal in terms of

Section 16 of the NGT Act is available to any person aggrieved. An

objective analysis of these provisions of the NGT Act shows that

wide original and specific appellate jurisdiction is vested in the

Tribunal in terms of Sections 14 to 16 of the NGT Act.


</p><p id="p_90">29. We may refer to a recent judgment of the Tribunal in the

case of Goa Foundation v. Union of India [ALL (I) NGT REPORTER

(NEW DELHI) 2013(1) Part 5 Page 234], where the Bench of the

Tribunal discussed the preamble and objects of the NGT Act.

Referring to the scope of jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Tribunal

held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_91">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">     "17.        To analyse the above rival contentions, we must
     examine the interpretation and impact of the relevant
     provisions and the scheme of the NGT Act. The NGT Act
     was enacted to provide for establishment of the Tribunal
     for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to
     environmental protection and conservation of forests and
     other natural resources including enforcement of any legal
     right relating to environment and giving relief and
     compensation for damages to persons and property and
     for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The
     very Preamble of this Act is a sufficient indicator of the
     jurisdiction that was to be vested in the Tribunal. The
     issue    relating   to    environmental    protection    and
     conservation was one of the paramount pillars, amongst
     others, of the adjudicatory process by the Tribunal. It was
     expected to dispose of cases relating to above matters
     expeditiously. This is the first indicator of the legislative
     intent which provides that a case could relate to
     environmental protection, conservation of forests and
     other natural resources or even enforcement of legal rights
     relating to environment and other matters mentioned
     thereto. This jurisdiction of the Tribunal and access to the
     people stands further expanded by the use of the words
     'for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto'. The
     legislature in its wisdom has used these two expressions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                       28</span>
 which can only be construed liberally and to provide
greater dimension to the mode of access to a person
claiming redress of his grievances as well as adjudication
by the Tribunal.
</blockquote><p id="p_92">18. Preamble is a relevant part of the Act, which can
help in the process of interpretation. It, in fact, is a kind of
guide to the spirit of the statute. Justice G.P. Singh in
"Principles of Statutory Interpretation", 13th ed. 2012,
referring to the significance of interpretation of preamble,
has stated as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">     "The preamble of a statute like the long title is a part
     of the act and is an admissible aid to construction.
     Although not an enacting part, the preamble is
     expected to express the scope, object and purpose of
     the Act more comprehensively than the long title. It
     may recite the ground and cause of making the
     statute, the evils sought to be remedied or the doubts
     which may be intended to be settled. In the words of
     SIR JOHN NICHOLL: ' It is to the preamble more
     specially that we are to look for the reason or spirit of
     every statute, rehearsing this, as it ordinarily does,
     the evils sought to be remedied or the doubts
     purported to be removed by the statute, and so
     evidencing, in the best and most satisfactory manner,
     the object or intention of the Legislature in making or
     passing the statute itself'. As enunciated by TINDAL
     C. J., in delivering the opinion of the judges who
     advised the House of Lords in Sussex Peerage case: 'If
     any doubt arise from the terms employed by the
     Legislature, it has always been held a safe means of
     collecting the intention to call in aid the ground and
     cause of making the statute, and to have recourse to
     the preamble, which according to CHIEF JUSTICE
     DYER is a key to open the minds of the makers of the
     Act and the mischiefs which they intended to
     redress'. The subject has been explained lucidly in a
     more recent decision of the House of Lords. The
     decision establishes the following propositions: the
     preamble being a part of the statute and be read
     along with other portions of the Act to find out the
     meaning of words in the enacting provisions as also
     to decide whether they are clear or ambiguous; the
     preamble in itself is not an enacting provision and is
     not of the same weight as an aid to construction of a
     section of the Act as are other relevant enacting
     words to be found elsewhere in the Act; the utility of
     preamble diminishes on a conclusion as to clarity of
     enacting provisions. The Supreme Court recently
     approvingly quoted these propositions."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                   29</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">            19. The Preamble may not strictly be an instrument
           for controlling or restricting the provisions of a
           statute but it certainly acts as a precept to gather the
           legislative intention and how the object of the Act can
           be achieved. It is an instrument that helps in giving a
           prudent legislative interpretation to a provision.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">            In light of this language of the Preamble of the NGT
      Act, now let us refer to some of the relevant provisions.
      Section 14 of the NGT Act outlines the jurisdiction that is
      vested in the Tribunal. In terms of this Section, the
      Tribunal will have jurisdiction over all civil cases where a
      substantial question relating to environment arises. The
      Tribunal will also have jurisdiction where a person
      approaches the Tribunal for enforcement of any legal right
      relating to environment. Of course, in either of these
      events, a substantial question arises out of the
      implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I
      to the NGT Act. Section 15 of the NGT Act provides for
      awarding of relief and compensation to the victims of
      pollution and other environmental damage, restitution of
      property damaged and restitution of the environment for
      such area(s) as the Tribunal may think fit, in addition to
      the provisions of <a href="/doc/31992/" id="a_22">Section 14(2)</a> supra. <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_23">Section 16</a> provides
      for the orders, decisions or directions that are appealable
      before the Tribunal. Any person aggrieved has the right to
      appeal against such order, decision or direction, as the
      case may be. This Tribunal, thus, has original as well as
      appellate jurisdiction. This wide jurisdiction is expected to
      be exercised by the Tribunal in relation to substantial
      question relating to environment or where enforcement of
      a legal right relating to environment is the foundation of
      an application. In terms of Section 14(2) of the NGT Act,
      the Tribunal shall hear disputes relating to the above
      matters and settle such disputes and pass orders
      thereupon."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_93">30.   The proposition of law stated by the Supreme Court in the

cases relied upon by the respondents can hardly be disputed. The

Tribunal has to exercise its jurisdiction within the four corners of

the statute that created it. The Tribunal must satisfy itself as to the

essential and pre-existing facts of the case in relation to its

jurisdiction. Once a person brings his case relating to substantial

question relating to environment and it arises from implementation


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                                      30</span>
 of the enactments stated in Schedule I to the NGT Act and the

application is filed within the limitation period, the Tribunal will

have to exercise its jurisdiction and pass appropriate orders as

contemplated under the provisions of the NGT Act.


</p><p id="p_94">31.    In the present application, the applicant has not invoked the

provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act. It is not filed in appeal

challenging the legality or correctness of any of the orders. On the

contrary, the applicant has generally raised a substantial question

relating to environment and has prayed for revocation of the

consent granted to the Respondent No.9 under different laws. The

applicant has further prayed that damage to environment and

hazards to public health are likely to arise from the breach of the

EC by Respondent No.9 and that the Tribunal should pass

appropriate orders for which complete facts have been stated in the

application.
</p>
<p id="p_95">
</p><p id="p_96">32.    Therefore, we must examine as to what is the case made out

by the applicant in his application. There is no dispute to the fact

that EC was granted by Respondent No.1 to the applicant on 27th

November, 2006 on the basis of the EIA Report submitted by

Respondent No.9. Let us see what was stated by the applicant in

the EIA Report for grant of EC. In the EIA Report, the project

proponent, Respondent No.9, has stated that the site for the

shopping mall encompasses about 33,415 sq.m. of land. The

proposed ground floor area including atrium area is 12,599.8 sq.m.

The total covered area of all the floors is 41,960.19 sq.m. excluding

parking and service area in basement and multi-level car parking

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                   31</span>
 area. It was stated by the project proponent that basements were to

be used for parking and services and the multi-level block, ground

floor, first floor, second floor and third floor were to be used for

commercial shopping, food court, restaurant, cinema, etc. It was

also stated that parking for 1772 vehicles would be provided in

three successive basements, ground floor and first floor of the

multi-level car block. Similar statement was made under the head

'Project Description'. These declarations were reiterated under the

head 'Project Infrastructure and Utilities' (para 2.2.3 of the report).


</p><p id="p_97">33.    The EIA Report, which was submitted by the applicant, upon

engaging the services of M/s SENES Consultants India Private

Limited, also dealt with the air and noise environment. While

dealing with the ambient air quality, it refers to the data for the year

2002-04 with historical air quality in New Delhi. The assessment of

ambient air quality was accomplished by obtaining site specific

historical data from the National Air Monitoring Programme of

Central Pollution Control Board. Since the proposed site has no

pollution intensive activities in its vicinity, five sampling stations

located within two kilometres radius of the site were considered

adequate to provide the surrounding baseline air quality. Similarly,

National Ambient Noise Quality Standards were kept in mind while

dealing with the noise pollution arising from the project in question.

The attributable factors like ambient air quality, noise levels, water

quality,   ground    water    availability,   soil   quality,   biological

environment, land use and socio-economic factors, were the very

basis of base-line environmental status in terms of the report. While

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                          32</span>
 referring to the land use in the attributable factors, as noticed

above, it was stated that the total covered area of the entire floor is

41,960.19 sq.m. excluding parking and service area in the

basement and multi-level car parking area. In other words, these

were the basic essential features of the EIA Report, which formed

the very crux for grant of EC to the project proponent. Paragraph 7

of the Notification of 2006 deals with the Stages in the Prior

Environmental Clearance Process for New Projects. Stage (2) under

this paragraph deals with scoping. Scoping refers to the process by

which the Expert Appraisal Committee or the State level Appraisal

Committee,    as   the   case   may    be,   determines   detailed   and

comprehensive Terms of Reference (for short the 'TOR'). TOR are

expected to deal with all matters of environmental impact. In

response to the TOR and after complying with the prescribed

procedure, the project proponent is expected to submit an EIA

Report, which then is considered by the competent authority.

Subsequently,      the    Expert      Appraisal   Committee      makes

recommendations for acceptance or rejection of the proposal put

forward by the project proponent on the basis of which the

competent authority grants the EC.

</p><p id="p_101">35.      A bare reading of the above clause shows that the area

proposed in the building for basement and other services would

qualify as built-up area or covered area for the purposes of

determining the grant of EC to the project proponent. The built up

or the covered area which is considered for the purpose of grant or

refusal of EC includes the area of basement as well as other

services. Thus, the area and its user, as disclosed by the project

proponent, is the very foundation for consideration of its application

for grant of EC.
</p>
<p id="p_102">36.      Now we have to examine the conditions of the EC with

relation to the project in question. As already noticed, the EC dated

27th November, 2006, while considering all the relevant documents

including the EIA Report, imposed various conditions.                            The green

belt design along the periphery of the plot was prescribed to achieve

attenuation factor, conforming to the day and night noise standards

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                                             34</span>
 prescribed for commercial land use. Traffic congestion near the

entry and exit points from the road adjoining the proposed project

site had to be avoided. Parking was to be fully internalized and no

public space ought to have been used for that purpose. The solid

waste generated was expected to be properly collected and

segregated for disposal to the city municipal facility. The project

proponent was required to install sewage treatment plant (STP)

before the project was commissioned for operation. In other words,

the conditions of the EC granted to the project proponent had taken

all aspects relating to environment vis-à-vis use of the total built up

area including basement into consideration. All these factors are

variable by increase, particularly changes in utilization of space,

population, vehicular traffic and congestion on road due to

unauthorized parking leading to increased air pollution. It was

primarily for these reasons that certain General Conditions were

provided in the EC granted to the project proponent. It was

specifically stated that in case of any change in the scope of the

project, the project would require a fresh appraisal by the Ministry.

</p><p id="p_103">37.   The EC is accorded for the project in its composite form.

Every ingredient or facet of the project is an integral matter for

consideration by the competent authority. It cannot be said that the

EC relates to a particular component of the project while other

components are outside the ambit of such clearance. This is the

precise reason that a specific condition, as mentioned above, was

imposed in the EC that in the event of change in the scope of the

project, the project would require fresh appraisal by the Ministry.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                                    35</span>
 The expression 'scope of the project' is very wide in its application

and is incapable of being given a narrow construction. 'Scope'

means the extent of the area or subject matter that something deals

with or to which it is relevant; a purpose, end or intention (Oxford

Dictionary of English, 3rd ed.). Thus, 'scope' cannot be construed in

a limited sense but would provide a wider connotation in relation to

the project which is under consideration of the authorities. The

scope would relate to all facets of the project including construction,

utilization of space, user of space, matters relating to provision of

services, STP etc. The obvious consequence of any change would be

fresh appraisal by the competent authority. The matters relating to

various clearances like building bye laws, fire safety certificate,

clearance by the Municipal Corporation for amenities and services

and environmental clearance, are inter-connected, indivisible and

interlinked. That is the precise reason as to why the DDA made the

sanction of the plans of Respondent No.9 subject to granting of EC

by the competent authority. But for the EC, the project could not

have even taken off.
</p>
<p id="p_104">38.   The FAR, construction and user of the space are parts of the

building plans and are equally essential considerations for EC,

being specific stipulations of EIA Report. Any alteration, much less

substantial alterations, in all these facets would require fresh

EC/appraisal by the competent authority. Such an approach is

further substantiated by the preamble of the Notification of 2006

 requiring fresh EC. Thus, it can safely be concluded that any

change, much less a major change, in floor area utilization or the

space for purposes other than those specified, which result in

change in the prescribed norms, would have to be considered as a

change in the scope of the project, thus calling for fresh appraisal of

the project by the competent authority.
</p>
<p id="p_105">39.   Now, we may deal with the contention of Respondent No.9

that there was a change in the FAR from 100 in the MPD 2001 to

125 in the MPD 2021.         As a result of this statutory change,

Respondent No.9 was entitled to use the increased FAR in the

basement, other parking and service areas for commercial purposes.

Consequently, Respondent No.9 had applied to the DDA for

permission to make such change in user of the space. This

argument of Respondent No.9 need not detain us any further in

view of the clear stand taken by the DDA that they have not granted

any such permission for change in use. In fact, the DDA has even

gone to the extent of stating on affidavit that permission for the

increased FAR had been requested by Respondent No.9 in the

existing structure and the said request for additional FAR was not

for redevelopment of the said plot. Since Respondent No.9 had

purchased the plot along with all control conditions, any additional

FAR other than the permissible limit i.e. 42,000 sq.m. floor area,

cannot be allowed in this case at the existing structure.

</p><p id="p_106">40.   The DDA has also stated that the FAR of 125 in MPD 2021 is

applicable only for non-hierarchical commercial centres. Besides

this, all other public authorities appearing before us i.e. MCD and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                     37</span>
 Fire Department, have also taken the stand that they had not

granted either any fire clearance or permission to use the area for

commercial purposes. The Fire Department has not renewed its

permission since 2011, while the MCD has issued a notice to

Respondent No.9 for violation and use of these areas for commercial

purposes in terms of Section 345A of the Delhi Municipal

Corporation Act, 1957. Not only this, even the DPCC has not

granted its consent and the CWGA has also not accorded its

approval for extraction of the underground water on account of the

increased capacity and utilization.
</p>
<p id="p_107">41.   The MoEF has also taken a definite stand that the alleged use

of basement and multi-level block for commercial operations is in

violation of the various building guidelines and absolute breach of

the EC granted to the project proponent. The emphasis of these

authorities/Corporations    is   on   the   violation   committed   by

Respondent No.9 and they not having accorded their respective

consent/approval for change of user, particularly keeping its impact

in mind.
</p>
<p id="p_108">42.   We may also notice that besides this being an actionable

wrong in terms of the provisions of the NGT Act, all other authorities

would be free to take action, as they may deem fit and proper in the

circumstances of the case and law in force in their respective fields.

The Tribunal is not concerned with the violation of other laws and

has to deal with the present application within the scope of

environmental jurisprudence. The averment of the applicant that

Respondent No.9 has violated the laws in force, and particularly the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                    38</span>
 terms and conditions of the EC order dated 27th November, 2006

with impunity, is duly substantiated on record.

</p><p id="p_109">43.   The cumulative effect of this is that Respondent No.9 ought

not to have converted the user of basement and the exclusive

multiple parking block for commercial activities contrary to the EIA

Report on the basis of which EC was obtained. This is a clear

breach of the terms of the EC. In fact, the action of Respondent No.9

suffers from dual infirmity. On the one hand, the said respondent

changed the use of the parking and service area for commercial

activities and on the other, it did not even bother to seek

consent/approval or permission of the competent authorities. It was

absolutely incumbent upon Respondent No.9 to apply for fresh

appraisal of the EC in terms of General Condition No. (v) of the EC

order dated 27th November, 2006. The EC was granted under the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_24">Environment Act</a> and the Notification of 2006.

Violation thereof would be a dispute relating to environmental

issues in terms of Schedule I to the NGT Act. This is definitely an

application raising a substantial question relating to environment

and the enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act.

Resultantly, we reject the contention raised on behalf of Respondent

No.1 and hold that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain and

decide the issues raised in this application.

</p><p id="p_110">44. 'Misuser' simplicitor in relation to the sanctioned plan may

invoke the jurisdiction of the Delhi Development Authority but

 EC granted under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_25">Environment Act</a>, then it

certainly would be a matter raising environmental issues.


</p><p id="p_111">45. Another argument has been raised to support the above

contention that no specific allegations have been made or facts

disclosed which would bring the petition squarely within the ambit

of Section 14 of the NGT Act. On the conjoint reading of various

paragraphs of the application, particularly paragraphs (vi), (xiii),

(xviii), (xxii) and the grounds dealing with the factual aspects,

particularly grounds (D) to (G), (K) and (R) it is clear that all these

are matters primarily raising an issue with regard to violation of

conditions of EC granted to Respondent No.9 and its adverse and

hazardous effects on the environment. Based upon these factual

averments and the grounds taken, the applicant has prayed for

revocation of the EC granted to Respondent No. 9 and the

corresponding permissions granted under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_27">Air

Act</a>. It is one thing to challenge the grant of EC on the ground that

for the reasons and grounds taken up by an applicant the EC ought

not to have been granted and therefore, is liable to be revoked or

cancelled; but it is certainly another thing to say that there is

violation of the terms and conditions of the EC and because of such

violation, the EC is liable to be revoked without challenging the

grant of EC per se. The present case falls in the second category.

The application has to be read in its entirety and along with the

documents which have been annexed by the applicant. Upon their

cumulative reading, it is established on record that the applicant

has raised a substantial question relating to environment arising

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                     40</span>
 from the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I

of the NGT Act. The language of Section 14 of the NGT Act is wide

enough to take within its ambit a petition of the present kind.


</p><p id="p_112">46. We must also clarify at this stage that different regulatory

regimes can simultaneously be applicable to a given situation. It

will be more so when both the regulatory regimes operate in

different fields and have distinct essentials as well as consequences.

The present case is an apt example of this kind. The building bye-

laws would govern buildings and its user while the EC would

regulate the project as a whole in relation to the various facets of

environment and its impact thereof. Both are regulatory regimes

but they operate in distinct and incongruent fields which have no

area of conflict.       One operates exclusively in the field of

environment, i.e. to be in consonance with the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_28">Environment Act</a> and the Notification of 2006, while the other, is

the DDA Act and the zonal plan which is to govern the planned

development and restrictions on buildings in terms of area and

user.   The contention of Respondent No.9 that it is a matter

exclusively falling in the domain of building bye-laws and this

Tribunal has no jurisdiction, is therefore, misconceived and ill-

founded. The project as a whole has various dimensions under the

environmental    laws    and   the   regulatory   regime   prescribed

thereunder.   The violation of the terms and conditions of such

statutory regulatory regime would invite consequences and would

have to be applied with all its rigours in the interest of the

environment and public health.

</p><p id="p_114"> 47. A half-hearted attempt was made on behalf of Respondent

No.9 to bring in the doctrine of double jeopardy and, therefore, to

avoid the present action. Firstly, the doctrine of double jeopardy

has no application in the facts and circumstances of the present

case but even if for the sake of arguments this contention is

considered on its face value, then it is a settled law that same facts

may give rise to different prosecutions and punishments and in

such an event the protection afforded by <a href="/doc/17858/" id="a_29">Article 20(2)</a> of the

Constitution of India is not available. This is the view that has been

consistently taken by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as

the courts in the United States. The test of identity of offences is

whether the same evidence is required to sustain them, if not, then

the fact that both parties relate to and create out of one transaction

would not make a single offence where two are defined by the

Statute.   An act defined as a crime by both national and state

sovereignty is an offence against the peace and dignity of both and

may be punished by each. To put it simply, one set of facts may

constitute an offence under two different statutes with two different

consequences.     Reference in this regard can be made to the

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of

<a href="/doc/1104661/" id="a_30">Monica Bedi v.   State of A.P</a>. [(2011)1 SCC 284] and also to the

judgment of the US Supreme Court in the case of T.W. Morgan v.

matters thereto, now we would examine the plea of limitation taken

up by the respondents.

<p id="p_116"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                    42</span>
</p><p id="p_117"> 49.     An applicant is entitled to invoke jurisdiction of the Tribunal

under Sections 14, 15 and 16 of the NGT Act. All these three

Sections provide for different limitations. In terms of Section 14(3)

of the NGT Act, the application has to be filed within six months

from the date on which the cause of action for such dispute first

arose. However, the proviso to Section 14(3) of the NGT Act permits

an application to be entertained beyond the period of six months

but within a further period not exceeding sixty days, provided the

applicant shows that he was prevented, for sufficient cause, from

filing the application within the said period. In other words, an

application under Section 14 of the NGT Act would be barred and

the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction even to condone the delay if

the application is filed beyond the time frame of six months + 60

days.    Section 15 of the NGT Act deals with the powers of the

Tribunal to grant relief and compensation to the victims of pollution

and other environmental damage arising under the enactments

specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act, for restitution of property

damaged and for restitution of environment for such area(s), as the

Tribunal may think fit. In terms of Section 15(3) of the NGT Act,

such application must be filed within a period of five years from the

date on which the cause of action for such compensation or relief

first arose. The proviso to Section 15(3) of the NGT Act empowers

the Tribunal to entertain such application beyond this period, but

not exceeding sixty days thereafter, if sufficient cause is shown.

Section 16 of the NGT Act deals with the appellate jurisdiction of the

Tribunal while Sections 14 and 15 of the NGT Act deal with the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                     43</span>
 original jurisdiction. The orders specified in clauses (a) to (j) of

Section 16 of the NGT Act are appealable before the Tribunal and

such appeal has to be filed within thirty days from the date on

which the order or decision or direction or determination is

communicated to the applicant. The proviso to Section 16 of the

NGT Act further empowers the Tribunal to entertain such an appeal

beyond the prescribed period of thirty days provided the appellant

shows that he was prevented by sufficient cause and the latter files

it within a further period not exceeding sixty days. Under all these

provisions, the period of limitation is prescribed and gives a limited

power to the Tribunal to condone the delay but not beyond the

period specified for limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_118">50.   Now, we have to examine under what provision of law, the

present application has been filed. In the application and its prayer

clause, it has been stated by the applicant that because of the

violation of the EC conditions, the same is liable to be revoked and

also the clearances granted under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_31">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_32">Air Act</a> are

liable to be recalled. The applicant also prays that penal action be

directed to be taken against Respondent No.9. On the cumulative

reading of the application and the prayer, it is clear that the present

application has not been filed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_33">Section 16</a> or

15 of the NGT Act. In fact, the learned counsel appearing for the

applicant, during the course of arguments, clearly stated that the

present application has been filed under Section 14 of the NGT Act

and the application is not barred by time. According to the

applicant, the application fully satisfied the ingredients of Section


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                    44</span>
 14 of the NGT Act as it raises a substantial question relating to

environment and it arises out of the implementation of the

enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act.

</p><p id="p_119">51.    The next question that arises for consideration is whether this

being an application under Section 14 of the NGT Act is barred by

the period of limitation prescribed under that Section. As already

noticed, under Section 14 of the NGT Act, an application can be

filed within six months from the date when the cause of action first

arose or at best within sixty days thereafter. Any application filed

after that period would be barred by limitation and even the

Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to condone such delay.

</p><p id="p_120">52.    According to the applicant, the EC was granted on 27th

November, 2006 while the consents under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_34">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_35">Water

Act</a> were granted by the competent Board on 31st May, 2008. The

applicant came to know about the unauthorized conversion of the

area   and   its   misuser   somewhere    in   December,    2012    and

immediately thereafter, wrote to the Secretary, MoEF, New Delhi,

bringing the specific details to his notice and specifically stated that

the entire operation was compromising the environmental and

health standards and the Ministry should take appropriate action in

that regard. However, since the Ministry failed to take any

appropriate action in accordance with law, the applicant was

compelled to file the present application before the Tribunal, which

was filed on 10th June, 2013. Thus, according to the applicant, the

application is within the prescribed period of limitation. According

to the applicant, the cause of action arose on or about 18th

 December, 2012 and the application was instituted on 10th June,

2013. The contention in regard to the application being barred by

time is liable to be rejected. The non-applicant has not disclosed all

the relevant and true facts in this regard. However, the contention

on behalf of Respondent No.9 was that it has converted the use of

the premises in question some time back and the same has been

open for public. As such, it was known to the applicant that the

premises have been converted. According to some of the other

private respondents, it is even contended that the lease deed was

executed around May/June, 2010 and as such the cause of action,

if any, arose for the first time during that period and the present

application is hopelessly barred by time and in fact, the Tribunal

has no jurisdiction to entertain the same.
</p>
<p id="p_121">53.   In order to examine the merits or otherwise of the rival

contentions raised before us, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to

dwell upon what is the meaning of the expression 'cause of action'.

In this regard, we may refer to a recent judgment dated 12 th

September, 2013 of the Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/88347937/" id="a_36">Kehar Singh v. State

of Haryana</a>; [ALL (I) NGT REPORTER (DELHI), 2013 (1) Part 7, Page

256], wherein a somewhat similar controversy arose with regard to

the establishment of an STP at Village Narkatari in Haryana. The

contention was that the land acquisition proceedings in relation to

the said STP were commenced long back, public notices were issued

and as such the limitation would start from the date of issuance of

the notification under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_37">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894. Rejecting the

 said contention and while explaining the expression 'cause of

action', the Tribunal held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_122">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">        "14.    In the present case, the applicant has invoked the
        jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Section 14 of the NGT Act
        with regard to establishment of STP on a location which,
        according to the applicant, is bound to create
        environmental problems and would adversely affect the
        public health. It will result in pollution of underground
        water besides causing emission of obnoxious gases and
        creating public nuisance, owing to being adjacent to
        residential colony and religious places. Thus, it would
        certainly involve a question relating to environment arising
        from the implementation of Acts specified in Schedule I to
        the NGT Act. Thus, the present case indisputably falls
        within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, of course, subject to
        the plea of limitation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">        15.     To further examine the question of limitation, we
        must deliberate upon what does the expression 'cause of
        action' mean. Furthermore, such cause of action has to
        relate to 'such dispute', as stated in Section 14 of the NGT
        Act. The period of six months shall be computed from the
        date on which the cause of action first arose in relation to
        such dispute. Both the expressions - 'cause of action' and
        'such dispute' - have to be read together. One of the settled
        rules of construction is noscitur a sociis i.e. the meaning of
        a word or an expression is to be judged by the company it
        keeps. Deliberating upon the application of this rule of
        interpretation, Justice G.P. Singh, in his book "Principles of
        Statutory Interpretation", 13th ed. 2012, while referring to a
        decision by Privy Council, inter alia, has stated:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">        "It is a legitimate rule of construction to construe
        words in an Act of Parliament with reference to words
        found in immediate connection with them. It is a rule
        wider than the rule of ejusdem generis; rather the
        latter rule is only an application of the former." The
        rule      has     been    lucidly      explained    by
        GAJENDRAGADKAR, J. in the following words: "This
        rule, according to MAXWELL, means that when two
        or more words which are susceptible of analogous
        meaning are coupled together, they are understood to
        be used in their cognate sense. They take as it were
        their colour from each other, that is, the more general
        is restricted to a sense analogous to a less general.</blockquote><p id="p_123">
</p><p id="p_124">        The same rule is thus interpreted in Words and
        Phrases. Associated words take their meaning from
        one another under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis,
        the philosophy of which is that the meaning of the
        doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                                                    47</span>
 meaning of words associated with it; such doctrine is
broader than the maxim ejusdem generis."
</p>
<p id="p_125">16.      'Cause of action', therefore, must be read in
conjunction with and should take colour from the
expression 'such dispute'. Such dispute will in turn
draw its meaning from <a href="/doc/31992/" id="a_38">Section 14(2)</a> and
consequently Section 14(1) of the NGT Act. These are
inter-connected and inter-dependent. 'Such dispute'
has to be considered as a dispute which is relating to
environment. The NGT Act is a specific Act with a
specific purpose and object, and therefore, the cause
of action which is specific to other laws or other
objects and does not directly relate to environmental
issues would not be 'such dispute' as contemplated
under the provisions of the NGT Act. The dispute
must essentially be an environmental dispute and
must relate to either of the Acts stated in Schedule I
to the NGT Act and the 'cause of action' referred to
under Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_39">Section 14</a> should be the
cause of action for 'such dispute' and not alien or
foreign to the substantial question of environment.</p><pre id="pre_4">
The cause of action must have a nexus to such
dispute     which      relates    to    the    issue   of
environment/substantial         question    relating   to
</pre><p id="p_126">environment, or any such proceeding, to trigger the
prescribed period of limitation. A cause of action,
which in its true spirit and substance, does not
relate to the issue of environment/substantial
question relating to environment arising out of the
specified legislations, thus, in law cannot trigger the
prescribed period of limitation under Section 14(3) of
the NGT Act. The term 'cause of action' has to be
understood in distinction to the nature or form of the
suit. A cause of action means every fact which is
necessary to establish to support the right to obtain
a judgment. It is a bundle of facts which are to be
pleaded and proved for the purpose of obtaining the
relief claimed in the suit. It is what a plaintiff must
plead and then prove for obtaining the relief. It is the
factual situation, the existence of which entitles one
person to obtain from the court remedy against
another. A cause of action means every fact which, if
traversed, would be necessary for the plaintiff to
prove in order to support his right to a judgment of
the court. In other words, it is a bundle of facts
which, taken with the law applicable to them, gives
the plaintiff a right to relief against the defendant. It
does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such
facts but every fact necessary for the plaintiff to
prove to enable him to obtain a decree. The
expression 'cause of action' has acquired a judicially

 settled meaning. In the restricted sense, cause of
action means the circumstances forming the
infraction of the right or the immediate occasion for
the action. In wider sense, it means the necessary
conditions for the maintenance of the suit including
not only the infraction coupled with the right itself.
To put it more clearly, the material facts which are
imperative for the suitor to allege and prove
constitute the cause of action. (Refer: Rajasthan High

</p><p id="p_127">17.      Upon analysis of the above judgments of the
Supreme Court, it is clear that the factual situation
that existed, the facts which are imperative for the
applicant to state and prove that give him a right to
obtain an order of the Tribunal, are the bundle of
facts which will constitute 'cause of action'. This
obviously means that those material facts and
situations must have relevancy to the essentials or
pre-requisites provided under the Act to claim the
relief. Under the NGT Act, in order to establish the
cause of action, pre-requisites are that the question
must relate to environment or it should be a
substantial question relating to environment or
enforcement of any legal right relating to
environment. If this is not satisfied, then the
provisions of Section 14 of the NGT Act cannot be
called in aid by the applicant to claim relief from the
Tribunal. Such question must fall within the ambit of
jurisdiction of the Tribunal i.e. it must arise from one
of the legislations in Schedule I to the NGT Act or any
other relevant provision of the NGT Act.             For
instance, the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to
determine any question relating to acquisition of land
or compensation payable in that regard. However, it
would have jurisdiction to award compensation for
environmental degradation and for restoration of the

 property damaged. Thus, the cause of action has to
have relevancy to the dispute sought to be raised,
right to raise such dispute and the jurisdiction of the
forum before which such dispute is sought to be
raised.
</p>
<p id="p_128">18.     Having dealt with the legal aspect relating to
limitation, we must now deal with the facts of the
present case. It is an undisputed position before us
that the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_49">Section 4</a> of the Land
Acquisition Act for acquisition of the land to set up
an STP had been issued by the competent authority
on 10th January, 2010 and was published in the
newspapers on 14th/15th January, 2010. Thereafter,
the news item was published on 19th May, 2013 and
20th May, 2013 declaring that the path for
installation of STP outside the city had been finally
cleared and the plant shall be set up soon and would
become a reality. On 20th May, 2013, the Gram
Panchayat, Narkatari, passed a resolution stating
that it had come to know that the land stated in the
notification, measuring about 18 acres, had been
acquired and the STP was being set up there, and for
the reasons stated therein, was opposing the same.
The resolution also noticed that the Government was
bent upon installing the plant, which was not in
public interest. The Municipal Councillor, Thanesar,
upon a meeting with the residents of Ward No.27,
Shanti Nagar, Kurukshetra, had also raised serious
objections with regard to the construction of the STP
at the site in question. He, inter alia, referred to the
adverse impact on the life of Dalit Colony near the
plant. Also, there was the Bhism Kund Baan Ganga
religious spot in close proximity of the plant, where
pilgrims come from various parts of the country.
Further, a petition was filed before the High Court
challenging the acquisition of the land in question
which came to be known as Civil Writ Petition No.
18732 of 2011 and was disposed of by the High
Court by a consented order dated 21st December,
2012.
</p>
<p id="p_129">19.     It is evident from the above facts that the
establishment of the STP at the site in question or
the substituted Khasra numbers came to public light
and became a contentious issue between the
Government and the public at large raising health
and environmental issues in the year 2013. It is
noteworthy that all the representations, objections,
etc. were made to the declaration notified in the
newspapers on 19th May, 2013 that the STP was
going to be set up at the site in question.
</p>
<p id="p_130"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                           50</span>
</p><p id="p_131"> 20.     According to the applicant, the limitation will
trigger from 19/20th May, 2013, when the matter in
relation to finally setting up the STP at the site in
question was published in the newspapers. The
applicant filed the application on 24th May, 2013 i.e.
within a few days of his acquiring the knowledge
when the cause of action arose in his favour.
</p><p id="p_132">Furthermore, the establishment of the STP at the site
in question received wide publicity on 19/20th May,
2013      whereafter    many     individuals,    public
organisations and, in fact, the public at large, raised
objection to the construction of the STP, thus, giving
rise to various environmental issues during that
period. Therefore, the application filed by the
applicant is within the prescribed period of
limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_133">21.     On the contrary, according to the respondent,
the cause of action arose when the notification under
<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_50">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_51">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act was
issued on or about 7/10th January, 2010. This
notification was published in the newspapers.
Therefore, the applicant would be deemed to have
knowledge of establishment of the STP in January,
2010 whereas the petition was filed in the year 2013.
The application is, therefore, barred by time as the
delay is more than 60 days over the prescribed
period of six months from the date of cause of action
and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the
delay.
</p>
<p id="p_134">22.     The entire controversy revolves as to the
effect of the issuance of the notification under
<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_52">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_53">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act and
whether it will constitute cause of action under the
NGT Act. We have no hesitation in answering this
question in the negative. The reasons for the same
are that the notification issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_54">Sections 4</a> and
<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_55">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act per se does not raise a
substantial question relating to environment. This
notification is for a different and distinct purpose.
The provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_56">Land Acquisition Act</a> operate in
an entirely different realm/field and have distinct
consequences. The questions arising in relation to
the validity of acquisition or payment of
compensation do not constitute 'dispute' within the
meaning of and for the purpose of Section 14 of the
NGT Act. The Tribunal, in any case, would have no
jurisdiction to venture upon the adjudication of such
an issue. Furthermore, the Government was
competent to change the 'public purpose' stated in
the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_57">Section 4</a> and even could de-
notify the area or give up the entire project upon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                                          51</span>
            hearing objections under <a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_58">Section 5</a> of the Land
           Acquisition Act. Change of purpose and de-
</p><p id="p_135">           notification by the State Government in accordance
           with law is permissible. If the Government would
           have de-notified the land from acquisition or if the
           High Court had quashed the notification under
           <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_59">Section 4</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, then the entire
           project of STP would have come to an end and the
           proceedings, if any, initiated by the applicant under
           the NGT Act would have been an exercise in futility.

</p><p id="p_136">           23.     Another important aspect is that the location,
           the Khasra number, etc. sought to be acquired under
           <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_60">Section 4</a> of the Land Acquisition Act could be
           changed by the competent authority while issuing
           the notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_61">Section 6</a> of the Land
           Acquisition Act. The High Court, vide its order dated
           21st December, 2012 permitted the change of Khasra
           number by agreement. In other words, the very
           location of the STP, from the initial site, stood
           changed to khasra number recorded in the order of
           the High Court. These were very material changes
           but fell within the field of acquisition proceedings.
           They do not have any impact on environmental
           issues in regard to establishment of the STP."

</p><p id="p_137">54.        Thus, it is clear that the cause of action should have a

direct nexus with the matters relating to environment. In the

present case, the respondents can hardly be heard to contend that

since they have been flouting with impunity, the law, the terms and

conditions of the EC for long, and therefore, every person is

expected to know such violations or unauthorized use, and as such,

the application would be barred by limitation. Respondent No.9 has

not come to the Tribunal with clean hands and disclosed complete

details,    which were    exclusively within    their knowledge     and

possession. In the normal course of business, Respondent No.9

would have first entered into agreements with other persons for

providing these premises, either on sale or lease, as the case may

be. Then such buyers/lessees would start making constructional

changes and provide infrastructure necessary for using the parking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                                     52</span>
 and services area for commercial purposes. Then alone, such

persons would have started using the premises for such purposes.

All these facts have been withheld by Respondent No.9. Therefore,

the Tribunal would be entitled to draw adverse inference against

Respondent No.9 in that behalf. In any case, Respondent No.9 and

other private respondents have converted the user of the premises

contrary to the specified purpose and in violation of law and terms

and conditions of the EC. Thus, even such an approach would

support the case of the applicant and in any case the respondents

cannot be permitted to take advantage of their own wrong or

default.
</p>
<p id="p_138">
</p><p id="p_139">55.   The cause of action is not restricted to 'in personam' but is an

action available to any person in terms of Section 14 of the NGT Act.

It empowers any person aggrieved to raise a substantial question

relating to environment including enforcement of any legal right

relating thereto. Every citizen is entitled to a clean and decent

environment in terms of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_62">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and the term

'cause of action first arose' must be understood in that sense and

context. The applicant has been able to establish that he first came

to know about the misuser and change of user, particularly with

regard to adverse environmental impact, only in the middle of

December, 2012 and immediately thereafter, he took steps requiring

the authorities concerned to take action as per law but to no avail.

Then he filed the present application within the prescribed period of

six months. The respondents have not been able to rebut

successfully the factual matrix stated by the applicant. As already

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                   53</span>
 stated, they have withheld relevant facts and information from the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_140">56.   A cause of action is a bundle of facts which should give, in its

composite form, right to a plaintiff against the defendant to

approach a court or Tribunal for a legal remedy or redressal of his

grievance. Thus, the existence of a legal remedy to the plaintiff is a

sine qua non for an actionable cause of action. In view of the above

reasoning, we have no hesitation in concluding that the present

application is not barred by time.
</p>
<p id="p_141">57.   Lastly but most importantly, now we have to deal with the

question as to whether the breach of conditions of EC is likely to

cause environmental and health hazards or not. We have already

held that Respondent No.9 has not only violated the specific terms

and conditions of the EC dated 27th November, 2006 but has also

miserably failed to submit an application for reappraisal of the

project. Furthermore, the said Respondent No.9 has committed

breach of the bye laws, fire safety measures, Corporation laws, etc.

All the public authorities have specifically taken the stand that at

no point of time, did they accord any permission or sanction for

conversion of the parking area for commercial purposes and its

misuser or unauthorized construction. In fact, according to them,

they have taken appropriate steps against Respondent No.9 in

accordance with law. We have already noticed that this Tribunal is

not concerned with the violations and breaches committed by

Respondent No.9 with regard to other laws in force but for




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                    54</span>
 environmental laws in terms of Schedule I to the NGT Act and its

adverse impact on environment and public health.

</p><p id="p_142">58.   It has come on record that approximately 59% of commercial

area has been increased by such unauthorized conversion and

misuser. The terms and conditions of the EC have specifically

provided that in the event of any change in the scope of the project,

Respondent No.9 was expected to take steps for reappraisal of the

project and take fresh EC, which admittedly, has not been done by

Respondent    No.9   despite   lapse   of   considerable   time.   These

violations would consequently have a direct impact on traffic

congestion, ambient air quality, contamination of underground

water, sewage disposal and municipal solid waste disposal besides

other adverse impact on population density in the area. With the

significant change of commercial area by 59%, the EC itself would

be substantially affected and it would be for the authorities

concerned to examine whether the EC can be continued or requires

to be recalled. There is a drastic change in PSY with change in sq.ft.

area as the EC was not intended for such area to which Respondent

No.9 has now expanded its activity. Furthermore, assessment of

water requirement is based upon the number of users and other

services in the area and this substantial change has fundamentally

been altered and would have drastic and adverse effects on all these

aspects. The EIA Report submitted by Respondent No.9 itself shows

that these are the various aspects, the variation of which is bound

to alter the entire basis for grant of the EC.       For instance, the

parking for 1772 cars was to be provided in the project in terms of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                      55</span>
 EIA report. For this purpose, the basement, lower ground floor in

one block and the multi-level car parking in the Block 2P had been

provided. Major part of this area had been converted and used by

Respondent No.9 and other private respondents for commercial

purposes.    It is not even the case of Respondent No.9 that the

required number of cars can be parked in that building. The cars

which could have been parked in the building now would have to be

parked on the public roads/places leading to lowering the road

capacity resulting in lowering the average speed of the vehicle,

consequently increasing the air pollution.

</p><p id="p_143">      It is noteworthy that the DPCC, in furtherance to the orders of

the Tribunal, had conducted an inspection on 22nd April, 2013, as

afore-referred, wherein in addition to misuser, it had also noticed

the deficiencies pertaining to the functioning of the STP and re-use

of the treated water. The consent granted to the project proponent

was valid till 31st August, 2013. Since no periodical inspection had

been carried out by the DPCC, it did not monitor compliance of the

conditions stated in its order of consent to operate.

</p><p id="p_144">59.   The apparent and obvious environmental consequences of

such substantial change by the project proponent in the scope of

the project are with regard to the increased inflow of people, its

impact on sewage, air and water parameters and collection and

disposal    of   municipal   wastes.   Violation   in   the   prescribed

parameters, as noticed above, are bound to have adverse impact on

environment and public health. This is bound to cause hazardous

problems in relation to the public health amongst others in relation


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                      56</span>
 to breeding of flies and other vectors. The STPs would be unable to

take such increased load and there will be a material change in the

parameters under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_63">Air Act</a>. This would be substantial

disturbed. All this certainly amounts to change in the scope of the

project and    would   require   reappraisal of the project itself.

Permitting such continued violation would seriously jeopardise the

environment, public health and even the larger public interest. The

Tribunal, while drawing a balance, would hardly be impressed by

the continuation of that injunctive order, which would also

jeopardise the financial interest of project proponent.   According to

Respondent No.9, it is likely to suffer a loss of about Rs.2.00 crores

per month as it would be unable to pay back the banks from whom

it has taken loans for completion of the project. Financial burden on

Respondent No.9 cannot be the consideration for compromising the

environmental and public health interests. Individual interest must

give way to larger public health and environmental interest. The

conduct of Respondent No.9 in entering into agreements with

various other private respondents and converting the parking areas

for commercial use without approval/consent/permission of the

competent authorities and making money and hugely gaining

monetarily in this context would, in any case, disentitle him from

even raising the contention of financial constraints or difficulties at

this stage now.
