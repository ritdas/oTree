                              JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner claims to be the owner in possession of a property

having an extent of 1 acre of land comprised in re-survey No.448/1A

of Thayannur village in Kasaragode District. She is conducting a

piggery therein. This writ petition has been filed on being aggrieved

by Ext.P8 notice issued by the first respondent requiring the petitioner

to close down the piggery. Evidently, such a notice was issued on

receipt of complaints from the people of the locality regarding the

unhygenic conditions in which the piggery is being conducted. It is

also stated therein that the petitioner has not obtained licence from the

the first respondent for running the piggery.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.     A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of respondents

1 and 2. It is specifically stated therein that the petitioner has been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C).21275/14                    2</span>



running the piggery without obtaining the valid licence from the

panchayat under the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Issuance of License to

Dangerous and Offensive Trades and <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_1">Factories) Act</a>. It is also stated

therein that on obtaining complaints from the local people, an

inspection was conducted in the piggery and it was found that the said

piggery has been functioning in an unhygenic condition. It was in the

said circumstances that Ext.P8 notice was issued.          The learned

standing counsel appearing for the fourth respondent, on instructions,

submitted that a complaint was received against the ill-functioning of

the piggery pursuant to which a closure intention notice was issued to

the petitioner to close it down. In fact, that notice was produced by

the first respondent as Ext.R1(c). It is stated therein that the piggery

is located less than 50 metre away from a nearby residence and that

too, without complying with condition Nos.3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3

and 4.4 of the consent issued earlier. It was in the said circumstances

that closure intention notice was issued in terms of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">section 33A</a> of the

Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control Pollution) Act</a> 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_4"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C).21275/14                    3</span>
</p><p id="p_5">      3.    I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the

learned standing counsel appearing for respondents 1 and 2, the

learned standing counsel appearing for the fourth respondent and the

learned Government Pleader. It is evident from the contentions raised

by the petitioner that prior to the commencement of the piggery, she

had submitted Ext.P1 application dated 1.4.2009 before the first

respondent. Evidently, that application was unaccompanied by a valid

consent to operate from the Pollution Control Board. Consent to

operate the piggery was issued by the PCB only on 4.10.2010. True

that the petitioner got renewed the license subsequently as per Ext.P3,

up to 30.6.2015. The petitioner did not have a case that prior to

Ext.P2 he was issued with valid consent to operate by the fourth

respondent. An application submitted for permit or licence

unaccompanied by the requisite documents before the concerned

Local Self Government Institution cannot be considered as a valid

application. Evidently, the petitioner cannot be heard to contend that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C).21275/14                     4</span>



she had produced valid consent to operate along with Ext.P1 as Ext.P2

was issued more than 1= years after Ext.P1. The prayer of the

petitioner is for issuance of a writ of mandamus commanding the first

respondent to dispose of Ext.P1 application.         I am at a loss to

understand what purpose could be served by issuing such a direction.

It is to be noted that the very case of the petitioner is that she accrued

the deemed licence in terms of the provisions under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">section 236</a> (3) of

the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act owing to the failure on the part of

respondents 1 and 2 to act upon Ext.P1. An invalid application could

not fetch any deemed licence under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">section 236</a> (3) of the Act. Even if

it is taken that owing to the failure on the part of the first respondent

to act upon Ext.P1 the petitioner accrued deemed licence, it could be

valid only for a period of one year. In that event, it could be treated

that the said deemed licence expired on 31.3.2010. Thereafter, the

petitioner had to file an application for its renewal. The learned

counsel for the petitioner submitted that subsequently the petitioner

submitted Ext.P4 letter dated 19.4.2011.          Obviously, that letter

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C).21275/14                      5</span>



addressing the secretary of the first respondent was submitted much

after the expiry of the deemed licence, if at all it could be treated that

the petitioner had accrued deemed licence by virtue of operation of

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">section 236</a> (3) of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act. There is no case for

the petitioner that subsequently she filed any application for licence.

In such circumstances, I do not find any reason to disagree with the

finding of the first respondent to the effect that the petitioner is

running the piggery without obtaining a valid licence. The learned

counsel further submitted that the pigs and piggies come about 100

numbers. In the light of the provisions under the Kerala Panchayat

Raj Issuance of License to Dangerous and Offensive Trades and

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_7">Factories) Act</a>, such a piggery cannot function without obtaining a

valid licence from the first respondent. In such circumstances, I do

not find any illegality in Ext.P8 and it calls for no interference. This

writ petition is liable to fail and accordingly it is dismissed. It is made

clear that the dismissal of this writ petition will not stand in the way

of the petitioner in approaching the authorities with a proper

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C).21275/14                    6</span>



application for licence. It is further made clear that the petitioner

cannot function the piggery without a valid licence from the first

respondent and therefore, it will be open to the first respondent to

issue appropriate instructions to regulate the disposal of the pigs and

piggies in the piggery.
