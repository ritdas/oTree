<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                    Page 5 of 28</span>
</pre><p id="p_4"> 4.     Learned counsel submits that at present, apart from the

President, who is a retired High Court Judge, the existing two members

are females.      He, therefore, submits that the respondent could not

have reserved any post for a Member (Female - non-judicial), since the

requirement of <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_5">Section 16(1)(b)</a>, which provides that one of the

members of the State Commission should be a woman, already stands

satisfied. I may note that the respondent No. 1/UOI supports this stand

of the petitioner in relation to the reservation of one post for Member

(Female - non-judicial).
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     The submission of respondent No. 2 is that the two female

members in the existing strength of the State Commission have been

appointed, not on account of their being females, but as Non-judicial

member (Mrs. Salma Noor) and Judicial member (Mrs. Kanwal Inder).

</p><p id="p_6">6.     Mrs. Kanwal Inder, the judicial member already stands retired.

Presently, the State Commission is left with only two incumbents, i.e.

the President Mr. B.R. Zaidi and a non-judicial member Mrs. Salma

Noor. It is argued that the advertisement in question is to fill up one

reserved vacancy for Member (Female - non-judicial), as the earlier

appointee viz. Mrs. Salma Noor was not appointed on account of her

being a female.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     Insofar as the         advertisement for the   second vacancy is

concerned, namely that of Member (judicial), the submission of learned



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                    Page 6 of 28</span>
 counsel for the petitioners is that <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_6">Section 16</a> does not purport to

reserve any vacancy for a judicial member. On the contrary, it seeks

to limit the appointment of "persons having judicial background" to not

more than 50% while making appointment of members who meet the

eligibility criteria set out in <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_7">Section 16(1)(b)</a> (i), (ii) &amp; (iii). It is argued

that the reservation made for Member (judicial) is contrary to <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_8">Section

16</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     Learned counsel for the petitioners places reliance on various

decisions on the interpretation of statutes to submit that normal

function of a proviso is to except something out of the enactment, or to

qualify something enacted therein which, but for the proviso, would be

within the purview of the enactment. The proper function of a proviso

is to except and to deal with a case which would otherwise fall within

the general language of the main enactment and its effect is confined

to that case. It is a qualification of the preceding enactment which is

expressed in terms too general, to be quite accurate.            As a general

rule, proviso is added to an enactment to qualify or create an

exception to what is in the enactment and ordinarily, a proviso is not

interpreted as stating a general rule. (See Nagar Palika Nigam Vs.

Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti &amp; Others, AIR 2009 SC 187)

</p><p id="p_9">9.     Reliance is also placed on Nasiruddin and Others Vs. Sita

Ram Agarwal, (2003) 2 SCC 577, to submit that the jurisdiction to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                          Page 7 of 28</span>
 interpret a statute can be invoked when the same is ambiguous. The

Court cannot interpret a legislation so as to enlarge the scope of the

legislation,   when     the   language   of   the   provision   is   plain   and

unambiguous.       It cannot add or subtract words to a statute or read

something into it which is not there.         It cannot re-write or re-cast

legislation.    It is submitted that the proviso to <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_9">Section 16(1)(b)</a> is

worded in a negative way to prescribe that not more than 50% of the

members shall be persons having a judicial background.                Negative

words are prohibitive and are ordinarily used as a legislative device to

make a statute imperative (see M. Pentiah and Others Vs.

Muddala Veeramallappa and Others, AIR 1961 SC 1107).                         It is

submitted that when the statute provides that not more than 50% of

the members shall be persons having a judicial background, it cannot

mean that, necessarily, 50% of the members should be persons having

a judicial background.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.    Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the President of

the State Commission is also a "member".               Thus considered, the

appointment of another judicial member would breach the restriction

contained in proviso to <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_10">Section 16(1)(b)</a>, as the number of judicial

members, including the President, would exceed 50% of the total

strength of the State Commission, as, apart from the President and

Mrs. Kanwal Inder, one more member would be a person having a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                           Page 8 of 28</span>
 judicial background - thus raising their number to three, whereas, the

number of members not having a judicial background shall be only

two, even if another member (Non-judicial) is appointed.

</p><p id="p_11">11.    In support of this submission, learned counsel for the petitioners

place reliance on the definition of the expression „member‟ contained

in <a href="/doc/334666/" id="a_11">Section 2(jj)</a> of the Act, and also on the decision of the Kerala High

Court in K. Kanakachandran Vs. State of Kerala and Others, AIR

2007 Kerala 155.         He also places reliance on the decision of the

Supreme Court in Central Bank of India Vs. Ravindra and Others,

AIR 2001 SC 3095. In this case, the Supreme Court has observed that

"ordinarily, a word of expression used at several places in one

enactment should be assigned the same meaning so as to avoid "a

head-on clash" between two meanings assigned to the same word or

expression occurring at two places in the same enactment. It should

not be lightly assumed that "Parliament had given with one hand what

it took away with the other" [See- Principles of statutory Interpretation,

Justice G.P. Singh, 7th Edition 1999, p.113]. That construction is to be

rejected which will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the

working of the system (ibid, p. 119).           While embarking upon

interpretation of words and expressions used in a Statute it is possible

to find a situation when the same word or expression may have

somewhat different meaning at different places depending on the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                     Page 9 of 28</span>
 subject or context.           This is however an exception which can be

resorted to only in the event of repugnancy in the subject or context

being spelled out. It has been the consistent view of Supreme Court

that when the Legislature used same word or expression in different

parts of the same section or statute, there is a presumption that the

word is used in the same sense throughout, (ibid, p.263). More correct

statement of the rule is, as held by House of Lords in Farrell V.

Alexander, (1976) 2 All ER 721, 736, "where the draftsman uses the

same word or phrase in similar contexts, he must be presumed to

intend it in each place to bear the same meaning"."
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.    Having heard learned counsel for the parties, considered the

rival submission in the light of the judgments cited before me and after

giving my due consideration to the provisions of the Act, I am of the

considered view that so far as the advertisement of one post for

Member (Female - non-judicial) is concerned, the same appears to be

contrary to the provisions of <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_12">Section 16(1)(b)</a> of the Act. However, the

advertisement of one post for Member (judicial) appears to be in order,

and in consonance with the provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.    A perusal of <a href="/doc/798312/" id="a_13">Section 16</a> of the Act clearly shows that there is no

reservation of posts, either in favour of a woman or a person having

judicial background, for being appointed as a Member of the State

Commission. All that <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_14">Section 16(1)(b)</a> provides is that, of the members



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                   Page 10 of 28</span>
 appointed to a State Commission, at least one shall be a woman. It

does not mean that a slot or a post of a member of the State

Commission can be labled or classified as that reserved for a Member

(Female).      What <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_15">Section 16(1)(b)</a> provides is that while making

appointment of members to the State Commission, if none of the

been fulfilled with the appointment of Mrs. Salma Noor, who still

continues to be Member (Mrs. Kanwal Inder having already retired), the

applications by other aspirants, who may otherwise satisfy the

requirement of <a href="/doc/116465/" id="a_20">Section 16(1)(b)</a> of the Act, and who may, or may not,

be women. The respondent No. 2 is not precluded from appointing a

woman from amongst the applicants, but the said appointment should

be based entirely on the applicants‟ merit and should not be swayed

by the consideration that she is a woman. The understanding of

respondent No. 2 that the earlier appointee, namely Mrs. Salma Noor

was not appointed on account of her being a woman and, therefore, a

post of Member is still reserved for a woman, is clearly not in

consonance with the language and spirit of the Act.

the goods &amp; services that they may procure for consideration and for

their personal use or consumption. The Consumer Courts which have a

3-tier hierarchy, are required to function in compliance of the principles

of natural justice. They are vested with the same powers as a Civil

Court while trying a suit in respect of various matters, such as

summoning and enforcing the attendance of any defendant or witness,

examination of the witnesses on oath; the discovery and production of

any document or other material object producible as evidence; the

the State Commission or the National Commission.              Whereas the

District Forum is statutorily mandated to be headed by a person who

is, or has been or is qualified to be, a District Judge as its President, the

State Commission necessarily has to be headed by a person, who is or

has been a Judge of a High Court as its President, and the National

Supreme Court as its President. The Consumer Courts have jurisdiction

to rule on the civil rights of the parties in respect of the subject matters

Judge respectively.       Even in respect of the President of the District

would be to induct persons having judicial background as members,

meaning - persons having knowledge and experience as Presiding

Officer at the district level Court or a Tribunal at equivalent level.

However, to make the Consumer Courts more consumer friendly, so

that they are more sensitive to the needs, the plight and the difficulties

of the consumers, and considering the vast scope of their jurisdiction,

the Act provides that not more than 50% of the members shall be from

amongst the persons having a judicial background, and atleast one of

them shall be a woman.         This is to ensure that at least 50% of the

members are those who are appointed, not on account of their having

a judicial background, but on account of their having adequate

knowledge and experience in dealing with problems relating to

economics, law, commerce, accountancy, industry, public affairs &amp;

the constitution of the Delhi Cooperative Tribunal is constitutional,

any High Court, or a retired District Judge or a person who has for not

 five years judicial experience at his credit.           The Lt.     Governor was

empowered to relax the qualification in case of any person otherwise

qualified in his opinion.       The    Division Bench placed reliance on the

aforesaid decision in the case of S.P. Sampath Kumar (supra), and

set aside the notification dated 26.05.2006, whereby the Delhi

Cooperative Tribunal was constituted, and directed the constitution of

a proper tribunal of which the Chairman should be a judicial member,

preferably a retired District Judge.

<p id="p_27">27.    The reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court in Sampath

Kumar (supra), R.K. Jain (supra), A.P. Pollution Control Board

(supra) and Rajeshwar Kumar Gupta (supra), in my view, applies

with the same force           to Consumer Courts.        The Consumer Courts

adjudicate civil rights arising out of contractual matters relating to sale

of goods and provision of services to a consumer.                  Complex laws

relating to banking, financing, insurance etc. fall within the jurisdiction

of the Consumer Courts. Apart from these, the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_41">Contract Act</a>, the sale

of    <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_42">Goods    Act</a>    etc     which   too   require    legal    background          and

understanding        for    proper    appreciation    also     routinely     fall   for

consideration by the          Consumer Courts.        In the case of Consumer

Courts as well, the legal input would undeniably be equally important

as the inputs that the other members may provide and sacrificing the

legal input and not giving its sufficient weightage would definitely

 impair the efficacy and effectiveness of the Consumer Courts. Since

the Consumer Courts discharge judicial function, and the proceedings

are judicial proceedings, wherein advocates also appear and argue

case and make legal submissions, the presence of a person having

judicial background would certainly further the cause of efficacy,

consistency and quality in the decision making process of the

Consumer Courts and would help in maintaining judicial temper. The

Consumer Courts and its benches, if there are more than one, should

consist of at least one person having judicial background, unless it is

presided by the President himself.
</p>
<p id="p_28">28.    The aforesaid being the position, if the Government decides to

specifically appoint a person having judicial background so as to

facilitate the creation of a bench of the State Commission and,

therefore, advertises the post by inviting applications from persons

having a judicial background, the petitioners can have no grievance,

particularly when the percentage of the persons having judicial

background would not exceed 50%, even after the filling up of the

advertised post.
</p>
<p id="p_29">29.    The State Government is entitled to fill the vacancy of a Member

from amongst the persons having judicial background if that is the

need of the hour. There is no purpose of inviting applications from the

 of a person having judicial background from amongst the applicants.

Unless a specific advertisement is issued to make appointment of a

person having judicial background, it is quite likely that persons with

such credentials may not even apply. At the same time, it would be a

wasted exercise for those who do not have such background, to

require them to submit their applications, if the need is to appoint a

person having judicial background.

the President of the State Commission is considered as a "member" for

the purpose of <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_44">Section 16(1)(b)</a> of the Act, the appointment of another

person having a judicial background would not breach the upper limit

of 50% of posts of members of the State Commission. Since the tenure

of the persons of the State Commission is provided for in <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_45">Section 16(3)</a>,

the State Government would in advance, be aware of the date of

up of vacancies.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                  Page 23 of 28</span>
 been a Judge of a High Court, and a "member" appointed under

<a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_48">Section 16(1)(b)</a>.      In my view, the expression "member" as used in

<a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_49">Section 16(1)(b)</a> as well as the proviso to <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_50">Section 16(1)(b)</a> does not

include the President, even though the term "member" has been

defined in <a href="/doc/576298/" id="a_51">Section 2(jj)</a> to include the President          of the National

Commission, or a State Commission, or a District Forum, as the case

may be. The definitions in <a href="/doc/576298/" id="a_52">Section 2</a> begin with the words "In this Act

unless the context otherwise requires, ..... ..... .....". (emphasis

supplied) Therefore, the definitions contained in <a href="/doc/576298/" id="a_53">Section 2</a> may not be

relevant, if the context in which the defined expression is used, is

different.     The "President" of the State Commission is dealt with in

clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_54">Section 16(1)</a>, whereas the "member(s)" are dealt with in

clause(b). The President stands on a different-rather a higher footing,

than the members of the State Commission. His position, his terms of

engagement, as well as the salary paid to him are different from the

position, the terms of engagement and the salary paid to the

members. The president of the State Commission is not merely the

first amongst equals.         His position is clearly on a higher pedestal,

though he may sit in a bench with the other members to discharge his

judicial functions. The context in which the expression "member" has

been used in <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_55">Section 16</a> of the Act requires that the expression

"President" be not read or understood to mean a "member".



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                      Page 24 of 28</span>
</p><p id="p_32"> 32.    In my view, the decision in Central Bank of India (supra)

supports the view that I am taking.     The Supreme Court recognized

that while embarking upon       interpretation of the words used in a

Statute, it is possible to find a situation when the same word or

expression may have somewhat different meaning at different places,

depending on the subject or context.       This is an exception to the

general rule that when the legislature has used the same word or

expression in different parts of the same Section or Statutes, there is a

presumption that the word is used in the same sense throughout. In

my view, the present case clearly falls in the exception, rather than

under the aforesaid rule.
</p>
<p id="p_33">33.    It is clear to me on a plain reading of <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_56">Section 16</a> that the State

Commission consists of at least three persons, i.e. the President

appointed under <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_57">Section 16(1)(a)</a>, and not less than two members

appointed under <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_58">Section 16(1)(b)</a>. If the submission of learned counsel

for the petitioners that the President is also a "member" for the

purpose of <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_59">Section 16(1)(b)</a> were to be accepted, it would mean that

the State Commission could consist of two members, i.e. one President

and a second member appointed under <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_60">Section 16(1)(b)</a>. This scheme

of things would not explain <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_61">Section 16(1B)(iii)</a> which, inter alia,

provides that if the members of a Bench differ in opinion on any point,

the points shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority, if



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                   Page 25 of 28</span>
 there is a majority, but if the members are equally divided, they shall

state the point or points on which they differ, and make a reference to

the President who shall either hear the point or points himself, or refer

the case for hearing on such point or points by one or more of the

other members, and such point or points shall be decided according to

the opinion of the majority of the members, who have heard the case,

including those who first heard it.
</p>
<p id="p_34">34.    Without, at least, three incumbents in the State Commission

(including the President), there is no question of a "majority" view or

opinion. In that case, the deadlock created on account of difference of

opinion between the President and the other member would never get

resolved.     It is, therefore, clear that the State Commission has to

necessarily consist of at least three persons, i.e. the President and two

other members. It is obvious that the expression "member/members"

used in <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_62">Section 16(1)(b)</a> does not include the President.

</p><p id="p_35">35.    Viewed thus, even if Mrs. Kanwal Inder had not retired and the

appointments in terms of the advertisement in question had been

made (which have not been made on account of pendency of these

proceedings), the number of members having judicial background

would have remained at two, and the number of members not having

judicial background, but appointed under <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_63">Section 16(1)(b)</a>, would also

have remained at two.         In that eventuality as well, the proviso to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                    Page 26 of 28</span>
<a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_64">Section 16(1)(b)</a> would not have been breached.
</p>
<p id="p_36">36.    Reliance placed by the learned counsel for the petitioners on

various decisions, as aforesaid, on the aspect of interpretation of

statutes have no relevance in the facts of the case and also in view of

the aforesaid discussion.
</p>
<p id="p_37">37.    The decision in Nasiruddin and Others (supra) does not

advance the case of the petitioners in the light of the aforesaid

discussion. Similarly, the decision in M. Pentiah and Others (supra)

also does not advance the petitioners‟ case, since the upper limit of

50% for appointment of members of the State Commission having a

judicial background has not been breached.        The decision in Nagar

Palika Nigam (supra) also has no relevance since the restrictions

contained in the proviso to <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_65">Section 16(1)(b)</a> have not been breached

by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_38">38.    The decision of the Kerala High Court in K. Kanakachandran

(supra) also does not advance the petitioners‟ case. It is clear from

reading of paras 5 &amp; 6 of the said judgment that the Court apart from

recording the submission of the petitioner had not expressed a definite

view on the issue whether the President was a "member" in the

context of <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_66">Section 16(1)(b)</a> of the Act, as the said issue did not arise for

determination in the facts of that case. This is clear from a reading of

para 6, the relevant part of which reads as follows:



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">W.P.(C) 153/2011 &amp; 305/2011                                     Page 27 of 28</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">            "6.    Even if the contention of the petitioner that the
           members mentioned therein does not include the President
           is accepted, I feel that the same will also make no
           difference on the outcome of the case. Among the 4
           members, if one is a member with a judicial background,
           the representation will be 25%. Twenty five percent is
           definitely a percentage which is not more than 50% as
           contemplated by the proviso to <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_67">Section 16(1)(b)</a> of the Act.
           But, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
           said proviso should be read to mean that the persons with
           judicial background should be at leat 50%."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">39.        For all the aforesaid reasons, I partially allow these petitions and

hold that the advertisement in question issued by respondent No. 2 for

filling the post of Member (Female - non-judicial) is contrary to the

provisions of the Act. However, the said advertisement to fill the post

of a Member (judicial), i.e., to appoint a person having judicial

background is in accord with <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_68">Section 16</a> of the Act and is, therefore,

upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_40">40.        The petitions stand disposed of in the aforesaid terms leaving

the parties to bear their own costs.
