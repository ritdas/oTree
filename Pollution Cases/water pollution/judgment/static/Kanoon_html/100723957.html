with <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_1">Section 16</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 Haryana

State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) challenges the order dated

6.11.2009 (Annexure P-14) passed by the Appellate Authority

constituted under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_2">Section 28</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.         By the impugned order, the Appellate Authority directed

that consent to operate Distillery unit run by Respondent (M/s.

Haryana Organics) for the year 2008-09 shall be deemed to have been

granted and hence forfeiture of Bank Guarantee of Rs. 12.25 lacs as

directed by HSPCB is void and be restored to the latter.


</p><p id="p_4">3.         Certain undisputed facts may be narrated at the outset in

order to narrow down the compass of the dispute.           They are as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "M/s. Haryana Organics is a company incorporated under

           the   <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_4">Companies    Act</a>,   1956.    Previously   it   used   to

           molasses to grains.   In Writ Petition (Civil) No. 725/1994

</p><p id="p_7">           the Hon'ble Apex Court passed an order dated 31.01.2001,

           constituting a Committee consisting of Shri K. Roy Paul,

           Additional Secretary or such other senior officer as may be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>
 deputed by the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forest (MoEF),

the Chairman of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)

and the Chairman of HSPCB. The Committee was directed

to hold meeting on or before 31.01.2001 and decide

whether to allow all or any of the Distilleries to operate or

not to operate.    This direction was given in the wake of

closure of four (4) Distilleries out of such five (5) Distilleries

operating in the State of Haryana, as per directions of the

HSPCB. The three Member High Powered Committee in its

meeting dated 08.10.2007 asked the HSPCB to direct M/s.

Haryana Organics to submit a time bound programme for

completion of the installation of RO/Nano Filtration system

in order to ensure zero effluent discharge from its Distillery.

The Committee also directed the HSPCB to seek a Bank

Guarantee of Rs. 50.00 lacs in order to ensure commitment

of M/s. Haryana Organics for commissioning the RO/Nano

filtration system in accordance with the time bound

programme.      A joint visit by the officers of CPCB and

HSPCB was to be arranged in the month of December, 2007

in order to verify the compliance.             The Distillery (M/s

Haryana Organics) submitted the time bound programme.

Thereafter, M/s. Haryana Organics was informed by the

HSPCB     to   execute    the     time      bound    programme     for

installation of the equipment i.e. bio-composting, Reverse

Osmosis    (RO),   Nano        Filtration    (NF),   Multiple   Effect

Evaporator, etc. to achieve zero effluent discharge.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           3</span>
</p><p id="p_8">           M/s. Haryana Organics filed an application for consent to

          operate for the year 2008-09 under the Water (Prevention

          and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water

          (for short, the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>).    It assured that Nano filtration

          system for treatment of the trade effluents will be installed

          within a short span and necessary Bank Guarantee will be

          furnished. By letter dated 08.04.2008, M/s. Haryana

          Organics furnished the Bank Guarantee of Rs. 50.00 lacs

          along with the Pert chart for installation of the equipments

          as directed by the HSPCB."
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">4.        There is no dispute about the fact that the HSPCB issued a

show cause notice dated 28.04.2008 to M/s. Haryana Organics to

comply with the directions of High Power Committee and furnish fresh

documents to prove compliance within 15 days failing which the letter

was to be treated as legal refusal of consent for the year 2008-2009.

An opportunity of personal hearing was given to M/s. Haryana

Organics on 09.07.2008 where Shri Parvesh Chawla, Manager, Public

Relations of the Distillery (M/s Haryana Organics) promised to comply

with the directions within 15 days failing which closure action could

be initiated by the Pollution Board. M/s. Haryana Organics informed

the HSPCB vide communication dated 26.09.2008 that installation of

RO/Nano filtration system was done and a separate compliance report

was also forwarded to the latter on 16.10.2008.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>
</p><p id="p_12"> 5.         Briefly stated, it is the case of HSPCB that in pursuance to

a complaint received from the office of the Deputy Commissioner,

Sonepat dated 26.10.2008, the Distillery unit of M/s. Haryana

Organics was visited and samples were collected from the outlets

thereof.   The samples were sent to the authorized laboratories. The

sample's analysis indicated that the unit had failed to achieve zero

discharge of the effluent and the trade effluent was being discharged

in the drain leading to Sonepat, which contaminated the water of

Yamuna river. Since there was violation of the directions issued by

the three Member High Powered Committee, M/s. Haryana Organics

was called upon to explain its stance. After personal hearing, M/s.

Haryana Organics was given warning to comply with the directions

and ensure zero discharge of effluent from the outlet, within a period

of fifteen (15) days.   Another direction was issued to extend the

validity of Bank Guarantee upto 31st December, 2009. Accordingly,

M/s. Haryana Organics extended the validity of Bank Guarantee upto

31.12.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">6.         According to HSPCB, in spite of such assurance given by

M/s. Haryana Organics there was no compliance made to achieve zero

discharge of contaminated effluents.    Besides acoustic chamber on

DG set was not installed and analysis report of bottle washing section

was not submitted. Again, a team of officers of CPCB and SPCB

visited the Distillery on 02.04.2009 and collected samples of trade

effluents that were being discharged from the outlets of the unit. It

was found that the samples collected from the outlets of the bottling

plant exceeded permissible limits of contamination.        Eventually,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5</span>
 another opportunity of personal hearing was given to M/s. Haryana

Organics on 08.05.2009 and thereafter a notice was issued under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_9">Section 33-A</a> of the Water Act on 11.05.2009 calling upon the

Distillery as to why 25% amount of the Bank Guarantee be not

forfeited. A separate notice was issued on 14.05.2009 calling upon

M/s. Haryana Organics to show cause as to why closure of the unit

may not be ordered. During the course of personal hearing, it was

assured by M/s. Haryana Organics that within fifteen (15) days the

compliance would be made.       The part of Bank Guarantee, to the

extent of 25% amount was forfeited in view of the guidelines issued by

the three Member High Powered Committee and as per the policy

approved by the HSPCB in a meeting dated 09.03.2009.


</p><p id="p_15">7.        It is further the case of HSPCB that the order dated

11.05.2009 to forfeit amount of Rs. 12.25 lacs, out of Bank

Guarantee, was well reasoned and supported by sufficient material.

Still, however, the Appellate Authority erroneously interfered with the

said order and quashed the directions issued by the HSPCB vide the

order impugned. The impugned order passed by the Appellate Board

is incorrect and improper. Hence, the Applicant (HSPCB) challenged

the said order by filing CWP No. 10832/2010, in the Hon'ble High

Court of Punjab and Haryana.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">8.        The Writ Petition was transferred to this Tribunal by

Hon'ble High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana vide order dated 22.01.2013.

In the meanwhile, the Distillery was allowed to run under interim

orders of the Hon'ble High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    6</span>
</p><p id="p_19"> 9.        M/s. Haryana Organics contended that due compliance of

the directions was made much before the forfeiture of 25% of the

Bank Guarantee.       It was further clarified that RO/Nano filtration

system was installed and made operational.          It was, therefore,

contended that forfeiture of the 25% amount of Bank Guarantee was

illegal and as such the order of the HSPCB was liable to be quashed.


</p><p id="p_20">10.       The Appellate Authority heard the parties and allowed the

Appeal.   The Appellate Authority directed to refund the forfeited

amount of Rs. 12.25 lacs to M/s. Haryana Organics. Being aggrieved

with such order of the Appellate Authority, the Writ Petition was filed

by the HSPCB, which is now the subject matter of the present

Appeal/Application.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">11.       We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties in extenso.

On behalf of the Appellant (HSPCB), Learned Sr. Counsel Mr.

Narender Hooda contended that directions under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_10">Section 33-A</a> of the

Water Act could be given in order to seek due compliance of the safety

measures viz. installation of RO/Nano filtration system and that is

why the Bank Guarantee also could be demanded. He contended that

forfeiture of the 25% of the Bank Guarantee is within the powers of

the HSPCB in as much as the installation of the RO/Nano filtration

system was not done within the timeframe as per the Pert chart

provided by M/s Haryana Organics.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">12.       He argued that the forfeiture was effected after issuing the

notice dated 11.05.2009, on finding that there was non-explanation of

the delay caused in installation of the required acoustic enclosure on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   7</span>
 DG set, non-submission of analysis report of bottle washing section

and non-compliance of zero discharge. He submitted that forfeiture of

the Bank Guarantee was in accordance with the policy approved by

the Pollution Board in its meeting dated 09.03.2009. He contended

that the Appellate Authority committed error while holding that the

forfeiture of the Bank Guarantee to the tune of Rs. 12.25 lacs is void.

He invited our attention to the observations of the Appellate Authority

in paragraph (9) of the impugned order and the concluding paragraph

thereof.   According to the Learned Sr. Counsel, there is internal

contradiction between the observations of the Appellate Authority and

hence the impugned order is liable to be set aside. He submitted that

the Appellate Authority failed to appreciate that the action of the

HSPCB was in accordance with the directions of the three Member

High Powered Committee constituted by the Apex Court. He urged,

therefore, to allow the Appeal and set aside the impugned order.


</p><p id="p_25">13.        Per contra, Learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted

that the HSPCB had no legal authority to ask for Bank Guarantee

from the Respondent nor had power to forfeit any part thereof. He

further submitted that the Respondent had furnished the Bank

Guarantee under compulsion and at the most it could be treated as

security for due compliance of the directions to install RO/Nano

filtration system as per the earlier direction of the HSPCB. He argued

that the Respondent, in fact, installed the RO/Nano filtration system

as directed by the HSPCB. The due compliances were verified by the

authorized officer of the HSPCB and as such, forfeiture of the 25% of

Bank Guarantee was uncalled for. He further contended that there

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8</span>
 was some delay in installation of the RO/Nano filtration system due to

delay on part of the concerned dealers of the said system to deliver the

goods and arrange for the installation thereof. He argued, therefore,

that the forfeiture of the part of the Bank Guarantee amounts to penal

action without legal authority and without any reasonable basis for

the same. Hence, he supported the impugned order.


</p><p id="p_26">14.         Having considered rival submissions and the pleadings of

the parties, we are of the opinion that the real controversy falls within

narrow compass. The controversial issue involved may be stated as

follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "Whether, in the facts and circumstances of the present

            case, HSPCB could have legally forfeited 25% of the Bank

            Guarantee amount and hence the impugned order is

            unsustainable" ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">
</blockquote><p id="p_28">15.         At the threshold, it is worthwhile to note that the HSPCB

called upon the Distillery to furnish Bank Guarantee of Rs. 50.00


lacs as a commitment for commissioning of RO/Nano filtration

system as per the target specified in this behalf. The direction asking

the Respondent to furnish the Bank Guarantee, was issued by the

HSPCB in accordance with the recommendations of the three Member

High Powered Committee constituted by the Apex Court in order to

monitor the time bound programme for commissioning of RO/Nano

filtration system in the plant of the Distillery of M/s Haryana Organics

like that of all the other Distilleries in the State of Haryana, to achieve

zero discharge. The Directions may be reproduced as below : -

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     9</span>
</p><p id="p_29">       "the committee decided that the HSPCB will direct the unit

(Respondent) to submit a time bound programme for completion of the

installation of RO/Nano filtration system along with the Bank

Guarantee of Rs. 50.00 Lacs as a commitment for commissioning of

RO/Nano filtration system as per the targets to be specified by HSPCB

in the direction. The unit will be visited jointly by CPCB and HSPCB in

December, 2007 for verification of the compliance"


</p><p id="p_30">                      (Emphasis supplied by us)


</p><p id="p_31">16.       On plain reading of the aforementioned direction of the

three Member High Powered Committee, it is manifestly clear that the

Bank Guarantee was sought as a commitment for commissioning of

the RO/Nano filtration system in accordance with the time bound

programme that the Respondent - Distillery was required to submit to

the HSPCB. In other words, the purpose to seek the Bank Guarantee

of Rs. 50.00 lacs was to ensure installation of the RO/Nano filtration

system within the time frame as per the programme. Obviously, as

and when the compliance was made by the Respondent (Distillery),

the purpose of the Bank Guarantee could be treated as accomplished.

It is clear, therefore, that the continuation of the Bank Guarantee

after due compliance of the installation of RO/Nano filtration system

was not required. For, the purpose was to obtain security by way of

the Bank Guarantee to ensure the compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">17.       Now, it is pertinent to note that the direction of the three

Member    High   Powered    Committee     to   the   HSPCB   and   the

consequential direction of the HSPCB to the Respondent (Distillery)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   10</span>
 was not by way of mutual agreement between the parties. There is no

forfeiture clause provided under any terms agreed between the parties

i.e. HSPCB and M/s. Haryana Organics. It is well settled that unless

there is forfeiture clause specified in the bilateral agreement, no party

is entitled to forfeit the security amount, after the compliance is made

in accordance with the directions issued by the competent authority.

Needless to say, HSPCB could not have unilaterally directed forfeiture

of the part of such Bank Guarantee given by M/s. Haryana Organics.


</p><p id="p_34">18.        Apart from absence of mutual contract between the parties,

particularly, in the context of forfeiture clause, it cannot be overlooked

that HSPCB acted under directions/guidelines issued by the three

Member High Powered Committee appointed by the Apex Court in

order to achieve zero effluent discharge by the Distilleries operating in

the State of Haryana.      It was necessary, therefore, that further

directions ought to have been sought from the three Member High

Powered Committee which could have perhaps got it vetted from the

Apex Court, if at all any forfeiture was required to be done. On its

own, HSPCB could not do so without concurrence of the three

Member High Powered Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">19.        Coming to the question of powers of HSPCB to give any

direction under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_11">Section 33</a> - <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">A of the Water Act</a>, it is true, no doubt,

that the provision commences with non-obstante clause and over

rides any other provision contained in any other law. The section may

be reproduced as follows, for the purpose of ready reference, in order

to properly interpret the same:-

17</a> of the Water Act.          As per Clause 17(1)(l)(i) function of the State

Board shall be to make, vary or revoke any order for prevention,

control or abatement of discharges of waste into streams or wells. One

of its functions is also to require any person concerned to construct

new systems for the disposal of sewage and trade effluent or to

modify, alter or extend any such existing system or to adopt such

remedial measures as are necessary to prevent, control or abate water

pollution [(17)(1)(l)(ii)].    It is under the said provision that HSPCB

could have directed M/s Haryana Organics to install the new


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                         12</span>
 RO/Nano filtration systems to ensure zero discharge of effluents.    In

"M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India" (2004) 6 SCC 588 it is observed:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "Though the Government has power to give directions, that power

      should be used only to effectuate and further goals of the

      approved scheme, zonal plans, etc.; and the land vested under the

      used for any other public purposes within the area envisaged

Act, the State Board has power to grant consent to operate on

condition as it may impose.     It may also refuse such consent for

reasons to be recorded in writing. It appears that when consent to

operate is granted, the State Board has to specify the conditions

which the unit is required to comply with. It is only when the State

Board decides to refuse such consent that there is duty cast to record

reasons in writing. Under <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_15">Section 27(2)</a>, the State Board has power to

<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">23.         If we read all the relevant provisions together with <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_24">Section

33</a> - <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_25">A of the Water Act</a>, it is clear that State Board has power to issue

any direction to secure performance of its functions under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water

Act</a>.   It is imperative that the directions to be issued by the State

Board must have reasonable nexus with due performance of its

functions under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_27">Water Act</a>.      The Bank guarantee was obtained

from M/s Haryana Organics in order to ensure due compliance of the

directions to install RO/Nano filtration system for the purpose of

securing zero discharge of the industrial effluents. In our opinion, the

Bank Guarantee was sought to achieve particular purpose and if any

deficiency was noticed by the HSPCB, till the removal of such

deficiency, the Bank Guarantee could have been renewed by

extending validity thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">24.         In our opinion, the Bank guarantee or any part thereof

could not be forfeited unilaterally without there being any specific

term incorporated under any mutual agreement.            We must not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                    15</span>
 overlook the very purpose of demanding Bank guarantee from any

industrial unit, trading firm, contractor, etc. The sole purpose is to

secure due compliance of the terms and conditions which are

mutually agreed by the parties. In the present case, neither there was

mutual agreement as such nor was any direction issued by the

HSPCB to M/s Haryana Organics to ensure compliances in the

exercise of power available under <a href="/doc/1837118/" id="a_28">Section 30</a> of the Water Act. The

direction was given by HSPCB to furnish the Bank Guarantee as per

the guidelines issued by the three Member High Powered Committee

nominated by the Apex Court. Under the circumstances, HSPCB had

no legal authority, power and competence to forfeit any part of the

Bank Guarantee furnished by M/s Haryana Organics.


</p><p id="p_54">25.        For the sake of argument, we may assume that HSPCB had

the power to give direction to forfeit Rs. 12.25 lacs out of Bank

Guarantee amount of Rs. 50 lacs. Even so, such direction cannot be

issued without following due procedure as contemplated under the

Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1975.          Rule 34

requires State Board to serve concerned person with a copy of the

proposed direction and to give an opportunity of hearing. <a href="/doc/1730116/" id="a_29">Section 34</a>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">26.        We find that HSPCB did not comply with the due procedure

as envisaged in Rule 34 (3) of the Water Rules. For this reason too,

the forfeiture of 25% of the Bank Guarantee furnished by M/s

Haryana Organics was illegal and improper.          We do not find any

substantial internal contradiction between the observations of the

Appellate Authority in paragraph (9) of the impugned order and the

concluding paragraph thereof.     We may state here that the Appellate

Authority categorically held that forfeiture of Rs. 12.25 lacs was

arbitrary and even demand of Bank Guarantee had no basis.             The

Appellate Authority held that demand for the Bank Guarantee was

coercive, unjust and unreasonable. Still, however, the Appellate

Authority made passing observation that the HSPCB may reconsider

the matter in order to satisfy apprehension of M/s Haryana Organics

about the basis and quantification of Bank Guarantee.         However, it

was further observed that if M/s Haryana Organics had any grievance

about the forfeiture, it can again approach the Appellate Authority on

that issue because imposition of the Bank Guarantee showed that the

HSPBC had been very unkind to M/s Haryana Organics.                   The

observations in paragraph (9) of the impugned order cannot be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                    17</span>
 branded as final finding of the Appellate Authority, though, the

observations are unhappily worded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">
</blockquote><p id="p_56">27.         The Appellate Authority took note of the fact that

installation of RO/Nano filtration system was done by M/s Haryana

Organics and as such the directions had been duly complied with.

What appears from the record is that previously M/s Haryana

Organics was using molasses as raw material for distillation of

rectified spirit.   The use of molasses was, however, discontinued at

subsequent stage and the Distillery switched over to use of grains as

raw material for production of rectified spirit. It is obvious that the

pollution level was much controlled due to the change of the raw

material.    In this view of the matter, and particularly, after due

installation of the RO/Nano filtration system by M/s Haryana

Organics, the forfeiture was uncalled for.

<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">28.         Cumulative effect of the forgoing discussion is that the

forfeiture of part of the Bank guarantee by HSPCB, was without any

legal basis and arbitrary. We do not find, therefore, any merit in the

present Appeal filed by the HSPCB. We do not, however, find it proper

to impose any cost on the Appellant (HSPCB) in as much as M/s

Haryana Organics had adopted dilly-dallying tactics and had not

followed the time bound programme as per the directions of the

HSPCB.
