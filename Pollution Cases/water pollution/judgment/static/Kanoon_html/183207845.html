ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                  Vide this order, I will dispose of an application under order 39 Rule 1 

and 2 CPC moved by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                In brief, the suit of the plaintiff is that he is running a proprietorship firm 

in   the   name   of   "Ashok   Engineering   Works"   and   is   engaged   in   the   business   of 

"electroplating". He is also a registered electricity consumer of defendant no.1 vide 

CA No. 000100031545 for a sanctioned load of 24 KW.  Further states that he has a 

license  of  NDMC   to   run  his  aforesaid   factory   and  has  also   got  "consent"  as per 

provisions of Air ( Prevention and Control of Pollution ) Act, 1981 (for short "<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Air 

Pollution Act</a>") and there has been no violation of any provision of the said Act. 

</p><p id="p_3">                Plaintiff   alleges   that   on   23.12.2015,   defendant   no.1   disconnected   his 

electricity supply without any rhyme, reason or show cause notice. Upon enquiry, it 

was orally informed to plaintiff at the office of defendant that the disconnection was 


             C.S No.  14/16                Sachin Mathur vs  BSES YPL                                          1/6
 done on the directions of defendant no.2 i.e. Delhi Pollution  Control Comittee (for 

short "DPCC"). As per plaintiff, he did receive a show cause notice dated 28.10.2015 

from DPCC, however he is not in violation of any provision of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Air Pollution Act</a> and 

had submitted a reply dated 30.03.2015 to the said show cause notice, denying the 

allegations made in the same.  Moreover he also holds a certificate of consent order 

issued by DPCC,  therefore show cause notice got satisfied. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">               Plaintiff alleges that despite no order of DPCC or any other authority for 

disconnection of electricity, defendant no.1 had disconnected the same without giving 

any opportunity of being heard to the plaintiff. Due to disconnection of electricity he 

has suffered heavy losses in his business.  Accordingly, this suit has been filed by him 

seeking direction to defendant no.1 to restore his electricity. Initially suit was filed 

only against BSES YPL, however vide Order dated 04.02.2016 of this court, plaintiff 

was directed to implead DPCC as a party to the suit as defendant no.2. 

</p><p id="p_5">                Written   Statement   has   been   filed   by   both   the   defendants.   In   its   W.S, 

defendant no.1 admits that plaintiff is availing electricity connection from it and is 

regularly   making   payment   of   the   bills.   However   it   is   submitted   that   plaintiff   is 

engaged   in   the   electroplating   business,   which   is   within   the   list   of   33   seriously 

polluting industries (SPIs) and plaintiff has failed to show any valid "consent" to 

operate his industry. The plaintiff has consent to operate his factory only till the year 

2008 and no further consent has been given by the DPCC thereafter. Further states 

that   electricity   connection   of   plaintiff   has   been   disconnected   only   because   of   the 

directions issued by DPCC which was further in compliance with direction of Hon'ble 


             C.S No.  14/16                Sachin Mathur vs  BSES YPL                                          2/6
 National Green Tribunal. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">                It  is  further  stated  that  defendant  no.1 has  no  objection  to  restore  the 

electricity of plaintiff if he obtains consent order from DPCC. It is also stated that the 

very issuance of show cause notice by DPCC to the plaintiff shows that there is no 

valid   consent   to   operate   in   favour   of   plaintiff   and   he   is   presuming   existence   of 

consent as per his on interpretation and interest.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">                W.S has been filed on behalf of defendant no.2 stating that civil court 

lacks jurisdiction to entertain suit or proceeding in view of <a href="/doc/192574007/" id="a_3">Section 22</a>, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">46</a> and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">58</a> of 

Environment Act, 1986, the Air ( Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and 

The water ( Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, respectively. Further 

states that in view of Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in para no. 39 of AIR 

2012, SC 3081, any cases filed or pending prior to the coming to force of National 

Green Tribunal (for short "NGT"), has to be transferred to NGT and this suit is not 

maintainable. It is further stated that in the entire plaint, there is no cause of action 

qua DPCC, hence the suit is liable to be dismissed. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">                It was denied that there was any valid consent given by DPCC in favour 

of plaintiff or that plaintiff is complying with environment laws. It is submitted that 

plaintiff had obtained consent from DPCC which was valid only till 13.05.2008 and 

there is no subsequent consent given to him. The unit of plaintiff is engaged in the 

activity of electroplating (job work) which has been identified as seriously polluting 

industry.   Further   the   unit   of   plaintiff   is   situated   at   Anand   Parbat   Industrial   Area 

which is redevelopment area and does not have Common Effluent Treatment Plant 


             C.S No.  14/16                Sachin Mathur vs  BSES YPL                                          3/6
 (CETP) to treat the waste water generated from the said industrial area. Therefore, no 

consent as well as authorization is being granted to the units situated there. Further 

states that plaintiff had applied for renewal of consent on 14.06.2012 for three years 

but the same was not granted. It was however denied that any direction has been 

given by DPCC to defendant no.1 for disconnection of electricity. 

</p><p id="p_9">                It is also stated that the Hon'ble NGT vide its order dated 17.11.2014 in 

OA No. 196/14 had constituted State Level Committee for compliance of various 

directions relating to seriously polluting industries operating without consent from 

the   pollution   Control   Board   including   directions   for   closure.   In   subsequent 

proceedings, it was also decided that if any seriously polluting industries are found, 

the same shall be closed within four weeks by DPCC. The other contentions were 

denied and prayer is made for dismissal of suit. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">                Vide   this   application   U/o   39   Rule   1   and   2   CPC,   plaintiff   is   seeking 

temporary injunction that defendant no.1 be directed to restore his electricity supply 

and not to disconnect it during the pendency of the suit. Reply has been filed by 

defendant opposing the said application on the same ground as taken in the W.S 

                I  have  heard  arguments  advanced  by  the  Ld.  counsels  for  parties and 

carefully perused the record.  The law is well settled regarding the grant of interim 

injunction.   Applicant   has   to   prove   three   basic   ingredients   for   grant   of   interim 

injunction:
</p>
                                1. existence of prima facie case.                                 <pre id="pre_2">

                                2. balance of convenience


             C.S No.  14/16                Sachin Mathur vs  BSES YPL                                          4/6
                                 3. irreparable injury

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                As far as prima facie case is concerned, it has not been denied on behalf 

of plaintiff that the business of electroplating does not fall under the category of 

seriously polluting industries. It is also admitted by his counsel during arguments that 

plaintiff does not have a written consent order from DPCC for the year 2016 though 

this fact is not mentioned in plaint. Plaintiff's contention however is that he is having 

a   valid   implied   consent   from   DPCC   since   he   had   moved   an   application   dated 

14.06.2012 seeking consent for five years and this application was not rejected by the 

defendant   no.2.   As   per   Section   25   (7)   of   <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water   Pollution   Act</a>,   if   the   concerned 

authority does not reply or reject the application within a period of four months, it 

shall be deemed that consent has been granted. Hence in view of the above provision, 

plaintiff is deemed to be having a valid consent in law as his application was neither 

replied   nor   rejected.   On   court   query,   counsel   for   plaintiff   has   however   failed   to 

disclose for how many years, this implied consent shall be deemed to be in force in 

law   but   insists   that   the   same   has   to   be   treated   for   a   period   as   mentioned   in   the 

application of plaintiff i.e. 5 years. </blockquote><p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">                Perusal of record shows that the previous consent order which was passed 

in favour of plaintiff, was only for a period of three years till year 2008 and under 

such   circumstances,   if   at   all,   any   presumption   is   to   be   drawn   that   there   was   an 

implied consent in favour of plaintiff, it ought to be treated only for a period of three 

years and not for a period of five years. Even otherwise, after issuance of show cause 

notice by defendant no.2 against the plaintiff, the said implied consent if any, cannot 


             C.S No.  14/16                Sachin Mathur vs  BSES YPL                                          5/6
 be deemed to be still in force. Moreover this show cause notice of defendant no.2 has 

not got satisfied as has been falsely mentioned by plaintiff in his plaint but defendant 

no.2 is mulling further action against plaintiff as per law. 

</p><p id="p_13">                It is further pertinent to mention that plaintiff has not denied the fact that 

the area wherein his factory is located, does not have any common effluent treatment 

plant (CETP) though it was contended during arguments that plaintiff will comply 

with   all   provisions   of   law   as   required   in   this   regard.   However   the   court   cannot 

presume what will happen in future and can only take into consideration, the present 

circumstances. Having considered all the facts and circumstances, in my considered 

opinion, till the time plaintiff obtains a valid written consent order from defendant no.

2,   he   is   not   entitled   to   any   interim   relief   from   this   court   especially   in   view   of 

directions given by Hon'ble NGT from time to time qua seriously polluting industries. 

</p><p id="p_14">                I do not find any prima facie case in favour of plaintiff.  hence there is no 

need   for   discussing   the   other   requirements   of   interim   relief   regarding   balance   of 

convenience and irreparable loss. With these observations, the injunction application 

of plaintiff U/o 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC stands dismissed.

<p id="p_15">                It   is   clarified   that   nothing   mentioned   herein   shall   tantamount   to 

expression of opinion on the merits of the case.
