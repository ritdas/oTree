<p id="p_2">[Delivered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Devi Prasad Singh]
 
</p><p id="p_3">1.	Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India has been preferred being aggrieved with ""no objection certificate"" issued by U.P. Pollution Control Board (in short hereinafter referred as Board) to respondent No.10 and 11 to run the brick-kiln in utter disregard to statutory provisions and Rules regulating the conditions provided for the purpose.  Respondent No.11, Shri Jai Prakash, who according to the  petitioner's counsel, is Vidhan Sabha Prabhari of the Amethi Ruling Party of the State of U.P.  entered into an agreement for lease of land bearing Gata No. 529, village Mochawa, Police Station, Amethi, District, Chhatrapati Sahu Ji Maharaj Nagar, U.P. The said agreement was registered on 15th May, 2010 in the office of Sub-Registrar, Amethi.   Admittedly, land belongs to Shri Vijay Kumar Singh, Shri Bhola Singh and Shri Samarjeet Singh, S/o Sri Tej Bahadur Singh, who have given it on lease rent for the period of 20 years to Sri Jai Prakash subject to payment of Rs.15,000/- as annual rent.  However, a case has been set-up in para-6 of the counter affidavit that since opposite party No. 11 could not run the brick-kiln, he let out on rent for the period of ten years on yearly rent of Rs.15,000/- to the respondent No. 10.  After obtaining the land from the respondent No.10, respondent No.11 started to construct the brick-kiln, which seems to opposed by the petitioners on the ground that brick-kiln is situated within the prohibited distance provided by the Rules of Zila Parishad, which is being followed by  Board.  Though in appeal, the license as well as "no objection certificate" was set-aside by the appellate authority, but later on fresh "no objection certificate" was granted by the Board  and brick-kiln was energized sometimes after March, 2011. Respondent no. 10 and 11, purported to restart the brick kiln on the basis of ""no objection certificate"" issued by the Board.  Accordingly, a prayer has been made for quashing of ""no objection certificate"" granted by the Board. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.	While assailing the opening of brick-kiln by respondents Nos. 10 and 11, the petitioner stated that brick-kiln is situated within the distance of 200 meter from the abadi of village Mochwa. The school, grove land or orchard are also situated within the prohibited distance.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.	Against the grant of first ""no objection certificate"" to run the brick-kiln, the petitioner had filed a writ petition No. 6653 (M/B) of 2010, in which, by order dated 10.08.2010, this Court had directed the statutory appellate authority to decide the controversy treating the memo of the writ petition as an appeal.  The petitioner, along with copy of memo of writ petition and order dated 10.08.2010 of this Court passed in the aforesaid writ petition, had filed an appeal No. 17 of 2010, under Section 31 (2) of the Air (Pollution &amp; <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_2">Control) Act</a>, 1981. However, the Appellate Authority had not decided the appeal within the stipulated period of two months as provided by this Court and the respondent Nos. 10 and 11 completed the construction of brick-kiln over Gata No. 521.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.	Subject to aforesaid backdrop, the petitioner had filed another writ petition No. 170 (M/B) of 2011 in this Court. In the said writ petition, this Court, by order dated 07.1.2011, directed the District Magistrate as well as Superintendent of Police of the District to restrain the respondent Nos. 10 and 11 from starting the brick-kiln.  The order dated 7.1.2011 passed by this Court directing the authorities not to permit to function the brick-kiln, has been filed as Annexure No. 9 to the writ petition. The operative portion of the order dated 07.1.2011 is reproduced as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">"In the meantime, in case Abadi land is situated less than the distance of 200 metres, then the district authorities i.e., District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police concerned, shall ensure that brick kiln of private respondent does not function at the place in question." 
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.	While passing the aforesaid interim order, this Court also directed the Board as to why Rules have not been framed and how the Board has granted ""no objection certificate"" in spite of the fact that brick-kiln is situated at the distance of 137 meter from abadi land in violation of Rules as well as the order passed by this Court in one other case, bearing FAFO No. 208 of 2010, decided on 7.3.2010.  After receipt of interim order dated 7.1.2011, spot inspection was done by four Lekhpal and one Revenue Inspector in pursuance to the order passed by the District Authorities.  A detailed report was submitted by the revenue authorities on 22.1.2011 to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Tehsil Amethi of the district. Copy of the report has been filed as Annexure 10 to the writ petition along with sketch map.  The report in its totality is reproduced as under :-

<p id="p_10">6.	From perusal of the aforesaid report, there appears to be no reason to disbelieve the petitioner's contention that brick-kiln is situated at the distance of 170 meter towards South-East and the distance of primary pathshala is 213 meters. The newly constructed house of petitioner and his brother bearing plot no. 543 is situated at the distance of 137 and 26 meters from brick kiln. However, the main abadi land is situated at the distance of 137 meters. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">7.	It appears that another inspection was done by Tehsildar, Amethi in pursuance to the petitioners' complaint dated 9.6.2010, who submitted a report that mango orchard and the abadi land are situated within the distance of 200 hundred meters from the brick-kiln. A copy of the report submitted by the Tehsildar, Amethi, which was forwarded to Additional District Magistrate/Finance &amp; Revenue, Amethi by Sub Division Magistrate, has been filed as Annexure No. 11 to the writ petition.  The report of the Deputy Collector in its totality is reproduced as under:

It appears that interim order dated 7.1.2011 passed by this Court in the aforesaid writ petition no. 170 (M/B) of 2011 was not complied with; hence, the petitioner had filed the contempt petition. However, in the meantime, Appeal No. 17 of 2010 (supra) was allowed by the Appellate Authority by an order dated 17.2.2011 and ""no objection certificate""  granted to the respondents Nos. 10 and 11 to run the brick-kiln was found to be illegal, hence rejected.   A copy of the order of the statutory appellate authority dated 17.2.2011 has been filed as Annexure No. 2 to the writ petition. The Appellate Authority has considered the report of the Lekhpal, Tehsildar and Sub Divisional Magistrate (supra) and formed opinion that the brick-kiln is situated within the prohibited area.

Being no interim order passed by this Court and for some unforeseen reasons, respondent No.11 had filed an application for withdrawal of writ petition No. 1248 (M/S) of 2011, which was preferred against the appellate order (supra).

<p id="p_50">In view of the above the inspection report is submitted, for kind perusal, before the Hon'ble High Court."
</p>
<p id="p_51">14.	From the plain reading of Advocate Commissioner's report it appears that the brick kiln is situated within the prohibited area as notified under Zila Parishad Adhiniyam(supra), which has been adopted by the "Board".  One unusual feature which has been brought on record is that in spite of dismissal of appeal another "no objection certificate" was issued and in pursuance thereof respondent no. 11 is running the brick kiln.  This fact pleaded in writ petition has not been denied while filing counter affidavit. Instead of complying with the order passed by this court, Board had issued "no objection certificate" again to respondent no. 11 to run the brick kiln.  Such action on the part of "Board" is disturbing and antithesis to rule of law.
</p>
<p id="p_52">15.	Attention has been invited towards one earlier judgment of this court passed in FAFO No. 208 of 2010. While considering the appeal it was found that Board had not framed rules in pursuance to relevant act. Ultimately in pursuance to judgement and order dated 17.3.2012 which has been upheld by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and SLP has been dismissed, respondent took decision to frame rules. In pursuance to aforesaid judgement of this Court of which one of us was Member (Justice Devi Prasad Singh) rules have been framed and notified on 27.6.2012.  Rule has been given effect from the date of publication i.e. 27.6.2012 and being prospective effect it seems to not applicable to adjudicate the present controversy.  However, for convenience Rule 2 of the Rule containing conditions to run brick kiln is reproduced as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_53">"2.	Subject to provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Promotion and Protection of Fruit Trees (Regulation of Harmful Establishment and Housing Schemes) Act, 1985, a brick kiln shall not be established which does not fulfill the following conditions:-
</p>
<p id="p_54">(i)a brick kiln shall not be established with in a distance of 5.0 kilometers from the area of a Muncipal Council or Municipal Corporation. subject to the above restrictions a brick kiln shall be established at least 500 meters away from residential area having population of more than 150 persons or more than 20 houses whether kachha or pucca;
</p>
<p id="p_55">(ii)a brick kilns not be established at a place within the distance of 1.0 kilometer from registered hospital, school, public building, religious places or a place from where flammable substances are stored; a brick kiln shall not be established within a radius of 5.0 kilometers in notified sensitive area of a zoo, wild life sanctuaries historic monuments, museum and the like:
</p>
<p id="p_56">Provided that in case of Taj Trapezium Zone Area (T.T.Z.) the directions/guidelines given by the Supreme Court from time to time, shall apply;
</p>
<p id="p_57">(iii)a brick kiln shall not be established within a distance of 200 meters from the sides of the railway tracks;
</p>
<p id="p_58">(iv)a brick kiln shall not be established within a distance of 300 meters from both sides of the National and State Highways;
</p>
<p id="p_59">(v)a brick kiln shall not be established within a distance of 100 meters from both sides of a main district road/public works department roads;
</p>
<p id="p_60">(vi)a brick kiln shall not be established within 800 meters froma brick kiln already established;
</p>
<p id="p_61">(vii)a brick kiln should not be allowed to install in the 'Buffer Zone' of a notified fruit belt area as defined in 'The Uttar Pradesh Promotion and Protection of Fruit Trees (Regulation of Harmful Establishments and Housing Schemes) Act, 1985' and the restriction made by the competent authority concerned or decision of court on case to case basis, if any.
</p>
<p id="p_62">Distance from sides of mango orchard/Mixed fruits (Mango and other) Orchard (having at least 100 fruiting trees) joint nursery from brick kiln shall not be less than 800 meters in each direction.  The mentioned distances are applicable irrespective of the variety/type of fruit area individually or collectively should not be less than 2.5 acre."
</p>
<p id="p_63">16.	In spite of the aforesaid notified rule since controversy relate back to period prior to it, we have to look into it in pursuance to rules framed by the Zila Parishad referred in the preceding paras being adopted by the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_64">17.	To sum up, from the bye-laws regulating the establishment of brick kiln etc. during the period in question, no brick kiln could have been established within 200 meter of abadi, public building, hospital, school.  Further no brick kiln could have been established from east and west side of mango grove within the distance of 1.5 Kilometer and on north-south side within the distance of 300 meters.
</p>
<p id="p_65">18.	The report of different revenue authorities including the Advocate Commissioner appointed by this Court seems to reveal that not only the petitioner's house is situated within 200 meter but house of other villagers existing in the abadi like Shri Sukhlal, Smt. Rajpati and Sri Ramcharan (supra) are situated within the distance of 200 meter.  Similarly, the distance of brick kiln from mango groove is also within the radius of 300 meter (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_66">19.	Thus, from the material on record, there appears to be no room of doubt that the brick kiln established by respondent no. 10 and 11 is situated within the prohibited distance and in violation of rules.
</p>
<p id="p_67">20.	Learned counsel for the respondents tried to make out a case with submission that distance should be measured from the mid of village. 
</p>
<p id="p_68">	Argument advanced by learned counsel for the private respondents seems to be misconceived.  The prohibition with regard to establishment of brick kiln beyond the distance provided by the rule is to save citizen from pollution and variety of disease. Hence, distance must be measured from the outer skirt of the abadi land to secure the interest of each and every village/citizen.
</p>
<p id="p_69">21.	Learned counsel for the petitioner has invited attention to number of problems from which the citizen may suffer because of emission from brick kiln. The emission from brick kiln is in the form of Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon monoxide, Oxides of nitrogen and Ash and ethylene etc.  The effect of these pollutant as pointed out by the petitioner's counsel are as under:- 
</p>
<p id="p_70">Sl. No.
 
Pollutants of Brick Kiln
 
Fatal Diseases cause to human beings
 
</p><p id="p_71">11.
 
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)
 
Breathing rate increase while breathing itself becomes less deep and a general feeling of air starvation is experienced-some even show signs of Bronchial spasms and asthmatic are badly affected.  Any So2 which oxidizes to SO3 may dissolve in the body fluids to form H2S04, a very strong and corrosive acid.
</p>
<p id="p_72">  2.
 
Carbon monoxide (CO)
 
CO combines with the haemoglobin in the blood to form cargboxy haemoglobin and when about half of the hemoglobin of the blood is used up, death ensues as the carboxy hamemoglobin is useless for respiratory purposes.  Person poisoned by carbon monoxide exhibit a characterisitc bright pink colour of the fresh due to the presence of carboxy haemoglobin in the blood.
</p>
<p id="p_73">  3.
 
Oxides of nitrogen (NO2) &amp; Ash
 
Prolonged exposure of human beings to even low concentration of oxides of nitrogen, can cause a chronic irritation of the respiratory tract, headech, loss of appetite and corrosion of teeth, Nitric Oxides reacts with air to form brown nitrogen dioxide which is very poisonous.
</p>
<p id="p_74">  4.
 
Ethylene
 
Eye irritation as a result of photochemical reaction with nitrogen oxides and ozone
 

 
</p><p id="p_75">22.	Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that consumption of coal in the brick kiln emerges (38 times per cent 5 by weight) 0.4536 Kg. Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) per burning of 1000 Kg. 
</p>
<p id="p_76">23.	Now it is well settled proposition of law that right to life, right  to quality of life, right of fresh air, right of unpolluted water are all basic rights protected by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India vide (2003) 6 SCC 1 Kapila Hingorani versus State of Bihar, AIR 1991 SC 1902 Bangalore Medical Trust versus M.S. Muddappa and others, 2001 Vol. 6 SCC 496 Hinch Lal Tiwari versus Kamala Devi, AIR 2007 SC 1046 Milkman Colony Vikas Samiti versus State of Rajasthan and others and 2006 Vol. 13 SCC 382 Nagar Nigam versus Al Faheem Meat Export (P) Limited.
</p>
<p id="p_77">24.	Since, fundamental right to inhale fresh air is available to each and every villager, distance should be measured from the edge of abadi land or from the outskirt of abadi where houses are situated.  It may be relevant to  point out that fundamental right protected by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India is available to citizens collectively as well as individually.  Construction of brick kiln at later stage within prohibited area of individual house shall also not be permissible.  Of course, in case, some construction is raised after the establishment of brick kiln in that event it is for the Board to take a decision keeping in view the facts and circumstances of each case and ground realities to secure the interest of citizen.
</p>
<p id="p_78">25.	In (1996) 5 SCC 647, Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum Vs. Union of India and others, Hon'ble Supreme Court had reiterated the judicially evolve principle "polluter pay" as well as "sustainable development". With regard to sustainable development their Lordship (three Member Bench) of Supreme Court in Vellore's case (supra) observed as under:- 
</p>
<p id="p_79"> 11. Some  of	the  salient   principles  of	"Sustainable Development", as culled-out from Brundtland Report and other international documents,  are Inter-Generational Equity, Use and  Conservation   of	 Nature  Resources, Environmental Protection, the   Precautionary  Principle,  Polluter	Pays principle, Obligation  to assist  and cooperate, Eradication of  Poverty  and  Financial  Assistance to the  developing countries.  We	 are, however,	of  the   vies  that	"The Precautionary Principle"  and "The  Polluter Pays" principle are essential  features of  "Sustainable Development". The "Precautionary Principle"  - in the context of the municipal law - means:
</p>
<p id="p_80">(i)  Environment measures - by the State Government and the statutory Authorities must anticipate,  prevent' and attack the causes of environmental degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_81">(ii) Where there  are threats  of serious  and	irreversible  damage lack  of scientific certainly should not be used as the  reason  for  postponing, measures to  prevent     environmental depredation.
</p>
<p id="p_82">(iii)The  "Onus  of  proof"   is  on	the actor   or	the   developer/industrial  to show  that his  action  is   environmentally benign."
</p>
<p id="p_83">26.	While considering the principle of "polluter pay", their Lordship has considered Articles 47, 48A and 51A(g) of the Constitution of India and made following observations:-
</p>
<p id="p_84">"12.     "The Polluter  Pays" principle  has been  held to	be a sound principle by this  Court Indian	Council for  Enviro-Legal Action vs. Union of India J.T. 1996 (2) 196. The Court observed, "We  are of the opinion that any principle evolved in this 'behalf should be simple practical and suited to the conditions obtaining  in this country". The Court ruled that "Once the  activity carried  on is  hazardous or  inherently dangerous, the person carrying on such activity is liable to make good  the loss  caused  to	 any  other  person  by his activity irrespective of the fact whether he took reasonable care   while carrying  on his activity. The rule is premised upon  the   very  nature   of  the   activity  carried on".
</p>
<p id="p_85">Consequently  the   polluting  industries   are "absolutely liable	to  compensate	for the  harm	caused by  them  to villagers in  the affected  area, to  the soil	and to the underground water  and hence, they are	bound to  take all necessary measures  to remove  sludge and  other  pollutants lying in  the affected areas". The "Polluter Pays" principle as  interpreted by  this  Court  means that  the  absolute liability for  harm to the environment extends not only to compensate the	victims of  pollution but  also the  cost of restoring the  environmental degradation. Remediation of the damaged environment  is part  of the process of "Sustainable Development" and  as such polluter is liable to pay the cost to the individual sufferers as well as the cost of reversing the damaged ecology.
</p>
<p id="p_86">13.     The  precautionary principle  and the  polluter pays principle have been accepted as part of the law of the land. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article	 21</a>   of  the	Constitution  of   India  guarantees protection of  life and	 personal liberty.  Articles 47, 48A and 51A(g) of the Constitution are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     "47. Duty of the State to raise the  level of nutrition and the standard  of living and  to	improve  public  health. The  State shall regard the  raising of	 the level  of nutrition and the  standard of  living of its people  and   the	improvement  of  public health  as among its primary duties and in particular, The State     shall  endeavour	to bring about    prohibition  of   the   consumption  except for	medicinal purposes  of   intoxicating drinks  and  of  drugs     which are injurious to health.
 
     48A. (g) Protection and improvement    of environment  and safeguarding of  forests and  wild life.  The  State  shall  endeavour	to protect  and  improve  the   environment	 and  to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country.
 
</blockquote>     51A.(g) To protect and improve the     natural	environment    including  forests,  takes,  rivers  and  wild  life, and	to have	compassion  for  living creatures."
 
<p id="p_87">     Apart from	 the constitutional  mandate to protect and improve	 the   environment  there   are	  plenty   of	post independence legislations  on the  subject but more relevant enactments for	our purpose  are: The Water  (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of  Pollution Act</a>  1974 (the  <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water  Act</a>),  The	 Air (Prevention and	 <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of  Pollution) Act</a>,  1981 (the	 <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_10">Air Act</a>)  and   the	 <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment   Protection  Act</a>	 1986	(the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment  Act</a>).   <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">The  Water	  Act</a>	provides   for	 the constitution of	 the Central  Pollution Control Board by the Central	 Government   and  the	constitution  of  one  State Pollution Control boards by various State Governments in the country. The  Boards function  under the  control  of	the Governments concerned.	<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">The Water  Act</a> prohibits  the use or streams and  wells for	disposal of  polluting matters. Also provides  for  restrictions  on outlets  and  discharge  of
 
effluents  without   obtaining	consent from	the   Board.
</p>
<p id="p_88">Prosecution and penalties have been provided which include sentence of  imprisonment. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">The	Air Act</a>	 provides  that	the Central Pollution  Control Board  and  the  State  Pollution Control Boards	constituted under  the later  Act shall also perform the powers and functions under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a>. The main function of the Boards, under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a>, is to improve the quality of  the air  and to  prevent. control  and abate air pollution in the country. We shall deal with the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_18">Environment Act</a> in the later part of this judgement.
</p>
<p id="p_89">14.     In view  of  the  above  mentioned	constitutional	 and statutory provisions  we have  no hesitation in holding that the precautionary  principle and the polluter pays principle are part of the environmental law of the country.
</p>
<p id="p_90">27.	The principle of "polluter pay" has been reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case reported in 2005 (10) SCC 510, Research Foundation for Science Technology and National Resources Policy Vs. Union of India and another.  Their Lordship held that community participation for protection of environment and human health is a right which flows from <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_91">28.	In 2008 (2) SCC 222, T.N.Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) Vs. Union of India and others while considering the question with regard to sustainable development and to check the damages to the environment and ecology, Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_92">"As a matter of preface, we may state that adherence to the principles of sustainable development is now a constitutional requirement.  How much damage to the environment and ecology has got to be decided on the facts of each case.  While applying the principle of sustainable development one must bear in mind that development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs is sustainable development.  Therefore, courts are required to balance development needs witht he protection of the environment and ecology.  It is the duty of the State under our Constitution to devise and implement a coherent and coordinated programme to meet its obligation of sustainable development based on inter-generational equity (See A.P. Pollution Control Board Vs. Prof. M.V. Nayudu)"
</p>
<p id="p_93">29.	In 2009 (6) SCC 142, M.C.Mehta Vs. Union of India and others again their Lordship has shown deep concern towards the deteriorating environmental condition of the country.
</p>
<p id="p_94">30.	Learned counsel for the private respondent nos. 9 and 10 tried to defend the action of Board as well as their own action to run brick kiln and stated that according to their expert the running of brick kiln at the place in question does not pollute the atmosphere.  
</p>
<p id="p_95">	Argument advanced by learned counsel for the respondent does not seem to help them for the reason that establishment of brick kiln within the prohibited distance could not have been done.  Violation of statutory provision does not permit the Board either to grant licence to run brick kiln or permit the private respondent to run brick kiln under the garb of expert's report that no pollution caused in the vicinity from the emission of brick kiln.  Question is of the compliance of statutory mandate (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_96">31.	In the present case, in spite of different opinion submitted by different revenue authorities and Advocate Commissioner at different time and cancellation of "no objection certificate" by the appellate forum (supra) followed by the interim order passed by this Court (supra) again Board had granted licence to run brick kiln. Such action on the part of Board seems to be not only suffer from vice of arbitrariness but also seems to be based on extraneous reasons and considerations.  An inference may be drawn that authorities of the Board acted for unforeseen reasons to help the private respondent no. 10 and 11 to establish brick kiln more so when the appellate authority had cancelled  "no objection certificate" by detailed reasoned judgement (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_97">32.	The collusive act of the Board and respondent nos. 10 and 11 also seems to borne out from material on record. When this court had not granted interim order in the writ petition filed against the appellate order, later on it was withdrawn and things were settled between respondent nos. 10, 11 and the Board with the outcome of fresh "no objection certificate" Such action on the part of Board and respondent no. 10 and 11 not only amounts to violation of well considered appellate order but also blatant abuse of power by the authorities of the Board.  
</p>
<p id="p_98">33.	The methodology adopted by the "Board" in collusion with respondent nos. 10 and 11 is disturbing and deprecated.  Government must look into such instances and appropriate provision be made to check the abuse of power by the U.P. Pollution Control Board and its authorities. Board play very important role to protect the environment and maintain ecological balance.  Hence, it shall be appropriate that the functioning of the Board must be screened by the Vigilance Department and other surveillance agencies. 
</p>
<p id="p_99">34.	The material on record not only makes out a case for exemplary costs in view of law settled by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case reported in <a href="/doc/342197/" id="a_20">Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu v. Union of India</a>, AIR 2005 SC 3353 ,<a href="/doc/175934687/" id="a_21">A. Shanmugam v.

Union of India and others</a>, (2012) 3 SCC 1 .
</p>
<p id="p_100">35. 	In view of above, writ petition deserves to be allowed.  
</p>
<p id="p_101">(1)	Writ petition is allowed with costs.  A writ in the nature of certiorari is issued, quashing the "no objection certificate" granted by respondent no. 2 and 3 in favour of respondent 10 and 11 to run the brick kiln in question with consequential benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_102">	A writ in the nature of mandamus is issued directing the respondent no.1 to 9 to stop the brick kiln expeditiously, say within a period of one week. Learned Chief Standing counsel shall communicate the order immediately.
</p>
<p id="p_103">(II)	Costs of Rs. 5,00000/- (Five lacs) is imposed on respondent no. 2 and 3 and respondent no. 10 and 11 out of which an amount of Rs. 3,00000/- (three lacs) shall be deposited by respondent no. 10 and 11 and Rs. 2,00000/- (two lacs) by respondent no. 2 and 3.  The petitioner shall be entitled to withdraw an amount of Rs. 3,00000/-(three lacs) and rest of Rs.2,00000/- (two lacs) shall be remitted to Mediation and Conciliation Center High Court, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow.
