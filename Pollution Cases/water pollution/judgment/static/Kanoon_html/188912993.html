<p id="p_1">            The petitioner is the successful bidder for Bhandala Mine in District

Ferozepur having an area of 2.64 hectares. The said mine comprises Khasra Nos.

49//23, 24, 21, 22, 19, 20, 18. The mining rights in respect of this land have been

obtained by the petitioner through e-auction held pursuant to the notice inviting

tender dated 13.06.2017 issued by the State of Punjab. He was the highest bidder

@ Rs. 108/- per metric ton. Thereafter, environmental clearance was transferred in

the petitioner's name and consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_1">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a> was

also granted. Final approval too was granted on 06.10.2017 and the petitioner thus

has commenced the mining activities immediately thereafter.

</p><p id="p_2">2.          The petitioner's grievance is that soon after he started mining

activities, another Notification dated 30.10.2017 has been issued in which

'Bhandala mine' has been again included although the land comprises different

khasra numbers 53//2, 3, 8 and 9, measuring total 1.61 hectares. He submits that

the mine which has now been put to auction is situated at a distance of 135 meters

from the mine which is taken by the petitioner pursuant to the notification dated

13.06.2017. This information regarding availability of 2nd mine in the adjoining

land was not made available when the notification inviting 1st bid was issued.

Resultantly, it is claimed that the petitioner would suffer huge losses and the action

of the State of Punjab in concealing this fact is per-se arbitrary and thus needs

intervention of this Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction vested under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a>

of the Constitution of India. Reliance has also been placed upon Rules 58 and 59

of the Punjab Minor Mineral Rules, 2013 as well as Notification dated 15.01.2016

issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

          "(1) The data provided by the State (Sustainable Sand Mining

          Guidelines) shows that most of the mining leases for minor minerals

          are of lease area less than 5 hectare. It is also reported that in hill

          States getting a stretch in river with area more than 5 hectare is very

          uncommon. So the size of lease for minor minerals including river

          sand mining will be determined by the States as per their

          circumstances.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          (2) The mining of minor minerals is mostly in clusters.            The

          Environment Impact Assessment or Environment Management Plan

          are required to be prepared for the entire cluster in order to capture

          all the possible externalities. These reports shall capture carrying

          replenishment and recharge issues, geo-hydrological study of the

             shall ensure that the mitigative measures emanating from the

             Environment Impact Assessment or Environment Management Plan

             study are fully reflected as environmental clearance conditions in the

             environmental clearance's of individual project proponents in that

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             (6)   A cluster shall be formed when the distance between the

             peripheries of one lease is less than 500 meters from the periphery of

             other lease in a homogenous mineral area."

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">
</blockquote><p id="p_6">5.           Reading the above provisions together, a "cluster" is created where, in

a homogenous area not exceeding 100 hectares, there are individual mines of area

not exceeding 5 hectares each and each mine within the cluster is less than 500

metres distant from the next mine. Further, in respect of such a "cluster", a

common Environment Impact Assessment or Environment Management Plan shall

be prepared. However, each individual project proponent shall apply for and be

issued an individual environmental clearance. Thus, the said provisions provide

that a common homogenous approach is to be adopted while assessing the

Environment Impact in an area where a "cluster" of small quarries or mines exist.

They do not bar leasing out of individual mines in a "cluster" as is sought to be

projected by the petitioner. Thus, there is no violation of any statutory provision

or a contractual liability.       Nothing unreasonable has been pointed out in the

impugned action so as to attract the charge of arbitrariness.

</p><p id="p_8">6.          The argument that the business of the petitioner would be adversely

affected on account of the impugned action, also can not be accepted. Assuming

that such is the result of the action complained of, the petitioner has the remedy of

claiming damages, if he is so entitled to. In exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India, this Court would interfere only in case there is

violation of a fundamental or legal right. Contractual rights and liabilities or the

violation thereof can not form the subject matter of such a petition except where

the action complained of is totally "unreasonable" and unconstitutional. In the

present case there is no such "unreasonableness" involved.        The writ petition is

wholly misconceived and without merit. It is a gross misuse of the extraordinary

remedy available under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and deserves to be

dismissed with costs. Ordered accordingly. Costs are assessed at ` 25,000/-, to

be deposited in the Registry of this Court within two weeks of receipt of a certified

copy of this judgment.
