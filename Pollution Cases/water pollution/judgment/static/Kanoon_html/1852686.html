ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.	The
present appeal, preferred under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, is directed against the judgment and order of
acquittal passed by the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Ahmedabad in Criminal Case No.2255 of 1990 on 03.04.1997.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.	As
per the prosecution case, the appellant, who was serving as Assistant
Law Officer with the  Gujarat Pollution Control Board, filed criminal
complaint against respondent Nos.1 to 4. The appellant was given
authority to file criminal case against respondent Nos.1 to 4 in the
Court of learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_2">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_3">25</a>, <a href="/doc/521753/" id="a_4">26</a>, <a href="/doc/73521/" id="a_5">43</a> and <a href="/doc/120844/" id="a_6">44</a> read with
<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_7">Section 47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974. The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, after considering
the deposition adduced by the prosecution and the documentary
evidence, by judgment and order dated 03.04.1997, acquitted all the
accused for the offence with which they were charged. The appellant,
being aggrieved by the said order, has preferred the present appeal
contending therein that the order passed by the learned Judge is not
based on evidence on record of the case and, therefore, the order is
required to be quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.	It
is submitted by learned advocate Mr.Mehta for the appellant that the
learned Judge has committed egregious error in acquitting the accused
by holding that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> of the Act were not
complied with by the appellant after taking samples of the polluted
water. The learned Judge has also erred in holding that the analyst,
who carried out the analysis, was required to be examined
and, in view of
the non-examination of the analyst, the prosecution has not
established the involvement of respondent Nos.1 to 4 in the
commission of offence and, therefore, they are required to be
acquitted for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_10">Sections  24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_11">25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_12">26</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_13">43</a>
and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_14">44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_15">Section 47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. Thus, it is submitted by the learned advocate
that the order passed by the learned Judge suffers from infirmity
and, therefore, it is required to be quashed and set aside and
respondent Nos.1 to 4 be convicted
for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_17">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_18">25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_19">26</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_20">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_21">44</a> read
with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_22">Section 47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.	Though
served, none appears for respondent Nos.1 to 4. Learned A.P.P.
Ms.Krina Calla, representing respondent No.5-State, submitted that
the learned Judge has not considered the oral deposition as well as
the documentary evidence in its true perspective while acquitting
respondent Nos.1 to 4 for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_24">Sections  24</a>,
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_25">25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_26">26</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_27">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_28">44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_29">Section 47</a> of the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and, therefore, the order passed by
the learned Judge is required to be quashed and set aside and
respondent Nos.1 to 4 be convicted for the offence punishable under
<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_31">Sections  24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_32">25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_33">26</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_34">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_35">44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_36">Section 47</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_37">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.	I
have heard learned advocate Mr.Sunil L. Mehta for the appellant and
learned A.P.P. Ms.Krina Calla for respondent No.5-State at length and
in great detail. This Court has also undertaken a complete and
comprehensive appreciation of all vital features of the case as well
as the entire evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.	Taking
into consideration the deposition adduced by the complainants  
Dahyabhai Kalubhai Solanki and Sushil Haribhai Vegda, it becomes
clear that there was a breach of
Rule 27 of the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution)
Rules, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as the  Rules 1976 ). The
said Rule 27 of Rules 1976 reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_7"> (a)
The sample shall be collected preferably in polythene container and
shall be labelled giving the following details, namely :-
</p>
<p id="p_8">(i)	
the source, and nature of sample,
 

</p><p id="p_9">(ii)	
the date and time of collection,
 

</p><p id="p_10">(iii)the
method of preservation used.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(b)	Atleast
2.5 liters of the materials required to be analysed  shall be sent in
a 	container, the capacity of which shall not be less than 3 liters
and not be more than 5 liter.
</p>
<p id="p_12">(c)	
The sample shall accompany with the letter from the  concerned
authority and shall give the number of parameters to be analysed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">(d)	The
sample shall be preferably transported to the laboratory by a
messenger.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(e)	The
messenger shall take  receipt of sample from the laboratory.
</p>
<p id="p_15">(f)	Fees
for analysis shall be paid either  in advance  or at the time of
submission of sample.
</p>
<p id="p_16">(g)	The
samples shall be preserved as per the instruction given in
IS-2488-1966 and 1968 (Part I, II and III) and IS-4733-1968. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">7.	Considering
the aforesaid Rule and in view of the evidence adduced by the
prosecution, it becomes clear that there was complete breach of Rule
27 of Rules 1976 and, in view of breach of Rule 27 of Rules 1976
committed by the appellant,
respondent Nos.1 to 4 are required to be acquitted for the offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_38">Sections  24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_39">25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_40">26</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_41">43</a>
and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_42">44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_43">Section 47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_44">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. This Court has, in case of Dahyabhai
Kalubhai Solanki V/s. Devine Intermediates &amp; Chemicals &amp;
Ors., reported in 1996 (1) G.L.R. 729, held that when the
requirements as laid-down in Rule 27 of Rules 1976 are not complied
with, then the accused is entitled to get the acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_18">8.	In
view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, since the
breach of Rule 27 of Rules 1976 has been committed by the appellant,
respondent Nos.1 to 4, in my considered view, are rightly acquitted
by the learned Judge for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_45">Sections  24</a>,
<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_46">25</a>, <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_47">26</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_48">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_49">44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_50">Section 47</a> of the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_51">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_19">9.	This
is an acquittal appeal in which Court would be slow to interfere with
the order of acquittal. Infirmities in the prosecution case go to the
root of the matter and strike a vital blow on the prosecution case.
In such a case, it would not be safe to set aside the order of
acquittal, more particularly when the evidence has not inspired
confidence of the learned Judge who had opportunity to observe
demeanour of the witnesses. As this Court is in general agreement
with the view expressed by the learned Judge, the Court does not
think it necessary either to reiterate the evidence of prosecution
witnesses or to restate the reasons for acquittal given by the
learned Judge and this Court is of the opinion that expression of
general agreement with the view taken by the learned Judge would be
sufficient in the facts of the case. This is so, in view of the
decisions rendered by the Supreme Court in the cases of (1)
<a href="/doc/582191/" id="a_52">Girija Nandini Devi &amp; Ors. v. Bijendra Narain Chaudhari</a>, AIR 1967
SC 1124, and (2) <a href="/doc/1474119/" id="a_53">State of Karnataka v. Hema Reddy and another</a>, AIR
1981 SC 1417. On overall
appreciation of evidence, this Court is satisfied that there is no
infirmity in the reasons assigned by the learned Judge for acquitting
the respondent. Suffice it to say that the learned Judge has given
cogent and convincing reasons for acquitting the respondent. The
learned advocate for the appellant has failed to convince this Court
to take a view contrary to the one already taken by the learned Judge
and, therefore, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_20">10.	For
the foregoing reasons, the appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed.
</p>
