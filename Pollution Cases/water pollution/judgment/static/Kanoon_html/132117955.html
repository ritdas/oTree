                   The short facts of the case for filing of the present complaint for 

   prosecution of the accused are that on 19.04.2000, the industrial unit of the 

   accused M/s A­One Automobile was inspected by Vigilance Squad consisting 

   of SDM (Seemapuri), DPCC Engineer and Sector Officer. During inspection, 

   the required facility for washing the automobiles was found in the premises 

   and oil mixed effluent was also observed in the drains and therefore, the unit 

   closure directions were issued by the SDM. It is also alleged that the accused 

   was operating its unit without obtaining requisite consent from DPCC. Hence, 

   present complaint.

<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">2. On   filing   of   the   complaint,   accused   was   summoned   and   thereafter   the 

   prosecution   examined   the   complainant   Sh.   Ramesh   Chandra,   Assistant 

   Environmental Engineer as CW1 in pre­charge evidence. Thereafter, a charge 

   u/s 24/25 &amp; 26 of the Act, punishable u/s 41/43 &amp; 44 of the Act was framed 

   against the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

    reiterated the facts mentioned in the complaint and stated that an inspection of 

   industrial unit of accused was carried out on 19.04.2000 and  required facility 

   for washing the automobiles was found in the premises and oil mixed effluent 

   was also observed in the drains. The accused was operating its unit without 

   obtaining   requisite   consent   from   DPCC   and   discharged   untreated   trade 

   effluent.   An   inspection   was   prepared   and   the   unit   closure   directions   were 

   issued by the SDM. He has proved on record inspection report Ex. CW1/8 and 

   closure order Ex.CW1/9.

   SDM and DPCC Engineer, inspected the unit of the accused and found water 

   mixed with oil and lubricants. Pump and compressor being used for washing 

   vehicles were also found. The witness also deposed that an inspection report 

   was   prepared   and   premises   was   sealed.   He   also   identified   his   signature

   less on the lines of CW1 and CW2. All three witnesses were cross examined 

   at length on behalf of the accused.

   relevant provisions of  Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. 


A) The   relevant   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_11">section   24</a>/<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">25</a>   &amp;   <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_13">26</a>   of   the  Water   (Prevention   &amp; 

   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 are reproduced for ready reference:­ 

</p><p id="p_21">        24. Prohibition on use of stream or well for disposal of polluting matter, 
        etc.­ (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, ­
</p><p id="p_22">        (a) no   person   shall   knowingly   cause   or   permit   any   poisonous,   noxious   or

            laid down by the State Board to enter (whether directly or indirectly) into any 
            [stream or well or sewer or on land], or
</p><p id="p_23">        (b) no person shall knowingly cause or permit to enter into any stream any other 
            matter which may tend, either directly or in combination with similar matters, 
            to impede the proper flow of the water of the stream in a manner leading or 
            likely to lead to a substantial aggravation of pollution due to other causes or

B) Learned counsel for complainant argued that the case of the prosecution has 

DPCC vs M/s A-One Automobiles                                                                             4 of 9
    been   proved   beyond   reasonable   doubt   in   view   of   the   testimony   of   the 

   witnesses. Hence, accused may be convicted for the alleged offences. 

</p><p id="p_28">           On  the  other  hand, learned  defence   counsel   argued  that  accused  is 

   innocent he has been falsely implicated in this case just to harass him. It is 

   further   argued   that   no   documentary   evidence   or   photographs   are   filed   on 

   record to show that the unit was in existence at the time of inspection and 

   moreover, no sample was taken and sent to lab for expert opinion to determine 

   the   existence   of  effluent.   However,  this   plea   of  the   accused   does   not  hold 

   much water. CW1, CW2 and CW3 were the member of Vigilance Squad, who 

   inspected the unit of the accused on 19.04.2000. The original inspection report 

   and closure order mentioning the irregularities and violation of the Hon'nble 

   Supreme Court order and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Water Act</a> by the accused, have been proved on 

   record   as   Ex.CW1/8   and   mark   A.   Accused   did   not   deny   his   signature 

   appearing upon inspection report Ex.CW1/8 as well as sealing order mark A. It 

   is evident from the inspection report as well as sealing order that, the unit of 

   the   accused   was   inspected   on   19.04.2000   and   these   documents   were 

   prepared at the spot which were signed by the accused also. 


C) Next contention raised is that no sample was taken, therefore, in absence of 

   any   expert   opinion,   it   can   not   be   said   that   the   unit   of   the   accused   was 

   discharging untreated effluent. However, perusal of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_17">section 21</a> of the Water 

   (Prevention   &amp;   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control   Pollution)  Act</a>,   1974,  makes  it  clear  that   collection   of 

   sample is not sine qua non. From the statement of witnesses, it is clear that no 

   Effluent   Treatment   Plant   (ETP)   was   installed   by   the   accused   and   required 

DPCC vs M/s A-One Automobiles                                                                   5 of 9
    facilities  of   servicing   and   washing   of  automobiles  were   existing   at   the  site. 

   Mixed oil effluent was also observed in the drain of unit and discharge of trade 

   effluent   without   any   treatment   by   putting   any   ETP.   CW1   also   stated   that 

   accused   was   operating   his   unit   without   obtaining   requisite   consent   from 

   DPCC. Accused has not denied this fact. Even the perusal of inspection report 

   relied upon by the complainant makes it clear that no ETP was provided for 

   the   treatment   of   trade   effluent   and   the   entire   untreated   effluent   was   being 

   discharged without any kind of treatment into the public sewer/drain. It is not 

   the   case   of   the   accused   that   any   ETP   was   installed   and   therefore,   expert 

   opinion   is  must  to  determine   the   prescribed  parameter  of  trade   effluent.  In 

   such circumstances,  it is not necessary to collect the sample and send the 

   same to lab test for expert opinion. 
</p>
<p id="p_29">
D) It is  further argued that testimony of prosecution witnesses is not reliable as 

   there is material contradiction in the testimony of prosecution witnesses and 

   no independent public witness was joined in this case. This arguments of the 

   learned defence counsel does not carry much weight. Inspection and closure 

   of the unit is evident from the document Ex.CW1/8 and mark A. Perusal of the 

   records reveals that the raid was conducted at the unit being closely run by the 

   accused. Thus, in the circumstances joining of public witness can not be said 

   to  be   necessary  as   it  was  not  a   public  place.   Even   there  is  no   law   which 

   mandates joining of public witness in each case.  In any case, if independent 

   persons are not willing to be a witness, the prosecution cannot be blamed and 

   evidence   of   other   witness   cannot   be   discarded.   In   support   of   claim   and 

DPCC vs M/s A-One Automobiles                                                                 6 of 9
    contention, reliance may be placed upon the judgment reported in "AIR 1988 

   SC   1998".  Though,   some   minor   contradictions   appears   in   the   testimony   of 

   prosecution   witnesses   regarding   the   time   of   reaching   the   spot,   location, 

   distance and direction of shop. In this matter, inspection was carried out on 

   19.04.2000   and   CW1   and   CW2   was   examined/cross   examined   in   the   year 

   2011 and CW3 was examined in the year 2012. Thus, it can not be aspected 

   from a witness to tell each and everty thing minutely after passing of such a 

   long  period. Such type  of minor contradictions  may obviously  occur due  to 

   lapses of a decade.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
E) However, before coming to the conclusion of the case, it would be necessary 

   to one important and legal issue raised by the learned defence counsel  as the 

   decision of this issue affect the case of the complainant. Learned counsel for 

   the accused has vehemently argued that this complaint is not filed by the duly 

   authorized and competent person and approval for filing the present complaint 

   is not proved on record. On the other hand, learned counsel for complainant 

   argued that not filing of approval on record is not fatal to the prosecution and 

   this objection has been raised for the first time at the stage of fag end of the 

   case. Per contra, learned defence counsel argued that except bald statement 

   nothing is on record to show that complainant obtained any approval prior to 

   filing of the present complaint. It is further argued that prosecution witnesses 

   have kept mum that whether any approval was obtained or not. Even, this fact 

   has not been mentioned in the complaint. Therefore, this legal issue was not 

   raised earlier and complainant can not be allowed to advantage of this very 

DPCC vs M/s A-One Automobiles                                                           7 of 9
    lacuna on the part of the complainant. 
</p>
<p id="p_31">
F) As observed this complaint was filed on behalf of complainant by CW1 Sh. 

   Ramesh Chandra the then serving   Junior Environment Engineer in DPCC. 

   CW1 deposed that he is authorized to file the present complaint through the 

   document   Ex.CW1/2.   Bare   perusal   of   document   Ex.CW1/2   shows   that 

   Assistant/Junior Environmental Engineer was authorized to file complaint with 

   prior approval of the Chairman of DPCC. It is argued on behalf of complainant 

   that approval was obtained. However, no such approval is filed or proved on 

   record. No approval as mentioned in document Ex.CW1/2 is filed on record. 

   Further, there is no copy of minutes of meeting dated 30.03.2000 as stated in 

   Ex.CW1/2 is on record to show that any resolution was passed to authorize 

   area AEE/JEE to maintain prosecution as contemplated u/s 49 of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water Act</a>. 

   Present complaint is filed by CW1 who can not be delegated the power to 

   adopt pick and choose policy. The statutory power of giving approval is given 

   to   the   Board.   In   this   case,   complainant   was   authorized   to   file   the   present 

   complaint   through   office   order   Ex.CW1/2   passed   by   Dr.   Chandra   Prakash, 

   Incharge (Legal Cell) and not by the board. Thus, present complaint is not 

   sustainable in absence of valid sanction/approval accorded by the competent 

   person. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the judgment report in 

   "Criminal Appl. No.1284 of 1989, titled as <a href="/doc/687725/" id="a_20">S.M. Dubash and Ors vs. V.V.M. 

   Bhosale and Ors</a>".
</p>
<p id="p_32">
G) In   this   case,   it   is   reiterated   that   CW1   has   even   failed   to   show   the   valid 


DPCC vs M/s A-One Automobiles                                                                     8 of 9
    sanction/approval to depose on behalf of the complainant. In fact, in this case, 

   it appears that there is no approval accorded for filing of the complaint or for 

   deposing before the court. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, 

   the court is of the considered view that the complainant has failed prove the 

   competency to file this complaint on behalf of the complainant or deposing 

   before this court by CW1. In this regard further reliance may be placed uon the 

   judgment reported in "V (2008) SLT 246". In view of the findings regarding the 

   competency of the witness to depose before this court as well as regarding 

   filing of the present complaint, the court is of the considered opinion that the 

   complainant has failed to prove the allegations against the accused made in 

   the complaint in accordance with the provisions of law. Complaint is, therefore, 

   dismissed. Accused is acquitted of charges leveled against him. However, bail 

   bonds of accused already on record is extended in terms of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_21">section 437A</a> for a 

   period of six months. Case property, if any, be confiscated to the state and file 

   be consigned to record room.
