</p><p id="p_4">2.
         As a common question arises  for determination by this
Court, these four Revision Applications are heard together and are
decided by this common order. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.
           The only question that arises for determination before
this Court is whether the order granting discharge to the respondents
can be sustained or confirmed by this Court when it is founded on 
fact dehors the record? The answer obviously; is in the negative. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.
         The Discharge was granted to the respondent by the
Magistrial  Court mainly on the ground that there is no evidence on
record to show that while drawing samples of the effluent, no request
was made by the representative of the respondent-industry to divide
sample in two parts for sending it to the Government Laboratory for
analysis and thus the requirement of <a href="/doc/83451/" id="a_1">Section 21(5)</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 has not been complied
with. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.
          In this regard, it is evident from the order impugned
itself that the statements of witnesses recorded before the Court
indicate that notice was given for drawing the sample and while
drawing the sample it was asked to the representative of the Industry
as to whether they desire the sample to be sent to the Government
Analyst for analysis. It was answered in the negative and consent was
signed by the representative.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.
          It is thus clear that the foundation of the order, that
there is no evidence to show that there was no demand for dividing
the sample for sending one of the samples to the Government
Laboratory for analysis is de-hors the record. Under the
circumstances, the Revision Applications preferred by the original
complainant deserve to be allowed by setting aside the orders
discharging the respondents impugned herein. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.	Accordingly,
the Revision Applications are allowed. Orders passsed by the learned 
Chief Matropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad on 25.01.1994, 11.02.1994,
19.01.1994 and 30.04.1994 in  Criminal Case Nos. 1706 of 1989,  2011
of 1989, 2251 of 1989 and 2254 of 1989, respectively, are hereby set
aside and the matters are remanded to the trial Court for proceeding
further from the stage of the order impugned in this revision. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.
       It is clarified that since the revision against the orders of
discharge on this sole ground, it would be open for the revisionists
to raise legally permissible contentions before the trial Court. 
</p>
