<p id="p_1">SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, CHIEF JUSTICE: (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.          The petitioners are aggrieved by the construction of a poultry

farm near their village contrary to norms for which they made

representation dated 10.6.2013 (Annexure P-2).       It appears that this

representation in turn persuaded the Haryana State Pollution Control

Board to issue notice dated 13.6.2013 (Annexure P-6) to the owners of

the poultry farm under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">Section 31-A</a> of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. However, the fate of this notice is not known and

the grievance of the petitioners is that the construction is going

unabated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.          We are, thus, of the view that the Haryana State Pollution

Control Board must dispose of the notice already issued to the alleged

offending party dated 13.6.2013 expeditiously so as not to make the

relief sought for by the petitioners infructuous.


</p><p id="p_5">3.           Since sufficient time has elapsed, we direct the State

Pollution Control Board to dispose of the notice dated 13.6.2013 within a

maximum period of 15 days from today and communicate to the

petitioners the result of the same.

<p id="p_6">4.           The writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid directions.

</p><p id="p_7">5.           Copy of this order be given dasti to learned counsel for

the parties under the signatures of the Principal Secretary (Judicial)-

cum-Joint Registrar of the Bench. Learned State counsel to ensure

due compliance of the instant order.</p><pre id="pre_2">
