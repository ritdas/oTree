                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioners herein are the accused Nos.1 to 3 in

crime No.1055/2017 of Irinjalakuda Police Station for

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/340671/" id="a_1">Sections 24(1)</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_2">43</a> of Water

Pollution Act, 1974 r/w <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_3">Section 269</a> of IPC and 120(e) of K.P

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   The prosecution alleged that on 10.07.2017, the

petitioners had unloaded toilet waste in a thodu and thereby

polluted it. They were apprehended on the same day and

are in custody since then.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.   It appears that they are not involved in any other

crime.    The investigation seems to have substantially

progressed. Hence, I do not feel that a further custody of

the petitioners would be justified.  Hence, I am inclined to

grant bail to the petitioners herein on the following

conditions:
