                                 ORDER

BY THE COURT (Per Hon'ble Amitava Roy,CJ)</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This batch of writ petitions has been laid before us to determine

as to whether these ought to be transferred to the National Green

Tribunal (for short, hereafter referred to as "the Tribunal") established

under <a href="/doc/50331181/" id="a_1">section 3</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (for short,

hereafter referred to as "the Act"). The writ petitions hitherto pending

before the learned Single Bench have been listed in terms of the order

dated 23.9.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      We have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned counsel for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The factual spectrum though involves divergent facts projecting a

range of challenges and grievances, however, pertains to environment

as defined in <a href="/doc/187339837/" id="a_2">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act with varying degree of co-relative

proximacy having regard to the debate raised and needs to be

addressed, it is inessential to dilate on the rival pleadings. This is more

so as in course of the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties, it

has not been contended that no environmental issue whatsoever is

involved in the instant proceedings. The competing pleadings as a

composite whole would thus be required to be noted in the pronounced

perspectives of the scheme and the underlying objectives of the Act.

</p><p id="p_4">      The learned counsel for the petitioners apart from contending

that the reliefs provided by the Act under <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_3">section 15</a> thereof do not

constitute efficacious alternative remedy, have urged that in absence of

any provision in the enactment to that effect, it is not mandatory to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    6</span>

transfer the cases to the learned Tribunal. It has been argued that the

provisions of the Act     do not apply to the facts of the instant

proceedings. Referring to <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_4">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_5">16</a> of the Act in particular, it

has been insisted that no substantial question in civil cases relating to

environment exist in the cases in hand and thus, the learned Tribunal is

bereft of jurisdiction in settling the disputes founded on the facts

averred. Referring to the notice(s) issued by the Rajasthan State

Pollution Control Board (for short, hereafter referred to as "the

Board") under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_6">section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short, hereinafter referred to as "the Act of

1974") in the concerned cases, it has been urged that as the validity

thereof has been impeached for the violation of the mandatory

provisions with regard thereto, no issue relating to environment is

involved and that the alternative remedy contemplated by the Act even

if available, the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India is not ousted thereby. As in some cases issues

involving the Combined Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) and Jodhpur

Pradushan Niwaran Trust (for short, hereinafter referred to as "the

Trust") are involved, it has been contended that no environmental

aspect is associated therewith and thus, those cases do not merit

transfer.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Mr.Mehta, learned counsel for the Trust in particular has urged

with reference to Articles 322A and 323B of the Constitution of India

that in absence of any provision in the Act mandating transfer of cases

relating to environment, as envisaged under <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_9">section 14</a> thereof, this

Court is under no obligation to do so. To reinforce this plea, he has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      7</span>

referred to a compilation of the various enactments made under the

aforementioned constitutional provisions embodying as well specific

legislative prescriptions for such transfer. According to Mr.Metha, the

observations/enjoinments made/recorded in the decision of the Hon'ble

Apex Court in Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan and ors.

V/s Union of India and ors. ((2012) 8 SCC 326) have to be essentially

interpreted in the textual facts and are not for general application.

</p><p id="p_6">       Mr.Punia, learned Additional Advocate General has submitted that

in all the proceedings on board, substantial questions relating to

environment are involved and thus, in view of the mandate of <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_10">Sections

14</a> and <a href="/doc/423562/" id="a_11">29</a> of the Act read with the ruling in Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila

Udyog Sangathan and ors. V/s Union of India and ors. (supra), these are

to be essentially transferred to the learned Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_7">       Mr.Shishodia, learned counsel for the Board while endorsing the

stand of the State-respondents has urged that as would be apparent

from the reply filed by his respondent in the related cases, violations of

the provisions of the legislations enumerated in Schedule-I of the Act

more particularly the Act of 1974 are writ large for which it (Board) has

taken necessary actions, which have since been assailed before this

Court. While referring to the decisions of the Delhi High Court and the

Karnataka High Court rendered in Mahavir Singh V/s Union of India &amp;

ors.    (WP(C)     No.7302/2009          decided   on     6.2.2013)     and

H.S.Neelakantappa      V/s   State       of   Karnataka   and   ors.    (WP

No.47599/2011 (GM-RES-PIL) and WP No.25255/2012 (GM-RES-PIL)

decided on 8.7.2013) respectively transferring the cases contemplated

under <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_12">section 14</a> of the Act to the learned Tribunal, in similar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    8</span>

circumstances, the learned counsel has drawn the attention of this

Court as well to the amendments obligated to the legislations

catalogued in Schedule-III of the Act and also to the corresponding

insertions in the related legislations to contend that having regard to

the avowed purpose of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_13">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010, the

instant proceedings ought to be transferred to the learned Tribunal

equipped with the necessary expertise to settle the disputes involved

therein.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      The arguments advanced have received our due consideration.

      To reiterate, it has not been pleaded before us that the issues

raised in the instant proceedings have no nexus whatsoever with the

environmental aspect or the laws relatable thereto. Be that as it may,

the Act has its roots as the statement of objects and reasons would

reveal, in the United Nations Conferences on environment and

development held in 1972 and 1992 in which India participated calling

upon the States to take appropriate steps for the protection of     the

human environment. Therein the necessity of providing effective access

to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy

and of developing national laws regarding liability and compensation for

the victims of pollution and other environmental damage, was

emphasized. Having regard to the ambit of right to life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_14">Article 21</a>

of the Constitution of India encompassing healthy environment and to

actualize the same and also taking into account the large number of

environmental cases pending in the higher courts involving multi-

disciplinary issues, the Hon'ble Apex Court requested the Law

Commission of India to consider the need for constitution of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       9</span>

specialized environmental courts. Consequently, on the necessary

recommendation of the Law Commission of India, a specialized Tribunal

with original and appellate jurisdictions relating to environmental laws

and equipped to handle multi-disciplinary issues involving environmental

cases was set up vide the Act with the objective of expeditious disposal

of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests

and other natural resources including enforcement of any legal right

relating to environment. The National Green Tribunal Bill, 2009 followed

which provided for establishment of the National Green Tribunal

consisting of   Chairperson and Judicial and Expert Members as          the

Central Government would notify. A person either an expert in physical

sciences or life sciences or engineering or having administrative

experience in dealing with environmental matters, was considered to be

qualified for appointment as Expert Member.            The comprehensive

jurisdiction of the learned Tribunal commensurate to the task entrusted

was outlined as well.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      This Bill having been passed by both the Houses of Parliament and

on receiving the assent of the President of India, was integrated in the

Statute Book as the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_15">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010. The preamble

thereof proclaims that it has been enacted to provide for the

establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and

expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and

conservation    of   forests   and   other   natural   resources   including

enforcement of any legal right relating to environment and for giving

relief and compensation for damages to persons and property and for

matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The recital following
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          10</span>

the preamble amongst others demonstrates that in order to eventuate

the resolutions adopted in the aforestated conferences and to fructify

the comprehension of right to healthy environment as an integrant of

life envisaged under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_16">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, the National

Green Tribunal has been set up to settle the disputes involving multi-

disciplinary issues relating to environment. <a href="/doc/187339837/" id="a_17">Section 2(c)</a> defines

"environment" as hereunder:-

      relationship, which exists among and between water, air and land

      and property;"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">The 'substantial question relating to environment' has been defined in
<a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_18">Section 2(m)</a>, which is extracted hereinbelow for ready reference:-

<p id="p_14">A bare perusal of Schedule-III authenticates the amendments introduced

in the legislations contained in Schedule I of the Act pursuant to <a href="/doc/158646846/" id="a_40">Section

36</a> thereof. <a href="/doc/161532715/" id="a_41">Section 33</a> of the Act in no uncertain terms assigns an over-

riding effect thereof over any other Act inconsistent therewith for the

time being in force or any instrument having the effect by virtue of any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    13</span>

law and inconsistent therewith. A plain reading of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_42">Section 14</a> of the Act

would irrefutably justify that thereby the learned Tribunal has been

conferred with the jurisdiction over all civil courts where a substantial

question relating to environment including enforcement of any legal

right relating to environment is involved and where such question arises

out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I,

the learned Tribunal is to hear the dispute arising from such question

and settle the same and pass order thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      Considering the ambit and expanse of the definition of the

expressions "environment" and "substantial question relating to

environment" as engrafted in <a href="/doc/187339837/" id="a_43">Section 2(c)</a> and <a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_44">2(m)</a> respectively, we are

unable to persuade ourselves to conclude that any constricted approach

to scuttle the   otherwise attributed wide jurisdiction of the learned

Tribunal is either envisaged by the Parliament or is intended. Not only

the environment includes water, air and land as defined and their inter-

relationship alongwith human beings, other living creatures, plants,

micro-organism and property,     the substantial question    relating to

environment includes amongst others the eventualities set out in clauses

</p><p id="p_16">(i) and (ii) of <a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_45">section 2(m)</a> of the Act. The definition "substantial

question relating to environment" as    provided in <a href="/doc/159334064/" id="a_46">section 2(m)</a> is an

inclusive one and by no means can be ascribed a connotation      to limit

the scope and sphere thereof.     Apropos the factual backdrop of the

legislation and the salubrious accomplishments thereof as intended, any

endeavour to muzzle the legislatively intended contour thereof would be

antithetical thereto and cannot receive judicial imprimatur.           A

purposive interpretation has to be essentially provided to the relevant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      14</span>

provisions of the Act so as to facilitate the wholesome implementation

of its enjoinments lest the same is rendered otiose.               The words

contained in <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_47">Section 14</a> delineating the jurisdiction of the learned

Tribunal therefor have to be assigned the desired flexibility and

amplitude to achieve the objectives thereof. <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_48">Section 16</a> by no means

ousts or regulates or circumscribes the ambit of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_49">Section 14</a>.

</p><p id="p_17">      The reliefs grantable by the learned Tribunal and enlisted in

<a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_50">Section 15</a> are also couched in compendious terms with adequate

discretion to the learned Tribunal to mould the same within the

framework thereof. The reliefs contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of

<a href="/doc/177298014/" id="a_51">Section 15(1)</a> therefore do not admit of literal interpretation to

circumvent the otherwise intended wide ambit thereof.

</p><p id="p_18">      Though the Act does not contain any provision in particular

mandating transfer of any pending case or proceeding otherwise within

the purview of the jurisdiction of the learned Tribunal to it, having

regard to the framework thereof and the interplay of the relevant

provisions, with the Tribunal as the envisaged fora to settle the disputes

involving substantial questions relating to environment, in our view, the

non-existence   thereof    (provision     of   transfer)   is   suggestive   of

impermissibility of such transfer.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      To reiterate,    the Act has been given an over-riding effect.

Though the same per se would not oust the jurisdiction of the superior

courts contemplated by the Constitution of India, the plea of

inadequacy or inefficacy of the remedy provided by the Act does not

weigh with us. The reference of Articles 323A and 323B of the

Constitution of India and the enactments made thereunder ipso facto
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      15</span>

also do not, in our estimate, outweigh the otherwise unmistakable edict

of the Act and the inbuilt exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil courts

in matters within the purview of the learned Tribunal for its

adjudication. The contention that this Court is beyond the concept of

civil court and thus, the provisions of the Act do not apply to the

proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_52">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is to be

recorded only to be rejected. There is no repugnance or conflict

between the provisions of the Act and the jurisdiction of the       learned

Tribunal outlined thereby with that of the superior courts under the

Constitution of India. No ouster of the writ jurisdiction of this Court as

well is either conceived of or intended. This, however, does not detract

from the necessity of transfer of the proceedings also under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_53">Article 226</a>

of the Constitution of India to the learned Tribunal          in view of the

avowed mission of the Act and for the settlement of disputes relating to

environment with suitable reliefs as a corollary thereof.

</p><p id="p_20">      It has been contended on behalf of the Board in its pleadings that

the facts involved pertain to water pollution due to discharge of sewage

and untreated trade effluent by the industries involved. Not only these

outrages are due to conscious violations of the Act of 1974 and other

environmental laws, remedial actions taken by it (Board) form the

subject matter of challenge in the instant writ proceedings as well.

Accusation of environmental pollution and ecological damage has been

made. Having regard to the definitions of "environment"                   and

"substantial   question   relating   to   environment"   as    adverted    to

hereinabove, we are thus of the unhesitant opinion that substantial

questions relating to environment and arising out of the implementation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                     16</span>

of the enactments amongst others the Act of 1974 is involved in the

proceedings in hand warranting transfer of the cases to the learned

Tribunal.

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      "40.   Keeping in view the provisions and scheme of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_54">National
      Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 (for short "the NGT Act") particularly
      <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_55">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/115054998/" id="a_56">29</a>, <a href="/doc/3100738/" id="a_57">30</a> and <a href="/doc/93496220/" id="a_58">38(5)</a>, it can safely be concluded that the
      environmental issues and matters covered under the NGT Act,
      Schedule I should be instituted and litigated before the National
      Green Tribunal (for short "NGT"). Such approach may be
      necessary to avoid likelihood of conflict of orders between the
      High Courts and NGT. Thus, in unambiguous terms, we direct that
      all the matters instituted after coming into force of the NGT Act
      and which are covered under the provisions of the NGT Act
      and/or in Schedule I to the NGT Act shall stand transferred and
      can be instituted only before NGT. This will help in rendering
      expeditious and specialized justice in the field of environment to
      all concerned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      41.    We find it imperative to place on record a caution for
      consideration of the courts of competent jurisdiction that the
      cases filed and pending prior to coming into force of the NGT Act,
      involving questions of environmental laws and/or relating to any
      of the seven statutes specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act,
      should also be dealt with by the specialized tribunal, that is,
      NGT, created under the provisions of the NGT Act. The courts
      may be well advised to direct transfer of such cases to NGT in its
      discretion as it will be in the fitness of administration of justice."</blockquote><p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">       Not only the text of the above quoted extract would evince a

mandate by their Lordships to transfer matters covered by the provisions

of the Act to the learned Tribunal whether pending prior to the coming

into force of the Act or instituted thereafter, in order to avoid conflict

of orders by it and the High Courts, but also in the interest of

expeditious and specialized justice in the field of environment to all

concerned. Their Lordships have further observed that the courts may

be well advised to direct transfer of such cases to the learned Tribunal

with the essential expertise as visualized by the Act, we construe it

appropriate to transfer the same to it forthwith. Ordered accordingly.
