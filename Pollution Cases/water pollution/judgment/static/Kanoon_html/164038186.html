       Meral P.S. Case No.79 of 2018 (G.R. No. 1165 of 2018) registered
       under sections 379/413/420/<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> of the Indian Penal Code</a> and under

</p><p id="p_4">             Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
       Addl. P.P. for the State.
</p><p id="p_5">             The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
       allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner was
       preparing bricks without obtaining No Objection Certificate from
       the Pollution Department. It is further submitted that the
       allegation against the petitioner are all false and the petitioner has
       no concern with the seized bricks. It is then submitted that the
       petitioner has no criminal antecedent as has been mentioned in
       paragraph no. 11 of the anticipatory bail application. It is next
       submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to furnish
       sufficient security including cash security and undertakes to
       cooperate with the investigation of the case. It is lastly submitted
       that the co-accused persons have already been given the privilege
       of anticipatory bail by this Court vide order dated 26.02.2019,
       passed in A.B.A. No. 7831 of 2018 and vide order dated 25.06.2019,
       passed in A.B.A. No. 3903 of 2019. Hence, it is submitted that the
       petitioner be also given the privilege of anticipatory bail.
         Learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of
  anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_6">        Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as
  discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the
  above named petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.
  Hence, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of
  four weeks from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail
  on depositing cash security of Rs.25,000/- and on furnishing bail
  bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two
  sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned
  C.J.M., Garhwa, in connection with Meral P.S. Case No.79 of 2018
  (G.R. No. 1165 of 2018) with the condition that the petitioner will
