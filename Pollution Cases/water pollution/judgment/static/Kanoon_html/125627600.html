submitted on the basis of instructions received that few
mining leases have been granted. It has also been stated that
illegal mining has been carried out by the persons, who have
been given mining lease. Thereafter, on 17.11.2016, this
Court ordered the respondent Nos.5 &amp; 6 to take prompt and
effective steps as per law to stop illegal mining. In sequel of
this, an order was passed on 06.01.2017 by this Court

respondents. Sub Divisional Magistrate, Kanda inspected the
site on 19.11.2016 and submitted the report on the same day
wherein it has been stated that Shri Mahesh Chandra Pant
had carried out the mining activity near 10 meters of the
residential houses of Shri Bhuwan Chandra, Shri Khyali Dutt
and Shri Manoj Pant. The water sources and paths of the
village were blocked. There are certain soil erosions in the
field of Bhuwan Chandra and Manoj Pant. As far as lease
holder, namely, Shri Fateh Singh Parihar is concerned, it was
noticed that there was certain damage caused to the land of
the State Government, however, damage has not been caused
to the trees. Sub Divisional Magistrate, Kanda submitted a

<p id="p_8">6.        In respect of Shri Ummed Singh, the footpath was
not constructed and no demarcation was carried out. In
respect of Shri Mahesh Chandra, soil erosion was noticed
near the house of Harish Pant and Maya Pant w/o Manoj
Pant at the distance of 10 meters. It was also noticed that
mining activities have damaged the minor irrigation canal
including footpath. It was a considerable case of illegal
mining for which fine was imposed. After receipt of report

<p id="p_17">13.       Respondent Nos. 8 to 10 have carried out the
mining illegally. They have used heavy machinery and
explosives causing gross damage to the environment and
ecology. The mining activities carried out by them caused
threat to school building. Rampant mining activities in close
proximity has also damaged the residential buildings and
waste material has damaged the adjoining water sources.
</p>
<p id="p_18">14.       District Magistrate, Bageshwar directed S.D.M. of
the area to visit the spot. S.D.M., Kanda inspected the spot
on 19.11.2016 and has noticed that illegal mining was
carried out by respondent Nos. 8 to 10. District Magistrate,
Bageshwar again ordered on 23.11.2016 the Sub Divisional
Magistrate, Kanda alongwith Geologist and Deputy Director,
Mining to carry out the joint inspection and submit a report.
The joint inspection report was submitted on 26.11.2016 with
the following observations :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                "(1) The lease holder namely, Sri Fate Singh
                had disposed of the much in Khet No.264 M,
                287M, 542M, 545M and 646M and which is
                liable to be removed from the said field,
                inasmuch as, if same is not removed, there is
                likelihood of flood in the nearby Ambedkar
                school. It is also necessary to mention here
                that in the report there were JCB machines
                                8 

 

               operated in Khet No.924 in which the natural
               water resource has also been disturbed and
               further, there was no appropriate plantation
               for the prevention of soil erosion, it has also
               been mentioned in the report itself that in
               western direction of the leased area, illegal
               mining has been carried out, which has now
               been plugged.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">               (2)   The   report   further    submitted   with
               respect to Sri Umed Singh that in order to
               reach the mining pit, the footpath has not
               been constructed and demarcation pillars
               were not found.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">               (3)   The   report   further    submitted   with
               respect to Sri Mahesh Chandra reveals that
               there were certain soil erosion near the
               residential house of Harish Pant and Maya

               distance of near about 10 meter of the said
               houses, however, the said houses are not
               actually used for residence."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">15.       Thus, it is conclusively proved that environment
and ecology has been damaged by the mining activities and
rivers have also been polluted by the respondent Nos.8 to 10.
</p>
<p id="p_20">16.       Respondent Nos.8 to 10 are carrying out illegal
mining. They are required to follow the law while carrying out
mining activities. District Magistrate, concerned has also
noticed that illegal mining activities have been carried out
and notices were sent to the private respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_21">17.       The Court has also noticed that no suitable action
has been taken against the private respondents. There is no
tangible material placed on record to show as to what action
                                 9 

 

has been taken against these respondents. The Shivalik
region of the Himalayas is further getting fragile by mining
activities. Mining activities are required to be regulated by the
State to ensure that no illegal mining is carried out. It is also
arbitrary on the part of the State to permit mining in the
fragile areas. The mining activities are required to be carried
out as per law. Petitioners have also stated in the petition
that mining is being carried out in the forest area as well.
They further avered that no mining activities should be
permitted in the State of Uttarakhand till the report is
obtained from experts committee regarding the effect of
mining in the State of Uttarakhand.

<p id="p_22">18.        The people of Kumaun used to mine iron and
copper for domestic consumption since ancient times, until
availability in the market of relatively cheaper exported
metals rendered indigenous production an uneconomic
proposition. There is a record of allotment of land to Vishnu
Upadhyay for copper mining in Athigaon area by King Prithvi
Chand (of Chand dynasty).
</p>
<p id="p_23">19.        Grouping of Mineral Resources can be classified in
the following categories :- (i) minerals which occur in great
abundance and the commercial exploitation of which would
be highly profitable. In this category are included magnesite,
talc-steatite, limestones, dolomites and building and roofing
material; (ii) Minerals, the deposits of which are too small to
be commercially profitable, but which are of great strategic
and industrial value. In this class come ores of uranium,
copper, lead, pyrite, and also the deposits of phosphorite,
gypsum and graphite; (iii) In the third category, those
minerals can be included, which are known but no serious
attempts have been made to search for their larger deposits,
i.e. Garnet, Kyanite, Barite, Asbestos and Glass-sand.
Discontinuation chains of lentiform deposits of coarsely
                                   10 

 

crystalline magnesite extend for approximately 150 km. from
the Kali valley northwest to the Mandakini valley. Talc and
steatite occur in two ways, as veins and lentils and pockets
within magnesite and in the bedded form. Among notable
deposits are those of Jakhera, Harap, Maulagar, Biskhal and
Surag in the Lahor valley, NNE of Baijnath, Agar-Girichhina
E of Someshwar. Phosphorite and phosphatic deposits occur
in two different stratigraphic units of two different geographic
areas. The first formation is the Precambrian Gangolihat
Dolomite (Deoban) of the Pithoragarh area. The second
stratigraphic formation which includes phosphorite is the
lower Permian jogria member of the Tal Formation in the
Mussoorie Hills near Dehradun. Copper minerals occur
mainly in three lithostratigraphic units; in the dolomites,
magnesite and talc schist. These are found at east of
Kanalichhina in the Dundu valley. Uranium mineralization
has been noticed along the line of old copper workings in the
fault-and shear-zones in the Chamethi-Pokhri-Tungi belt in
the District Chamoli. Limestone and marble constitute the
third import group of mineral material of Kumaun. These are
found in District Pithoragarh and in the Ramganga valley.
Dolomites     are   found    in   Gangolihat     and      Upper   Krol
formations. Graphite is found in Kalmatiya, Sirar, Petsal and
Banini Devi. The Gypusm is found in the middle and upper
Krol Dolomite near Khurpatal and Dhapila (Nihal valley) in
Nainital.

            spatial position of alpine treeline in Dokriani
            glacier valley was at the altitude of 3880 m in
            the year 1962 and migrated higher to the 3960
            m asl up to the year 2009 along Singh / OIDA
            International         Journal          of         Sustainable
            Development 05: 04 (2012) 33 with the current
            aerial   distance      of   1.7    Km         and    altitude
            difference of 40 m to the glacier snout. While in
            Chorabari glacier valley treeline was reported
            at the altitude of 2920 m in the year 1962 and
            it moved uphill to the altitude of 3400 m up to
            the year 2009 along with the aerial distance of
            3.7 Km and altitude difference 466 m to the
            glacier snout (table 1). The alpine treeline
            dynamics     towards         the        higher       altitude
            @10.21m/year in Chorabari and @1.70m/year
            in Dokriani glacier valleys with in the period of
            47 years is mainly attributed to the CC and
            anthropogenic       impact        on        the    ecosystem
            features. The relative difference of 08.51m to
            the rate of treeline rise in both valleys of
            similar climatic domain is strongly indicative of
            dominance of site specific conditions and
            associated local factors. Another study based
            on remote sensing data, also reported nearly
            similar treeline dynamics variability, i.e., from
            10 m to 11.9 m/year in different parts of same
            climatic regime of himalayan region for the
            period of 1970 to 2006. And in majority of
            areas treeline elevation was reported between
            3000-4000 m but in some cases treeline was
                      12 

 

    found below than 3000 m and above than
    4000 m asl [9]. The current findings based on
    field as well as remote sensing study are
    suggestive that concept of existence of regional
    treeline need to be revised with respect to area
    specific attributes in himalayan region [10].
    Studies confirmed that treeline dynamics is not
    uniform in all regions and it is hardly governed
    by global climate system and looks to be a
    product of prevailing micro-climatic scenario
    [11], [12], [13]. Since temperature is considered
    as a principal treeline driver worldwide and
    hence it can be concluded that "uniform global
    warming impact" is barely discernible in the
    region under study. The site specific and
    interlinked      factors        such     as      altitude,
    topography,      geology,        snow      and     water
    precipitation,    photoperiod,         light   intensity,
    airsoil temperature and moisture regime, soil
    content, wind velocity and aspect of the slope,
    forest fire and anthropogenic activities, etc.,
    are considered possible determinants and
    important     players      in    the    treeline   uphill
    dynamics. The influence of location specific
    treeline drivers appears to be dominant over
    the global drivers in the Himalayan region like
    some of the other mountain regions of the
    world [14].

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">    Forest

         Forest is a one of the integral parts of
    alpine as well as downstream ecosystem in
    IGB and in addition to the food, shelter, fuel
    wood, fodder and other majorminor forest
    products essentially required for sustainable
    development, it also provide various ecosystem
                    13 

 

    services for the sustenance of basin
    population. In addition to climate change
    impacts specifically discussed so far with
    reference to treeline dynamics, various others
    possible     implications     are   evident   and
    discussed herewith. Present investigation in
    Dokriani and Chorabari Glaciers Valley
    suggest that alpine ecosystem is witnessing by
    change      in    plant     species   composition,
    productivity and biodiversity which is also
    being reported in other major ecosystems of
    the World [29]. The various seasonal
    phenomenon of the forest species such as leaf
    sprouting, leaf fall, flowering, fruiting, etc.,
    have been reported to advance by 1-3 weeks
    in some of the central Himalayan species viz
    Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. floribunda,
    Rhododendron arboreum, Pinus roxburghii
    [30]. Even in alpine tree species i.e. Betula
    utilis, the marked difference has been
    observed by the author in leaf development
    with in Gangotri Glacier Valley at the
    altitudinal difference of 250 m asl in the year
    2011. At the elevation of 3600 m asl near
    Chirbas, tree was reported with full of leaves
    (Figure 4) and at the elevation of 3850 near
    Bhojbas, same species was reported leafless
    at same time frame i.e. May 23, 2011 (Figure
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">    5). While in the year 1985 both the localities
    were reported to display same climatic effect
    i.e. leafless trees. This change is attributed to
    the shifting of snowline towards higher
    altitude and vacating a relatively suitable area
    for tree growth in erstwhile snow covered area.
    The upward shifting of snowline is generating
    moisture      stress    for   alpine   vegetation,
    especially to herbaceous species and affecting
    their productivity. In central Himalayan region,
    the encroachment of less useful tree species
    i.e. Pinus lonifolia into the domain of much
    useful species i.e.Quercus leucotrichophora is
    also linked to the moisture stress. The fast
    invasion of exotic species such as Lantana
    camara, Eupatorium spp. and Parthenium spp.
    in the Himalayan region is also assigned to the
                    14 

 

    change in floristic composition and looks to be
    related to CC impact [31]. The forest fire is one
    of the natural and man made calamity which
    destroy the forest, wild life resource and local
    ecosystem up to worst extant. Rapidly
    increasing fire affected area in Himalayan
    region is a matter of serious concern and
    seems to be associated with climate change,
    especially of moisture stress. In one of the
    Himalayan states i.e. Uttrakhand, the fire
    affected area in the year 2001 was only 825
    hectares and it increased to 3652 hectare in
    the year 2006 and in recent year i.e. 2010 it
    reached to the 4115 hectares [32]. It may be
    predicted that some of the Himalayan forest
    species may adopt themself according to the
    climate change scenario. Because under dry
    condition, the seed maturation and seed
    germination period coincides with monsoon
    rainfall in few dominant tree species such as
    in Sal (Shorea robusta), Moru (Quercus
    floribunda) and Kharsu (Q.semecarpifolia),
    while in wet conditions, these species show
    vivipary. The water stress may advance 36
    Singh / OIDA International Journal of
    Sustainable Development 05: 04 (2012) seed
    maturation, which might result in the
    breakdown of synchrony between monsoon
    rains and seed germination [33].

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">    Agriculture, Water and population

          Agriculture is a main source of
    subsistence to the IGB population with net
    cropped area114 million hectares. And poverty
    is substantially higher in rural areas where
    agriculture is the main source of livelihood.
    High rate of population growth remain a cause
    for concern in terms of water and food
    security, poverty alleviation and resource
    conservation. IGB is likely to have some of the
    highest growth of population in South Asia in
    the first half of this century. Especially India's
    population is increasing, but projected to be
    stabilized around 1,583 million in the middle
    of this century. By this time (2050), about half
                    15 

 

    of the India's population shall be living in
    cities. Table 2 shows that, due to high
    population growth, more than 61% of the rural
    population and 56% of the urban population of
    India will live in IGB by 2050 [34]. Table 3
    shows that in Ganga Basin, 90% of the annual
    water is still being used for agriculture
    followed by 7.8 per cent for domestic use in
    IGB. In Indus, the share of agriculture in total
    use is as high as 96%. However, the major
    drivers of increasing water demand in the
    future will be from the domestic and industrial
    sectors [1].

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">          Although glaciers are the birth place to all
    Himalayan perennial rivers but main portion of
    their water discharge in downstream basin
    areas is contributed by rain water rather than
    snow /glacier melt water. The glacial melt
    water component has been estimated 44.8%
    for Indus, 9.1% for Ganges, 12.3% for
    Brahamputra, 8.8% for Salween, 18.5% for
    Yangtze, 1.3% for Yellow and 40.2% for the
    Tarim River [35], [36], [37]. The examined
    sources and availability of water for irrigation
    are evident that majority of Himalayan region
    is rain fed and water received from the
    monsoon still is principal driver for sustainable
    productivity in IGB. The basin is mainly fed by
    the Asian Monsoon and winter Westerlies but
    continuous weakness, delaying trend and
    erratic behavior of the these sources of
    precipitation is predicted to generate resource
    crunch, productivity loss, socio-economic
    constraints     and    various     environmental
    stresses     and    ultimately     hamper     the
    sustainable development in the region [26],
    [38], [39]. The considerable decline in
    productivity in various crops and fruits due to
    CC especially of change in weather pattern
    and cycle has been reported in various parts of
    India in the IGB [40], [41], [42], [43], [44].

    traditional crops due to delayed and erratic
    monsoon in Ganga River catchment and some

    destroyed due to excessive rains during the

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">    Glaciers

          Glaciers are the unique frozen water
    resource in alpine region of IGB and behave as
    a climate marker. Most of the perennial rivers
    in Himalayan Ecosystem originate from these
    glaciers and feed most of the populated
    regions including northern part of India. But
    due to CC impact their conventional enrichment
    system has been deteriorated. Glaciers are
    getting less snow precipitation and some time
    precipitation followed by rain fall do not allow
    them to hold snowice mass. The disbalance
    between the snow precipitation received and
    snow-ice melt is results into negative mass
    balance every year and consequently most of
    the Himalayan glacier are in the phase of
    recession. The Himalayan region represents
    one of the most dynamic and complex
    mountain systems of the World and is
    extremely vulnerable to CC [45]. Due to the
    harsh climatic condition and difficult terrain,
    studies on Himalayan Glaciers have been
    scanty and limited to a few glaciers only. In
    fact decrease in snow-ice cover during the last
    century, across the globe, especially in
    mountain glaciers is seen as impact of CC [46].
    Studies carried out on some of the important
    Himalayan glaciers revealed that due to
    different   climatic   setting,   site   specific
                    17 

 

    geomorphic conditions and study time frame,
    their recession rate is variable.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">          The recession rate of Gangotri glacier has
    been estimated about 28.33 m per year
    between the years 1990 and 1996 [47], while
    between the years 2005 - 2007, it was
    receded by nearly 11.80 m per year [23],[48].
    In Siachen and Pindari glaciers recession was
    at the rates of 31.5 m and 23.5 m per year
    [49], in Milam Glacier it was 9.1 m per year
    between 1901and 1997 [50], in Dokriani
    Bamak Glacier, recession was recorded 16.6 m
    per year from the years 2001- 2007 [15], in
    Gara, Gor Garang, Shaune Garang, Nagpo
    Tokpo Glaciers of Satluj River Basin it was
    reported between 4.22 - 6.8 m per year [49].
    The variable recession rate behavior of glaciers
    is also confirmed in the most detailed satellite-
    imagery based study ever done in the
    Himalayas. Study revealed that 75% of these
    glaciers have shown annual retreat rate at an
    average of 3.75 m, 8 % have shown an
    advance and rest of 17 % have exhibited
    stable position [51]. The overall prevailing
    scenario of glacial regime is suggestive that

    is bound to create water and geo-hydrological
    crises to hamper various activities related to
    the sustainable development.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">          The global warming is also attributed to
    the glacier recession and treeline dynamics in
    some of the studies [18], [42], [45],[46], [51],
    [52], [53]. However, recent studies conducted
    in the western Indian Himalaya and other
    parts suggests that global warming impact is
    hardly evidenced in instrumental records as
    well as in natural archives. The general
    slowdown in the rate of glacial retreat has
    been reported during late nineties and in the
    decade of year 2000 in the Himalayan region
    [24], [49]. Study based on observational
                                 18 

 

                 records and tree rings suggest a pre-monsoon
                 temperature cooling during the later part of the
                 20th century [21]. Dokriani glacier area has
                 also not witnessed any air temperature rise
                 trend in instrumental records and followed by
                 slight decrease in snout recession in
                 comparison of preceding years [15]. The
                 presumed rapid melting of snow-glaciers due
                 to warming need to be reflected through
                 increasing annual glacial water discharge but
                 in Gangotri glacier more or less a decreasing
                 trend has been reported during 2000-2006
                 melt season [54]. Glacier fed rivers such as
                 Beas, Chenab, Ravi and Satluj also have not
                 witnessed increasing trend of overall water
                 discharge [22]. It appears that ever weakening
                 monsoon for long period has created poor
                 snow precipitation system and negative mass
                 balance which consequently has resulted into
                 overall recession in most of the glaciers. Recent
                 study also established weakened summer
                 monsoon circulation in general, during the
                 period of years 1951-2004 [26].

    in <a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_18">Section 2</a> of the Mines and Minerals
    (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_19">Development) Act</a>, 1957, has
    naturally to be the paramount consideration in
    all matters concerning the regulation of mines
    and the development of minerals. Parliament's
    policy is clearly discernible from the provisions
    of the Act. It is the conservation and the
    prudent and discriminating exploitation of
    minerals, with a view to secure maximum
    benefit to the community. There are clear
    signposts to lead and guide the subordinate
    legislating authority in the matter of the
    making of rules. Viewed in the light shed by
    the other provisions of the Act, particularly
    <a href="/doc/542527/" id="a_20">Sections 4-A</a>, <a href="/doc/542527/" id="a_21">17</a> and <a href="/doc/542527/" id="a_22">18</a>, it cannot be said that
    the rule-making authority under <a href="/doc/542527/" id="a_23">Section 15</a>
    has exceeded its powers in banning leases for
    quarrying black granite in favour of private
    parties and in stipulating that the State
    Government         themselves   may     engage   in
    quarrying black granite or grant leases for
    quarrying black granite in favour of any
    corporation    wholly     owned    by   the   State
    Government. To view such a rule made by the
    subordinate legislating body as a rule made to
    benefit   itself     merely   because   the   State
    Government happens to be the subordinate
    legislating body, is, but, to take too narrow a
    view of the functions of that body. The reasons

               that prompted the State Government to make

               common counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the
               State Government before the High Court. We
               find no good reason for not accepting the
               statements made in the counter-affidavit. It

          were told during the hearing that the Tata Iron and

          limestone for manufacture of a special kind of steel.
          At the present rate of mining, the deposits are likely
          to last some 50 years. It is           for the Government
          and the Nation -- and not for the Court -- to decide
          whether the deposits should be exploited at the cost
          of ecology and environmental considerations or the
          industrial   requirement         should    be   otherwise

          strike   a   balance         between   preservation   and
          utilisation that would indeed be a matter for an

    protection is of recent origin. The United Nations
    Conference on World Environment held in Stockholm
    in June 1972 and the follow-up action thereafter is
    spreading the awareness. Over thousands of years
    men had been successfully exploiting the ecological
    system for his sustenance but with the growth of
    population the demand for land has increased and
    forest growth has been and is being cut down and
    man has started encroaching upon Nature and its
    assets.    Scientific   developments   have   made   it
    possible and convenient for man to approach the
    places which were hitherto beyond his ken. The
    consequences of such interference with ecology and
    environment have now come to be realised. It is
    necessary that the Himalayas and the forest growth
    on the mountain range should be left uninterfered
    with so that there may be sufficient quantity of rain.
    The top soil may be preserved without being eroded
    and the natural setting of the area may remain
    intact. We had commended earlier to the State of
    Uttar Pradesh as also to the Union of India that
    afforestation activity may be carried out in the
    whole valley and the hills. We have been told that
    such activity has been undertaken. We are not
    oblivious of the fact that natural resources has got to
    be tapped for the purposes of social development
    but one cannot forget at the same time that tapping
                                24

              carried on lawfully, in the name of higher
              considerations of ecology and environment.
              This is a simple case where we are called

              The effect of this position is that no non-forest

               cannot carry on any such non-forest activity in
               the said area without such prior approval. That
               the mining activity amounts to non-forest
               purpose is beyond dispute. Thus, the grant of

               the State Government, without obtaining the
               prior approval of the Central Government, in
               respect of the mines situated within the
               protected forest, after January 1, 1975 is
               contrary to law. All the mines listed in

               within the areas declared as protected forest
               while the mines listed in Appendix 'B' fall
               partly within and partly outside such areas.
               According to Rule 4(6) of the Rajasthan Minor
               Mineral Concession Rules, 1986 too, no mining
               lease could have been granted or renewed
               within the forest "without clearance from the
               Central Government in accordance with the
               <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_28">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980 and the rules
               made thereunder". Admittedly, no such prior
               approval or clearance of Central Government
               was obtained. The Chairman of the committee,
               Shri Justice M.L. Jain has recommended that

               report, which are situated wholly within the
               protected forest should be closed forthwith.
               There can hardly be any valid objection in law
               to the said recommendation. Similarly, with
               respect to 47 mines mentioned in Appendix 'B'
               to the report, the learned Chairman has
               recommended that they should be closed

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">                10. The traditional concept that development
            and ecology are opposed to each other is no
            longer acceptable. "Sustainable Development" is
            the answer. In the international sphere,
            "Sustainable Development" as a concept came to
            be known for the first time in the Stockholm
            Declaration of 1972. Thereafter, in 1987 the
            concept was given a definite shape by the World
            Commission on Environment and Development in
            its report called "Our Common Future". The
            Commission was chaired by the then Prime
            Minister of Norway, Ms G.H. Brundtland and as
            such the report is popularly known             as
            "Brundtland Report". In 1991 the World
            Conservation Union, United Nations Environment
            Programme and Worldwide Fund for Nature,
            jointly came out with a document called "Caring
            for the Earth" which is a strategy for sustainable
            living. Finally, came the Earth Summit held in
            June 1992 at Rio which saw the largest
            gathering of world leaders ever in the history --
            deliberating and chalking out a blueprint for the
            survival of the planet. Among the tangible
            achievements of the Rio Conference was the
            signing of two conventions, one on biological
            diversity and another on climate change. These
            conventions were signed by 153 nations. The
                      28 

 

    delegates also approved by consensus three non-
    binding documents namely, a Statement on
    Forestry Principles, a declaration of principles on
    environmental policy and development initiatives
    and Agenda 21, a programme of action into the
    next century in areas like poverty, population and
    pollution. During the two decades from Stockholm
    to Rio "Sustainable Development" has come to be
    accepted as a viable concept to eradicate poverty
    and improve the quality of human life while living
    within the carrying capacity of the supporting
    ecosystems. "Sustainable Development" as
    defined by the Brundtland Report means
    "Development that meets the needs of the present
    without compromising the ability of the future
    generations to meet their own needs". We have
    no hesitation in holding that "Sustainable
    Development" as a balancing concept between
    ecology and development has been accepted as a
    part of the customary international law though its
    salient features have yet to be finalised by the
    international law jurists.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">       11. Some of the salient principles of
    "Sustainable Development", as culled out from
    Brundtland Report and other international
    documents, are Inter-Generational Equity, Use
    and    Conservation     of    Natural  Resources,
    Environmental Protection, the Precautionary
    Principle, Polluter Pays Principle, Obligation to
    Assist and Cooperate, Eradication of Poverty and
    Financial Assistance to the developing countries.
    We are, however, of the view that "The
    Precautionary Principle" and "The Polluter Pays
    Principle" are essential features of "Sustainable
    Development". The "Precautionary Principle" -- in
    the context of the municipal law -- means:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">         (i) Environmental measures -- by the State
      Government and the statutory authorities --
      must anticipate, prevent and attack the causes
      of environmental degradation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">         (ii) Where there are threats of serious and
      irreversible damage, lack of scientific certainty
      should not be used as a reason for postponing

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">       12. "The Polluter Pays Principle" has been held
    to be a sound principle by this Court in Indian
    Council for <a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_29">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India1</a>.
    The Court observed: (SCC p. 246, para 65)

         "... we are of the opinion that any principle
      evolved in this behalf should be simple,
      practical and suited to the conditions obtaining
      in this country."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">      The Court ruled that: (SCC p. 246, para 65)

         "... once the activity carried on is hazardous
      or inherently dangerous, the person carrying
      on such activity is liable to make good the loss
      caused to any other person by his activity
      irrespective of the fact whether he took
      reasonable care while carrying on his activity.
      The rule is premised upon the very nature of
      the activity carried on".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">       Consequently the polluting industries are
    "absolutely liable to compensate for the harm
    caused by them to villagers in the affected area,
    to the soil and to the underground water and
    hence, they are bound to take all necessary
    measures to remove sludge and other pollutants
    lying in the affected areas". The "Polluter Pays
    Principle" as interpreted by this Court means that
    the absolute liability for harm to the environment
    extends not only to compensate the victims of
    pollution but also the cost of restoring the
    environmental degradation. Remediation of the
    damaged environment is part of the process of
    "Sustainable Development" and as such the
    polluter is liable to pay the cost to the individual
    sufferers as well as the cost of reversing the
    damaged ecology.

      the air unwholesome, this is an injurious
      nuisance, as it tends to deprive him of the use
      and benefit of his house. A like injury is, if
      one's neighbour sets up and exercises any
      offensive trade; as a tanner's, a tallow-
      chandler's, or the like; for though these are
      lawful and necessary trades, yet they should
      be exercised in remote places; for the rule is,
      'sic utere tuo, ut alienum non leadas'; this
          therefore is an actionable nuisance. And
      on a similar principle a constant ringing of

    an authority or authorities under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_45">Section 3(3)</a> of
    the Act with adequate powers to control pollution
    and protect the environment. It is a pity that till

    read with other provisions of the Act is being
    done by this Court and the other courts in the

    the five districts of Tamil Nadu, where tanneries
    are operating, are permitted to continue then in
    the near future all rivers/canals shall be polluted,
    underground waters contaminated, agricultural
    lands turned barren and the residents of the area

total prohibition under <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_49">Section 2</a> of the Forest (Conservation)

               the respondent has been denied is not making
               any fresh extraction of the mines (sic minerals)
               in the forest area but only the removing of the
               stacked minerals from the surface of the earth,
               that too, with the permission granted by the
               authorities; the direction issued by the High

    Court in the impugned order, therefore, is
    correct in law. We find no force in the
    contention.         The         learned       Judges        have
    proceeded on the premise that the respondent
    is entitled to extract and remove minerals, said
    to be stacked on the ground that the lease is a
    valid lease; otherwise he does not get any
    right. The premise on which the Division Bench
    has proceeded is obviously illegal. <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_50">Section 2</a> of
    the Act prohibits mining operations if the mines
    are situated within the forest area. It is a total
    prohibition,    unless           the     State     Government
    grants mining lease with the prior concurrence
    of the Central Government. Admittedly, the
    prior concurrence of the Central Government
    had not been obtained. Shri Subba Rao sought
    to place before us the guidelines issued by the
    Department          of     Environment           and      Forest,
    Government          of         India     in   relaxation       of
    Rules/guidelines under <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_51">Forest (Conservation)

    Government          without            obtaining    the     prior
    concurrence of the Department of Environment
    and Forest. In that behalf, it was mentioned
    that the renewal of the mining leases, if they
    are within a particular radius was directed to
    be done without any fresh breaking up of fresh
    area and felling of the trees but subject to
    reforestation. In this case that situation does
    not arise. This is a case of grant of renewal in
    a routine way. Under these circumstances, the
    direction issued by the Division Bench of the

               Judge (U.C. Banerjee, J., as he then was) came
               to the conclusion: (AIR Headnote)

                     "There is no manner of doubt that the
               issue of environmental degradation cannot but
               be termed to be a social problem and
               considering the growing awareness and
               considering the impact of this problem on the
               society in regard thereto law courts should
               also rise up to the occasion to deal with the
               situation as it demands in the present day
               context: Law courts have a social duty since it
               is a part of the society and as such, must
               always function having due regard to the
               present day problems which the society faces.
               It is now a well-settled principle of law that
               socio-economic condition of the country cannot
               be ignored by a court of law. It is now a well-
               settled principle of law that while dealing with
               the matter, the social problems shall have to be
               dealt with in the way and in the manner it
               calls for, since benefit to the society ought to be
               the prime consideration of the law courts and
               ecological imbalance being a social problem
                   36

<blockquote id="blockquote_53">          The learned Judge had indicated in the
    said judgment that there should be a proper
    balance between the protection of environment
    and the development process: the society shall
    have to prosper, but not at the cost of the
    environment and in the similar vein, the
    environment shall have to be protected but not
    at the cost of the development of the society --
    there shall have to be both development and
    proper environment and as such, a balance
    has to be found out and administrative actions
    ought to proceed in accordance therewith and
    not dehors the same. In the case of Indian
    Council for <a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_53">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of
    India2</a> this Court had the occasion to deal with
    the question of protection of 6000 km long
    coastline of India and the Court emphasised
    that it would be the duty and responsibility of
    the Coastal States and Union Territories in
    which the stretches exist, to see that the
    notifications issued under the provisions of the
    Environment (Protection) Rules as well as the
    notifications issued, declaring the coastal
    stretches as Coastal Regulation Zone should
    be properly and duly implemented and the
    various restrictions on the setting up and
    expansion of industries, operation or process
    etc. in the Regulation Zone should be strictly
    enforced. The Court had indicated that with a
    view to protect the ecological balance in the
    coastal areas, notifications having been issued
    by the Central Government, there ought not to
    be any violation and the prohibited activities
    should not be allowed to come up within the
    area declared as CRZ Notification. The Court
    also emphasised that no activities which
    would ultimately lead to unscientific and
    unsustainable development and ecological
    destruction should at all be allowed and the
    courts must scrupulously try to protect the
    ecology and environment and should shoulder

                 greater responsibility of which the court can

    monopolies and knows no exception. It has
    always some levelling agency that puts the
    overbearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate
    substantially on the same ground with all
    others" said Zarathustra. Environment is a
    polycentric and multifaceted problem affecting
    the    human         existence.        The     Stockholm
    Declaration of the United Nations on Human
    Environment, 1972, reads its Principle No. 3,
    inter alia, thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_79">    "Man has the fundamental right to freedom,
    equality, and adequate conditions of life, in an
    environment of equality that permits a life of

    environmental          problems     are      caused      by
    underdevelopment. The Declaration suggests
    safe actions with prudent care for ecological
    balance. It is necessary to avoid massive and
    irreversible harm to the earthly environment
    and strife for achieving for present generation
    and    the   posterity       a    better     life   in   an
    environment more in keeping with the needs
    and hopes. In this context immediately comes
    to mind the words of Pythagoras who said:
    "For so long as man continues to be the

    will never know health or peace. For so long as

    protect and improve the environment and to
    control or prevent any act or omission polluting
    or likely to pollute the environment. In view of
    the     enormous      challenges    thrown       by     the
    industrial     revolution,         the     legislatures
    throughout the world are busy in this exercise.
    Many have enacted laws long back and they
    are busy in remodelling the environmental law.
    The others have moved their law-making
    machineries     in     this   direction    except       the
    underdeveloped States who have yet to come

    countries which paid attention right from the
    ancient times down to the present age and till
    date, the tailoring of the existing law to suit the
    changing conditions is going on. The problem
    of law-making and amending is a difficult task
    in this area. There are a variety of colours of
    this problem. For example, the industrial
          revolution and the evolution of certain
    cultural and moral values of humanity and the
    rural    and   urban      area     developments          in
    agricultural   technology,       waste,        barren    or

    Tiwari Committee came out with the data that
    we    have   in        India   "nearly     five    hundred
    environmental          laws"    and       the     Committee
    pointed out that no systematic study had been
    undertaken        to     evaluate     those       legislative
    developments.           Some      legal    controls       and
    techniques    have         been      adopted       by     the
    legislatures in the field of Indian environmental
    laws. Different legislative controls right from
    the ancient times, down to the modern period
    make interesting reading. Attention has to be
    paid to identify the areas of great concern to
    the legislature; the techniques adopted to solve
    those problems; the pollutants which require
    continuous exercises; the role of the legislature
    and people's participation outside. These are
    some    of   many         areas     which       attract   the
    attention in the study of history of the Indian
    environmental law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_82">      20. Since time immemorial, natural objects
    like rivers enjoyed a high position in the life of
    the    society.        They    were       considered       as
    goddesses having not only purifying capacity
    but also self-purifying ability. Fouling of the
    water of a river was considered a sin and it
    attracted punishments of different grades
    which included penance, outcasting, fine etc.
    The earth or soil also equally had the same
    importance, and the ancient literature provided
    the means to purify the polluted soil. The
    above are some of the many illustrations to
    support the view that environmental pollution
    was controlled rigidly in the ancient times. It
                     46 

 

    was not an affair limited to an individual or
    individuals    but    the   society   as   a    whole
    accepted its duty to protect the environment.
    The "dharma" of environment was to sustain
    and ensure progress and welfare of all. The
    inner urge of the individuals to follow the set
    norms of the society, motivated them to allow
    the natural objects to remain in the natural
    state. Apart from this motivation, there was the
    fear of punishment. There were efforts not just
    to punish the culprit but to balance the
    ecosystems. The noteworthy development in
    this period was that each individual knew his
    duty to protect the environment and he tried to
    act accordingly. Those aspects have been
    highlighted by a learned author C.M. Jariwala
    in his article "Changing Dimensions of the
    Indian Environmental Law" in the book Law
    and Environment by P. Leelakrishnan.

    general categories:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_84">    (a) Criminal liabilities

       The number of criminal offences for non-
    compliance with environmental legislation is
    immense, and in recent years the regulation
    agencies have shown an increased willingness
    to resort to prosecution. Private prosecution is
    also a possibility. Fines will be the normal
    penalty,   though     in    a   number     of   cases
    sentences of imprisonment have been imposed
    (there is normally a potential personal liability
                           47 

 

      for     directors     and        senior   managers).

      years, as have actual levels of fines imposed.

<blockquote id="blockquote_85">      (b) Administrative sanctions

      In most regulatory systems there is a range of
      options available to the regulator, including
      variation, suspension or revocation of a licence.
      Since these steps may lead to the closure of a
      plant, they are obviously of great importance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_86">      (c) Clean-up costs

      In most environmental legislation there is a
      power to clean up after a pollution incident and
      receive the cost from the polluter or (in some
      cases) the occupier.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_87">      (d) Civil liability

      There is growing interest in the toxic torts,
    although many of the actions have in fact been
    around for a long time. Many environmental
    actions rest upon strict liability. Although liability
    may often be difficult to establish, the size of
    claims may be very high indeed.

    there is a certain element of hazard or risk

    hazard or risk altogether. We can only hope to
    reduce the element of hazard or risk to the
    community by taking all necessary steps for
    locating such industries in a manner which would
    pose least risk of danger to the community and
    maximizing safety requirements. As observed in
    the United Nations Conference held at Stockholm
    in June 1972, economic and social development

    which can be sustained by nature/ecology with

    intending entrepreneur. For carrying on any
    mining activity close to township which has
    tendency to degrade environment and is likely to

    degrading the environment or minimising adverse
    effects    thereupon             by     applying         stringent
    safeguards, it is possible to carry on development

    has to go on because one cannot lose sight of the
    need for development of industries, irrigation
    resources and power projects etc. including the
    need to improve employment opportunities and
    the generation of revenue. A balance has to be
    struck. We may note that to stall fast the
    depletion of forest, a series of orders have been
    passed by this Court in T.N. Godavarman case6
    regulating the felling of trees in all the forests in
    the country. Principle 15 of the Rio Conference of
    1992§      relating         to        the     applicability     of
    precautionary principle, which stipulates that
    where there are threats of serious or irreversible
    damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not
    be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective
    measures to prevent environmental degradation,
    is also required to be kept in view. In such
    matters, many a times, the option to be adopted
    is not very easy or in a straitjacket. If an activity
    is allowed to go ahead, there may be irreparable
    damage to the environment and if it is stopped,
    there may be irreparable damage to economic
    interest. In case of doubt, however, protection of
    environment would have precedence over the
    economic      interest.          Precautionary           principle
    requires anticipatory action to be taken to prevent
    harm. The harm can be prevented even on a

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_108">      55. In respect of mining in the forest area, we
    may also refer to the National Forest Policy, 1988
    issued by the Ministry of Environment and
    Forests, Government of India which, inter alia,
    notices that over the years, forests in the country
    have suffered serious depletion. One of the
    reasons       for    it    is     inadequacy     of    protection
    measures and diversion of forest land to non-
    forest    uses,      without        ensuring     compensatory
    afforestation         and         essential      environmental
    safeguards; and the tendency to look upon
    forests as revenue-earning resource. The basic
    objectives      of        the     policy,    inter     alia,    are
    maintenance of environment stability through
    preservation and, where necessary, restoration of
    the ecological balance that has been adversely
          disturbed by serious depletion of the forests
    of the country and checking the soil erosion and
    water conservation and increasing substantially
    the      forest/tree            cover       through         massive
    afforestation and social forestry programmes. It
    provides that the national goal should be to have
    a minimum of 1/3rd of the total land area of the
    country under forest or tree cover. In the hills and
    in mountainous regions, the aim should be to
    maintain 2/3rds of the area under such cover in
    order to prevent erosion and land degradation
    and      to   ensure        the    stability    of    the    fragile
    ecosystem. It also provides that a massive need-
    based         and         time-bound           programme         of
    afforestation and tree planting, with particular

    on all degraded and denuded lands in the

    area where large scale of afforestation with

    examined keeping in view the national forest

    land with tree cover should not be treated merely
    as a resource readily available to be utilised for
    various projects and programmes but as a
    national asset which requires to be properly

    should      be    consistent         with   the      need     for
    conservation of trees in forests. It provides that

    area. For the present, we are not suggesting a
    complete ban on mining operations on forest land
    so long as it is possible to undertake the said
    operation    on      the   sustainable   development
    principle and after obtaining due approvals under
    various statutory provisions including <a href="/doc/1642441/" id="a_70">Section 2</a> of
    the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. At the same
    time,   we     are     unable    to   appreciate     the
    commencement and continuation of mining over
    areas on which crores of foreign funds have been
    spent for afforestation and plantation. Further, it
    is also not possible to accept the contention urged
    on behalf of the leaseholders that only that part
    of such leased land where allegedly damage has
    been caused to plantation as a result of mining
    operations, be excluded from mining and not the
    entire area of the lease. For example, if the
    mining area is 5 hectares and damage as a result
    of mining is to plantation in an area of 1 hectare,
    it is not practicable or reasonable to exclude only
    that 1 hectare and permit the mining operation on
    the rest of the mining area. Reference can also be
    usefully made to the part of the State          Forest
    Report, 1999 issued by Forest Survey of India in
    relation to Haryana. It, inter alia, provides that
    large-scale plantations were carried out under the
    Aravalli Project since 1992. The document claims
    increase of the forest cover in the State as a
    result of plantation under the Aravalli Project. It,
    inter alia, mentions that forest cover increase in
    Gurgaon      and     Faridabad   is   mainly   due    to
    plantation raised under the Aravalli Project which
    was started in the early 1990s. In these matters,
    neither the State nor the leaseholders can be
                         62 

 

    permitted to turn round and now take a stand
    that the areas covered under the Aravalli Project
    are not forest. The National Forestry Action
    Programme of December 2000 issued by the
    Ministry of Environment and Forests of the
    Government giving project profile also makes
    detailed reference to the institution building and
    integrated national resource development in the
    Aravalli region, Haryana under the project-
    implementing agency of the Forest Department,
    Government of Haryana. The project profile, inter
    alia, states that central to such a policy is
    rehabilitation of common lands to meet the needs
    of the rural poor and to reduce soil and water
    erosion,   and    the proposed programme              was
    envisaged to bring the benefit of integrated
    development of the Aravalli ecosystem to the
    whole community, particularly, to the poorer
    sections. The project, it is stated, has been
    implemented in Aravalli hills situated in the five
    districts of Haryana including Gurgaon. One of
    the expected outcomes of the project is the
    reduced soil erosion and improved water regime
    in the rehabilitated area which will drastically
    reduce     the   run-off    leading     to    recharge   of
    constantly depleting groundwater resources. It
    records that the Haryana Forest Department has
    implemented a project on the eco-restoration of
    common lands in the Aravalli hills, from June
    1990 to October 1999. The project is being
    funded      by    the      Delegation        of   European

               bear in mind that development which meets
               the needs of the present without compromising
               the ability of the future generations to meet
               their own needs is sustainable development.
               Therefore, courts are required to balance
               development needs with the protection of the
               environment and ecology. It is the duty of the
               State under our Constitution to devise and
               implement a coherent and coordinated
               programme to meet its obligation of
               sustainable development based on inter-
               generational equity (see <a href="/doc/764031/" id="a_76">A.P. Pollution Control
               Board v. Prof. M.V. Nayudu1</a>). Mining is an
               important     revenue-generating       industry.
               However, we cannot allow our national assets
               to be placed into the hands of companies
               without a proper mechanism in place and
               without ascertaining the credibility of the user

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_125">                "Limits of Mineral Exploitation

                      To support an ever increasing population
                and to maintain continuation of supply of raw
                materials to the industrialised society and to
                increase the quality of life, larger and larger
                quantity of earth resources have to be
                supplied. Indeed the quantity and variety of
                mineral resources used by a society is
                considered as an index of development and
                progress. Looking into the rate of consumption
                of raw materials by some of the industrialised
                rich nations, Romney (1965) called it "Mineral
                demand explosion", and the persistent effort of
                the underdeveloped or developing nations to
                rush in their foot-step, the Club of Rome
                (Medows et al, 1972) forecasted a raw material
                famine by the end of the century for many key
                minerals.    However,   exploration    strategy,
                technological advances in the know-how for
                extraction and discovery of new and cheaper
                sources of energy for extraction of the desired
                stuffs have made it theoretically possible to
                utilize the lower than the lowest grade ores
                increasing the resources reserve severalfolds.
                Apparently the rate of precipitation of some of
                the sea-bed minerals like manganese nodules
                is    considered   to   match     the   present
                     71 

 

    consumption rate of the metal (Mero, 1967).
    Besides, synthetic substitutes and alternative
    materials always appear in the market
    whenever the need arises. Collection of scraps
    and recycling of wastes have also made the
    non-replenishable         resources      virtually
    replenishable, expect for those which are too
    difficult to collect or contain in the present
    level of entrapment in the utility cycle and leak
    out into the environment (Fig 2 after Brooks,
    1976). "The sufficiency of physical resources in
    the earth's crust has become a matter of hot
    debate. Prophesy about the prospective
    exhaustion of the world's resources is rooted in
    the shifting stands of statistics on proved
    reserves" (U.S. National Commission on
    Material Policy, 1973) (Fig 3 after Govett et al,
    1974 and Fig 4 after McKelvey, 1974).
    Therefore, the spectre of world mineral
    starvation, once the slogan of many
    futurologists     no    more     threatens    the
    technologists of the present generation whose
    contention is "if oil and coal are exhausted
    (imagine the amount of CO2 that would be
    generated) man will turn for nuclear fission,
    then to fusion (irrespective of waste disposal
    problem?) and if natural resources are
    finished, there will be synthetics".

<blockquote id="blockquote_126">          Resources are almost infinitely greater
    than assumed by the Serra Club who brought
    out the scarcity model in terms of data
    available during the period. The geologically
    available resource becomes economically
    expoitable reserve depending on market
    conditions and technology. The scare is false
    and technology has always been able to extend
    the horizon of the resources reserve. For
    example with improved beneficiation and
    processing technique copper ore of 0.5% grade
    is today considered economically mineable and
    with micro-biol heap leaching, mining of 0.1%
    grade ore is not far from sight. However looking
    into the average lead time in mineral
    exploitation which take more than a decade to
    translate a "strike" to production and the rate
    of increase in consumption, the proved
    reserves of most key minerals are likely to be
    exhausted and here lies the "mineral crisis"
    model proposed by the Doomsters in the Limits
    of Growth.

                    The 'Limits of Growth" does not arise out
              of scarcity of resources, but out of scarcity of
              energy to convert the resources into products.
              The limits of energy again do not arise out of
              shortage of fossil or fissile fuels or in lack of
              technological know-how to harness 'alternate',
              'clean' or ' nonconventional' energy, but out of
              environmental impact in their use. For
              examples: the 'greenhouse gas' problems in
              burning of fossil dangers associated in
              operating nuclear power plants, the well-
              known problems of large dams generating
              hydel power, the possibility of large-scale
              surface     water   pollution    in   harnessing
              geothermal energy and last but not the least
              the possible impact on earth's rotation due to
              massive tapping of wind and tidal power have
              to be considered in the long run. In global
              mineral exploitation, a true environmentalist
              must think "globally while acting locally" (Clark
              and Holling, 1985). Besides we must remember
              that "to look is easy and to think is difficult"
              (Home 1978) but to act is dangerous.

<blockquote id="blockquote_132">    1. VISUAL IMPACT

    i. Source

         All the working mineral processes in

    The visual impact on the mines workings are
    due to the following sources:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_133">    a) Surface excavations:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_134">         The magnitude to which surface
    excavations intrude into the landscape bears
    no direct relationship to size. The nature of
    excavation, the surrounding landforms and
    the relationships between the two are the
    main factors. Fresh rock exposures created
    by surface mining are often highly visible.
    Serous visual impact is caused by the
    excavation intersecting the skyline. The
    resulting gap is almost invariably highly
    prominent.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_135">                       74 

 

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_136">    b) Waste Disposal:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_137">          Dumping of solid wastes, impounding of
    slurries, etc. cause visual intrusion. A
    particular problem of mining non-ferrous
    metals like lead and zinc is the disposal of
    tailings. Some impoundments are initially
    constructed so as to serve the life of the mine,
    but it is more common for dam walls to be
    progressively raised over an extended time
    period. Such methods result in long term
    visual intrusion.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_138">    c) Fixed plant:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_139">          Non ferrous metal mine requires
    crushing, grinding, classifying and processing
    circuits. Underground mines have head-
    frames, and haulage or winding equipment.
    These equipments are located for a wide area.
    Very frequently, the fixed surface plant gives
    rise to visual impacts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_140">    d) Mobile plant:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_141">         Mobile equipment also give rise to visual

<blockquote id="blockquote_143">          In addition to their nuisance as physical
    and chemical pollutants, liquid effluents and
    aerial emissions also cause aesthetic
    nuisance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_144">    ii. Measures for control

         All the underground mines should be
    confined and located in sparsely populated
    remote regions away from highways and
    densely populated areas. Then there would be
    no    pronounced    impacts     affecting the
    surrounding landscape. Preparation of a

    strata. Surface subsidence causes damages to
    man-made structures and it affects the
    ground-water     regime,    surface drainage
    pattern, highways, building and bridges.
    Sometimes the water and the gas mains may
    also get sheared or twisted.

<blockquote id="blockquote_147">    ii. Measures for Control

         To minimate the severity of deformation
    of the surface, modified mining methods
    should be adopted. Before designing new
    mining operations, the following points are to
    be taken into consideration:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_148">    a) The proposed site should be sufficiently
    away from areas of natural geological
    discontinuities (faults, thrusts, fractures etc.)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_149">    b) The structures should be designed with
    factor of rigidity, flexibility, etc. with due
    consideration for the subsidence problems
    and geo-technical setting.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_150">    (c) The mining should be planned to permit
    controlled subsidence with the entire
    overlying ground subsiding uniformly by
    using harmonic mining.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_151">    (d) The mined areas should be filled with sand
    or suitable packing material. Cut and fill
    system of mining also helps to prevent
    subsidence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_152">    3. NOISE

    i. Source

         The three major categories of noise
    source in mining operations are fixed plant,
                   76 

 

    mobile plant used internally and external
    transport       movements.      Fixed     plant
    machineries such as crushers, grinders,
    screens, conveyors, ventilation fans, etc.
    generate noise and vibrations. Similarly the
    mobile plant used on site associated with
    drilling, blasting, loading, haulage or service
    operations causes noise also. Thirdly, the
    external transport movements which are
    related to mining operations like supply to
    materials, the despatch of valuable product
    and waste by road, cause noise problems.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_153">    ii. Measures for Control

          There are three basic control techniques
    available: to lessen the noise generated at
    source, to isolate the source or to increase the
    attenuation or absorption between the source
    and listener. Noise is best controlled at source
    by choosing machinery and equipment
    suitably by proper mounting of equipment
    and ventilation fans and by providing noise
    insulating enclosures or padding. Noise of
    aerodynamic origin may be reduced by the
    use of absorption type silencers. Reactance
    mufflers can be used where the noise is
    caused by repeated pluses by gas, as in the
    case of exhaust of diesel and compressed air
    powered machines. Absorption mufflers can
    be used where there is a continuous noise
    such as a blower or pump. Regular
    maintenance of machinery and equipment
    can also affect significant reductions in noise
    levels. Residential colonies should be located
    reasonably away (about 3 km) from the
    mining       premises.      Boundary       walls
    (bafflewalls), waste banks and dense belt of
    trees should be erected to act as acconnstic
    barriers. A 10 m wide belt of trees of different
    heights act as a noise absorbant.

    i. Source

         In the blasting operations carried out in
    mines, the potential energy contained in the
    explosive is suddenly released, normally with
    the primary intention of fragmenting rock. A
                    77 

 

    secondary and undesirable result of explosive
    detonation is that the surface of the ground in
    the    vicinity  of   the   blast    undergoes
    displacement, the amplitude of which
    depends upon the distance from the blast, the
    energy released in explosion and the local
    geological conditions. Ground vibrations are
    caused by blasting operations, subsidence
    due to mining operations, deployment of
    mobile equipments, rock bursts and rock
    bumps. Blasting also generates air vibrations
    and in turn damages structurally unsound
    buildings. These vibrations cause annoyance
    also to human beings.

<blockquote id="blockquote_203">    8. NUISANCE DUE TO TRANSPORT

         Mining operations require a two way
    flow of goods, material, and the products with
    the external community. The transport
    associated with this exchange inevitably
    represents an extension of mining activity
    into the external environment, and often
    directly confronts the general public with
    environmental problems. The seven most
    important types of mineral transport are by:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_204">    a) road, b) rail, c) sea, d) inland waterways, e)
    aerial ropeway, f) conveyors, g) pipe lines.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_205">    i. Source

          Pollution problems are associated with
    all these types of transport as described above
    to some extent or other. Road transport
    method normally occasions the greatest
    number      and     range   of   environmental
    complaints. The principal areas of concern
    are public safety and inconvenience, noise
    and vibration, air pollution and visual
    intrusion.     The      main     environmental
    disadvantages of rail transport are noise,
                    82 

 

    vibration and dust. The environmental
    problems connected with sea transport are at
    the loading and discharge points as similar to
    those of rail. Inland waterways transport also
    has the same type of environmental problems
    as described for sea transport. The pollution
    problems associated with the conveyors are
    dust and visual intrusion. In the same
    fashion for the aerial ropeways the problems
    are similar. Finally in the case of pipelines the
    only problem is the very slight possibilities of
    pollution from leaks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_206">    ii. Measures for Control

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_207">    a) Precautions for the transport of materials
    both as regards personal safety and
    minimisation of loss of values during
    operations can be handled routinely since the
    methodology and techniques exit. Modern
    practice tends towards the use of explosive
    slurries which are mixed with chemicals to
    render them harmless in transit. Some of the
    chemicals used in ore beneficiation are in
    some forms and usages dangerously toxic.
    The special precautions for transporting
    dangerous substances should be observed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_208">    b) The concentrate after filtration being fairly
    dry can readily be dispersed by wind or
    spillage. When the concentrate has to be
    transported over long distances or shipped
    overseas, covered containers should be
    employed and precaution against spillage and
    wind blown dust should also be taken in
    unloading. Storage areas also ought to be
    covered and protected from the wind to avoid
    dispersal of the concentrate over the
    surrounding neighbourhood. This is more
    necessary in the case of lead bearing
    concentrates.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_209">    c) In case of dust problems in the conveyors
    and aerial ropeways, this can be controlled by
    the use of water sprays, regular maintenance
    or by total enclosure. Visual intrusion

    ropeways can be solved by careful selection of
    the route and minimising the height of
    structures.

              abandoned mineral workings require the
              establishment and maintenance of vegetation
              on the disturbed land. No other medium can
              achieve rapid visual reintegration, surface
              stabilisation or reductions in air and water
              pollution nor offer a wide variety of land use
              possibilities which can be achieved at
              acceptable cost. The design of the mining
              programme materially causes revegetation
              problems. In natural circumstances, plants
              exist in a soil, formed by weathering and
              biological processes from a parent rock which
              may or may not underlie it. The precise type
              of soil, which forms, depends upon the
              complex interactions between the parent
              rock, the climate, and the type of plants and
              animals which first colonise it.

    Fragile Nature of Geological Structure of
    Himalaya

          The Himalaya is one of the youngest
    mountain systems of the world; it is
    geologically unstable and made up mostly of
    stratified and sedimentary rock formation.
    The instability of the Himalayan regions is
    exemplified by the occurrence of earthquakes;
    several earthquakes in recent times have
    affected vast areas in the Himalaya. It is
    anticipated that such violent movements will
    continue in future. To-day the fragile
    structure of the Himalaya is being further
    undermined by the construction of huge
    dams, mining, use of high potency explosives
    and the tunneling of deep surge shafts which
    will eventually channel great volume of water.
    These activities have shaken the loose rocks
    of the mountains.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_218">          Due to quarrying limestones in the hills
    of Mussoorie, the environment of Doon Valley
    has become imbalanced. It has disturbed the
    stability of the fragile ecosystem. The
    extraction of the minerals initially disturbs
    the land-soil-vegetation system by removal of
    vegetation and top soil. This phenomenon is
    associated with mining. The high rainfall
    (specially in monsoons) worsens the land
    instability introduced by mining. The
    extraction of limestone creates a deteriorating
    ecological impact on land resources. The use
    of explosives to remove the rocks weakens the
    already fragile rock structure. Landslides due
    to mining have further increased the silting in
    the rivers and streams of the Doon Valley.
    Increased silting has also been observed in
    Bhagirathi river due to construction activity
    in connection with a Dam at Tehri.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_219">    Turbidity and       Its   Effect   on   Aquatic
    Environment

    Turbidity or silting also adversely affects the
    fauna and flora of the streams and rivers. It
    also hinders in the process of photosynthesis
    among photoplanktons. The highest and
    lowest turbidity changes have been found to
    be associated with minima and maxima of
    phytoplanktons. In the Bhagirathi river,
                   86 

 

    downstream from Tehri, due to excessive
    turbidity by the construction of dam, there
    has been a continuous decrease in the
    quantity of phytoplanktons, zooplanktons and
    fish communities. The turbidity decreases
    dissolved oxygen and increases carbon
    dioxide in the river water. Fishes are unable
    to detect their food in turbid waters. The
    feeding activity gets reduced, the gut is either
    empty or with only a small amount of food
    material. This could be due to the following
    reasons.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_220">    The increased turbidity affects the feeding of
    the fishes. In most of the fish, the stomachs
    were found to be empty and devoid of any
    food item. It appears that the turbidity of the

    activity of the fishes. In turbid waters, on the
    other hand, the fishes are unable to detect
    the food with ease.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_221">    The water resources of the Doon Valley are
    slowly and gradually drying up due to
    quarrying of the limestone deposits of the
    Mussoorie hills. The water retention power of
    the hills is exorbitantly reduced due to loss of
    top soil and vegetation cover and as such, the
    rain water quickly flows down the hills. As a
    result, the aquifers are not annually charged
    and the natural springs slowly die out. The
    valley is served mainly by streams originating
    in the Mussoorie hills. Calcium carbonate
    from lime based industries and dust from
    cement factory has polluted the environment
    of Doon Valley and the entire valley is turned
    into a gas chamber. The cement dust, which
    is a mixture of calcium carbonate and silica,
    affects the animal and plant life of this area.
    The dust layer on the plants (specially on the
    leaves) hinders the process of photosynthesis,
    transpiration and exchange of gases. Due to
    the layer of dust, the leaves do not get sun
    light (radiant energy) properly and slowly and
    gradually the chlorophyll pigment of the
    mesophyll tissue of the leaves gets
    disintegrated and ultimately the leaves
    become pale and yellow. The trees are unable
    to synthesise their food and as a result, they
    perish. This magnitude of pollution is also
    affecting the famous Basmati rice crop of
                             87 

 

              Dehra Dun. Quarrying for the limestone and
              phosphates have destroyed the green cover of
              the earth. The fertile top soil has been
              destroyed. It is estimated that one inch of
              natural soil formation takes place in 400-
              1000 years. During the process of unscientific
              mining, this layer is destroyed within days.
              The mining is fast spreading over the
              Himalaya, unspectacularly but relentlessly.
              The beautiful Himalayan forested hills are
              becoming bare producing, ugly landscapes.
              The wildlife is getting exterminated. This
              ecological stress in the mountains has a
              destructive impact in the plains because of
              the fury of floods, the siltation of reservoirs
              and dams, the loos of agriculture leading to
              irrecoverable human and economic losses.

    Chaunala and Suitola. Chemically it consits
    of Ca 45-50%, Mg 0.75 to 1.80%, and SiO2 5
    to 13.20, with an average of about 10.38%.
    About 60 million tonnes of limestone has

    areas has caused serious environmental
    problems in this sector of Himalaya. The
    various aspects of environmental degradation,
    as observed during field work are described in
    the following pages.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_237">    Deforestation- Prior to the mining activities
    the vegetal cover is removed from the mining
    sites,  accelerating    erosion   and    mass
    movement. The scree which is allowed to slide
    down the hill slopes near Dhunga (Plate 3),
    Tarigaon and Chandak is harming and
    hampering the growth of trees, shrubs and
    grasses. The recent growth of xerophytic
    plants around Chandak area indicate
    emergence of semidesertic to desertic climatic
    conditions    in    the   area   caused    by
    unscrupulous felling of trees.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_238">    Mass-Movement and siltation - In the process
    of excavation a huge amount of debris is
    allowed to roll down the valley slopes,
    accelerating the erosion. The scree originating
    from Chandak mines is swept away by the
    Papdev stream. During the last 13 years,
    more than 4 metres thick sediment load has
    been deposited in the stream, resulting in the
    widening of channel, flooding of low lying
    cultivated fields and accelerating bank
    erosion (Plate 2). The flash floods have
    completely destroyed the boundary walls and
    fencing of the cultivated fields such as seen
    near Papdev village, northwest of Pithoragarh
    township and along Rai gadhera. The very
    poorly maintained approach roads too
    contribute a large amount of mass wasting
    and sinking of the ground. On an average,
    construction of one kilometer road in the hills
    requires removal of about 40,000 to 80,000
    m3 of debris (Valdiya, 1985). As such the
    unmetalled approach roads connecting the
    mines to the main roads, such as Chandak-
    Dharigaon (3 km) Pithoragarh town-Tarigaon
    (1.9 km) Chandak to Dhunga (2.5 km),
    generate a large amount of loose debris. The
    loose material is allowed to roll down the
    slopes triggering off the landslides, increasing
    mass movement and reactivating the erosion
    processes. Most affected areas are the banks
    of Rai gadhera and western slope of
    Mostmanu. The abandoned mining sites in
                   93 

 

    the area continue to present dangers because
    of unsealed shafts, sharp cliffs and unstable
    spoil piles etc. The villagers informed that
    many cattles die every year due to such
    mining menace.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_239">    Geohydrological impacts - The mining
    activities have largely affected the local
    surface drainage as well as the groundwater
    conditions in area. Few years back, before the
    mining operations started in the Dharigaon
    area, there used to be water mills along the
    Chhanna gadhera, but the excessive siltation
    and debris flows in the stream have
    completely     changed      the   hydrological
    conditions and there is no water in the
    stream for running the mills (Plate 6).
    Moreover the excessive siltation has not only
    accelerated the erosion but has also
    destroyed the gradient required for running
    the mills, such as seen near Dharigaon. The
    blasting   operations have affected the
    discharge of the springs, even some springs in
    Papdev, Chandak, Dharapani, Kimchaur,
    Bajethi, Kaphlani, Marhgaon, Mostmanu,
    Helpati, Dhari and Channa have dried up
    during last two decades.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_240">    Health Hazards - Large quantities of smoke
    and dust are produced during excavation,
    blasting and beneficiation processes. The
    inhalation of dusty air causes pneumoconosis
    and many lung diseases. Thin layers of silt
    could be seen upto many kilometers away
    from the excavation and beneficiation plant
    sites. The silt and carbon emanating from the
    beneficiation plant ultimately settles on the
    leaves of the herbs, shrubs and plants
    causing severe physiological disorders due to
    blocking of stromata, affecting transpiration
    and photosynthesis processes. This causes
    molting and premature yellowing of leaves.
    The growth of pine trees near the Chandak
    and Tarigaon beneficiation plants has been
    affected, causing premature mortality of the
    leaves. The noxious gases produced during
    blasting and from dead burn magnesite
    (DBM) near Tarigaon and Chandak adds up
    to the problem of atmospheric pollution. The
    main pollutant gases being nitrous oxide,
    carbon mono-oxide and carbon dioxide. The
                             94 

 

              area has also suffered to some extent due to
              the noise pollution.

<blockquote id="blockquote_241">              Socio-economic impacts - The opening of the
              mining industries in this economically
              backward region of Himalaya has both
              positive    and    negative    socio-economic
              implications. The mining activities have
              raised the income of local people and have to
              some extent also changed the social
              environment. The problem of rehabilitation,
              scarification of agricultural land due to
              mining and their socio economic impact must
              be studied in detail before the actual mining
              operations are taken up.

              ago. The Mussoorie town situated at an
              altitude of 2000.5 m having a population of
              about 30,000 is no longer a queen of hills as
              these are badly scarred with irregular patches
              due to uncontrolled limestone quarrying and
              road construction to these quarries. This
              activity has posed a great threat to the
              ecosystem and stability of these mountains.
              The quarrying has resulted in the loss of top
              soil and vegetation cover thus increasing the
              soil erosion and landslides. The quarrying is
              being done in an unscientific manner and
              without any control measures for the
              protection of the ecosystem of these
              mountains. These hills need an immediate
              attention for the balance in the environment
              and the conservation of palnt, soil and water
              resources.

<blockquote id="blockquote_244">    Mussoorie hills fall within the district Dehra
    Dun of Western Himalaya. During the fifth
    decade of the present century the quarrying
    was confined to a few places. Since the lime
    extracted in Mussoorie and Dehra Dun valley
    is the best in India, the demand for it grew
    fast and leases for quarrying were given by
    the Government. The protests of the local
    people were ignored while issuing and
    renewing the leases. The quarrying in
    Mussoorie hills is carried out for the
    extraction of limestone, marble, dolomite,
    gypsum and a phosphate called Mussoorie
    phos. The quarrying in these hills is done by
    the private contractors and a Government of
    India Undertaking - Pyrites, Phosphates and
    Chemcials Limited. As a result of intensive
    quarrying, one views a shocking glimpse of
    the fading beauty of these mountains from
    Dehra Dun valley. Both the northern and the
    southern slopes have become badly scarred
    with wide, irregular patches making blots on
    these mountains. For the extraction of
    various minerals, the hills are quarried at
    random with the help of blasts using
    explosives. The quarries are situated at
    Hathipaon, Bhatta village, Durmala, below
    Mossey Fall, Near Kempty Falls, on the east
    and south of Jharipani, north of Rajpur and
    on all sides of Sahastradhara. There are
    about 60 temporary roads constructed for the
    carrier trucks from these quarries to the main
    roads.

<blockquote id="blockquote_245">    Topography and Geology

    The topography of these mountains is hilly
    with deep gorges and gullies. The rivers are
    smaller and pass through the narrow ravines
    in north-south direction. Most of the quarries
    are situated on the southern slopes which
    consist of less thicker vegetation as compared

    valley and Siwaliks. There are two belts in the
    Tertiary rocks - Mandali and Krol belts. The
    quarries occurin Krol belt. The Chandpur
    slate, consisting mainly of grey, green, purple,
    red and black coloured slates occupy the
    bottom of the rock formation. This slate is
    covered by pink, white and cream coloured
    quartzites in the sequence of rock geology.
    The Krol formation consist of limestone,
    dolomite and marble. The red shales comprise
    the lower units. The Krol formation is
    separated from the overlying Tal formation by
    a band of black coloured phosphorite. This
    rock part is quarried at Durmala to extract a
    rock phosphate called Mussoorie phos. The
    Tal formation consists of shales and
    quartzites.

<blockquote id="blockquote_247">    Effects of quarrying on the ecosystem

    The Mussoorie hills are badly denuded by
    quarrying and the construction of temporary
    roads to these quarries affecting the
    ecosystem of these mountains adversely. The
    quarrying has resulted in the loss of
    vegetation and top soil, decreased the water
    table and accelerated the soil erosion and
    landslides. The explosions for the blasting of
    rocks have weakened the faults and rock
    formations as a result of which the slope
    failures occur and these increase the
    probability of landslides.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_248">    The quarrying activities are going on in an
    unscientific manner as the check dams have
    not been constructed below these quarries to
    prevent the soil erosion. The mineral belt is
    exposed by random quarrying which clears
    the vegetation and top soil of these
    mountains. The blasting has activated the
    faults and the Main Boundary Thrust forming
    a disturbance zone in the middle area. This
    zone is prone to soil erosion and landslides
    due to slope failure. The hills are quarried
                   97 

 

    indiscriminately  without    following   any
    measures to prevent the ecological balance in
    the ecosystem. The quarry owners do not take
    any interest in maintaining a balance in the
    ecosystem.

<blockquote id="blockquote_249">    In the upper areas such as at Hathipaon,
    Durmala and Kempty Falls there has been a
    continuous decrease in the water table. The
    water resources in these areas have
    decreased in the recent years. The quarrying
    activities near the Mussoorie town and
    surrounding villages have threatened their
    stability. The accelerated soil erosion and
    landslides have resulted in the silting up of
    rivers and agricultural fields. The amount of
    silt has been increasing in the rivers at
    Rajpur and Sahastradhara. The waterfalls on
    the north of Sahastradhara have dried up due
    to quarrying on all sides of this area. The
    agricultural fields on the east and north of
    Sahastradhara have been filled up with the
    silt during the rains. The erosion and silting
    up of rivers have also caused the water
    pollution and the floods in Dehra Dun valley
    since 1978. The residential houses and
    agricultural area near Bhatta village, mossey
    Fall and below Hathipaon have been
    threatened due to quarrying in their upper
    parts. There has been an increase in the dust
    count of the air at various quarrying places.
    The maximum dust count has been recorded
    at Jharipani (89.7 per cubic feet of air) and
    Sahastradhara (98.6 per cubic feet of air). The
    amount of dust deposition on the vegetation
    has also been found in an appropriate
    quantity to affect the physiology of plants
    near the quarries and temporary roads. The
    amount of dust on the leaves of different
    species has recorded as 20 to 90 cm in 24
    hours. The dust particles block the stomata of
    these plants and ultimately kill them by
    affecting their physiology adversely. The
    maximum temperature of Mussoorie town has
    increased by 8 degrees in 1981 as against the
    maximum temperature in 1950 (25.80C).

    quarrying should not be allowed on the slopes
    where vegetation loss and soil erosion has
    taken place. The check dams should be made
    below the quarries. The blasted areas should

              minimizing the slope failures. The present
              open quarrying method should be switched
              over to tunneling or underground method to
              protect the top soil and vegetation cover.
              These conservation measures are essential to

<blockquote id="blockquote_257">    Introduction

    In the Himalayan region a series of narrow
    elongated          longitudinal       valleys
    characteristically designated as 'Duns' form
    important geomorphological features. They
    owe their origin primarily to the structural
    features rather than the erosional processes.
    The Dehradun, one such important valley is
    bounded by Lesser Himalaya in north and
    younger Siwalik mollasse in south and is
    limited by the rivers Ganga and Yamuna in
    east and west respectively. It lies between
    Long. 77035 to 78024 east and Lat. 29055 to
    30030 north and covers an area of more than
    2,000 sq km. The elevation ranges from 315
    to 2,400 m, with gradient varying between 7
    to 10 m/km. The annual rainfall is 2,145 mm
    and     the    maximum       and   minimum
    temperatures are 42 and 4 C respectively

    nature were to be utilized by the man for his
    own prosperity which he gallantly did, nut, in
    his over enthusiasm to plunder the earth's

    Geological and Geomorphological Model of
    the Valley

    Geologically the Dehradun valley is a
    synclinal trough within the Siwalik formation.
    The limbs of the syncline consist of the
    Middle and Upper Siwalik rocks followed by
    the northerly dipping Pre-Tertiary formations
    of Lesser Himalaya in north. On all these
    older formations are deposited the Pliestocene
    and Recent sediments, the Dun gravels.
    Towards north, unlike to the other part of
    Himalaya, the Siwaliks directly come in
    contact with the rocks of Krol nappe and thus
    the superposition of the krol thrust on the
    Main Boundary Fault is exhibited. Main
    Boundary Fault appears to be neotectonically
    active as revealed by changes in the river
    courses and movement of hills blocks,
    landslides etc.

    The oldest lithounit of the Lesser Himalayan
    succession in the present area is the
    Precambrian Chandpur Formation overlain by
    the Precambrian to Lower Palaeozoic Nagthat,
    Blaini, Infra-Krol, Krol and Tal Formation
    successively which form the northerly dipping
    southern limb of Mussoorie syncline.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_260">    The geomorphic features of the valley are the
    ultimate net result of the geological
    structures,       lithology,    erosional    and
    depositional processes, climate and drainage
    pattern. Geomorphologically also the valley
    can be divided into the northern lesser
    Himalayan zone, the southern Siwalik zone
    and the central valley zone, the three more or
    less coinciding with the synclinal-anticlinal
    pattern of the valley. Anatharaman (1981) has
    given a detailed classification of the various
    geomorphic regions of the Dehradun valley.
    viz. (i). Lesser Himalayan Structural Hills, (ii).
    Piedmont colluvial tract, (iii). Dun gravels and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_261">    (iv). Siwalik structural denudation hills.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_262">    The drainage pattern in the valley is also
    quite significant. There is main water divided
    trending more or less N-S and passing
    through the city of Dehra Dun and it
    separates the Ganga and Yamuna water
    systems. The rivers commonly exhibit
    intermittent drainage network.

    Natural Resources and their Exploitation

    The Chandpur phyllites, Nagthat quartzites,
    Blaini conglomerates and the Infra-Krol slates
    of the valley are broadly speaking barren as
    far as the mineral resources are concerned.
    However, some of the quartizite is locally used
    for building purposes but no economic
    significance can be given to it. One the
    contrary the Krol formation, particularly the
    massive as well as bedded limestone of the
    Upper Krol extensively exposed in the area
    formed the backbone of the mineral based
    industry in the Dehra Dun valley. Most of the
    limestone mined was till recent past being
    used from manufacture of lime but the
    cement grade and chemical grade varieties
    also occur and possibilities to establish
    suitable industries to use them could have
    been considered. A small-scale cement factory
    was already in operation in the region, but its
    closure has been ordered. There are a few
    workable pockets of gypsum within the Krols
    such as those near Sahastradhara, Chiphaldi
    etc. which are being currently mined by the
    private enterprises.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_264">    The Krol-Tal contact in the Mussoorie
    syncline is marked by the presence of 3 to 3.5
    m, thick phosphorite belt which has been
    found to be a most suitable natural fetiliser
    particularly for acidic soils. The mining is
    being carried out at Maldeota and Durmala
    by the PPCL, a Government of India
    undertaking. The other prospective deposits
    are   located    at   Paritibba,  Chamasari,
    Chiphaldi and Bhusti, the exploitation of
    which may be taken up in due course of time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_265">    The younger Siwalik rocks supply good
    building material. The Upper Siwalik
    sandstone in the valley is suitable to be mixed
    up with some of the Krol limestone for the
    manufacture of Portland Cement. The Dun
    gravels supply material to be used for
    building purposes.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_266">    Besides these, there       are some minor
    occurrences of minerals   like barite, galena,
    marble and lignite from   various formations,
    the economic importance   of which has not yet

    localities in the Dehradun valley and

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_267">    The forest of Dehradun valley occupy more
    than 60% area and is represented by different
    types of herbs, shrubs and trees. Babu (1977)
    has given an elaborate list of some of the
    noteworthy plants which proves that the
    Dehradun forest is extremely rich for wood
    industries, fruit production and therapeutic
    applications besides the wild life protections.
    The species of deodar, sal, oak, walnut,
    semal, khair, gular, kans, munj, strawberry,
    kunj etc., are worth mentioning.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_268">    So far as the soil resources are concerned, the
    valley comprises both denudational and
    depositional soils. The Dun gravels form older
    and younger terraces of different rivers of
    both      Ganga     and    Yamuna      system.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_269">    Sedimentological studies have shown that the
    older Pleistocene terraces are fluvioglacial
    whereas the younger Holocene terraces are
    fluvial (Prasad and Verma, 1974). The soil of
    the region has been proved to be very fertile
    for the cultivation of rice, sugarcane, fruits
    and vegetables.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_270">    Even in case of water resources the valley is
    quite prosperous. The annual rain-fall is so
    high that the water poured in the valley has
    to follow various river channels to feedup the
    two major rivers Ganga and Yamuna. It is
    only the topography of the region which is
    responsible for the intermittence in the
    surface runoff. Ground water level is
    transected for the water to come out in the
    form of springs and seepages. Nossin (1971)
    points out that it is fortunate for the valley to
    have the Dun-Aquifer-zone which more or
    less coincides with the limits of Dun fan
    formation. Further, the Lesser Himalayan
    zone is characterised by the presence of
    extensive limestone formation of the Krols.
    This also gives rise to a number of spring
    zones in the valley which according to
    Saxena, Anantharaman and Pande (1979) can
    be classified in the following zones:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_271">    Candrabhaga-Rishikesh spring zone; Dun-
    aquifer zone; Swarna-Ghuchupani-Bhogpur-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_272">                  104 

 

    Ogal spring zone; Aglar-Khattapani-Bidhalana
    spring zone, and Ghattudhar-Murray spring
    zone.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_273">    Thus it is obvious that as far as the natural
    resources are concerned the valley is highly
    prosperous     to    feedup    the    regional
    requirements of both the mountainous and
    plain habitations. However, as in other cases,
    in exploitation of these resources also, it is
    essential that a proper balance is maintained
    so that it does not hamper the natural
    environment.      Ironically   the     various
    developmental programmes being carried out
    in the valley were not observing the
    environmental planning schemes till recent
    past. Although, now the situation is slightly
    changed due to the alert and conscious
    pursuation by various social, scientific and
    academic agencies as also due to strict steps
    taken by the government, there are still some
    voices of concern regarding the economic
    development of the valley and related social
    and socio-economical problems. So it is self
    evident that a perception of environmental
    degradation and the economical growth
    should be developed in a balanced manner.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_274">    Perception of Eco-Imbalance

    Substantial contributions have been made by
    the geoscientists in perception studies as a
    part of hazard research which was initially
    confined to natural hazards Poerter1 has
    enlarged the scope of hazard perception
    research    by   introducing   environmental
    hazards as a recognition of the human and
    social contribution to the existence of
    hazards. Technological hazards also form a
    part of environmental hazards as the former
    is    a    concomitant     of   technological
    contributions to the creation of a desirable
    man - environment relationship. But
    mismanagement of technology has been
    greatly responsible to create technological
    hazards which, in many cases, become more
    damaging than the natural hazards. Burton
    and Kates (1978) stated that in resource
    management activities, inadequate knowledge
    of environment leads to extreme hazardous
    conditions. Mehrotra and Joshi1, while
                   105 

 

    reviewing the environmental degradation in
    Himalaya have also shown that the relatively
    young and tectonically weak mountain
    system is in itself prone to natural hazards
    which become more damaging by the addition
    of server technological hazards caused by the
    mineral exploitation activities. Subsequently
    Mehrotra and Bahukhandi (1982) have
    carried out detailed investigations of Eastern
    Himalayan sector and have substantially
    proved that there also the natural hazards
    have been accelerated due to technological
    applications.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_275">    From this point of view when one looks at
    Dehradun valley, he immediately discerns the
    grave situation of both natural and
    technological hazards in this region too. The
    slope failure and landsliding has been a
    common phenomenon in this region and the
    incompetent rocks like phyllites, slates and
    shales accompanied with highly jointed
    quartzites and sandstones were being most
    susceptible to large-scale erosion causing
    severe damages, (Sah, Pal &amp; Mazari, 1982).
    Similarly the neotectonic activity bringing
    upheaval of the valley and changing the
    courses of the rivers and creating fluctuations
    in the rate of erosion were also bringing about
    additive effects. Besides, a major portion of
    the area is occupied by the limestones which
    being relatively susceptible to water action
    creates numerous cavities and caverns
    ultimately weakening the region. The Rajpur -
    Mussoorie tract Saura viilage Dwara village
    Ichari dam site are some of the important
    examples of such natural hazards.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_276">    Soil erosion is also enhanced by various
    natural activities such as the high rainfall,
    landslides, network of torrents and the sloppy
    terrains (Bharadwaj, 1982). Similarly the
    landsliding and slope failure cause natural
    deforestation also. Another intends to
    emphasise here that although hazards do
    occur naturally but the nature has got the
    tendency to compensate the loss and
    maintain the ecobalance by soil accumulation
    and afforestation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_277">    On the contrary man creates technological
    hazards ignoring the compensation. The

    quarrying for limestone from the hills and
    along the northern border of the valley is a
    glaring example. Whosoever had visited the
    beautiful Sahastradhara tourist resort a few
    years back will be shocked to see the
    unscrupulous mining operations which have
    extensive wastelands and bare hills. The
    overburden was dumped in the Baldi river
    valley not only damaging the greenery but
    also causing water pollution. Apart from
    being a beauty spot the Sahastradhara spring
    water has been found similar in composition
    to that of Trinquelle (Germany) and the white
    sulphur spring (USA) which are used for the
    cure of skin diseases (Saxena, Anantharaman
    and Pande, (1979). If such highly medicinal
    water instead of being used for the specific
    purpose gets polluted it's significance will be
    totally lost.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_278">    At Maldeota quarrying for phosphorite is
    going on. Although water pollution in the
    Bandal river is being induced by the steams
    flowing from the mine site but the PPCL
    seems to be cautious regarding the problem.
    They have built barrages to check the waste
    accumulation and are trying to some extent
    recultivation of forests. However, it is
    necessary to accelerate this process, as the
    measures being taken are quite insignificant
    comparing the loss. Huge boulders are being
    eroded blocking the valleys. At Durmala
    phosphorite      quarry     also,    suitable
    precautionary measures are being applied
    and the removed overburden is begin
    accumulated in the dry valley gaps, thus
    strengthening the slopes.

    The coming of East India Company to this
    region in 1815 was the beginning of the
    opening of the Himalaya. The colonial rulers
    cast longing eyes on the natural wealth of the
    Himalayan region and beyond. The search for
    resin, timber and minerals had begun before
    they actually reached here. The travelers and
    hunters who came here in that period did not
    forest to mention the forest and mineral
    wealth of the region, apart from the general
    wilderness of the Himalaya. Francis White
    (1837) was possibly the first traveler who
    mentioned about the vast reserves of
    limestone in the Mussoorie region. Those were
    the years when Mussoorie was in its infancy.
    In the lap of the hills over which the 'queen of
    mountains' settled down, the minerals
    remained unexploited for the next hundred
    years. The harmonious relationship between
    man and nature remained undisturbed and
    water resources from the nearby hills to
    Sahastradhara undefiled. The Britishers kept
    the region in good shape, particularly the hill

    politics and administration monopolized

<blockquote id="blockquote_306">    From Injury to Sickness

    Now, Dehradun known for its litchi and
    basmati and Mussoorie for its wood and
    snows, began to grow and develop. For
    making luck from mining and forests,
    indiscriminate felling of the trees and over-
    use of dynamites for mining became a
    common feature. The population of Mussoorie
    was 500 in 1840, 5000 in 1881, and it
    swelled to 18,241, in 1981, while that of
    Dehradun went up from 2,126 in 1827,
    20,683 in 1881 to 2,93,628 in 1981. The
    unregulated mining caused landslides, soil-
    erosion and floods-a recurrent and dreadful
    phenomenon. But for a long time public
    opposition against the formidable contractor
    lobby was pail and unorganized. Even the
    decisions taken by the Chief Minister Sri.
    H.N. Bahuguna (1976) against renewal of
    leases could not be implemented because of
    the influence of the contractor lobby.
    Although now the public was not a mute
    spectator and the issue was raised by
    journalists and scientists but is was of no
    avail. The landslides and soil erosion in
    Mussoorie area made floods in Dehradun
    more gruesome. The volume of silt in Balti
    and Rispana rivers become unprecedented
    and the water source of Sahastradhara, also
    known for its medicinal value, dried up. Since
    the cement and lime factories were gulping

    Soapstone (talc) is yet another important
    mineral being recklessly exploited in the
    remote regions of Uttarakhand. Mining and
    environmental laws do not restrict this
    ind8iscriminate exploitation. For more than a
    decade, the mining of soapstone is being
    carried out in Garia-Gadera, Chaurathal,
    Basguna, Kheerakote Knada and Kiroli etc.,
    in Almora Huna in Chamoli, villages of

    and nahikala-Barkote etc. in Dehradun
    districts. The mineral is rapidly being
    exploited and exported to many parts of the
    world since its demand in the international
    market is very high. The mining of soapstone
    has enabled the criminals and exploiters to
    penetrate into the remote villages and
    combined with activities of the criminal
    contractors this has damaged the rural fabric
    in more than one way. Most of the mining

    the mining licencees. But it is also true that
    in some rural areas, such as Huna,
    Gariagadera, Kheerakote and, Hevalghati etc.,
    mining has either been retarded or stopped
    due to local protests. Very recently, anti-

    still    taking    place    drastically   and
    unscientifically with the connaivance of
    politicians and administrators, close to the
    contractor-capitalist lobby. Especially where
    the big industrialists have monopolized
    mining and allied industries, local protests
    and environmental consciousness, both are
    being suppressed.

<blockquote id="blockquote_324">               Introduction

               Economic development of any region largely
               depends upon the availability of resources
               and their exploitation to the optimum
               capacity which is of paramount importance.
               This also applies to the minerals and rocks.
               Minerals are required for the industrial use
               whereas rocks are required for the rural,
               urban and industrial developments. Such
               activities reduce or destruct the biological
               potential of the land which can ultimately
               lead to disturb the otherwise balanced
               ecosystem thereby creating "wasteland".
               Though the mining areas are not covered
               under the definition of wasteland, but such
               activities when carried out irrationally by the
               man for their own needs, develops focil of
               desertification during and after the mining
               activity (Man and Chatterji, 1978). The
               mining activity is increasing day by day e.g. in
               Rajasthan during the last decade the mining
               activity has spread over to double the area,
               and with this rate of increase in area likely to
               be effected by the year 2000 will about three
               folds (based on the growth rate between 1970
               and 1976 (Saxena and Chatterj, 1985). As per
               the estimates of the Department of
               Environment, Government of Rajasthan, the
               State has 37.8% area as wasteland as
               compared to country's average of 16.21%.
               Even in the higher rainfall areas of Udaipur
               and Bhilwara district the wasteland cover
               38% and 40% areas respectively which is due
               to more mining activity.

<blockquote id="blockquote_325">               Mining for mineral and lock is known from
               the ancient times. However, most of these
               activities were on small scale, sporadic and
               intermittent. The mining activity gained
               impetus during the world war II. At that time
               no regulations regarding the conservation,
               optimum development and utilization of
               deposits were introduced. Consequently the
               mining activity was mostly indiscriminate and

    Independence      in    1947    that   mining
    regulations    and     mineral    conservation
    ordinance came into existence and improved
    the mining activity to some extent.

<blockquote id="blockquote_326">    Land damaged by the mining and other allied
    activities must be reclaimed to the possible
    extent so that we do not handover a
    desertified and complete wasteland to the
    future generation. This would only be possible
    if the mine owners, who are accruing profits
    out of these activities, invest a percentage of
    profit to rehabilitate and restore the ecological
    balance or to make these land productive in
    other sense. Some large mine owners having
    mineral based industries have recently
    initiated to follow the conservation and
    rehabilitation plans but small mine owners
    which are in large number and scattered over
    whole of the country, do not follow any
    conservation norms. Moreover road material
    mining leaves behind numerous shallow pits
    of 1-2 metre depth and covers wider area
    poses a potential threat (Saxena and
    Chatterji, 1985). In arid and semi-arid areas,
    the ecosystem is so fragile that when
    disturbed;    its    restoration    becomes     a
    herculean task. Imbalanced conditions of
    such disturbed ecosystem are largely
    governed by the type of mining, scale of
    mining, resulting topography, physical and
    chemical nature of the mine waste and
    procedure of their disposal.

    Types of mining

    Broadly the mining activity could be classified
    into three groups i.e. (i) alluvial, (ii) open cast
    and (iii) underground. These could be small
    manual operations or large scale semi or fully
    mechanised depending upon the extent of
    ore/mineral/rock deposits and its use.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_328">    Whatsoever may be the type or magnitude of

    effect on the ecosystem by way of (i) removal
    of vegetation i.e. tree, shrub and grasses, (ii) if
    there is any surface overburden over the body
    it will have to be removed and dumped

    be scrapped and dumped on the surface near

    market value have to be also dumped
    separately.

<blockquote id="blockquote_329">    Impact of mining

    All of the above processes have the
    undermentioned adverse impact on the
    existing balance of ecosystem and causes
    land of degradation (Saxena and Chatterji,
    1986).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_330">    (1) Reduction of land: Due to mining operation
    undertaken on the fertile/productive land the
    areas available for cultivation, forestry and
    grassland are reduced. Even when the mining
    activity are on the rocky areas, these reduce
    the forest and pasture land. In both of the
    cases disposal of surface material, mine
    wasteland low grade product pose a still
    greater threat in reducing the productive
    land.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_331">    (2) Pollution hazards: Mining activity causes
    three types of pollution hazards.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_332">    (a) Air: The fine mineral/ore/rock particulates
    released during the process of blasting are
    released to the atmosphere. These in turn
    cause health hazards to the miners, animals
    and people inhabiting in the adjoining areas,
    retards and destroys the plant growth (Vyas
    et al, 1985) and when it ultimately settles
    down on land also adverse effects in several
    ways.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_333">    (b) Land surface: When the atmospheric
    particulates settles down on the land surface
    and also minewaste which spreads all over
    the mining area, changes the land capability
    class and the productivity of the land is
    reduced.      Moreover   these    are   being
    transported by the surface runoff during the
    rains and pollute the surface water resources
    like lakes, rivers etc.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_334">    (c) Underground: The toxic and harmful metal
    and mineral which gets dissolved in the rain
                   121 

 

    water percolates down to the aquifer within
    the mining area and also in the adjoining
    areas thereby deteriorating the ground water
    quality which has again its adverse effects
    depending upon the use and may turn them
    into wastelands.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_335">    (3) Degradation of land capability class: The
    removal of productive top soil development of
    gullies and exposure of rock/hard pan on the
    surface, deposition of fine particulates from
    the air and contamination of the surface and
    ground     water    resources   reduce     the
    productivity of the land and thereby reduce
    the land capability class.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_336">    (4) Development of salinity: The fine
    particulates which get accumulated on the
    land    surface     gradually       reduce  the
    permeability of the top soil formation thereby
    the recharge to the aquifer is reduced and
    during rainy season the area gets water
    logged.    This    in    turn      releases the
    mineral/metal contents of the particulate and
    develops the salinity in the soil.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_337">    (5) Deterioration of hydrological conditions:
    Due to mining activity and disposal of
    minewaste, especially in case of surface
    mining, the surface drainages are disturbed
    and blocked. Due to which the surface
    storage in the adjoining areas, which receive
    water from these drainages, are affected. Also
    the blocking of the drainage channels and
    structurally weak joints reduce the recharge
    to the aquifer. As a result the yield from the
    wells and quality of ground water are affected.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_338">    (6) Land subsidence: This takes place only in
    case of underground mining, specially on the
    sensation of mining activity i.e. when all of
    the underground support structum are
    withdrawn. Thereby causing a scar in the
    land surface small or big depending upon the
    magnitude of the underground excavated
    area.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_339">    (7) Development of pits: This is associated with
    the alluvial and open cast mining methods,

    mining activity.

    All of the above degradational processes
    either singularly or collectively causes to
    degrade the land and develop 'wasteland'.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_341">    Allied activity

    Most of the mining activities are associated
    with    beneficiation    or   upgrading    and
    processing activities. Because most of the
    mining products are not directly used, these
    have to be either upgraded, concentrated or
    processed for use by the industry or other.
    The beneficiation process is composed of
    crushing, sizing classification, washing and
    scrubbing,     floatation    and    separation
    components. Likewise the processing is also
    composed of crushing, cutting, grinding and
    polishing     and       chemical    processing
    components. It is not essential that all of the
    components are always associated with each
    beneficiation and processing activity.

    Both of the above processes         affect   the
    ecosystem in three ways i.e.

    (1) Atmospheric      This can be classified
    into two groups:

<blockquote id="blockquote_344">    (b) Chemical fumes: These are emitted from
    the floatation, separation and chemical
    processing stages where chemical reactions
    are involved. These are detrimental for the
    health of the inhabitants and vegetation.

               resources. These are also dissolved with the
               water and contaminate the ground water
               during the process of recharge. This
               contamination affects the use of water.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_348">               (c) Disposal of tailing: These need extra

<blockquote id="blockquote_354">               Mining and Environment

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_355">               a) What is environment? Environment as one
               understands is the status of various factors
               which contribute towards healthy living, the
               nature of land, air noise, water and other
               factors. Irregular or improper handling of any
               one    of    these    attributes upsets    the
               equilibrium. Though these elements had been
               damages or disturbed over the years the
               cumulative effect of these has created a
               persetible change in the conditions around
                   124 

 

    us, that the awareness has only been recent.
    There are many causes for disturbance of
    these natural factor and one significant cause
    of upsetting of environment has been the
    mining operations. Metals and minerals have
    been part of the human needs from times
    immemorial but the recent upsurge in
    population, industrialisation and the need for
    raw material have been the cause of increased
    exploitation of metals and minerals. Coal,
    lignite, iron, manganese, lead and zinc and
    copper and a host of such commodities are
    needed for a large number of uses in any
    developed and developing countries. There
    have been large scale exports and these to
    developed countries due to lack of technology
    in the processing as well as money to do so
    and sooner we become self sufficient in our
    requirements and export processed minerals
    and metals the stronger would our country
    be.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_356">    b) Metals and minerals are invariably or
    largely situated in forest areas of different
    densities, especially in areas very vulnerable
    to environmental degradation, like top of hills
    watersheds and valleys. This has led to
    conflicts.   There    has    always    been   a
    controversy about location of mining or nay
    other projects in forest areas. There are
    reasons for this. The country's forest
    resources were very rich. After independence
    we have lost more than 4.3 million hectares of
    forests due to release for agricultural
    extension, development of communications
    and power, submersion due to power and
    irrigation projects, development of command
    areas, release of forests for rehabilitation of
    repatriates from Ceylon, Tibetan people and
    East       Pakistan      displaced     persons,
    indiscriminate exploitation of Zamindari areas
    before being handed over to Forest
    Department, mining etc.. It is not only mining
    that has destroyed the forest. It is the
    cumulative effect of all these which have been
    responsible for reduction of forest area.
    Though about 1/3 of land area has to be
    under forest, the area of forests is about 23%
    according to Forest Department while NRS
    agency shows it as hardly 12%. This is a very
    alarming situation as we need more forests to
                   125 

 

    cater to the increasing needs of timber, fuel,
    usufruchts and a host of materials required
    by the people, raw materials needed for
    industries, protection of watersheds and
    conserving the soil. It is in this context that
    the Government is now insisting towards
    more trees, and for restoration of mined out
    sites and for adopting measures against soil
    erosion, preventing floods and maintaining
    proper conditions to improve the health and
    quality of life of the people living around
    mined areas. It is thus a duty on the part of
    all of us to face the challenge and avoid
    conflicts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_357">    A balanced outlook is thus needed. We need
    forests and trees etc. We also need metals
    and minerals for a developing country. We
    need to prevent degradation of environment.
    We need to generate employment oriented
    projects. This being so, it is essential that
    environmental improvement works are taken
    up and implemented with the same zeal and
    enthusiasm as production of metals and
    minerals. It has now become incumbent on
    the part of mining organisations to submit
    environmental        management           plans
    simultaneously with the detailed project has
    to clear the project before final clearance. It
    would be worthwhile to work out the
    percentage of expenditure that is being spent
    on environmental safeguards and restoration
    of mined land to as near its original form. The
    figures would be shocking. It thus calls for an
    immediate reorientation of thinking in these
    matters.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_358">    Impact of mining

    Mining results in despoliation of land, creates
    ugly scars and leaves the area with large
    lakes, hillocks rendering the area useless for
    any other purpose.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_359">    a) Loss of forests: Mining directly affects
    forests when located in a wooded area. There
    is loss of timber and fuel resources,
    usufruchts, minor forest produce and loss of
    habitat for wild life. The vegetation has to be
    cleared and this results in irregular
    exploitation of forest contrary to accepted
    principles of removal of wood equivalent in
                    126 

 

    volume to that of increment put on by forests
    in a year. The destruction of forests is more
    evident in an area when open cast mining is
    resorted to. In the case of underground mines
    land subsidence when it occurs becomes
    significant but it is equally serious. Mining
    also results in loss of genetic resources.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_360">    b) Loss of agricultural lands: Mining
    invariably, if forests are absent, affects
    agricultural lands. It may be rainfed, or
    irrigated or garden lands or orchards which
    are valuables grown over the years out of soil
    and soiling their hands. Their acquisition is
    resented as such cannot be built over a short
    period however high the compensation may
    be. It is a highly sensitive issue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_361">    c) Loss of home - rehabilitation: Mining results
    in the displacement of people and their
    vacating the villages and homes where they
    have lived over the year, as well as their
    lands. This is the most sensitive aspect of the
    project - any project. They resent, and if there
    is a strong political backing, the project may
    not come through. If the area lies in a tribal
    belt and the tribal people resent, there is
    difficulty in the projects going through.
    Should the project be approved the selection
    of an alternative area to rehabilitate the
    displaced people is a vexed problem.
    Proximity to different facilities, water supply,
    sanitation, proper housing, medical facilities,
    providing other infrastructural facilities,
    roads etc., are important considerations in
    chosing the sites for rehabilitation. Of course
    if the site is in forests, there is the problem of
    getting clearance. Best is to avoid locating
    forest lands for this and other infrastructural
    facilities. Either rehabilitation colonies are
    built or compensation with a site given to the
    families. The payment of compensation is
    beset with difficulties as the youth are likely
    to misuse the funds for various purposes.
    This is a matter of policy of the organisation.
    Secondly, the displaced people invariably
    request employment of atleast one member of
    the family in the mining project which I hear
    now, is discouraged due to surplus labour in
    the coal sector. In the matter of rehabilitation,
    data has to be collected carefully and when
                   127 

 

    one goes to do that, villagers drive out the
    staff since they are against the project coming
    up. A considerable P. R. work is also needed
    and a proper planning is necessary. People
    locally living and even State Governments
    resent to such projects which supply coal to
    thermal stations in other States, and supply
    of power to other States at their cost.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_362">    d) Air pollution: Mining results in serious
    disturbance     of   soil   involving digging,
    transport and dumping. This leads to
    considerable dust generation at all levels
    inspite of the provisions of safeguards. When
    mines are situated on hill tops and the speed
    of the wind is high, the dust generated in the
    mines is carried far and wide affecting the
    atmosphere and the life of the local workers
    and people living around the mine. Inhalation
    of the fine dust results in development of

<blockquote id="blockquote_370">    Role of Forest in Maintenance of Ecology
    and Environment

    Ecology has been receiving increased
    attention in recent years. The place of man in
    nature, his influence on the environment and
    the influence of the total environment on man
    are objects of increasing study and thought.
    Forests intercept incoming and outgoing
    radiation, precipitation, and winds and have
    thus a marked effect on the microclimate.
    They filter dust from the air and absorb it. It
    is known that a stand of one hectare of
    spruce collects about 32 tonnes of dust from
    the air, one of pine 36.4 tonnes and a like one
    of beech (a broad leaved tree) 68 tonnes till
    the needles and leave can hold no more dust.
    The dust carrying winds invade the forest and
    deposit the dust on the leaves, branches and
    stems. By the mechanical obstacles the wind
    also loses much energy. Its velocity is reduced
    resulting in an increased dust precipitation.
    During the rains the dust is washed to the
    ground, where, due to moisture, it loses its
    flying capacity and is thus bound. This can
    be termed as "active filtering". Dense forest
    stands which the wind cannot penetrate have
    a positive effect on the purification of the air.
    The wind's ascent in front and the descent
    behind the obstacle, create air currents, jams
    and     vortices     causing   increased    dust
    sedimentation. This is called "passive
    protection". The forest serves also in removing
    dust source. Best results have been obtained
    by extensive afforestation on the dumps of the
    lignite districts of the Rhine land in Germany.
    The air cleaning capacity of the forest has
    indirect positive effects in so far as the
    condensation nuclei, necessary for fog
    formation, are absorbed form the air. Thus
    the frequency and density of fog formation is
    reduced. This has a direct bearing on the
    occurrence of fog on the ore body in
    Kudremukn during December and January.
    Dust particles absorb sunlight and reduce
    ultra-violet radiation.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_371">                   130 

 

    A special property of the forest is that the
    leaves and needles can absorb upto 50% of
    the collected radio iodine. The forest protects
    man against radio active radiation as it
    screens fields and pastures against radio
    active dust, saving man from incorporation
    radio activity contaminated nutrition.

<blockquote id="blockquote_372">    For mental recreation the forest is ideal. In
    the quiet of the forest the hunted man finds
    peace. Freed from the anonymity of the mass
    he finds himself again. There nature is
    observed in its various aspects. He often gets
    to inner contemplation. The continuously
    changing views divert him from the sorrows of
    daily life.

<blockquote id="blockquote_373">    Forests intercept incoming and outgoing

    regime, amount and kind of soil organic
    matter supplied, animal and plant life in the
    soil layers and depth of rooting. Soils under
    tropical forests have thin organic layers
    resulting in a rapid decomposition of organic
    matter and recirculation of nutrients. Forest
    soils in comparison with grasslands soils,
    have greater porosity and tend to encourage
    infiltration and absorption of water and to
    increase underground supplies. Forests
    reduce extremes of soil temperature partly by
    canopy action and partly by the action of the
    forest floor.

    tonnes per hectare. Later this dust is washed
    to the ground by rains. Filtering of dust by
    trees removes water condensation nuclei and
    reduces     fog   which     often     contains
    concentrations of health damaging nuclei and
    reduces     fog   which     often     contains
    concentrations of health damaging gases.
    Dust in the air reduces ultraviolet radiation
    diminishing the formation of Vitamin D and
    the germicidal and healing effect of sunlight.
    A negative psychic effect may result from
    dust. Forests control erosion as the soil is
    protected from rain drop splash and surface
    run off become minimum. Forest soils, well
    stocked with deep rooted trees, have a storage

    be classified in the following categories :- (i)
    minerals which occur in great abundance and

    Discontinuation chains of lentiform deposits of
    coarsely crystalline magnesite extend for

<p id="p_60">Ecology

      The subdiscipline of biology that concentrates on the
relationships between organisms and their environments; it is
also called environmental biology. Ecology is concerned with
patterns of distribution (where organism occur) and with
patterns of abundance (how many organisms occur) in space
and time. It seeks to explain the factors that determine the
range of environments that organisms occupy and that
determine how abundant organisms are within those ranges.
It also emphasizes functional interactions between co-
occuring organisms. In addition to its character as a unique
component of the biological sciences, ecology is both a
synthetic and an integrative science since it often draws upon
information and concepts in other sciences, ranging from
physiology     to        meteorology,      to   explain   the   complex
organization of nature.

somewhat more general term is habitat, which refers in a

Applied Ecology

Applied ecology is that branch of ecology dealing with
practical problems of immediate social importance. Ecology is
often    confused    in   the     minds     of   laypersons       with    the
environmental movement, a social interest group concerned
with environmental degradation and problems of resource
supply    to   human      societies.      Applied    ecology      makes    a
fundamental contribution to those social and political
concerns by identifying environmental problems, gaging their
significance, and suggesting potential solutions. Among the
environmental       issues   to    which     ecology      had   made      an
important contribution have been problems of population
growth and resource supply, acid rain, eutrophication,
consequences of pollution, biological control of crop pests,
range management, forestry, and the ecological consequences
of nuclear war. From T.R. Mathus's essay on human
population growth to recent scientific evaluations of nuclear
war, ecology has always been concerned with problems that
are important to the affairs of humans.

<p id="p_63">Ecosystem ecology

Ecological systems, or ecosystems, are complexes of plants,
animals, microorganisms, and humans, together with their
environment.    Environment         includes        all   those    factors,
physical, chemical, biological, sociocultural, which affect the
ecosystem. The complex of life and environment exists as an
interacting system and is unique for each part of the Earth.
The unique geological features, soils, climate, and availability
of plants, animals, and microorganisms create a variety of
different types of ecosystems, such as forests, fields, lakes,
rivers, and oceans. Each ecological system may be composed
of hundreds to thousands of biological species which interact
with each other through the transfer of energy, chemical
materials, and information. The interconnecting networks
                                 138 

 

which characterize ecosystems are often called food webs
(Fig. 1). It is obvious from this structural feature of
interaction that a disturbance to one population within an
ecosystem could potentially affect many other populations.
From another point of view, ecosystems are composed of
chemical     elements,   arranged      in   a    variety     of   organic
complexes. There is a continual process of loss and uptake of
chemicals to and from the environment as populations are
born, grow and die, and are decomposed. Ecosystems operate
on energy derived from photosynthesis (called primary
production) and from other energy exchanges. The functional
attributes of ecosystems, such as productivity, energy flow,
and cycling of chemical elements, depend upon the biological
species in the ecosystem and the limiting conditions of the
environment. See BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY; ECOLOGICAL
ENERGETICS; FOOD WEB.
</p>
<p id="p_64">Ecological systems develop in accord with the regional
environment. Although these systems have evolved to resist
the normal expected perturbations encountered in the
environment, unusual disturbances and catastrophic events
can upset and even destroy the system. In this case, recovery
can occur after the disturbance stops. Recovery is termed
ecological succession since it comprises a sequence of
communities which succeed each other until a dynamic
steady state is reestablished. See ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION.
</p>
<p id="p_65">Populations in these ecosystems fill a variety of structural
and functional roles within the system. Often, groups of
populations coevolve, so that they form a more or less
isolated subunit. For examples, the pollinators of a plant
species, and their predators and parasites, form such a guild.
Populations continually adapt and develop through natural
selection,   expanding    to   the     limit    of   their    resources.

<p id="p_66">Atmospheric problems

The atmosphere is one of the most important components of
the environment to consider from the viewpoint of applied
ecology since it connects all portions of the Earth into one
ecosystem. The atmosphere is composed of a variety of gases,
of    which   oxygen   and    nitrogen   make   up   the   largest
percentage. It is not uniform in its depth or its composition,
but is divided into several layers or zones which differ in
density and composition. Although most interaction with
humans occurs in the zone nearest Earth, the most distant
parts of the atmosphere are also important since they affect
the heat balance of the Earth and the quality of radiant
energy striking the surface. Disturbances to these portions of
the atmosphere could affect the entire biosphere. See
ATMOSPHERE.
</p>
<p id="p_67">The composition of the atmosphere varies according to
location. The qualities of minor gases such as carbon dioxide,
the amounts of various metallic elements, and the quantity of
water vapor and dust all may differ, depending on the relative
distance from land or sea. But, in addition, the atmospheric
composition may change in time. For example, over the
history of the planet, the percentage composition of oxygen
has changed from a very oxgen-poor environment by volume.
See     ATMOSPHERE,          EVOLUTION    OF;    ATMOSPHERIC
CHEMISTRY.
</p>
<p id="p_68">Human activities may introduce a variety of pollutants into
the atmosphere. The principal pollutants are carbon dioxide,
sulfur compounds, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, solid
particles (particulates), and heat. The amounts of pollutants
that are produced may be quite large, especially in local
                               140 

 

areas, and have increased in amount as industrialization has
become more widespread. Industrial and domestic activities
have also been estimated to put 2.18 × 108 tons (1.96 × 108
metric tons) of sulfur into the atmosphere per year. In most
cases, these pollutants have increased during the recent past,
and in many areas have become a serious problem. See AIR
POLLUTION.
</p>
<p id="p_69">Atmospheric problems can have a variety of impacts on
humans.    Numerous     observers    have   attributed   climatic
change to atmospheric alteration, since any change in the
gaseous envelope of the Earth could alter the heat balance
and the climate. The Earth's climate is not constant, and it is
difficult to establish an exact correlation between pollution
and variation in temperature or solar radiation at the Earth's
surface. The pollutants most likely to have an effect on
climate are carbon dioxide and solid particles. Pollution may
also affect the chemical balance of regions of the Earth. These
effects may be extremely complicated. For example, it has
been reported that sulfur oxides produced in the industrial
districts of northern Europe have moved north in the
atmosphere over Scandinavia. The sulfur oxides react with
water to form sulfuric acid, which rains out in precipitation.
The acid rain changes the acidity of the soil in this region and
may depress the activity of blue-green algae, with fix nitrogen
from the atmosphere. Acid rain appears to cause reduction in
the growth of trees. Other pollutants may act in a similar
complicated fashion through the network of interactions in
the Earth ecosystem. See ACID RAIN.
</p>
<p id="p_70">Finally, atmospheric pollution has direct effects on plants
and animals and human activities. Pollutants, like other
materials, can act as limiting influences on the growth,
reproduction, and survival of plants and animals. A variety of
plants, such as lichens and mosses, that are extremely
                                 141 

 

sensitive to pollution can be used to indicate the degree of
atmospheric    deterioration.    In     some   severe     cases,   all
vegetation and animal life may be destroyed in the vicinity of
the polluting industry. Gases and solids are taken into the
lungs of humans, and cause disease or discomfort. In cities,
such pollutants as asbestos and lead are exceedingly
dangerous to the population. And finally, the impact of
pollutants on buildings, clothes, artwork, and machines is
costly.
</p>
<p id="p_71">Control of atmospheric pollution requires interception of
pollutants at the point of discharge. Industrial control can be
achieved by the use of special filters, precipitators and other
devices. Control of pollution for automobiles also may involve
special equipment, as well as redesign of engines and fuel.
Reduction in dust and similar general sources of air pollution
may demand a change in the operation producing the
problem.
</p>
<p id="p_72">Water problems

The aquatic environment is of equal importance to applied
ecology since most of the Earth's surface is covered by the
oceans, and the land is connected to the oceans by streams
and rivers. Thus, like the atmosphere, the waters are a
connection between distant parts of the biosphere and can
carry a disturbance from its origin to another region.
</p>
<p id="p_73">Ecosystem

A functional system that includes an ecological community of
organisms     together   with     the     physical      environment,
interacting as a unit. Ecosystems are characterized by flow of
energy through food webs, production and degradation of
organic matter, and transformation and cycling of nutrient
elements. This production of organic molecules serves as the
                                   142 

 

energy base for all biological activity within ecosystems. The
consumption       of   plants    by    herbivores        (organisms   that
consume living plants or algae) and detritivores (organisms
that consume dead organic matter) serves to transfer energy
stored in photosynthetically produced organic molecules to
other organisms. Coupled to the production of organic matter
and   flow   of   energy    is   the     cycling    of    elements.   See
ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; ENVIRONMENT.
</p>
<p id="p_74">Environment

The sum of all external factors, both biotic (living) and abiotic
(nonliving), to which an organism is exposed. Biotic factors
include influences by members of the same and other species
on the development and survival of the individual. Primary
abiotic factors are light, temperature, water, atmospheric
gases, and ionizing radiation, influencing the form and
function of the individual.
</p>
<p id="p_75">For each environment factor, an organism has a tolerance
range, in which it is able to survive. The intercept of these
ranges constitutes the ecological niche of the organism.
Different individuals or species have different tolerance
ranges for particular environmental factors - this variation
represents the adaptation of the organism to its environment.
The ability of an organism to modify its tolerance of certain
environmental factors in response to a change in them
represents the plasticity of that organism. Alterations in
environmental tolerance are termed acclimation. Exposure to
environmental conditions at the limit of an individual's
tolerance    range      represents       environment        stress.   See

Environment engineering

The division of engineering concerned with the environment
and management of natural resources. The environmental
engineer places special attention on the biological, chemical,
and   physical    reactions    in   the     air,    land,      and    water
environments and on improved technology for integrated
management       systems,     including     reuse,       recycling,     and
recovery measures.
</p>
<p id="p_77">Scope

Environmental      engineering      began       with     the    need     for
acceptable drinking water and for management of liquid and
solid wastes. In fact, the terms public health and sanitary
were used to identify the engineers seeking solutions for
eliminating   waterborne      disease      in      the   1800s.       Later,
urbanization and industrialization contributed significantly to
the formation of unsanitary conditions in many areas.
Abatement of air and land contamination became new
challenges for the environmental engineer, followed by toxic-
waste and hazardous-waste concerns. The environmental
engineer is also instrumental in the mitigation and protection
of wildlife habitat, preservation of species, and the overall
well-being of ecosystems.
</p>
<p id="p_78">During   project     development,         environmental         engineers
conduct a life-cycle analysis (cost-effectiveness analysis) of
project alternatives that consider the capital and the
operation and maintenance costs over the life of the project.
The National Environmental Policy Act and other legislation,
regulations, and policies contain provisions to expand the
alternative analysis to reduce ecological, health, and safety
risks during project development. This process embraces the
concepts often called green engineering.
</p><p id="p_79">                                 144 

 

Green engineering is the early application of environmentally
favorable engineering project concepts in the design and
development of processes, products, and facilities. Embracing
the basic concepts of pollution prevention and waste
minimization, green engineering considers innovative and
alternative technologies. The project should be feasible and
economical, while minimizing the generation of air, water,
and solid-waste pollution at the source, as well as the risk to
public health and the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_80">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a Design for
the Environment (DfE) program that includes a life-cycle
assessment. This process provides a tool to examine the
environmental impacts of products over their entire life cycle
from materials acquisition to manufacturing, use, and
disposition. Design for the Environment provides decision-
makers with information, tools, and incentives to make
informed decisions that integrate risk, performance, and cost
issues. The life-cycle analysis evaluates impacts on human
health, atmospheric resources/air quality, water quality,
ecological health, and natural resource consumption.
</p>
<p id="p_81">Education   of   professionals.    Traditionally,   environmental
engineers drew their basic education and training from civil
engineering programs. In order to broaden their perspective
and   capabilities,   contemporary     environmental       engineers
undertake course work and postgraduate training in a
number      of   professional      areas,      including    biology,
epidemiology,    chemical       engineering,     chemistry,     and
hydrology. Since environmental engineers deal with sensitive
public issues, training in public education, risk assessment,
public policy, and social sciences is desirable.
</p>
<p id="p_82">After satisfying experience and testing requirements, the
environmental engineer      obtains professional       engineering
registration. Professional associations of interest to the
                                 145 

 

environmental engineer include the American Academy of
Environmental Engineers, the Air and Waste management
Association, the American Water Works Association, the
Water   Environment    Federation,      and     the     solid    Waste
Association of North America.
</p>
<p id="p_83">Professional activities. Principal areas of employment for
practicing   environmental   engineers        include       consulting,
industry, and government. Other environmental engineers
are academic or research faculty, or they direct                   the
development and production of pollution-control equipment.
</p>
<p id="p_84">Consulting environmental engineers apply their knowledge
and experience under contract to public and private clients.
Their services may range from studies to preliminary design,
final design, construction management, and operation and
maintenance services. Specific areas of service studies and
assessments, assistance in obtaining permits, and expert
witness testimony.
</p>
<p id="p_85">Within the industrial sector, there is considerable demand for
environmental    professionals     to   achieve       and     maintain
compliance with environmental statutes and regulations.
Increasing public sensitivity to the environment and demand
for a clean environment have expanded industry's need for
environmental engineering technology.
</p>
<p id="p_86">Environmental engineers in public service provide technical
expertise in all levels of government. Though most publicized
for their role in the development of regulations and in
enforcement, they also are involved in numerous research
and development programs and technology transfer activities.
</p>
<p id="p_87">The principal environmental engineering specialties are air-
quality control, water supply, wastewater disposal, storm
water    management,      solid-waste         management,          and
                                          146 

 

hazardous-waste management. Other specialties include
industrial    hygiene,       noise        control,       oceanography,            and
radiology.
</p>
<p id="p_88">Air-quality control

The term air pollution is used to describe the presence in the
atmosphere of one or more contaminants in quantities, and
with     characteristics,         that     will    be        injurious      to,    or
unreasonably interfere with, public health and welfare or
other natural environmental processes. The extent of air-
pollution problems ranges from relatively small areas, such
as an industrial park impacted by one or more emission
sources,     to    urban     areas        impacted        by     a    number       of
contaminant sources.
</p>
<p id="p_89">Contaminants are categorized as particulate matter and
gases and their associated forms, including dust, smoke,
fumes,     mist,     and     vapor.         The        primary       gaseous      air
contaminants are carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen
oxides, and sulfur oxides.
</p>
<p id="p_90">Meteorological and topographical factors contribute to the
creation and continuation of air pollution under specific site
conditions. Temperature inversions prevent upward diffusion,
and very low wind speeds allow emissions to remain near
their source. Some terrains cause emissions to follow specific
patterns from one area to another.
</p>
<p id="p_91">Generally, sources of air contaminants may be classified as
stationary,       mobile,    or    fugitive.       Respectively,         they     are
attributed    to     point   sources            such    as     industrial       stack
emissions, transportation activities such as automobile
emissions, and uncontrolled (fugitive) sources such as
windblown dusts from stockpiles.
</p><p id="p_92">                                         147 

 

The environmental engineer is instrumental in developing
particulate       and   gas      controls      for   all       sources     of   air
contaminants. Source control is the first abatement method
considered.        Controls      for    particulates           include    settling
chambers, inertial separators, wet scrubbers, and fabric
filters.    Gas     controls      include       absorption,          absorption,
condensation, flaring, and incineration. Other areas of
practice address acid rain issues, fugitive emissions, odor
control, indoor air quality, and noise abatement.
</p>
<p id="p_93">Indoor air quality is of increasing concern for health officials
and the public. Industrial hygienists and various engineering
disciplines are instrumental in identifying and controlling
indoor air pollution. Environmental engineering principle can
be    used    in    technical      assessments           for     identifying    air
pollutants and selecting source controls.
</p>
<p id="p_94">Indoor air quality control measures are very source-specific.
The basic abatement strategies are source control, ventilation
improvements, and air cleaners. Typically, source control is
the    most    cost-effective          abatement     measure.            See    AIR
POLLUTION; AIR POLLUTION, INDOOR.
</p>
<p id="p_95">Environmental geology

The branch of geology that deals with the ways in which
geology affects people. Examples of the effect of geology on
human civilizations include (1) the ways that fertile soils
develop from rocks and how these soils can become polluted
by human activities; (2) how rocks and soils move down-slope
to destroy roads, houses, and other human construction; (3)
sources of surface and subsurface water supplies and how
they become polluted; (4) why floods occur where they do and
how        human    activities     affect      floods;     (5)     locations     of
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and the dangers they
pose; (6) location of mineral resource such as copper, oil and
                                148 

 

gas, and uranium, and how mining these resources can
pollute the environment; (7) how human activities can pollute
the atmosphere and cause global warming, sea-level rise, and
ozone depletion.
</p>
<p id="p_96">Soil

Most environmental concerns center on three materials
essential to human life: soil, water, and air. Soils develop
from    chemical   reactions   between     rocks,   water,     and
atmospheric gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. The
most abundant solid product of these reactions is a variety of
clay minerals, which are major contributors to agricultural
fertility. Ions on clay surfaces and decaying organic matter
are the sources of nutrient elements for growing plants. Clay
minerals are also responsible for destructive events, such as
when they absorb water and cause soil to swell, resulting in
foundation   cracking   and    other   structural   problems    in
buildings. Changes in clay minerals as they lie in the soil are
also the cause of many types of landslides. See CLAY
MINERALS; SOIL.
</p>
<p id="p_97">The major environmental problems affecting soil are erosion
and pollution. Almost half of American farmland is losing
fertile topsoil faster than it can be formed. Most of the erosion
results from poor farming practices and overzealous logging.
Which deplete the soil of plants and root systems that hold
the soil in place. Most soil pollution is caused by synthetic
chemical pesticides which not only kill the pests but also are
absorbed by plants, which are then eaten by people and other
animals. See EROSION; SOIL CONSERVATION.
</p>
<p id="p_98">Water

The amount of water on the Earth's surface is constant and
more than enough to supply human needs. Water problems
                               149 

 

are generally concerned with local supply and its pollution.
Serious water shortages in the United States occur in many
western states because of increasing populations, as in
Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.
</p>
<p id="p_99">In areas where surface water supplies are inadequate, fresh
water can commonly be obtained from underground sources.
The water occurs in the open spaces between the grains in
sedimentary rocks and has accumulated in the rocks over
many thousands of years. When this water is withdrawn
faster than it is naturally replenished by rain-and snowfall,
the underground supply can become seriously depleted, as is
occurring today in many western cities. Such depletion is
also a serious problem in the heavily irrigated agricultural
areas of the central United States, because most irrigation
water is drawn from subsurface supplies. Removal of
subsurface water can also result in ground subsidence, a
serious problem in central California, Houston, and New
Orleans. See GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY.
</p>
<p id="p_100">Pollution. Most water pollution problems in the United States
are caused by synthetic organic compounds and heavy
elements released in wastewater discharges, many by the
military as well as by chemical plants. Oil refineries are also
major polluters. Other sources of pollution include leaking
sanitary landfills, pesticides in runoff from farms, and
mixtures of sulfuric acid and cyanide from mining operations.
See HAZARDOUS WASTE; WATER POLLUTION.
</p>
<p id="p_101">Hazardous waste water can be disposed of by underground
injection, incineration, evaporation from open pits, or export
to other areas. The most common domestic method is
underground injection, but because the underground geology
is inadequately known, liquid hazardous waste injected deep
underground has seeped into underground water supplies in
about half the states. About 20% of hazardous waste is
                               150 

 

incinerated, but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
estimates that 60% could be disposed of by this safer
method. Incineration is more expensive than subsurface
disposal, however. Disposal by evaporation from surface
impoundments is very unsafe and has caused ground-water
contamination in about three-quarters of the 50 states.
</p>
<p id="p_102">Floods. Floods are the most commonly experienced natural
calamities and are the cause of about 60% of declared
disasters. Flooding may be caused by hurricanes from the
ocean or excessive water from landward areas. Hurricanes
cannot be controlled, and the value of property destroyed by
them has increased considerably over time because of
people's desire to live near the seashore. Loss of life has
decreased, however, because of improved forecasting and
early warning. Flooding resulting from excessive rain on the
land surface has been exacerbated by the human desire to
live near river channels, to pave land surfaces and increase
the rate of runoff, and to denude hill slopes by excessive
logging. Without vegetation and porous soil, the rate of runoff
of rainwater is increased and river channels cannot hold all
the water they receive. The massive flooding in central China
in 1998 was attributed to the stripping of vegetation over
large areas.
</p>
<p id="p_103">Atmosphere

Concerns about air quality revolve around increases in the
amount of carbon dioxide, decreases in the amount of ozone
10-20 mi above the surface, and pollution of the air that
sustains life in the lower atmosphere. Increasing carbon
dioxide levels result largely from the burning of coal and oil,
the main sources of energy in industrial societies. The
amount of carbon dioxide in the air has increased by nearly
30% during the past 150 years. Carbon dioxide absorbs
radiation from the Earth's surface and has caused a
                                      151 

 

measurable increase in global temperatures (greenhouse
effect); this global warming may in turn result in rising sea
levels     (from    melting        glaciers),      endangering     coastal
communities over the long term. See GREENHOUSE EFFECT.
</p>
<p id="p_104">The concentration of ozone in the stratosphere absorbs most
of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation, thus protecting people
from excessive skin cancers, damaged immune system, and
other maladies. The thickness of the ozone layer has
decreased significantly during the past 50 years because of
the release to the atmosphere of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
which now nearly stopped worldwide, but the ozone layer will
not restore itself completely for about another 50 years.
</p>
<p id="p_105">Noxious gases and particulates in the air result largely from
combustion of coal and oil in automobiles and factories. It is
the cause of many lung problems and premature deaths in
industrial countries. See AIR POLLUTION.
</p>
<p id="p_106">        Applied ecology is that branch of ecology dealing with
practical problems of immediate social importance. Ecology is
often    confused    in   the      minds      of   laypersons    with    the
environmental movement, a social interest group concerned
with environmental degradation and problems of resource
supply     to   human     societies.        Applied   ecology    makes    a
fundamental contribution to those social and political
concerns by identifying environmental problems, gaging their
significance, and suggesting potential solutions. Among the
environmental       issues    to    which       ecology   had    made    an
important contribution have been problems of population
growth and resource supply, acid rain, eutrophication,
consequences of pollution, biological control of crop pests,
range management, forestry, and the ecological consequences
of nuclear war. From T.R. Mathus's essay on human
population growth to recent scientific evaluations of nuclear
                                  152 

 

war, ecology has always been concerned with problems that
are important to the affairs of humans.

It impairs the ecology and people's right to natural resources.
The entire process of setting up and functioning of a mining
operation requires utmost good faith and honesty on the part
of the intending entrepreneur. A balance has to be struck.
</p>
<p id="p_108">52.       The mining activities have largely affected the local
surface drainage as well as the groundwater conditions in
area. It has come on record that private respondents have
started mining activities in the Forest areas. The ground
water condition has been disturbed. The entire area is geo-
dynamically sensitive and ecologically fragile. The mountain
environment is entirely different from other environments.
The State should adopt positive environmental economics.
State should also promote the positive environmental values
by education, debates etc. The essential objectives of all
provisions relating to waste disposal must be protection of
human health and the environment against harmful effects
caused by the collection, transport, treatment, storage and
tipping of waste. The human health and environment is
harmed   by   the    illegal   unscientific    mining.    The    Dust,
Chemicals spills, harmful fumes, heavy metals and radiation
etc. can poison workers and cause life-long health problems.
The heavy lifting can lead to injuries to the arms, legs and
back. The use of jackhammers or other vibrating machinery
etc. can cause damage to nerves and blood circulation. The
loud, constant noise from mining activities may cause
hearing problems. Vision can also be affected. In case the
mining operation is carrying out in hot conditions, it can
cause weakness. The dust may cause damage to lungs and
develop other health diseases like as heart disease, lung
                                 153 

 

cancer, pneumonia and asthma. Workers should be provided
materials to protect from breathing dust. State Government
should ensure that in the mining operation, necessary
protection to the workers from the dust be provided.           The
mining operations contaminate the water, surface water and
ground water for centuries together. The mining operation
must ensure that there is no leakage into the ground water
by way of spilling. First Aid must be made available to the
people. It is the duty of the State to teach and trained the
workers about the mining dangers. The focus should be on
sustainable mining instead of haphazard mining. The mining
activity   has   a   strong   impact   on   environment   in   the
exploration, construction and exploitation steps. Mining as
noticed leads to erosion. The erosion of land should be
controlled at the early stages since it results in land sliding.
The erosion may result in loading of sediments to nearby
water bodies. The mining impacts on air quality. The mining
also impacts flora and fauna. The survival of wildlife species
can depend on soil conditions, local climate, altitude and
other features of the local habitat. Direct and indirect damage
to wildlife is caused by mining. Similarly, human life is also
affected since streams, lakes and rivers are contaminated.
Unscientific and irregular mining has also impacts public
health.

               authority to initiate bills that advance the interests
               of   future     generations.       There    is    a    historical
               precedent as well. Under Byzantine law, the
               concept of jus gentium, a law for all people and
               nations,       was    developed      to    protect     Nature's

    God of Death, and the tree is often planted outside
    the village near crematoriums. It is believed to be
    the abode of ghosts. Vetals and pisachas are
    supposed to hang from its many branches.

<blockquote id="blockquote_402">          Indians knew that banyan tree as the vata
    vriksha. When the British came to India, they
    notices that members of the trading or Bania
    community gathered under a large shady fig tree,
    which they named the banyan, from Bania.
    Technically,   Ficus    bengalensis,   the    banyan,
    belongs to the fig family. There are various types
    of fig trees all over the world and some of these
    are sacred. The most popular one is the Ficus
    religiosa, or the peepul which became especially
    popular in the Buddhist times, because it was
    under this tree that Gautama Siddhartha of the
    Sakya clan attained enlightenment. It was the
    leaves of a fig tree that Adam and Eve used to
    cover their nakedness in Eden after they were
    tempted to eat the forbidden fruit by Satan.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_403">          The banyan tree does not let a blade of
    grass blow under it. Thus, it does not allow for
    any rebirth and renewal. While the banyan offers
    shade from the sun, it offers no food. That is why
    it is not part of fertility ceremonies like marriage
    and    childbirth,     where   food-giving,    rapidly
    renewing plants with a short lifespan such as
    banana, mango, coconut, betal, rice and even

          Marriage and rebirth are rites of passage;
    they represent major shifts in life. They are all
    about instability and flux; the banyan tree is the
    very opposite. It is stable and constant. It has a
    long lifespan, and hence seems immortal. Its roots
    descend from the branches and then anchor the
    tree to the ground, transforming into trunks
    eventually, so that decades later, it is difficult to
    distinguish root from stem.

<blockquote id="blockquote_405">          Things that evolve the notion of immortality
    become auspicious in India; for example, the
    immoral mountain, the immortal sea, the immortal
    diamond and indestructible ash. This is because
    since ancient times, Indian seers were acutely
    aware of the transitory nature of things around
    us. Everything dies-every plant, every animal,
    even moments die; the present becomes the past
    in an instant. In an ever changing world, we seek
    constancy and permanence. The banyan tree is
    therefore worthy of veneration. It is evergreen and
    shady, hence an eternal refuge for all creatures
    unable to bear the vagaries of life.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_406">          Thus it emerges that in Indian though, there
    are two types of sacredness-one that is associated
    with impermanent material reality, and the other,
    which is associated with permanent spiritual
    reality. The banana and the coconut fit into the
    previous category; the banyan fits into the latter.
    Banana is the symbol of flesh, constantly dying
    and renewing itself. Banyan is the soul-never
    needing to renew itself. The banyan is the
    botanical equivalent of the hermit.

    through determination and intelligence, managed
    to secure back her husband's life. In the memory
    of the event, Hindu women circle the banyan tree,
    tying seven stings around it. This is imitative
    magic; by symbolically going around the immortal
    tree, the women are binding immortality into their
    married lives. They are securing the lives of their
    husbands, the pillars of their households. They
    are protecting themselves from widowhood, which
    is believed by most Hindus to be the worst fate for
    a woman.

    represented in its shade as stone called the
    Lingam. Being an ascetic, Shiva was not part of

                    under the banyan tree, is placed on the south
                    facing wall of the temple. Like Shiva, Vishnu is
                    also a form of God. But Vishnu is not associated
                    with the banyan tree, perhaps because Vishnu is
                    that aspect of God, which more associated with

                    called leela or playfulness- he does not fear
                    change. Vishnu is therefore associated with the
                    fragrant tulsi plant, or with flowering plants like
                    champa and Kadamba. But there is one time
                    when Vishnu is associated with the banyan tree.
                    It is during the end of the world, when flood
                    waters   rise   and    dissolve      all    things.    Sage
                    Markandeya, who had a terrifying vision of this
                    event, saw Vishnu as a baby lying on the leaf of
                    banyan tree, cradled by the deadly waves. This
                    form of Vishnu is called Vatapatra-Shayin, he who
                    rests on the banyan leaf. The image is rich in
                    symbols; the whole world may seem transitory,
                    like the waves of the ocean, but all life can renew
                    itself, as a baby replaces the older generation,
                    because divine grace represented by Vishnu is
                    eternal, like a banyan leaf."

                      Alpine zone in the Himalaya is that section,
                which lies immediately above the tree line and
                below the snow line. Generally, the lower part of
                the alpine zone is a summer grazing ground, with
                meadows bright with alpine flowers and the upper
                parts have a high alpine flora with species
                adapted to withstand the extremes of cold and
                desiccation (Polunin &amp; Staintion, 1984). As started
                above, on account of the wide ranging climatic
                conditions at different latitudes and altitudes of
                the Himalaya, the demarcation of the alpine zone
                by altitude alone in the entire Himalayan belt is
                not possible because variation in alpine flora
                depends on local environment.

<blockquote id="blockquote_413">                      The western Himalayan ranges differ from
                their eastern counterparts in greater breadth and
                length, higher latitude, scanty rainfall, heavy
                snowfall and cool, dry climate. This marked
                difference in the humidity and quality of
                vegetation in eastern and western Himalayan is
                evident by the fact that the tree line in the western
                Himalaya is ca 3600 m as compared to eastern
                Himalayan where the tree line extends to ca 4600
                m. The eastern Himalaya is more evenly than the
                western Himalaya. The degree of precipitation is
                    167 

 

    due to the abruptly rising hills that directly
    confront the moisture laden clouds blowing from
    the Bay of Bengal. The high humidity is conducive
    for the tree growth, and therefore, the timber line
    or the upper limit of tree zone goes up to 4600 m
    compared to 3600 m in western Himalaya. The
    vegetation of the alpine zone is normally devoid of
    any tree growth, except for the stunted bushes
    and shrubs scattered among the characteristic
    cushion-forming or matted plants and colourful
    herbs, most of which are seasonal.

    endemic either to the alpine belt as a whole or
    confined to western or eastern sectors. The alpine
    belt in the western sector is more dominant and
    composed of open rolling grassy meadows termed

    scattered and stunted. These forests are generally
    seen on rocks, ridges and other similar situations.
    The shrubby and herbaceous components of these

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_418">    2. Alpine scrubs

           Alpine scrubs are chiefly met with on rocks,
    ridges and stony slopes and generally appear
    above the tree limit and in similar habitats,
    ascending almost up to 4200 m. The chief shrubby
    components are Berberis jaeschkeana, Myricaria
    elegans, Lonicera asperifolia, L. Hypoleuca, L.
    semenovii, L. spinosa, Salix flagellaris, S.
    lindleyana, S. pychnostachya, Rhododendron
    anthopogon, R. lepidotum, Juniperus indica, J.
    recurva and J. communis. Areas where adequate
    water is available, the Rhododendron are
    frequently seen along with the species of Berberis,
    Lonicera and few others. In drier inner valleys,
    species like Rosa webbiana, Cotoneaster
    pruinosus, C. microphyllus, C. gilgitensis,
    Caragana versicolor, C. brevifolia, C. gerardiana
    and Cassiope fastigiata and Ephedra gerardiana
    are common. The herbaceous elements among
    these alpine scrubs are species of Artemisia,
    Astragalus. Androsace, Anemone, Aster, Gentiana,
    Geranium,      Mysotis,     Oxytropis,   Potentilla,
    Ranunculus,      Saxifraga,   Sedum,     Epilobium,

<blockquote id="blockquote_419">    3. Alpine meadows

          The alpine meadows or alpine pastures the
    most fascinating areas which support unique plant
    species. These alpine meadows form a lush carpet
    in some localities and are the picturesque beauty
    of high lofty snow peaks. Such typical alpine
    meadows can be found in the "Valley of Flowers",
    Bishtola, Baidni, Bajmora, Lakshmiban (Garhwal)
    and Joharpatti (Kumaon) in the western sectos.
    Typical alpine meadows are not common in east
    Himalaya.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_420">          In the eastern sector, the alpine meadows
    are confined only to small pockets on hill tops
    surrounded by dense vegetation as one can find in
    Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. At certain places
    the meadows are replaced by glacial moraines,
    which also possess a similar type of floristic
    composition. Most of the alpine herbs have annual
    aerial parts, but perennial underground rhizomes,
                     169 

 

    rootstocks and stems covered and protected by
    layers of leaf-bushes and scales. The distribution
    pattern of these alpine meadows is largely
    determined by the local edaphic and climatic
    conditions. The common herbaceous elements of
    the alpine meadows are Aconitum violaceum,
    Adonis aestivalis, himalaica, Arabis tibetica,
    Arnebia euchroma, Artemisia gmelinii, Aster
    flaccidus,     var.    maximowiczii,        Delphinium
    brunonianum,       D.    vestitum,   Dracocephalum
    heterophyllum, Erigeron multiradiatus, Gernium
    collinum, Lagotis cashmiriana, L. kunawurensis,
    Lomatogonium          carinthiacum,        Oxygraphis

    tomentosa and species of Juncus, Lactuca,
    Pedicularis,    Polygonum,      Potentilla,    Primula,
    Ranunculus, Rhodiola, Saxifraga, Saussurea and
    Senecio. Most of the alpine plants have very
    colouful flowers much larger in size compared to
    the size of the plant. This could be one of the
    adaptations for ensuring the insect pollination,
    where the insect population is scarce.

<blockquote id="blockquote_421">          Grasses and sedges are also common in the
    alpine meadows, the prominent of these are
    Bromus gracillimus, B. inermis, Carex cruenta, C.
    infuscate, C. nivalis, C. obscura, Dactylis
    glomerata, Elymus nutans, Festuca kashmiriana,
    Kobresia pamiroalaica, K. pygmaea, Pennisetum
    lanatum, Phleum alpinum, Poa alpine, P. tibetica,
    Trisetum spicatum, etc.

          The alpine marshes, along banks and
    similar marshy habitats support a numbe of
    characteristic marshy plants such as Pinguicula
    alpine, Juncus leucomelas, Caltha palustris and
    various colourful species of Primula, Corydalis,
    Pedicularis and Polygonum.

<blockquote id="blockquote_422">          At the higher limits of alpine zone which are
    exposed to server cold, only characteristic cushion-
    forming species typical of cold desert are found.
    Some such species form soft cushion e.g. species
    of Androsace, Draba, Saxifraga, Sedum and
    Paraquilegia,    while      other    species    like

    most curious of alpine flowering plants are the
    woolly species of Asteraceae e.g. Saussurea
    gossypiphora, S. obvallata, S. simpsoniana, S.
    graminifolia, Soroseris glomerata and species of
    Tussilago      and    Leontopodiuim.     Saussurea
    gossypiphora and S. graminifolia commonly
    referred to as "Snow ball" plants are unique alpine
    species which look like snow ball due to the
    dense, white hairs which cover the entire plant
    and protect from severe cold wind and snow and
    maintains warmth inside the head even if outside
    temperature falls. The pollination biology of these
    species form a very interesting strategy. Bees' and
    flies take shelter in the warmth and at the same
    time pollinate the flowers. There is yet another
    interesting group of 'hot house' plants like Rheum
    nobile and Saussurea obvallata which have their
    inflorescences sheltered by leafy bracts that can
    be compared to glasses of a 'hot house'. The
    flower open inside the bracts, where insects also
    take shelter for warmth and at the same time
    pollinate the flower.

<blockquote id="blockquote_423">    Phytogeographical considerations

           The Himalaya defines the geographical
    boundary of India in the north and also influences
    the monsoon rainfall and the climate of India as a
    whole. The Himalayan uplift contributed to the
    shaping of the biogeogarphical characters of India
    (Mani, 1978). It is presumed that the Himalayan
    mountains had their own flora even before the
    Pleistocene epoch. The intermittent warm periods
    during the Himalayan glaciations to some extent
    protected the species from total extinction. The
    glaciations did not affect much the foothills with
    result the vegetation of the lower belt was not
    altered. Migration of floras through new corridors
    of mountain chains, survival of relicts, adaptive
    radiation of species complexes in new ecological
    niches, evolution of new species by an intermixing
    of different flora and by mutation had a role in
    determining the present day composition and
    distribution of alpine flora (Rau, 1975).

    under the Sino- Himalayan, Tibetan mountain
    province of the Sino-Japanese region of Boreal
    Kingdom. Gaussen (1933) and many other
    considered Himalaya as a sort of phytogeoraphic
    barrier for many of the Asiatic elements. Mani
    (1978) considered the defile of the river Sutlej
    being    the    landmark    in    the   Himalayan
    biogeography. He presented a gradual transition
    from east to west sector of the Himalaya. The
    geologic welding of Gondwana and Asiatic
    landmass led to the exchange of flora and fauna
    resulting in the biogeographic complexity. The flora
    of the Tertiary mountains of south China, Indo-
    China, Thailand and Malaya intruded westward,
    along the rising Himalaya. The continued uplift of
    the Himalaya has led to evolution of lowland
    steppe elements into temperate and alpine forms
    of Turkemenian subregion.

<blockquote id="blockquote_425">           A study of the alpine flora of western
    Himalaya shows that a large number of species
    like Nepeta tibetica, Elsholtzia densa, Rimula
    tibetica, P. ellitica, Onosma hispidus, Tanacetum
    fruticulosum of the lower alpine belt in the
    Garhwal-Kumaon sector and eastwards appear to
    have come from Tibet, W. China and adjoining
    northeast Asia. The northwestern sector of the
    Himalaya has been subjected to considerable
    influence from the adjoining floristically rich areas
    of Karakoram, Pamir and further north in the Tien
    Shan range of mountains. Some species of these
    regions which are today common in N.W.
    Himalaya are Arctium lappa, Thalictrum alpinum,
    Astragalus coluteocarpus, Sibbaldia cuneata,
    Bupleurum falcate var. gracillimum and species of

    considered similarity of Himalayan flora with
    those of China. Chinese mountains being much
    older than Himalaya have contributed to the
    present day Himalayan flora. His studies have
    revealed various possibilities regarding the entry
    of floristic elements into the alpine Himalaya from
    the north, west and east Asia. In the eastern

    Indo-China subregion while some Malayan
    elements are also visible. According to Ohba
    (1988) it is quite probable that the Himalayan flora
    had open intercourse with those of the arctic
    region via the east and west margins of the
    highland, particularly in ages of climatic
    fluctuation. According to him the "Central Asiatic
    Corridor" favours an important pass for the
    migration of the flora between the arctic regions
    and the Himalaya as well as E. Tibet and S. W.
    China. The floristic connection of the Himalaya
    through this corridor is supported by the
    distribution pattern and the presence of common
    or corresponding species with arctic region. Such
    species are Acantholimon lycopodioides, Eremurus
    himalaicus, Physochlaina praealta, Caragana
    versicolor, C. brevifolia, Nepeta supine, Epilobium

                     The Himalayan mountains are one of the

              is no correct assessment of the endemic flora in
              the alpine zone, one can fairly guess that ca 50%
              of the endemic plants of the Himalaya occur in the
              alpine or subalpine zones. The high rate of
              endemism in the alpine zone, particularly in
              largest and diversified genera is quite remarkable
              and is an indication of active evolution (speciation)
              as well as considerable degree of isolation. It is
              observed that majority of these endemics are
              neoendemics of apparently recent origin with close
              relatives in the alpine zone itself, in the lowland

                     174 

 

    and multiply in prevailing adverse ecological
    conditions, some species perhaps because of low
    level of genetic diversity in them, are unable to
    survive the competition with other vegetation. Such
    species have become endangered. In other words,
    the endangered species are those whose
    reproductive capacity is far lower than the number
    of plants eliminated from the habitat due to
    natural     or    anthropogenic     factors.    This
    consequently leads to the decline in number and
    size     of    populations.    Although      species
    disappearance attracts wide publicity and
    attention, the loss of genetic diversity due to
    extinction of population is least studies. The
    decrease in the size and number of populations
    under a given species has deleterious effect on
    their breeding structure, genetic and evolutionary
    dynamics, all of which form the focal point o
    concern in conservation biology (Falk &amp; Horsinger,
    1991; Harper, 1977; Barret &amp; Kohn, 1991, Karron,
    1991). In small and isolated populations, genetic
    drift operates and this results in the loss of
    variations which ultimately reduces the ability of
    populations to adapt to changing environmental
    conditions and to increase their susceptibility
    against pests and diseases and are thus prone to
    extinction (Hamilton, 1982).

    determined as rare and this may not always be
    correct. Sometimes if a species is collected after a
    gap of 25 to 50 years or more than also it is
    concluded as an endangered species. While partly
    it could be true, certain ephemeral species such as
    species of Thermopsis, Primula, Saxifraga, Sedum,
    Gentiana etc., complete their life cycle in a short
    period and die off, likely to be missed by botanists
    exploring the area. Hence, not collecting a plant for
    several decades may not always conclude in
    species as endangered.

<blockquote id="blockquote_430">         All the endangered plants are certainly rare
    but not all rare plants are endangered. For

    Primula, Corydalis, Thalictrum, Saxifraga, etc.
    have developed ecological            adaptations to
    persistence in small populations showing natural
    rarity and are genetically stable. On other hand,
    there are some rare species which were supposed
    to be widespread at one time have now undergone
    a rapid decline due to anthropogenic factors
    (anthropogenic rarity), for example Aconitum

    Podophyllum hexandrum, Panax pseudo-ginseng,
    Picrorhiza kurrooa, Dioscorea deltoidea, Angelica
    glauca, Allium stracheyi, etc. These aspects
    require very extensive filed investigations before
    one can decide a species endangered or not.
    According to the minimum viable population
    concept (Schaffer, 1981) a minimum of 50
    individuals are recommended for maintenance of
    the population. A species with less than 50
    individuals is certainly critically endangered.

<blockquote id="blockquote_431">          In the Himalaya, due to natural (such as
    landslides, glaciations, earthquakes, lack of
    pollination and regeneration etc.) and man- made
    (such as over-exploitation, destruction of habitats,
    etc.) factors the alpine bioresources are under
    varying degrees of threat. It is no wonder that
    today many of the valuable plants like
    Podophyllum          hexandrum,       Nardostachys
    grandiflora, Aconitum spp., Picrorhiza kurrooa,

    not found in large populations in their natural

    the demography of the population is altered, the
    genetic diversity that is essential for sustaining
    the species also get eroded. Steps should,
    therefore, be taken to ensure that their genetic
    diversity is not lost.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_432">           Conservation and management of an
    endangered species requires rather very extensive
    and frequent field surveys throughout the
    distribution range of a particular species, which is
    certainly time consuming, expensive and difficult.
    A large number of species so far listed from the
    alpine zone of the Himalaya are based on the
    scrutiny of herbaria. Therefore, what is urgently
    required is the assessment of status of individual
    species in its natural habitat.

          For long term conservation and management
    of any species, its genetics and demography i.e.
    population dynamics is crucial. In case of
    Eremostachys superb the solitary population near
    Mohand in Siwaliks of Uttar Pradesh is so small
    and isolated. A strong genetic drift has set in and
    this results in loss and variation in the species.
    Another consequence of low population structure is
    the occurrence of inbreeding resulting in loss of
    fitness (inbreeding depression). Therefore, we
    have to think of strategies that increase the
    genetic diversity in rare species - say bringing
    together geographically isolated populations. This
    again requires extensive surveys to find out the
    distribution of various populations of a given
    endangered species. The reproductive biology of
    endangered species is another aspect of study
    which is almost neglected. Preservation of the
    habitat alone as attempted in most cases may not
    ensure the long term conservation of endangered
    species.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_434">          In situ conservation is the best method for
    protecting the delicate populations of endangered
    species. In a situation where several endangered
    species grow within a few hectare or sq km the
    whole area should be protected. The occurrence of
    several endemic species in a particular area also
    indicates the potential of that area as a centre of
    speciation and evolution. Furthermore, when an
    endangered species grows in pure population of
    fewer or more individuals or in association with
    other vegetation, it is necessary to establish a
    sanctuary for the individual species as for e.g.
    Rhododendron sanctuary in Sikkim.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_435">          Wide publicity regarding the critical nature of

                'hug the trees' movement) spread in India and
                abroad.   This       andolan   was   represented
                national and internationally by two of its

                and are widely accepted as spokesman in

                popular subject in print and audio-visual
                media; it has been taken up as an issue in
                academic debates; it served and still serves
                political and ideological arguments. Numerous

                referred to, Chipko's incidents. And differing

                   to the public as an 'ecological movement, as a
                   'peasant movement' with ecological impact, as
                   a 'women's or eco-feminist movement' as a

                   ('ecologically friendly') attitude is assumed to
                   guide traditional relations with nature and the
                   social practices of the people in Uttarakhand,

<p id="p_144">74.        The contribution of Sri Sunderlal Bahuguna is

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_742">                  "In sum, Bahuguna's alternative concept of
           development    is   marked    by   an   emphasis     on
           sustainability and ethics which lead to an attitude
           towards nature instructed b worship and respect.
           To achieve sustainability, care for posterity should
           get at least that much, if not more' (1990:12).
           Therefore, the contract between the generations', to
           put it in the words of Jonas and King, demands not
           exploiting or over exploiting non-renewable as well
           as renewable resources. This alternative does not
           dismiss science and technology, but demands they
           be guided by 'wisdom', which is neither contained
           in volumes of books nor in the minds of great
           professors, but in the lives of the common people'
           (1992:9). And this wisdom lies, in part, in 'switching
           over from agriculture to tree farming' (1992:10).
           Such farming would not propagate species which
           are useful for commercial purposes:

<p id="p_145">75.        The damages, destructions or imbalances of the
environment have now posed serious problems of social,
political, regional, cultural, ecological etc. The very existence
of the humanity is on stake. The landscape is changing
repeatedly due to degradation and erosion. Learned Author-
Sri Satish Kumar Tripathi in his Article "How Economists
View the Environment?" has explained the depletion of
non-renewable resources, as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_744">                 "Natural resources can be classified under
                 two broad categories - renewable resources
                 and non-renewable resources. Examples of
                 non-renewable resources are : coal, crude oil,
                 natural gas and minerals. The stocks of these
                 resources are finite and hence the society's
                 problem is optimal depletion of the resources
                 over time. Fisheries, forests and water in
                 lakes and rivers, and ground water are
                 examples     of     renewable    resources.     These
                 resources are capable of self-production and
                 their stocks can increase with time only if
                 their rates of harvesting are below their
                 natural rates of growth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_745">                 Renewable resources can be under private
                 property,    common-pool        resource   or   open
                 access resource regimes. Hotelling's paper on
                 economics of exhaustible resources stresses
                 the need for an inter-temporal approach to
                 analyse the optimal rate of depletion of a
                 finite stock of resource. He says that the
                                223 

 

                static equilibrium type of economic theory is
                plainly inadequate for an industry in which
                the indefinite maintenance of a steady state is
                a physical impossibility. He uses the calculus
                of variations technique to study the optimum
                rates of depletion unde competition and
                monopoly and also the rate of depletion from
                the society's point of view.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_746">                The Hotelling rules is that the price of an
                exhaustible resource must grow at a rate
                equal to the rate of interest, both along an
                efficient extraction path and in a competitive
                resource     industry     equilibrium.   Hotelling
                shows that, if the elastically of demand is
                decreasing as the quantity increases, the
                monopolist will deplete the resource more
                slowly than a competitor. When the cost of
                extraction depends on the rate of extraction
                and cumulative production, he shows that
                the royalty does not rise at the rate of interest
                but at less the percentage increase in cost
                caused by adding to the stock of cumulative
                production. He analyses the effects of capital
                value tax upon the value of a mine and a per
                unit serverance tax on materials extracted on
                conservation."
