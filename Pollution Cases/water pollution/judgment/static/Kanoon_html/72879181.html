neither the provisions of <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_3">section 195</a> nor <a href="/doc/852291/" id="a_4">section 40(a)(i)</a> were applicable to

maintainable.

</p><p id="p_16">        Revenue has taken the following grounds in their appeals: -
</p><p id="p_17">                  1.   The order No. In ITA No.561/PNJ/2011-12/JCIT,
        dated: 31.08.2012 in the         above case is opposed to law and facts

</p><p id="p_19">              2.    The learned CIT (A) has erred in appreciating the
      issue    of   "Disallowance    of   Expenditure    on     Research          &amp;
      Development" to the tune of Rs. 1,94,55,376 for Assessment Year
      2009-10, as <a href="/doc/1789026/" id="a_6">Section 43(4)(i)</a> of the I.T. Act, 1961 defines scientific
      research as any activities for the extension of knowledge in the
      fields of natural or applied science including agriculture, animal
      husbandry or fisheries. The case of the assessee is clearly not
      covered under this definition. Moreover, the assessee has also not
      taken approval of the designated authority that this activity
      tantamount to scientific research. For the A.Y 2006-07 also same
      issue was confirmed by CIT (Appeal).
</p>
<p id="p_20">              3.    The learned CIT (A) has failed to appreciate the
      "Disallowance of Foreign exchange notional loss/loss on forward
      contracts" to the tune of Rs.1,59,00,000/-. Board's Circular No. 23
      (XXXIV-4) D of 1960 dated: 12/09/1960 and Instruction No.3 - 2010
      dated: 23/03/2010 clearly says that the losses incurred by the
      assessee on forward contracts is to be treated as speculative loss
      and not hedging loss.
</p>
<p id="p_21">              4.    The learned CIT (A) has failed to appreciate the
      addition with respect to "Expenditure incurred in respect of issue
      of Bonus Shares" to the tune of Rs.61,35,482/-, which is mainly
      related to expansion of capital base and therefore it is in the
      nature of capital expenditure but not revenue expenditure.
</p>
<p id="p_22">              5.    For this and other grounds that may be urged at the
      time of hearing, it is prayed that the order of learned CIT (A) be
      cancelled and that of the Assessing Officer be restored.
</p>
<p id="p_23">4.    The brief facts of the case are that the assessee filed return declaring
an income of Rs. 28,84,80,920/-. Assessment u/s 143(3) was made vide
order dt. 30/12/2011 u/s 143(3) after making various disallowances and the
addition at an income of Rs. 4,90,07,85,742/-. The assessee went in appeal
before the CIT(A) who partly allowed the appeal of the assessee.

</p><p id="p_25">5.     Ground nos. 1.1 &amp; 1.2 in the appeal of the assessee relate to the
disallowance u/s 14A of the I. T. Act. The brief facts relating to this ground are
that AO has noted that the assessee has received dividend income of Rs.
1,42,72,73,668/- exempt from tax. The AO asked the assessee to explain why
the disallowance u/s 14A read with rule 8D should not be made for the
expenses incurred. The assessee submitted the explanation that he has not
borrowed any money for purchase / investment on which dividend is received.
No interest has been debited to profit and loss account. Interest and other
charges appearing in the profit and loss account relate to Bank charges in
connection   with   collection of    outstation   cheques. No      administration
expenditure was incurred on earning dividend income as investment in mutual
funds was made just to park the surplus funds. The assessee has already
disallowed a sum of Rs. 25,78,156/- in the computation of income. The AO
did not agree and he was of the view that the company has made substantial
investment in mutual funds. Investment of such magnitude requires proper
analysis of the market condition to the stock movement etc. and therefore, the
assessee must have incurred substantial expenditure for earning the
dividend. The assessing officer by invoking the provision of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_7">section 14A</a> read
with Rule 8D worked out the disallowance as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       i.     Amount of expenditure directly relating to income
              which does not form part of total income          - Nil
       ii.    In a case where the assessee has incurred expenditure by way
       of interest during the previous year which is not directly attributable to
       any particular income or receipt, an amount computed in accordance
       with the following formula, namely:- [AxB]/C =


A.     Amount of expenditure by way of interest other than the amount of
interest included in clause (i) incurred during the previous year - Nil


B.     The average of value of investment, income from which does not or

assessee on the first day and the last day of the previous year

8D as expenditure incurred for earning the exempted income and same is
added to the total income.
</p>
<p id="p_29">6.     The assessee went in appeal before the CIT(A). The CIT(A) confirmed
the disallowance by holding as under:
</p><p id="p_30">        "4.1 During the appellate proceedings, the authorised representative
of the assessee vehemently argued on behalf of the appellant and pleaded
for deletion of the disallowances made by the Assessing Officer. It was
specifically stated that rule 8D provides for computation of disallowance only
if the Assessing Officer, having regard to the accounts of the previous year is
not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of expenditure computed by the
assessee. It was claimed that a careful reading of both <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">section 14A(2)</a> as well
as rule 8D(1)(b) brings out clearly that resort to making disallowance by
applying threshold of 0.5% to the total value of investment is to be made only
after the AO was not satisfied with the claim of the assessee regarding the
computation of such expenses. Following the decision in the case of Jindal
Photo Ltd. ITA no I.T.A. No. 4539/Del./2010, it was claimed that it was
mandatory for the assessing officer to record his dissatisfaction about the
claim of the assessee regarding computation of expenses incurred for earning
the exempt income and the onus is on Assessing Officer to bring out the
factual incurrence of expenses. The assessee also relied on various other
authorities including that in the case of <a href="/doc/264398/" id="a_9">CIT vs. Hero Cycles Ltd</a> (323 ITR
</p><p id="p_31">518), <a href="/doc/47515605/" id="a_10">CIT vs Walfort Share and Stock Brokers (P) Ltd</a> (310 ITR 421), etc, to
substantiate its claim. In this regard it was also stated that that the reasoning
of the Assessing Officer that the investment of such high magnitude would
require a regular analysis and monitoring of the investments would have been
relevant in the context of investment in equity shares or equity oriented
mutual funds. Whereas, the entire investment in the case of the assessee is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6</span>
                                                           ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

into debt oriented mutual funds which do not require any significant efforts
either in making such investment or in tracking the same. It was therefore
claimed that the estimated disallowance of Rs.25,78,156/- made by the
appellant was reasonable and therefore, the same should have been
accepted by the assessing officer.
</p>
<p id="p_32">4.2    I have carefully considered the submissions of the assessee as well as
the observations of the Assessing Officer. The primary contention of the
assessee is that before invoking the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_11">section 14A</a> for making
disallowance of expenditure by applying rule 8D of the Income tax Rules, the
assessing officer ought to have recorded his dissatisfaction for rejecting the
quantification of the expenditure relating to the tax exempted income made by
the assessee. Before proceeding further it will be relevant to examine the
provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">section 14A</a> providing for disallowance of expenditure relating to
exempt income.
</p>
<p id="p_33"> <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">Section 14A</a>: For the purposes of computing the total income under
      this Chapter, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of expenditure
      incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form
      part of the total income under this Act.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      Provided that nothing contained in this section shall empower the
      Assessing Officer either to reassess under <a href="/doc/1837761/" id="a_14">section 147</a> or pass an
      order enhancing the assessment or reducing a refund already made or
      otherwise increasing the liability of the assessee under <a href="/doc/1951329/" id="a_15">section 154</a>, for
      any assessment year beginning on or before the 1st day of April, 2001.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      (2) The Assessing Officer shall determine the amount of expenditure
      incurred in relation to such income which does not form part of the total
      income under this Act in accordance with such method as may be
      prescribed, if the Assessing Officer, having regard to the accounts of
      the assessee, is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the
      assessee in respect of such expenditure in relation to income which
      does not form part of the total income under this Act.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      (3) The provisions of sub-section (2) shall also apply in relation to a
      case where an assessee claims that no expenditure has been incurred
      by him in relation to income which does not form part of the total
      income under this section.
</p>
<p id="p_37">       From the plain reading of the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_16">section 14A</a> of Income
Tax Act, it is clear that no deduction shall be allowed in respect of
expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not
form part of the total income under this Act. Rule 8D of the Income Tax
Rules expressly provides the method for determining the amount of
expenditure in relation to the exempt income. Therefore, the position with
respect to assessment year 2008-09 onwards is that in all cases where
the assessing officer is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of
the assessee in respect of the expenditure incurred on earnings that do
not form part of the total income, expenditure on this account has to be
computed as provided under Rule 8D of Income Tax Rules. There can be
no other basis of estimating such expenditure to be disallowed.

4.3. From the assessment order it is observed that the assessing officer has
taken not accepted the claim of the assessee that since most of the
investments were made in mutual funds primarily to invest the surplus funds
of the company, no administrative expenditure was incurred in this regard.The
assessing officer had specifically taken note of the fact that there was
substantial investment made by the company resulting in receipt of
substantial amount of dividend income and considering the magnitude of both
the investment held and the dividend received by the company, it was not
plausible to accept that no administrative expenditure was incurred in the
hands of the company in this regard. It is also important to note that the
assessing officer had specifically recorded his dissatisfaction about the
correctness of disallowance of Rs.25,78,156/- made by the assessee. The
fact that the assessing officer had properly examine the matter and had
applied his mind to the issue of disallowance of expenditure is also evident
from the fact that the assessing officer had considered and accepted the
explanation of the assessee regarding the claim that no borrowed funds were
used by the company for such investments and hence no disallowance of
interest u/s14A was called for.
</p>
<p id="p_39">4.4    On careful consideration of the facts of the case, it is observed that
there is an inherent contradiction in the submissions made by the assessee.
While on one hand the assessee vehemently claims that no direct
expenditure was incurred to earn the dividend income, on the other hand it
had quantified certain expense on a notional basis which could relate to
earning of dividend income from such investments. The fact, that the
assessee had made an notional disallowance of Rs.25,78,156/- as the
estimated administrative expenditure relatable to the earning of
dividend income, shows that it was only an adhoc quantification of the
expenditure without having any direct co-relation with the actual
expenditures incurred.
</p>
<p id="p_40">       In this regard it is relevant to refer to the annexure submitted by the
assessee during the scrutiny proceedings, furnishing details of the
computation of the amount Rs.25,78,156/-. From the information furnished in
the annexure, it is clearly noticed that for the purpose of allocation of
expenditure relating to the exempt income, the assessee has considered
expenses only under three heads including ‗maintenance of office
equipments', ‗printing and stationery' and ‗postage and telephone'. The other
administrative expenses such as professional and legal charges (Rs.23.56
crores), auditors fees (Rs. 0.53 crores), traveling and representation
expenses of Directors (Rs.4.22 crores) and miscellaneous expenses (Rs.3.60
crores) were not considered by the assessee for allocation. No specific
reasons have been furnished in this regard to justify why these heads are not
relevant in this regard. It is relevant to note that the expenditure referred to in
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_17">section 14A</a> should comprise of expenditures such as salary, rent, taxes,
interest, etc. In fact, in the decision in the case of Godrej &amp; Boyce Mfg.Co.
Ltd., the Hon'ble Bombay High Court has held that, the expression
'expenditure incurred' in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_18">section 14A</a> refers to expenditure on rent,
taxes, salaries, interest, etc., in respect of which allowances are
provided for. [Para 43]. Therefore, it was necessary for the assessee to
allocate all the expenditures relevant for incurring the tax exempt income
instead of limiting the allocation only to three heads of expenditure, as
discussed above.

<p id="p_41">                                                            ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012



       Further, it is also seen that for the purpose of allocation of the
expenses, the assessee has allocated the expenses on a pro rata basis by
taking into consideration the turnover of different types of receipts such as,
sales, hire charges of transhipper, sale of gas, sale of carbon credits etc.
However, in respect of dividend income, the assessee has taken ‗income' as
the basis for the purpose of allocation instead of considering the total
investment, which should correspond to ‗turnover' as in the case of other
receipts. This is patently wrong because the basis of allocation should be
similar for all items and when the assessee has considered turnover as the
basis for all other kind of receipts, it ought to have also considered the total
turnover of the investment for allocating the expenses in respect of the
dividend income. Therefore, allocating the expenditure taking income as
the basis in the case of dividend income and turnover as the basis in
the case of other receipts, gives rise to major distortion in the allocation
of expenditure. Further, it is also seen that the allocation of the expenditure
incurred towards Salary, Gratuity, PF etc, which alone accounted for 38% of
the total administrative expenditure, has not been made on a proportionate
basis. No justification has been adduced in this regard. If the total salary
expenditure of Rs.21.85 crores is allocated on a pro rata basis, the
proportionate amount relatable to dividend income will be Rs.62.10 lacs
instead of Rs.17.03 lacs, as computed by the assessee in the annexure. This
clearly shows that the basis adopted by the assessee for quantification
of the expenditure incurred in relation to the exempted income is
grossly flawed and erroneous.
</p>
<p id="p_42">       Further, it is also seen that the sales and other receipts of the
assessee, excluding dividend income is around Rs.4853 crores. The average
value of the investments as per the balance sheet is found to be Rs.2510
crores. Put together, the total turnover including investment in mutual funds
comes to Rs.7363 crores approximately. Therefore, if the total
administrative expenditure of Rs.56.59 crores is allocated on a
proportionate basis, the expenditure incurred in relation to the dividend
income shall amount to Rs.19.29 crores. As against this, the assessee
had computed an amount of Rs.25.78 lacs as the proportionate expenditure.
</p>
<p id="p_43">        Similarly, on a different analogy, it may be seen that in the explanation
baa under <a href="/doc/30524/" id="a_19">section 80HHC</a> of the income tax act, the statute provides for
deduction of 90% of various receipts such as sale of license, duty drawback,
commission, interest, etc, for computing the business profits. This implies that
in such cases 10% of such receipts could be reasonably held to be the
expenditure in relation to the receipts. Taking this into consideration, the
expenditure incurred in relation to making investment in shares and mutual
funds could be reasonably estimated by taking a similar figure of 10% of the
total transactions in such shares and mutual funds. By adopting this method
of computation, the expenditure incurred in relation to the mutual fund
investments in the case of the assessee comes to Rs.25.10 crores being 10%
of the average investment of Rs.2510 crores, which is very close to the
estimation made by the Assessing Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_44">4.5    The above discussions and comparisons clearly show that the
quantification of the expenditure at Rs.25.78 lacs made by the assessee is
grossly understated and without any basis. As discussed above the assessee

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       9</span>
                                                            ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

has not allocated the total salary expenditure of Rs. 21.85 crores
proportionately. Instead, it has taken adhoc figure of Rs. 17.03 Lacs as the
salary expenditure incurred in relation to earning of dividend income, which is
without any basis. It has been also shown above that if the salary expenditure
was allocated proportionately, the expenditure incurred for earning the
dividend income would have been Rs.62.10 lacs instead of Rs.17.03 lacs, as
computed by the assessee. Considering the above deviations and
discrepancies, it is clearly established that the method adopted by the
assessee for the allocation of expenditure in relation to the exempted income
is grossly flawed and erroneous and therefore, the Assessing Officer was
fully justified in not being satisfied with the correctness of the claim of
the assessee and for invoking the provisions of section 14A(2) of the I.
T. Act.
</p>
<p id="p_45">4.6    The assessee has relied on various judicial decisions such as in the
case of <a href="/doc/264398/" id="a_20">CIT vs. Hero Cycles Ltd</a> , 323 ITR 518(<a href="/doc/47515605/" id="a_21">P&amp;H) and CIT vs Walfort
Share and Stock Brokers (P) Ltd</a>, 326 ITR (SC), to substantiate this
ground of appeal. However, on examination of these cases it is observed
that these decisions relate to the assessment year 2004-05 and 2000-01
respectively, which was prior to the insertion of rule 8D. Careful reading of
both <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_22">section 14A(2)</a> as well as rule 8D(1) clearly brings out that the
Assessing Officer can derive jurisdiction to invoke the provisions of this
section only if he is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the
assessee in respect of the expenditure, which the assessee claims to
have incurred in relation to the exempt income. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_23">Section 14A</a> clearly
mandates that once the Assessing Officer is satisfied that the claim
of the assessee is not correct, he has no other option but to invoke
the methods prescribed in Rule 8D for quantifying the expenditure
incurred in relation to the exempt income. In the present case, there
are more than sufficient reasons, as discussed above, for the Assessing
Officer to reject the claim of the assessee. In view of the glaring errors as
discussed above, the Assessing Officer is fully justified in invoking the
provisions of I.T. Rule 8D for quantifying the expenditure incurred in
relation to the exempt income. Admittedly, the assessee has not raised
any objection as far as the computation of the expenditure under Rule 8D
is concerned. Therefore, in my considered view, the assessing officer was
correct for not being satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the
assessee in respect of such expenditure incurred in relation to the exempt
income. Having clearly recorded his dissatisfaction about the correctness
of the claim made by the assessee, he was fully within his jurisdiction to
invoke the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_24">section 14A(2)</a> and quantify the amount to be
disallowed as prescribed under rule 8D(1)(b). Therefore, considering the
facts of the case and for the reasons as discussed above, I confirmed the
disallowance of expenditure of Rs.12,29,25,049/- made by the Assessing
Officer under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_25">section 14A</a> of the I.T. Act. The first ground of appeal is
accordingly dismissed.‖

assessee company did not borrow any funds for making such investments
and the same was made out of its own funds. No direct administrative
expenses were incurred in respect of such investments. Even assuming
that the expenditure incurred as referred to in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_26">section 14A</a> covers also
indirect expenditure, a proportion of administrative expenditure of
Rs.25,78,156/- (which could be relatable to such investments) had already
been offered for disallowance u/s 14A . The said disallowance offered by
the assessee included part of salaries of its respective officials engaged in
such investment work and related incidental administrative expenses. The
AO accepted the fact that no borrowings were made for such investments,
hence no disallowance was made in relation to interest expenses or any
direct expenses but the AO applied rule 8D and made disallowance @
0.5% of the average amount of investments at the beginning and closing
of the year and a disallowance of Rs 12,29,25,049/- was made. It was
pointed out that the AO made following averments: -

          However, in respect of dividends, the assessee has considered the

<p id="p_51">9.    It was submitted by the Ld. Counsel that the assessee invested funds
on the advice of mutual fund managers. Mutual fund officials came to the
doorstep of the assessee to collect the forms and cheques and rendered all
services and in some cases dividends are reinvested in the mutual funds
itself and thus practically no cost was incurred by the assessee in making
investments and receiving dividends.        The assessee invested in debt
mutual funds. Page Nos. 457-458 of (Initial) PB Vol. II containing details of
investments exhibit that the assessee invested in a limited number of mutual

funds only. Further, Page No. 20 of (Initial) PB Vol. I exhibit the details of
profit on sale of investments which has been offered for taxation by the
assessee as capital gain and due taxes have been paid thereon. Therefore,
undisputedly   taxable    income   was      earned   from   these   investments.
Accordingly, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_27">section 14A</a> cannot be applied when investments are yielding
taxable income as well.     Further only few transactions of purchase and
sale have been undertaken by the assessee. The assessee need not spend
day to day time to decide about the investments as the assessee has not
churned out / shifted the investments on daily / regular basis. It can be seen
that once an investment is made, it lies there; just a few of them were sold to
encash profit on them and which was subjected to capital gains tax. Only
one person was full-time engaged for the investment activity and who used to
analyse various options and then the decision to invest was taken by the
CFO and approved by the Managing Director. Therefore, the assessee itself
disallowed u/s 14A the salary of the said persons to the extent of their
involvement in the activity of investments as mentioned on Page No. 109 of
(Initial) PB Vol. I. However, CIT (A) presumed that each staff and personnel
was participating in the investment activity and probably therefore felt the
need to allocate the entire salary in some proportion. But this proposition is
prima facie fallacious since all employees are not supposed to undertake or
be engaged in each and every business activity. Their strength is pre-
determined accordingly to the manpower requirement and their duties are
also pre-assigned accordingly. It must be appreciated that the primary
business of the appellant is „mining‟ which definitely entails a huge manpower
need and in comparison to which the manpower required to assist in
investing surplus funds with mutual funds is absolutely insignificant. Thus, the
entire salary expenses of the entire staff cannot be allocated proportionately
between taxable and exempt incomes as averred by the CIT (A), especially
when a proper person-wise allocation to the investment activity is practically
possible.

certain expenses relatable to earning of exempt income as mentioned on

fees, travelling expenses of director, etc., were particularly incurred for this
investment activity and therefore no disallowance was made. Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in CIT Vs Walfort Share &amp; Stock Brokers (P) Ltd. (2010)
326 ITR 1 (SC) held that the AO is required to prove that the disallowance is
necessary due to proximate cause and nexus of expenditure to earn the
exempt income. Likewise, in Maxopp Investment Ltd Vs. CIT (2011) 15
Taxmann. Com 390 (Delhi), it has been held that the Assessing Officer is
required to satisfy as regards the incorrectness of the claim of expenditure.It
was for the AO to point out the expenses actually incurred for earning the
exempt income and point out discrepancy in the computation of disallowance
made by the assessee. But no such effort has been made by the AO and no
such discrepancy has been pointed out as can be seen from the assessment
order. No evidence has been brought on record by the AO that the
explanations of the appellant were not correct. A reasonable amount of
expenditure of more than Rs. 25.78 lacs including salaries was disallowed by
the appellant himself. The AO did not record his satisfaction as to why the
disallowance made by the assessee-company was incorrect. He merely
alleged that the said disallowance is low as compared to the magnitude of
investment and disallowance which cannot be a reason for applying Rule 8D.
Referring to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_28">section 14A(2)</a>, it was pointed out that the satisfaction of the
assessing officer about the incorrectness of the claim of the assessee in
respect of the expenditure relating to the dividend income should be with
regard to the accounts of the assessee.       No such satisfaction has been
arrived at by the assessing officer. He has not rejected the accounts of the
assessee.    He has not pointed out any mistake in the accounts of the
assessee.    The Ld. A.R. in this regard relied on the decision of the
jurisdictional High Court in the case of Godrej &amp; Boyce Manufacturing
Company Ltd. Vs. DCIT 328 ITR 81 (Mum.).

<p id="p_53">11.    Rule 8D provides for the computation of the disallowance in this
connection, only if the assessing officer, having regard to the accounts of
the previous year is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the
expenditure computed/worked out by the assessee. The assessing officer
must, in the first instance determined whether the claim of the assessee in
that regard is correct and the determination must be made having regard

                                                             ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

to the accounts of the assessee. The satisfaction of the assessing officer
must be arrived at on an exact basis. The CIT (A) concluded that the
assessee made a contrary claim that no administrative expenditure was
incurred but worked out the disallowance on notional basis. There is no
contradiction in the statement of assessee. The assessee stated that there
was no directly relatable expenditure which was incurred to earn dividends
and the disallowance was made for other expenses. This was, in fact,
accepted by the AO who also did not make any disallowance u/r 8D(1)(i).
The CIT (A) tried to justify the application of Rule 8D by the assessing
officer on surmises and presumptions which is not permissible at all. One
assertion made by the CIT (A) was that the amount of investment
corresponds to the amount of turnover/sales in case of dividends and
therefore the same should be considered for the purpose of allocation of
indirect expenses, but it is submitted that it is not correct proposition. The
corresponding base figure to the value of investment made in mutual
funds can at best be the stock of iron-ore/finished goods, but it can never
be said to correspond to the turnover of iron-ore, etc. in any manner
because the basic nature of receipts and income is such that they can
never correspond to stock or value of investment at all. Further, the
turnover of mutual funds, i.e., the value of redemption of mutual funds is
subject to tax as capital gains [since exemption/s 10(38) is not available
on liquidation of a debt-oriented mutual fund] and therefore the said basis
cannot be considered for the purpose of computation of disallowance u/s
14A. Thus, to allocate the indirect expenses, only dividend receipts /
income could have been considered as has been done by the assessee.
Thus, the presumption of the CIT (A) to consider the value of investment
for allocation of expenses is baseless. Another preposterous proposition
of the CIT (A) is to apply <a href="/doc/30524/" id="a_29">section 80HHC</a> which is entirely a different code
for an entirely different purpose. The basis of 10% adopted therein cannot
be considered while computing disallowance u/s 14A. If that basis was to
be adopted then there was no need to introduce Rule 8D. The intention
behind enacting the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_30">section 14A</a> and rule 8D is to bring
equity in levy and collection of taxes by providing that if an income stream
is not taxable then expenses incurred in relation thereto should not/cannot
be allowed - (which if not done, then may allow a sort of double

advantage to an assessee). However in the same corollary of argument, it
should be appreciated that the intention behind provisions laid down in
Rule 8D is not to embark upon an unwarranted high level of disallowance
of expense when the available facts and circumstances do suggest
otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_54">12.   Reliance was placed in this regard on the decision in the case of
CIT Vs. Jindal Photo Ltd. in ITA No.4539/DLI/010 dated 7/1/11 for the
proposition of the law that the assessing officer must record his
dissatisfaction about the claim of the assessee regarding computation of
expenses incurred for earning exempt income with regard to the accounts
of the assessee. No ad-hoc disallowance can be made. Again Delhi
Bench of this Tribunal for the assessment year 2008-09 in the case of the
same assessee i.e. DCIT Vs. Jindal Photo Ltd. vide order dated
23/9/2011, the Tribunal followed the same principle and took the view that
a mechanical application of rule 8D is not permissible. The onus is on the
assessing officer to record his satisfaction as to the incorrectness of the
claim of the assessee about the expenses incurred in relation to the
exempt income and assessing officer has to establish a clear finding of the
expenses incurred in relation to the exempt income. Reliance was also
placed on the decision of Justice S.P. Barucha Vs. Addl. Income Tax
Officer in ITA No.3889/Mum/2011. But this decision, in our opinion, is not
applicable to the facts of the case as in this case, the assessee has not
claimed any expenditure being incurred for earning the exempt income.
Reliance was also placed on the decision of the `F‟ Bench, Mumbai in ITA
No. 5779/2006 and ITA No. 208/2009 in the case of Avshesh Mercantile
Pvt. Ltd. and others Vs. DCIT for the proposition of the income when the
assessee has both taxable as well as exempt income, the provisions of
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_31">section 14A</a> will not apply. Reliance was also placed on the decision of
apex court in the case of CIT Vs. Walfort Share and Stock Brokers Ltd.,
326 ITR 1, it was stressed that the intention beyond provision laid down in
rule 8D is not embarked upon an unwarranted high level of disallowance
of expenditure when the available factors and circumstances do suggest
that an ad-hoc application would provide such result as has happened in
assessee‟s case. It was pointed out that, as a result of computation of

disallowance by the assessing officer u/s 14A, the disallowance in relation
to exempt income comes at Rs.12,55,03,205/- i.e. about 8.8% of total
exempt dividend income. Whereas, as per the audited accounts, the total
administrative expenses incurred for the whole year are only Rs.56.59
crores with regard to the total turnover of Rs.4,996.23 crores, including the
exempt dividend income. This works out only at 1.7%. It is impossible for
a company to incur almost 1/5th of Rs.56 crores in earning an income
which is from investment and not from the main stream.
</p>
<p id="p_55">13.   The Learned D.R. on the other hand submitted that the assessee‟s
investment in shares, etc. are Rs.2,510 crores. Dividend income earned
from this investment is Rs.142,72,73,668/-. The assessee has worked out
the disallowance at Rs.25,78,156/- u/s 14A on ad-hoc basis by taking into
account expenditure incurred towards maintenance of office equipment,
printing &amp; stationery and postage &amp; telephone. The assessing officer,
having regard to the accounts of the assessee, is not satisfied with the
correctness of the claim of the assessee as the explanation of the
assessee that no administrative expenditure incurred on earning dividend
income not acceptable, considering the magnitude of investment and
dividend income received. The disallowance made by assessee u/s. 14<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_32">A
of the Act</a> towards administrative expenditure is low on comparing the
magnitude of purchase and sale made by the assessee and investment of
large magnitude cannot be made by proper analysis of the market
condition stock movement etc. Appellate Commissioner confirmed finding
of the Assessing Officer that having regard to the accounts of the
assessee is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim. Submission of
the assessee on the one hand that there was no administrative
expenditure and on the other hand there was administrative expenditure
which was worked out on notional basis is self contradictory.          Ad-hoc
administrative expenditure worked out by the assessee on "maintenance

</blockquote><p id="p_60">14.   We have carefully considered the rival submissions along with the
order of the authorities below. We have also gone through various case laws
and the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_36">IT Act</a> in this regard. The issue involved before us
relate to the disallowance made by the AO by applying the provisions of
sec.14<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_37">A of the IT Act</a> read with Rule 8D of the IT Rules. Sec.14A was
inserted by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_38">Finance Act</a>, 2001 w.e.f. 1.4.1962. Originally this sec. provides
that in computing the total income of the assessee no deduction shall be
allowed in respect of the expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to
the income which does not form part of the total income under the Act.
Subsequently, by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_39">Finance Act</a>, 2002 with retrospective effect from 11/5/2001
proviso was added which states that this sec. shall not empower the AO
either to re-assess or pass an order enhancing the assessment or reducing
the refund already made or otherwise increasing the liability of the assessee
for any assessment year beginning on or before 1/4/2001.        With effect from
1/4/2007 by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_40">Finance Act</a>, 2006 sub-sec. (2) empowers the AO to determine
the amount of expenditure incurred in relation to such income which does not
form part of the total income in accordance with the method as may be
prescribed. Such power is to be exercised if the AO having regard to the
accounts of the assessee, is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of
the assessee in respect of the expenditure mentioned in sub-sec.(1). Before
applying Rule 8D, it is apparent that the AO must be satisfied with the
correctness of the claim of the assessee having regard to the accounts of the
assessee.   Such satisfaction is an objective satisfaction that it has to be
judicious and based on the material on record. It cannot be an impression that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                      21</span>
                                                            ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

it is much more than the gossip or hearsay, it means judgment or belief that it
is a belief or a connection resulting from what one thinks on a particular
question. It must be based on the reasons and ground as seems good to him
and while making such satisfaction, the AO must give regard to the accounts
of the assessee. He must record deficiency in the accounts with regards to
the claim of the assessee. Sub-sec.(3) provides that provisions of sub-sec.(2)
shall also apply where assessee claims that no expenditure had been
incurred in relation to income not forming part of the total income. This is not
the case of the assessee as in the case of the assessee, assessee himself
estimated the expenses relating to the exempt income and disallowed the
same. Rule 8D was inserted by gazette notification dated 24/3/2008 in view of
the power conferred under sub-sec (2). This Rule prescribes the method for
computing the expenditure incurred in relation to the income not forming part
of the total income. This is an undisputed fact that in this case, the assessee
has invested in debts mutual funds. The assessee computed disallowance u/s
14A(2) at Rs.25,78,156/- and disallowed the same, while computing its total
income. The working of the said disallowance claimed by the assessee is
given herein above in the submissions made by the assessee. The AO was
not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the assessee especially the
explanation of the assessee that no administrative expenditure incurred on
earning the dividend income. Considering the magnitude of the investments
and the dividend income received, the AO was of the view that the
disallowance made by the assessee u/s 14<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_41">A of the IT Act</a> towards the
administrative expenditure is low on comparing the magnitude of purchase
and sales made by the assessee and the investments of large magnitude
cannot be made without proper analysis of the market condition/stock
movement etc.     The revenue was of the opinion, that the assessee has
worked out the administrative expenditure and had not considered all the
administrative expenditure. Both the parties before us vehemently relied on
the decision of Godrej Boyce Mfg Co. Ltd. Vs DCIT 328 ITR 81 (Mum).

<p id="p_61">15.   We have gone through this decision and we noted that in this case, the
assessee claimed exemption in respect of dividend income of 34.34 crores
u/s 10(33). The AO issued notices for disallowance of interest u/s 14<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_42">A of the
IT Act</a>. The explanation of the assessee was that (i) 95% of the shares were

bonus shares for which no cost was incurred; (ii) No investment in shares was
made in the current year and no disallowance was made in earlier years and
</p><p id="p_62">(iii) There were sufficient interest free funds available in the form of share
capital, reserves etc. which were more than investment in shares.          The AO
was not satisfied with the explanation of the assessee and he made
disallowance u/s 14A on prorata basis. The CIT(A) following his orders for
earlier years, accepted the appeal of the assessee. The Tribunal following
the decision of the Special Bench in the case of ITO Vs Daga Capital
Management (P) Ltd 117 ITD 169 (SB) restored the matter to the file of the
AO for the consideration in the light of the provisions of sub-sec.(2) &amp; (3) of
Sec.14A of the IT Act.    The assessee, being aggrieved, filed appeal as well
as Writ Petition challenging the constitutional validity of sub-sec. (2) &amp; (3) and
Rule D. The Hon‟ble High Court gave the following findings;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">       1. The provisions of sec. 14A and Rule 8D are constitutionally valid.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">       2. The provisions of sub-sec. (2) &amp; (3) of Sec.14A and Rule 8D are
       prospective and not retrospective, in nature and therefore, would apply
       from assessment year 2007-08.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">       3. The basic object of Sec.14A is to disallow the direct and indirect
       expenditure incurred in relation to income which does not form part of
       the total income (page 21).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">       4. The insertion of sec.14A was curative and declaratory of the intent
       of the Parliament. The basic principle of taxation is that only net
       income, namely, gross income minus expenditure that is taxable.</blockquote>
<p id="p_63">       Expenses incurred can be allowed only to the extent that they are
       relatable to the earning of taxable income (pages 22-23). The test
       which has been enunciated in Wallfort for attracting the provisions of
       sec.14A is that there has to be a proximate cause for disallowance
       which has its relationship with the tax exempt income. Once the test
       of proximate cause, based on the relationship of the expenditure
       with tax exempt income is established, a disallowance would
       have to be effected under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_43">section 14A</a> (page 28)
</p><p id="p_64">       5. What merits emphasis is that the jurisdiction of the AO to determine
       the expenditure incurred in relation to such income which does not
       form part of the total income, in accordance with the prescribed
       method, arises if the AO is not satisfied with the correctness of the

claim of the assessee in respect of the expenditure which the
assessee claims to have incurred in relation to income which does not
form part of the total income. Moreover, the satisfaction of the AO has
to be arrived at, having regard to the accounts of the assessee.
Hence, sub-sec (2) does not ipso facto enable the AO to apply the
method prescribed by the rules straightaway without considering
whether the claim made by the assessee in respect of the expenditure
incurred in relation to income which does not form part of the total
income is correct.    The AO must, in the first instance, determine
whether the claim of the assessee in that regard is correct and the
determination must be made having regard to the accounts of the
assessee. The satisfaction of the AO must be arrived at on an
objective basis. It is only when the AO is not satisfied with the claim of
the assessee, that the legislature directs him to follow the method that
may be prescribed. In a situation where the accounts of the assessee
furnish an objective basis for the AO to arrive at a satisfaction in regard
to the correctness of the claim of the assessee of the expenditure
which has been incurred in relation to income which does not form part
of the total income, there would be no warrant for taking recourse to
the method prescribed by the rules.     For, it is only in the event of the
AO not being so satisfied that recourse to the prescribed method is
mandated by law (pages 31-32).
</p><p id="p_65">6. In the event that the AO is not satisfied with the correctness of the
claim made by the assessee, he must record reasons for his
conclusion (page-79).
</p><p id="p_66">7. The effect of sec.14A is to widen the theory of the apportionment of
expenditure (page 49).
</p><p id="p_67">8. The expression ‗expenditure incurred; in Sec.14A refers to
expenditure on rent, taxes, salaries, interest, etc., in respect of which
allowances are provided for (page-50).
</p><p id="p_68">9. Sub-sections (2) &amp; (3) of Sec.14A are intended to enforce and
implement the provisions of sub-sec (1) (pages 50).

      part of the total income under the Act. The AO would have to follow a
      reasonable method of apportioning the expenditure consistent with
      what the circumstances of the case would warrant and having regard
      to all relevant facts and circumstances‖.
</p>
<p id="p_70">      The said decision of the jurisdictional High Court is binding on us.
While deciding this case, the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the
case of CIT Vs Wallfort Shares &amp; Stock Brokers Ltd., 233 CTR (SC) 42 was
referred to. In this decision, we noted that the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in that
case upheld the view of the Hon‟ble Mumbai High Court in the case of
Wallfort Shares &amp; Stock Brokers Ltd. Vs ITO 310 ITR 421.           The Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in this decision, at page-31 of the order held as under;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">      ―To attract Sec.14A there has to be proximate cause for disallowance
      which has its relationship with the tax exempt. Pay back or return of
      investment is not such proximate cause. Hence, Sec.14A is not
      applicable in the present case. Thus, in the absence of such proximate
      cause for disallowance, Sec.14A cannot be invoked‖.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_71">16.   The Hon‟ble Bombay High Court in the case of Godrej &amp; Boyce Mfg.
Co. Ltd. Vs DCIT (supra) therefore at page-28 has clearly laid down that
there must be proximate cause based on the relationship of the expenditure
that tax exempt income is established, only then a disallowance would have
to be effected u/s 14<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_44">A of the IT Act</a>. Therefore, in view of the decision of the
jurisdictional High Court and the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, we
are of the view that sec.14A cannot be applied unless there is a proximate
cause for disallowance. The onus to establish that there is proximate cause
based on the relationship of the expenditure with the exempt income in our
opinion is on the Revenue. Thus, the application of the provisions of sec. (2)
&amp; (3) of Sec.14A and Rule 8D is not automatic in each and every case, where
there is income not forming part of the total income. Sub-sec. (2) &amp; (3) are
intended to enforce and implement the provisions of sub-sec. (1).
Therefore, it is necessary for the AO first to ascertain whether there is
proximate connection between the expenditure incurred and the income not
forming part of the total income. If such proximate connection is established
with the exempt income, the AO would be justified in applying the provisions


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                      25</span>

of sub-sec (2) &amp; (3) of sec.14A and Rule 8D of the IT Act, 1961. The
expenditure incurred u/s 14A would include direct and indirect expenditure,
but relationship with exempted income must be proximate. If there is material
to establish that there is direct nexus between the expenditure incurred and
the income not forming part of total income then disallowance would be
justified even where there is no receipt of exempted income u/s 10 in the year
under consideration in view of the decision of Special Bench in the case of
Cheminvest Ltd. 124 TTJ 577 (Del)(SB).

<p id="p_72">17.    The basic principle of taxation is to tax the net income. On the same
analogy, the exemption is also to be allowed on net basis i.e. gross receipts
minus related expenses. Therefore, if any expenditure is directly related to
exempted income, it cannot be allowed to be set off against taxable profit. On
the same analogy, in our opinion, if any expenditure is directly related to
taxable income, it cannot be allowed to be set off against the exempted
income merely because some incidental benefit has arisen towards exempted
income. Before making any disallowance u/s 14A, the AO is required to
record a satisfaction, having regard to the accounts of the assessee, that
claim of assessee that expenditure incurred is not related to the income
forming part of the total income is incorrect. Such satisfaction must be arrived
at on the objective basis.       He is also required to record the reasons for
arriving at such satisfaction.    The assessing officer in this case, we noted is
not satisfied with the correctness of the disallowance made by the assessee
even though he has accepted the explanation of the assessee that no interest
is incurred with regard to exempt income. He rejected the explanation of the
assessee that no administrative expenditure incurred on earning dividend
income considering the magnitude of the investments and dividend income
received and the disallowance according to him made by the assessee u/s
14A towards administrative expenditure is very less. The assessing officer
nowhere pointed out the proximate connection of other expenses not
apportioned by the assessee for the earning of the dividend income. He
merely observed that the administrative expenses disallowed by the assessee
is very less but how they are less and how the other expenses incurred by the
assessee related to the dividend income has not been brought on record.
Even the AO has not pointed out the expenses excluded by the assessee for

disallowance has proximate connection with dividend income. In our opinion,
the assessing officer before rejecting the disallowance computed by the
assessee must give a clear cut finding having regard to the accounts of the
assessee how the other expenditure claimed by the assessee out of non
exempt income is related with the exempt income. No discrepancy in the
claim of the assessee was pointed out. The assessing officer in our opinion
in view of the jurisdictional High Court decision is bound to record satisfaction
as to how the expenses claimed by the assessee have been incurred on
earning dividend income were not sufficient and correct. We have already
held that the onus to prove in this regard lies on the assessing officer.
Although the Ld. DR had vehemently contended and tried to build up his case
by substituting the reasons given by the CIT(Appeal) in place of the AO, but
failed to bring any cogent material or evidence in this regard which may prove
that the other expenses claimed by the Revenue for apportionment had
proximate connection with the earning of the dividend income. In our opinion
until and unless this is proved or established by the revenue, the assessing
officer does not have any power to reject the accounts of the assessee and
take the shelter of Rule 8D for computing the disallowance out of the exempt
income. We are not at all convinced with the submission of the Ld. DR
relying on the decision of CIT(Appeal) in respect of Explanation bb to sec.
80HHC that 10% of the receipts under the sources mentioned therein are
deemed to be the expenditure. This in our opinion will strengthen the case of
the assessee as Explanation bb to sec. 80HHC does not recognize amount of
the investment made in other receipt to be the basis of computing the
expenditure being incurred for the earning of that income. Similar views have
been taken by Hon‟ble Tribunal in the following decisions also.

       claim of the assessee in respect of expenditure incurred in relation to
       income which does not form part of the assessee's total income under

      under Rule 8D of the I.T. Rules. However, in the present case, the
      assessment order does not evince any such satisfaction of the AO
      regarding the correctness of the claim of the assessee. As such, Rule
      8D of the Rules was not appropriately applied by the AO as correctly
      held by the CIT(A).      It has not been done by the AO that any
      expenditure had been incurred by the assessee for earning its dividend
      income. Merely, an adhoc disallowance was made. The onus was on
      the AO to establish any such expenditure. This onus has not been
      discharged.    In ―CIT Vs. Hero Cycles‖ (P&amp;H) 323 ITR 518, under
      similar circumstances, it was held that the disallowance u/s 14<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_46">A of the

      Hon'ble High Court on the merit of the issue which is binding on this
      Tribunal. We are unable to accept this contention of the learned DR.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      It is well settled proposition of judicial precedents that is appeal the
      Hon'ble High Court considers facts pertaining to the issue and gives

      gets merged with the judgment and order of the High Court and it
      becomes binding precedent even though approval to decision of lower
      forum/court is summarily recorded.     Similar situation had arisen for
      consideration before the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of
      Nirma Industries Ltd. 283 ITR 402 wherein the effects of summary
      disposal of appeal by the High Court were analysed and explained by
      their Lordships. It was clarified that while hearing an appeal even for
      deciding whether substantial question of law arises or not from the
      order of the Tribunal, the High Court does not exercise either the
      original jurisdiction or the jurisdiction to issue writs and the only
      jurisdiction exercised by the High Court in the first instance decides
      whether or not substantial question of law arises from the order of the

subject matter of controversy between the parties has not been dealt
with by the High Court. It was held that when the decision of the

decision of the High Court which becomes operative and which is
capable of being given effect to for all intents and purposes. Keeping

High Court and delete the disallowance made by the AO and

the Learned DR, it is observed that in none of these cases, the facts

taxable as well as exempt income which was actually not earned by
the assessee in the relevant period as are the facts of the present case
or that of the case of Delite Enterprise (supra) decided by the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court.       Accordingly, we decide the common issue
involved in all these appeals in favour of the assessees following the

that case, the assessee was regularly investing in the shares. The assessee
has not disallowed any expenditure with regard to the earning of the dividend

not to invest is a very strategic decision and top management involve in taking

2005-06, in which the similar issue was considered. With regard to
the controversy whether the assessee is required to deduct tax at
source for the commission paid to the non-resident agents, the
Hon'ble tribunal has decided the issue in favour of the assessee in
the above referred appeal. In this regard it is held that circular no. 7
of 2009 withdrawing the circular no. 23 of 1969, 163 of 1975 and
786 of 2000, will be operative only from 22/10/2009 and not prior to
that date. It was accordingly held that the circular is not applicable
for the year under consideration, i.e., 2005-06 and accordingly the
appeal of the assessee was allowed. Following the ratio of this
decision, circular no. 7 of 2009, which was held to be operative only
from 22/10/2009, should have no application to the present case
which relates to the financial year 2008-09 relevant to the
assessment year 2009-10. Accordingly, following the decision of the
Hon'ble ITAT, the assessee was not liable to deduct tax in respect
of the commission payments made to the non-resident agents.

       Rs.9,88,29,729/- is added back to the total income of the
       assessee.‖


It is therefore, necessary to refer to the order of the CIT(Appeal) for
the assessment year 2006-07 in connection with the allowability of
commission payment. During the year 2005-06 (relevant for
assessment year 2006-07) commission was paid to three concerns
including,      Rs.15,21,98,212/-    to    Mitsui   &amp;    Co.,     Japan,
Rs.2,71,86,975/- to Ahmed Jaffar &amp; Co. Ltd., Karachi and
Rs.66,86,324/- to Arimpeks Dis Ticaret Ve Mum Ltd. In this regard,
in the order of the CIT (Appeal), it was held that since the assessee
company is dealing with the purchasers of iron ore year after year,
exports are made directly; payments are received directly without
being routed through the commission agents. There is apparently
no    justified   reason   for   payment   of   commission       without
substantiating the authenticity of the commission agents and
without having furnished reasonable proof of correspondence and
adequacy of services rendered by the commission agents.
Therefore, for the assessment year 2006-07 the CIT (Appeal)
had held that there was no necessity for engaging the
commission agents and accordingly, the commission payment
was not held to be allowable as business expenditure u/s 37 of
the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_54">I.T. Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_84">6.5    In the present case, it is observed that the facts are very
much similar to that of the case for assessment year 2006-07. For
the year under consideration, assessee has paid commission of
Rs.8,26,79,634/- to M/s Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd., Japan and Rs.54,90,159/-
to M/s Omega Pvt. Ltd., Karachi, Pakistan. The balance amount of
the claim represents service tax. During the course of appeal
proceedings, the assessee had furnished copy of agreement dated
26.07.2007 between Sesa Goa Ltd. and Omega Pvt. Ltd. and a
copy of an Addendum agreement between Sesa Goa Ltd. and
Mitsui Japan. The assessee has also relied on extracts of e-mails
exchange between the appellant and the sales agents to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                    33</span>
                                                     ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

substantiate the nature of services rendered by the sales agents.
However, it is important to note that the claim of payment of
commission to the extent of Rs.9.88 crores cannot be justified
merely by relying on copies of agreements or e-mail extracts. It is
not disputed that M/s Mitsui &amp; Co. or M/s Omega Pvt. Ltd. are
known entities as far as the assessee is concerned. It is possible
that the assessee may have some kind of business relationship with
the above two companies. It is also possible that there may be
some correspondence with the two companies with regard to sales
of iron ore abroad. But this shall not be sufficient justification to
prove that the companies abroad have rendered necessary
services for effecting sales so as to justify the claim of commission.
It is important to observe that although the agreement between the
assessee and Omega Pvt. Ltd. is dated 26.7.2007, no commission
was paid to Omega Ltd. during the F.Y. 2007-08 which implies that
no services were rendered during that year, notwithstanding the
agreement. This demonstrates that entering an agreement does not
necessarily imply that services are rendered. Similarly, the
assessee has not been able to counter the observations made by
the CIT(Appeal) in respect of commission payment to M/s Mitsui &amp;
Co. for the assessment year 2006-07. It is established in law that
mere existence of an agreement for payment of commission shall
not justify the claim of deduction u/s 37 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_55">I.T. Act</a>. In this
regard, it is relevant to note the following observations of the
Supreme Court in the case of Laxminarayan Madanlal Vs CIT
(1972) 86 ITR 439 (SC).
</p>
<p id="p_85">―The question whether an amount claimed as an expenditure was
laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the
business has to be decided on the facts and in the light of the
circumstances in each case. The mere existence of an agreement
between the assessee and its selling agents or payment of certain
amounts as commission, assuming there was such payment, does
not bind the ITO to hold that payment was made exclusively and
wholly for the purpose of the assessee's business. Although there


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                34</span>
                                                            ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

       might be such an agreement in existence and the payments might
       have been made, it is still open to the ITO to consider the relevant
       factors and determine for himself whether commission said to have
       been paid to the selling agents or any part thereof is properly
       deductible u/s 37 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_56">IT Act</a>.‖




       6.6    In the present case, it is significant to note that assessee is
       an established iron ore exporter and has been exporting iron ore to
       the same countries year after year for substantially long time. It is
       also observed that the assessee has been transacting with known
       business concerns and therefore, there was no real necessity for an
       agent to render any service for promoting sales with such concerns
       with whom the assessee has been transacting for long. As far as
       Mitusi &amp; Co., Japan, is concerned, it is pertinent to note that
       assessee has been exporting iron to this concern for substantially
       long time, which should normally not require any sales promotion.
       Considering the facts of the case as discussed above, the assessee
       has not been able to substantiate the claim for payment of
       commission to non-resident agents by adducing specific and
       tangible evidence to demonstrate that services were rendered by
       the sales agents to justify commission payment as claimed by the
       assessee. Therefore, in view of the above, it is held that the
       commission payment of Rs.9,88,29,729/- which is claimed to have
       been paid to non-resident agents cannot be allowed as business
       expenditure u/s 37 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_57">I.T. Act</a>, and therefore, the disallowance of
       Rs.9,88,29,729/-      made by the Assessing Officer is accordingly
       confirmed. The ground of appeal is accordingly, dismissed.‖

</pre><p id="p_89">              21.   It was pointed out that during the year; commission has been paid only
              to two parties as is clear from the said chart i.e. Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd., Japan and
              Omega Private Limited, Karachi. In the earlier year, commission was paid to
              Ahmed Jaffer &amp; Co. in Karachi. This party was reconstituted and became
              Private Limited Company at the same place and the same services are being
              rendered by Omega Private Ltd.        None of the parties is related to the
              assessee. The assessee has entered into an agreement with both the parties
              for which attention was drawn to page 414 and 421 of the paper book.
</p>
<p id="p_90">              21.1 The AO disallowed the said commission u/s 40(a)(i) for the first time in
              A.Y. 2005-06, on the pretext that no tax has been deducted at source on such
              commission paid. Though CIT (A) confirmed the disallowance, but the issue
              was decided in favor of the assessee by the Hon‟ble I.T.A.T., Panaji in ITA
              No. 113/PNJ/2010 vide order dt. 10/03/2011. It is understood that department
              has not filed appeal against the said order in the High Court of Bombay at
              Goa. The CIT (A) in his order for A.Y. 2005-06, had also raised a point
              regarding necessity of the payment of such commission. The I.T.A.T. did
              refute to make any comment on this issue since it was not a ground raised by
              AO for disallowance. The same disallowance is getting repeated in the AYs


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                    37</span>

2006-07,    2007-08,    2008-09    &amp;   2009-10.    However,     the    question        of
genuineness of commission has been raised in all these years. In AY 2006-
07, the said disallowance was confirmed by CIT (A) and the matter is lying
under appeal before the Hon‟ble I.T.A.T. which has already been heard. For
A.Y. 2007-08, the first appellate order is still pending for adjudication till date.
For A.Y. 2008-09, in view of certain TP additions, the draft order was referred
to DRP which refused to interfere with the AO‟s order and hence this matter is
also before the Tribunal but adjourned on the request of Department.
</p>
<p id="p_91">21.2 The learned A.R submitted that so far the issue regarding disallowance
of commission u/s 40(a)(i) due to non-deduction of tax at source is
concerned, the same has been decided in favor of the assessee and thus
there remains no dispute regarding the same. It was further argued that it
must be appreciated that the sometimes commission is paid to the agent only
in the first year for finding a buyer. However, mostly it is paid regularly year
after year for smooth execution of the contracts with the said buyers. It always
depends upon the terms and conditions of the contract with agent which
mention about the service to be rendered by the agents. The agent may/may
not assist in settling the terms of the transactions because that is the subject
matter between the seller and the buyer. But the agents are entitled for
commission for services rendered by them for smooth and perfect execution
of contracts without hindrances. The services of the sale agents are utilized,
besides getting the sales contracts, also in settling the problems arising to the
buyers. These agents arrange meetings, prepare presentations, communicate
shipping documents, nomination of vessel for export by the buyers, dealing
with the difficulties arising on such nominations, assist in fixing shipment
schedules, opening letter of credit by the buyers and any amendments
whereon, various issues cropping in connection with letter of credit, follow-up
with buyers for payments and settlement of invoices, prompt settlement of
demurrage and dispatch matters. Our attention was drawn to Page No.131 of
(Initial) PB Vol. I, wherein vide para nos. 2.3 &amp; 2.4 services rendered by the
commission agents are mentioned. The agents ensure that the goods would
be supplied by the buyers on settled terms for which payment would be
released by the buyer as settled between the two. The agents cannot be left
out of the transactions. Sale of goods is not the only important aspect in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                        38</span>
                                                             ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

international business, that too of iron ore business, various business
auxiliary services like shipping dispatching, documentation, letter of credit are
other important aspects to be taken care of for proper dispatch of goods and
receipt of money. If the goods are not shipped in time, the assessee may
have to bear extra cost in form of demurrage, compensation, etc. If the letter
of credit is not opened in time it will delay the dispatch and the entire process.
Either the assessee has to employ staff overseas which can take care of such
things but it will increase fixed cost to the assessee, or the assessee can get
services of these agents who have been rendering services to it for years and
know the intricacies of business. It is the prerogative of the businessman to
decide as to whether commission has to be paid or not as per his business
requirements. The commercial expediency should be adjudged from the point
of view of the businessman. The AO cannot step into the shoes of the
businessman to decide commercial expediency. The CIT (A) has accepted
that there is some business relationship and correspondence between the
assessee and the agents but held that is not sufficient justification to hold
services were rendered by agents for commission to the extent of Rs. 9.88
crores. This shows that the CIT (A) agreed that evidences produced show the
existence of business relationship which could be none other than agent as is
clear from the agreement wherein services rendered are mentioned. Emails
show that the said services were actually rendered. What more justification
was required has not been brought on record by the authorities. The
international business is being done through telephones, internet and emails
and therefore only such type of evidences can be produced to prove the
physical rendering of services by the agents. The CIT (A) held that mere
existence of an agreement for payment of commission does not justify the
expenditure. The assessee agrees to it but the agreements are supporting
evidences to show the nature of services rendered by the agent. These
agreements read with other supporting evidences like emails, etc. prove the
rendering of services by the agents and are therefore an important piece of
evidence. Reliance was placed by the Ld. AR on the judgement of CIT Vs
Shriram Pistons &amp; Rings Ltd. [2012-TIOL-187-HC-DEL-IT] wherein it has
been held that when the assessee pays up commission based on
agreements, any disallowance cannot be made of the same by disputing that
the agents did not render any service. The assessee-company has been

paying commission to Mitsui &amp; Co. in the preceding years which has been
allowed to it even prior to AY 2006-07. The commission paid to Mitsui &amp; Co.
Ltd. Was considered by the Transfer Pricing Officer in AY 2004-05 and 2005-
06 and it was held by him that the transactions were at Arm‟s Length Prices.
Photocopies of the TPO orders are enclosed at Page nos. 424-427 of (Initial)
PB Vol. II. The said Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd. was an AE (Associated Enterprise) of
the assessee till AY 2008-09 and till then, the transactions with the AE
including payment of commission were subjected to TPO‟s audit and no
adverse inference was drawn by TPO in view of arm‟s length principle
followed for making such payment. A photocopy of the addendum agreement
entered with Mitsui &amp; Co. is placed at Page nos. 421-423 of (Initial) PB Vol. II.
Further, Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd rendered services to the assessee during the year
as can be seen from the photocopies of emails exchanged between buyer
and Mitsui and seller and Mitsui placed at Page nos. 135-156 of (Initial) PB
Vol. I. These evidences clearly show that the said agent has rendered
services to the assessee and therefore commission paid to it should be
allowed. A copy of agency contract entered into with M/s Omega Private Ltd
is placed on record at Page nos. 414-420 of (Initial) PB Vol. II. Though the
agreement was entered into on 26/07/2007, but since no services were
rendered by the said party as per contract, no commission was paid to it in
the preceding year. However, in the year under consideration, services were
rendered by it, and therefore the commission was paid. The said amount was
paid to the agent for smooth execution of contract with Pakistan steel. The
said party is not related to the assessee in any manner. None of the
recipients of commission was a related party but internationally known
independent and reputed companies. All payments were made through
proper banking channels notified to RBI as well. The assessee company had
a turnover (iron ore only) of Rs. 4,586 crores during the financial year 2008-
09 (relevant to AY 2009-10). The claim of commission was Rs. 9.88 crore,
which works out to 0.215% of the turnover which is reasonable. The assessee
had declared an income of Rs. 2,007 crores and paid tax of Rs. 682 crores at
the time of filing the return. In the facts and circumstances, the lower
authorities are not justified in concluding that the commission of Rs. 9.88 cr
(which would have a tax impact of Rs. 3.35 cr (approx.) or 0.5% of the tax
paid by the assessee is not genuine.

</pre><p id="p_94">23.     It was contended that it is on the principal as to how many or how
much services he may require from an agent, the purpose of appointing an
agent is to be introduced to a party. Once the agent has introduced a party,
he may continue to get the commission as per the terms and conditions
agreed between the agent and the principal.          In the instant case, all
payments were duly approved by the RBI and were sent through banking
channel.    Survey has taken place in the case of the assessee, but no
contrary evidence was found which may prove that these parties were not the
agents of the assessee. The disallowance was made merely on surmises
and conjectures. It was pointed out that the main condition for deduction of
the expenditure u/s 37 of the Act is that the expenditure should be incurred
wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business and that there is no
condition to the fact that it need to have also been incurred necessarily. It is
the assessee to decide whether any expenditure should be incurred or not.
The assessing officer cannot enter into the shoes of the assessee and direct
the assessee as to what expenditure the assessee should incur.            Thus, it
was contended that the assessee has duly proved the genuineness of the
expenditure incurred and the deduction must be allowed. The Learned D.R.
on the other hand contended that Mitsui &amp; Company Ltd. is originally a
purchaser from assessee. The claim of the assessee that during the current
assessment year, Mitsui &amp; Company Ltd. did not purchase any stock from
the assessee but acted as an agent is not supported by any evidence. The
assessee has not proved any nexus between the agents and the assessee
with reference to the actual sale or export.   The assessee has not produced
any evidence to substantiate the payment of the commission that the

services were rendered by the sales agent. Mere agreement between the
assessee and the foreign company is not sufficient to justify the payment of
the commission. Reliance was placed on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Laxminarayan Madanlal Vs. CIT 86 ITR 439 (Supreme
Court).
</p>
<p id="p_95">24. We have carefully considered the rival submissions along with the order
of the tax authorities below and also the material relied upon by both the
parties. The only issue before us is whether the commission paid by the
assessee has been incurred by the assessee wholly and exclusively for the
purpose of the business of the assessee. Now, coming to the relevant
provision in which the assessee claimed deduction is <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_58">section 37(1)</a> of the
Income Tax Act, 1961. <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_59">Section 37(1)</a> reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">              "Any expenditure (not being expenditure of the nature described
              in <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_60">sections 30</a> to <a href="/doc/1427856/" id="a_61">36</a> and not being in the nature of capital
              expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee), laid out or
              expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the
              business or profession shall be allowed in computing the
              income chargeable under the head "Profits and gains of
              business or profession.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">              Explanation: For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared
              that any expenditure incurred by an assessee for any purpose
              which is an offence or which is prohibited by law shall not be
              deemed to have been incurred for the purpose of business or

              respect of such expenditure"</blockquote>
<p id="p_96">    From the aforesaid section, it is apparently clear that expenditure to be
eligible for deduction u/s 37(1) must fulfill the following conditions:-
</p>
<p id="p_97">   a)      The expenditure should not be covered by the provision of <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_62">section
           30</a> to <a href="/doc/1427856/" id="a_63">36</a> as these sections provide its specific treatment to
           expenditure laid down in those sections.</p><pre id="pre_7">

                                                                 ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

      b)      Expenditure should not be capital in nature.
      c)      It is not to be personal expenditure of the assessee.
      d)      It should be incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of
              business or profession.
      e)      It should be incurred during the previous year.
      f)      It should not be incurred for any purpose which is an offence or
              which is prohibited by law.


24.1           In the case of the assessee, there is no doubt that the commission
</pre><p id="p_98">paid by the assessee is not covered by the provision of <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_64">section 30</a> to <a href="/doc/1427856/" id="a_65">36</a>.
There is also no dispute that the expenditure incurred by the assessee is of
revenue nature and not of capital in nature. There is also no dispute about the
fact that the expenditure has been incurred during the respective previous
years. There is also no dispute that this expenditure has not been incurred
for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law. The
expenditure so incurred by the assessee company cannot be regarded to be
the personal expenditure of the assessee. There is no evidence on record
that these expenses were incurred to meet out the personal needs of the
assessee company. The company is always incorporated for the purpose of
carrying on the business as stipulated under its object clause laid down in the
Memorandum of Association. The company so incorporated is not human
being, which may have personal needs. The company is an artificial person
incorporated under the legislature by having a separate entity. Although by
having a separate entity; it may work as a human being in its own name but it
does not require any expenditure to be incurred, as a human being requires
for meeting out its personal needs. Therefore the expenditure incurred by the
assessee company cannot be regarded to be the personal expenditure of the
assessee. The personal expenditure of the management or the human beings
who are controlling the company cannot be regarded to be the personal
expenses of the assessee company. It may be remuneration or perquisite in
the hands of the management or the human beings but it cannot regard to be
the personal expenses of an incorporated body.
</p>
<p id="p_99">25.        The only dispute in this case relates to the fact whether the commission
paid can be regarded to have been incurred wholly and exclusively for the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                            44</span>

purposes of the business or profession of the assessee company. Before
1939, the phrase used was „Expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of
earning profit‟. The Omnibus provision of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_66">section 37</a> as amended by 1939 Act
allows of „Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such
business/profession‟ as long as no personal/capital element is involved. The
scope of the term „For the purpose of business‟ is surely wider than the term
„for the purpose of earning profit‟. In our opinion the Income Tax Department
cannot prescribe what expenditure an assessee should incur and under what
circumstances. Every businessman knows his interest best. The assessee
may not be a prudent man and yet an expenditure incurred voluntarily for the
purpose of the business would be allowable u/s 37(1).
</p>
<p id="p_100">       The Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of Eastern Investment Ltd. Vs.
CIT, 20 ITR 14 (SC), laid down the following principles for evaluation of
„wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business‟: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">              (i)     Even if the question must be decided on the facts of each
                      case, the concluding decision will be one of law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">               (ii)   It is not necessary that the expenditure be incurred for
                      earning profit.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">              (iii)   It is enough that the money was expended "not of
                      necessity and with a view to directing and immediate
                      benefit to the trade, but voluntarily on the ground of
                      commercial expediency, and in order, indirectly, to
                      facilitate the carrying on of the business."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">              (iv)    No hard and fast rule can be laid down to explain what
                      the word "solely" is meant for.</blockquote>
<p id="p_101">       The expression "wholly and exclusively" used in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_67">section 37(1)</a> does not
mean "necessarily". Ordinarily, it is for the assessee to decide whether any
expenditure should be incurred in the course of its or his business. Such
expenditure may be incurred voluntarily and without any necessity, and if is
incurred for promoting the business and to earn profits, the assessee can
claim deduction therefore under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_68">section 37(1)</a> even though there was no
compelling necessity to incur such expenditure. The Supreme Court, in the
case of CIT Vs Malayalam Plantation (1964) 53 ITR 140 (SC), held that it is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                        45</span>
                                                              ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

not only expenditure which directly results in benefit or advantage to the
assessee‟s business that is entitled to deduction, but also any expenditure
which is incurred with a view to facilitating the carrying on of the business.
</p>
<p id="p_102">26. We do agree with the submissions of the Ld. AR that it is not open to the
department to prescribe what expenditure the assessee should incur and in
what circumstances he should incur that expenditure. Every businessman
knows his interest best as this has been clearly laid down by the Hon‟ble
Apex Court in 91 ITR 544 in the case of CIT Vs Dhanrajgiri Raja Narsinghgiri.
No doubt every businessman is the best judge of his business expediency but
the Assessing Officer in our opinion has the right to know whether the
expenditure has been incurred for business purposes or not or whether it has
been incurred for other extraneous consideration. Similar view has been
taken by the Hon‟ble Rajasthan High Court in the case of Jaipur Electro Pvt.
Ltd. Vs CIT, 134 CTR 237 (Raj). The Hon‟ble Bombay High Court has also
taken the similar view in the case of Ramanand Sagar Vs DCIT, 255 ITR 134
(Bom) in which it was held that the mere fact that the payment has been
made under a contract is not conclusive of expenditure being laid down
wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business. Once doubt arise
about the bonafide nature of the payment, it is necessary to look into the
necessary circumstances such as relationship of the payee to the assessee,
the general standard of similar expenditure in comparable business, the true
worth of the services or goods in question and so forth. It is also open to the
A.O. to question the reality of the expenditure i.e., the true nature of the
payment, the true consideration for it and so forth. Once the A.O. considers
the payment and the purpose to be bonafide, it is not open for him to
substitute his own judgment what is the reasonable quantum of expenditure
for the assessee. The A.O. can only decide whether the expenditure is real,
whether it relates to the business and is wholly spent for that purpose. In
applying the test of commercial expediency, for determining whether the
expenditure was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the
business the reasonableness of the expenditure has to be judged from the
point of view of the businessman and not the Revenue, as held in CIT Vs
Walchand and Co. (P) Ltd. (1967) 65 ITR 381 (SC). The similar view has
been taken in the cases of JK Woollen Manufacturers Vs CIT (1969) 72 ITR


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                        46</span>
                                                            ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

612 (SC); Aluminum Corporation of India Ltd. Vs CIT (1972) 86 ITR 11 (SC)
and CIT Vs Panipat Woollen and General Mills Co. Ltd. (1976) 103 ITR 66
(SC). Considering the true import of the expression "wholly and exclusively" it
was observed by the apex court in Sassoon J Davit and Co. Pvt. Ltd. Vs CIT
(1979) 118 ITR 261, that the same does not mean "necessarily". Ordinarily, it
is for the assessee to decide whether any expenditure should be incurred in
the course of its business. Such expenditure may be incurred voluntarily and
without any necessity and if it is incurred for promoting the business and to
earn profits, the assessee can claim deduction under the relevant provision
even though there was no compelling necessity to incur such expenditure.
The fact that somebody other than the assessee is also benefited by the
expenditure should not come in the way of an expenditure being allowed by
way of deduction u/s 37 of the Act if it otherwise satisfies the tests laid down
by law.     The bill read "any expenditure laid out or expended wholly,
necessarily and exclusively for the purposes of the business or profession
shall be allowed". In view of the protests raised by the taxpayers the word
"necessarily" came to be dropped. It will be also noticed that in CIT Vs
Chandulal Keshavlal and Co. (1960) 38 ITR 601, 610, it was observed as
follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">            "Another fact that emerges from these cases is that if the expense
            is incurred for fostering the business of another only or was made
            by way of distribution of profits or was wholly gratuitous or for
            some improper or oblique purpose outside the course of business
            then the expense is not deductible. In deciding whether a
            payment of money is a deductible expenditure one has to take
            into consideration questions of commercial expediency and the
            principles of ordinary commercial trading.      If the payment or
            expenditure is incurred for the purpose of the trade of the
            assessee it does not matter that the payment may incur to the
            benefit of a third party (Usher‟s Wiltshire Brewery Limited v Bruce
            (1914) 6 Tax cases 399 (HL). Another test is whether the
            transaction is properly entered into as a part of the assessee‟s
            legitimate commercial undertaking in order to facilitate the
            carrying on of its business; and it is immaterial that a third party


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                      47</span>

            also benefits thereby. But in every case it is a question of fact
            whether the expenditure was expended wholly and exclusively for
            the purpose of trade or business of the assessee."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_103">27.    If we apply the principles of the law as enunciated in the various
judgments, we are of the opinion that once the A.O. finds that the assessee
has bonafidely incurred the expenditure for the business, the A.O. cannot
decide the quantum of the expenditure to be incurred by the assessee. In this
case before us the assessing officer has disputed the fact that commission
has been paid for the purpose of the business and also disallowed the said
expenditure by applying the provisions of sec. 40(a)(i) as well as on the basis
of the genuineness of the expenditure incurred. The CIT (A) while holding that
the assessee was not liable to deduct tax in respect of the commission
payment made to the non-resident agents took the view that the assessing
officer was not justified in disallowing the commission payment by invoking
the provision of sec. 40(a)(i). The CIT(A), however, disallowed the
commission paid by the assessee to the foreign non-resident agents by
applying the provisions of sec. 37 as according to him the assessee had not
able to substantiate the claim for payment of commission to non-resident
agents by adducing specific and tangible evidence to demonstrate that the
services were rendered by the sales agents to justify the commission
payment as claimed by the assessee. He, thus, confirmed the order of the
assessing officer for the said disallowance. Now the only issue before us is
whether the assessee had discharged its onus of proving the genuineness of
the expenditure incurred by the assessee or not.
</p>
<p id="p_104">27.1    The documentary evidences by way of agreements with the non-
resident agents and emails exchanged with them in this regard, which were
placed on record of the authorities below and also furnished at page nos. 135
to 156 of the paper book before us, clearly exhibit the nature and extent of
services rendered by those non-resident agents; and the genuineness of the
same cannot be doubted merely on surmises without bringing anything
contrary on record. CIT (A) while rejecting this vital piece of evidence has
merely stated vide para 6.5 of his appellate order that "it is possible that the
assessee may have some kind of business relationship with the above two


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                      48</span>

companies. It is also possible that there may be some correspondence with
the two companies with regard to sales of iron ore abroad. But this shall not
be sufficient justification to prove that the companies abroad have rendered
necessary services for effecting sales so as to justify the claim of
commission." Whereas in our considered view, the contents of the emails
furnished by the assessee, which have been summarized herein above,
clearly show that those were being exchanged with the said two non-resident
agents in actual performance of their services for which they had been
engaged by the assessee as per the respective agreements entered into with
them and for which commission had been paid to them. It is not the case of
the Revenue that the impugned emails were fabricated or forged one. In fact,
the CIT (A) has admitted in his appellate order that „it is possible that there
may some correspondence with the two companies with regard to sale of iron
ore abroad‟, but without going into the merits of the emails exchanged and
without controverting how the same did not exhibit that actual services had
not been rendered by those agents, he merely rejected the claim of the
assessee as if the assessee has not incurred these expenses genuinely for
the purpose of the business. It is cardinal principle of law that a disallowance
cannot be made on mere surmises and conjectures. Where the explanation of
the assessee is bonafide and evidences produced by it further corroborate its
explanation, there is no reason for Revenue to disregard the same on whims
without bringing forth any tangible and cogent material to the contrary.
</p>
<p id="p_105">27.2 The said two non-resident agents had been engaged by the asseseee
in the past and they have been paid commission on sales abroad since last
so many years. There is no law which mandates that a middleman is entitled
to his commission only for the first time when he introduces both the parties
to each other. We agree with the ld. AR that in fact, it is a normal business
practice all over the world that after the parties are introduced the actual work
of a commission agent starts. Here in the instant case of the assessee, the
buyers had been introduced by the said agents in the past.             The emails
exhibit that the agents were deeply involved with the buyers vis-à-vis the
assessee in actual transportation of goods and securing payments to the
assessee.   Emails show that the agent was confirming vessel nomination
from the buyer, which was later accepted by the assessee. Other emails


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                       49</span>
                                                           ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

show the assessee‟s request to the agent for opening of LC and subsequently
requesting the agent for LC amendments and LC acceptances. In other such
set of emails, the assessee is found suggesting amendments to the draft LC
and the agent confirming / suggesting amendments to the LC.             Similarly,
another set of emails show the Agent advising changes in the sale contract
with the buyer and the assessee accepting the same. Yet another exchange
of emails shows the agent is forwarding draft revised Final Adjustment Sheet
and the assessee is suggesting corrections to Final Adjustment Sheets and
requesting the agent to forward the same to the buyer. More so, in one such
set of emails, the assessee is seen asking the agent to convey its message to
the buyer and the agent can be seen conveying message from the buyer to
the assessee. Thus, there remains no doubt in our mind that the non-resident
agents were actually rendering the services as middlemen in terms of their
respective agreements with the assessee and, accordingly, commission was
genuinely paid by the assessee for those services only, i.e., wholly and
exclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_106">      The decision in Laxminarayan Madanlal Vs CIT (1972) 86 ITR 439
(SC), relied upon by the Revenue is totally distinguishable on facts. In that
case the assessee had only produced the agreements and the Hon‟ble apex
court decided that the mere existence of an agreement between the assessee
and its selling agents or payment of certain amounts as commission,
assuming there were such payments, does not bind the ITO to hold that
payment was made exclusively and wholly for the purpose of the assessee‟s
business. Whereas in the instant case, the assessee has placed other
documentary evidences on record besides the agreements, which clearly
demonstrate that the requisite services under those agreements for which
commission was paid to them, had actually been rendered by them. Thus, in
the case of the assessee commercial expediency has clearly been proved.
Therefore, the disallowance of Rs. 9,88,29,729/- for commission paid to non-
resident agents is deleted by allowing this ground of appeal of the assessee.

Companies/Ship owners u/s 40(a)(i) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_69">Income-tax Act</a>. The brief facts of
the case are that the assessee has noted that the assessee has paid an
amount of Rs. 36,05,767/- to its buyer in Pakistan without deduction of tax at
source and therefore he disallowed the same u/s 40(a)(i). In respect of sum
of Rs. 119,70,782/-, the AO noted that the assessee deposited the taxes
deducted on behalf of the shipping companies of the countries with whom
India has no DTAA. The taxes were paid on its PAN on behalf of those
shipping companies but were not paid within the due dates and therefore
said amount was disallowed u/s 40(a)(i). When the matter went before the
CIT(A), CIT(A) confirmed both the disallowances by merging both the
grounds observing as under:
</p><p id="p_108">―7.2   I have considered the facts of the case and the submissions made by
the assessee. The claim of the assessee that the demurrage amount
remitted to the nonresident buyers of iron ore was actually payable by the
said buyers to the ship owners and therefore liable to tax u/s. 172 of the Act,
is without any merit. It has been clearly established that the payments were
made by the assessee to the buyers of iron ore abroad and no tax was either
deducted or deducted belatedly in respect of such payments. The claim that
such payments were ultimately payable to the ship owners will not
change the nature of payments in the hands of the assessee. As far as
the assessee is concerned, it has paid the amounts as demurrage and the
same has been claimed as expenditure. The payments made by the
assessee are clearly covered by the residual limb of <a href="/doc/1486104/" id="a_70">section 40</a> (i) of the
Income tax Act, which refers to ‗Other sum chargeable under this Act'. The
payments made by the assessee are clearly in the nature of payments
chargeable to tax. The assessee has not substantiated its claim that
these payments would have been subsequently paid to the ship owners
by the buyers of iron ore or why such payments are not chargeable to
tax. It is established law that the onus of substantiating the claim lies on the
assessee who makes the claim. Therefore, considering the facts of the case
and the observations made by the assessing officer and considering the fact
that the assessee has completely failed to substantiate its claim as
mentioned above, I find no merit in the claim of the assessee. Accordingly, I
confirm the disallowance of Rs.36,05,767/- and Rs. 1,19,70,782/- made by
the Assessing Officer. This ground of appeal is accordingly, dismissed.

</p><p id="p_110">29.    Before us, the Learned. A.R. contended that the demurrage amount
remitted to the buyers of iron ore in Pakistan amounting to Rs.36,05,767/-
was in respect of amount payable by the said buyers to the ship owners of the
vessels by which relevant iron ore was exported. The assessee has exported
to Pakistani buyer on FOB basis. The foreign buyer engages a ship for taking
delivery of the goods from India. Ship comes to Indian port for a limited period
and when the assessee enables to load the goods on to the ship within the
limited period. In such situations the foreign buyer has to pay demurrage to
the ship owner. The assessee has to compensate the buyer for the same.
The assessee has remitted the said sum to Pakistan buyers which they said
buyer had paid to ship owners in addition to the Freight Charges due to delay
in loading of the ships at the India Port. The said sum was paid as per the
export contract. Tax is to be deducted at source only when income is
chargeable to tax under this Act. So it is necessary to determine whether this
income is taxable or not. Such payment is not in the nature of any income
since this is merely offsetting the additional cost incurred by the said buyer
due to the lack of operational efficiency and non-adherence to the stipulated
timelines (terms of performance) by the seller. In fact this amount must be
considered as an additional discount by the assessee to the buyer. It was
akin to price reduction due to fault in product/service and is equivalent to
discount/rebate which can be adjusted against the sale price. It goes to
reduce the sale price rather than to be considered as an expense in the
hands of the assessee. Further, even if for the sake of argument, it is
assumed that there is an incidence of income in the hands of non-resident
buyers, the same would not attract any tax in India in view of Explanation 1(b)
to <a href="/doc/1220884/" id="a_71">section 9(1)(i)</a> of IT Act, 1961 which provides that in case of non-resident,
no income shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India to him through or from
operations which are confined to the purchase of goods in India for the
purpose of export. It is an admitted fact that the non-resident buyer got the
demurrage through the operation which are confined to purchase of goods,
i.e., in relation to the ship which it had arranged for taking the delivery of the
goods from the assessee/seller from India. Thus, the said income will not be
deemed to accrue or arise in India and therefore the said amount is not
taxable in India and is not liable to the tax deduction at source. Presuming

without admitting, if the said amount is considered as demurrage payment
instead of compensation, in that case demurrage charges are liable to tax u/s
172(8) of the Act in the hands of ship owners. In this regard, it is stated that
<a href="/doc/1497178/" id="a_72">section 172(8)</a> states that the amount mentioned in 172(2) includes
demurrage charges. <a href="/doc/695450/" id="a_73">Section 172(2)</a> provides that where a ship carries
passengers, goods, etc., then 7.5% of the amount paid or payable on account
of such carriage to the owner or character on this behalf shall be deemed to
be income accruing in India to the owner or charterer. Thus, as per <a href="/doc/1497178/" id="a_74">section
172(8)</a>, the amount of demurrage will also be considered for this purpose, i.e.,
for computing its taxable income. Thus, the demurrage stands considered as
part of Freight, i.e., the payment made u/s 172(2) of the Act. Reliance is
placed on CBDT Circular No. 723 of 1995 which explains that <a href="/doc/1195538/" id="a_75">section 194C</a>
and <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_76">195</a> to tax deduction at source are not applicable to the <a href="/doc/1497178/" id="a_77">section 172</a>.
Clauses 5 of the Circular states that even the payment to the agent of the
non-resident ship owners will also not attract TDS. The demurrage paid by
the assessee to the non-resident buyer would in turn have been paid by the
buyer to the ship-owners. The Freight including demurrage was taxable in the
hands of ship owner u/s 172 of the Act. Thus, the amount can be treated as
paid to the agent of the ship owner. Even in that case the assessee was not
liable to deduct TDS as mentioned in clause 5 of Circular No. 723 (supra).
Thus, when the amount covered under <a href="/doc/1497178/" id="a_78">section 172</a> is not liable to TDS u/s
195, then no disallowance u/s 40(a)(ia) can be made.
</p>
<p id="p_111">29.1   For the sum of Rs. 1,19,70,782/-, it was contended that the assessee
has export sales contract with the buyer on CIF basis. The assessee engages
a ship on its own and paid the Freight directly to ship owners which are also
non-residents. Sometimes there is delay in loading the ship within the pre
agreed time line which results into payment of demurrage by the assessee to
such ship owners. The CIT (A) did not deal with this amount separately but
got it merged with payment made to Pakistani buyer without appreciating the
defect of these payments were entirely different from demurrage reimbursed
to Pakistani buyer. The said amount was paid to foreign shipping companies.
U/s 172 demurrage is to receive the same treatment as Freight payment the
assessee has not deducted any tax on these payments but in some cases the
assessee assisted ship owners in discharging their legal obligation by making

payment to the department for and on behalf of such ship owners and not as
TDS. Assessing Authority misunderstood that the assessee has deducted the
tax and deposited it. In the earlier year also similar payments were made
without TDS and were allowed as deduction. Circular No. 723 of 1995 is very
clear that <a href="/doc/1195538/" id="a_79">section 194C</a> and <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_80">195</a> are not applicable to <a href="/doc/1497178/" id="a_81">section 172</a> which is a
self contained code. Thus it was contended that since the provision of 195 is
not applicable and the payments are not covered under <a href="/doc/420239/" id="a_82">section 40(a)(i)</a> and
therefore the disallowance be deleted.
</p>
<p id="p_112">30.    The Ld. DR on the other hand contended that demurrage charges are
liable to tax in India u/s 172(8) of the Act. The assessee when making the
payment to the non-resident is bound to deduct tax at source u/s 195 of the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_83">Income-tax Act</a>. Having failed so, the disallowance has rightly been sustained
by the CIT(A) u/s 40(a)(i) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_84">Income-tax Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_113">31.   We have carefully considered the rival submissions and perused the
material on record. This is a fact that the assessee has paid the demurrage
charges to the non-resident in respect of delay in loading the ship. We find
that the sum of Rs. 36,05,767/- was reimbursed by the assessee to the
foreign buyer to compensate the foreign buyer for paying demurrage to the
ship owner when ship came to Indian port and the assessee could not load
the goods on to the ship within the limited time period. The export sales were
made to the foreign Pakistani buyer on FOB basis. In view of the contract with
the Pakistani buyer specifically clause 11(d), in our opinion, the assessee is
bound to compensate the Pakistani buyer in respect of demurrage paid by the
Pakistani buyer to the ship owner. This payment in our opinion can be
regarded to be the expenditure incurred by the assessee for the sales of the
goods. We do not agree with the Ld. AR that this payment was akin to price
deduction due to fault in product/service and is equivalent to discount/rebate
which can be adjusted against the sale price.

towards the demurrage incurred through the operation which are confined to
the purchase of the goods, i.e. in relation to the ship which it had arrange for
taking the delivery of the goods from the assessee/seller from India. In our
opinion this income cannot be deemed to accrue or arise in India in the hands
of the foreign buyer and therefore it cannot be taxable in India and is not
liable to tax deduction at source. On this basis, no disallowance can be made
u/s 40(a)(ia) and accordingly we delete the disallowance of Rs. 36,05,767/-.

demurrage liable to tax in India u/s 172(8) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_86">I.T. Act</a> and have been
incurred by the assessee for making payment to the shipping company

</blockquote><p id="p_116">33.   From the perusal of this circular, it is apparently clear that the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1195538/" id="a_103">section 194C</a> and <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_104">195</a> relating to tax deduction at source are not
applicable where the provisions of <a href="/doc/1497178/" id="a_105">section 172</a> are applicable. The circular
issued by the CBDT is binding on the department. In view of the circular in
our opinion the assessee is not obliged to deduct TDS on the payment made
as demurrage charges and the demurrage charges are also liable to be taxed
u/s 172 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_106">Income-tax Act</a>. The assessee, since is not liable to deduct tax
at source, no question arise for making any disallowance u/s 40(a)(i).

treated as freight in view of specific provision of <a href="/doc/1497178/" id="a_109">section 172(8)</a>. We have
already held in the preceding paragraph that in view of circular number 723

deduction at source are not applicable to the income which is chargeable to
tax u/s 172. In view of this circular the assessee was not obliged to deduct tax
at source on the demurrage paid to the shipping owners during the year.
Since the provision of TDS were not applicable, therefore no disallowance
can be sustained u/s 40(a)(ia). We therefore, set aside the order of the CIT(A)
on these issues and delete the disallowance of Rs.36,05,767/- and Rs.
1,19,70,782/-. Thus the ground nos. 3 &amp; 4 are allowed.

<p id="p_118">33.2. The ground no. 5 relates to the disallowance of education and higher
education cess amounting to Rs.19,72,00,814/-. The assessee claimed this
cess paid by him as deduction as business expenditure.           The assessing
officer hold that this cess is collected by the revenue as part of income-tax
and in view of <a href="/doc/1486104/" id="a_112">section 40(ic)</a>&amp;(i), this amount cannot be allowed as an
expenditure. When the matter went before the CIT(A), CIT(A) confirmed the
disallowance by holding as under:

      Higher Secondary Education Cess is paid under the law for providing
      finance for basic, secondary, and Higher Secondary Education and
      therefore, such payment was for the purpose of the business is without
      any substance. The fact remains that the Education Cess and
      Secondary &amp; Higher Secondary Education Cess are collected as
      part of Income Tax and Fringe Benefit Tax. The fact that the cess is
      applied for the purpose of promoting basic education and higher
      secondary education will not change the nature of the levy in the hands
      of the assessee. The amounts collected by way of Education Cess and
      Secondary &amp; Higher Secondary Education Cess forms an integral part
      of the direct tax collection and therefore such payments are clearly

             8.2    Further it is also admitted that the assessee had claimed

      Secondary &amp; Higher Secondary Education Cess, by a separate letter
      dated 5.10.2011, after filing the return. This is a clear case where the
      assessee had claimed deduction after the return was filed. The
      claim was neither made in the original return of income nor in any
      revised return of income was filed in this regard. Therefore, even
      without going into the merits of the claim, the same cannot be allowed
      as a deduction following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
      in the case of Goetze (India) Ltd. Vs. CIT, 284 ITR 323. In this case
      the Court has held that where an assessee has claimed deduction
      after the return has been filed, the assessing authority has no powers
      to entertain such claim made otherwise than by a way of a revised
      return. Therefore, respectfully following the decision of the Hon'ble

<p id="p_120">35.    We heard the rival submissions and carefully considered the same. In
our opinion, education cess and secondary higher education cess levied by
the assessee has been collected as part of the income-tax and the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1918609/" id="a_115">section 40(a)(ic)</a> &amp; (ii) are clearly applicable and the assessee is not
entitled for the deduction. The said payment is not a fee but is a tax. In case
of fees, payment is made against getting certain benefit or services while tax
is imposed by the Government and is levied for which the person who pay the
tax is not promised in return to get any benefit or service. The assessee is
not getting any benefit or services in return by making the payment towards
the education cess and secondary higher education cess. Therefore, it cannot
be said that it is an expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively for the
purpose of the business and is not part of tax. We do not find any infirmity or
illegality in the order of the CIT(A) while confirming the disallowance made by
the assessing officer in this regard. Thus, disallowance of Rs.19,72,00,814/-
is hereby confirmed. Thus, this ground stand dismissed.

assessee u/s 10B of the Act in respect of its 100% export oriented units at
Amona in Goa, at Chitradurga in Karnataka and at Codli in Goa. During the
year, the assessee claimed deduction in respect of 3 units located at Amona,
Chitradurga &amp; Codli respectively. Of these 3 units, the Codli unit is registered
as an EOU from the initial stages of setting up while the other two units at
Amona and Chitradurga were originally set up in domestic tariff areas, which

business of mining and export of iron ore and manufacture and sale of
metallurgical coke. The assessing officer disallowed the said claims made
u/s 10B of the Act in respect of all the units. The main reason given by the AO
was that there is no production or manufacture involved in the activities
carried out in the units. The assessing officer took the view in respect of
Amona and Chitradurga unit that these units started commencement of the
manufacture in the year 1985 and 1994 respectively and therefore, cannot be

treated as new units eligible for the benefit u/s 10B merely on the ground that
there was expansion of these units by way of purchase of new plant and
machinery in the years 2002-03 &amp; 2005-06 respectively. In respect of ultra
fines recovery plant at Codli, the assessing officer gave the reasons mainly
that (a) the said unit does not fulfill the conditions of manufacture or
production as required u/s 10B (b) no satisfactory evidence has been
produced regarding the date of commencement of manufacture or production
</p><p id="p_122">(c) The fresh approval of the board is not available to the unit and (d) the unit
is not debiting any purchase cost in respect of the purchase of wastage from
other units. In respect of three units in general, the assessing officer held (a)
the iron ore processing cannot be treated as "manufacture or production in
view of the insertion of new <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_116">section 2(29BA)</a> defining the meaning of
manufacture/production" (b) the assessee had not maintained separate books
of accounts for the EOU units and for non-EOU units and setting up of a unit
in the old mines which are already being operated by the assessee cannot be
treated as new unit. The assessee went in appeal before the CIT(A). The
CIT(A) dealt with the deduction in respect of each of the units separately.
The CIT(A) confirmed the order of the assessing officer by sustaining the
disallowance of the deduction claimed u/s 10B in respect of Amona Unit,
Codli Unit and Chitradurga Unit. The CIT(A) as per the discussion held
under para 10.4 to 11.7 took the view that no new unit has come into
existence at the Amona plant during the year 2002-03. Similarly, no new unit
came into existence at Chitradurga plant during the year 2005-06 or in the
subsequent year by summarizing as under, under para 12 of its order.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                       60</span>
                                                           ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

      during the year 2005-06 or in the subsequent years. It is also a case
      of reconstruction of the existing unit involving repair and renovation of
      the old structure and other plant and machinery. Therefore the
      assessee is not eligible to claim deduction under <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_117">section 10B</a> in
      respect of both its units at Amona and Chitradurga for the
      assessment year 2009-10, which is much beyond the period of 10
      conservative years, as prescribed in this section.
</p>
<p id="p_128">37.   The CIT(A) has also discussed various case laws as relied by the
assessee under para 30 of its order. The CIT(A) has also held that the unit at
Chitradurga was earlier in the domestic traffic area. During the financial year
2008-09, the assessee wanted to convert the unit as an EOU and submitted
its application in the concerned authorities dated 15.2.2008 and as per
instruction no.2 dated 9.3.2009 of the CBDT, the approval granted by the
Development Commissioner in such cases will be considered as valid. One
such approval is ratified by the board of approval for EOU scheme. The
approval was ratified by the Board on 14.1.11. Therefore, for the assessment
year 2009-10, there was no approval of the board. CIT(A) ultimately took the
view that the assessee was not engaged in manufacturing or production. The
iron ore at Amona and Chitradurga plants of the assessee are not entirely
from the iron ore extracted by the assessee from its mines. Part of the iron
ores fed to the beneficiation unit at Amona is purchased by the company.
Mines of the assessee from which iron ores are fed to the Amona and
Chitradurga plants are very old which are being exploited by the company
since long. The CIT(A) took the view that since the mines of the assessee
are not new, it cannot be said that they formed part of the undertaking at
Amona and Chitradurga, even if these two units are considered to be new. It
was further held that the Amona and Chitradurga units cannot be said to have
been engaged in extraction activities, therefore, the activities of Amona and
Chitradurga plants cannot be held as manufacturing or production keeping in
view the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the assessee which
has been followed by the I.T.A.T. bench in the case of M/s. Chowgule and
Company Ltd (I.T.A No. 162 &amp; 184/PNJ/2006 and Misc. Application No.
23/PNJ/2007) and in the case of V.S. Dempo and Company Pvt. Ltd. (ITA
No. 44/PNJ/2009). It was held that alternatively if the mines from which iron
ore is supplied to the processing plants are considered to form part of the
undertakings at Amona and Chitradurga, such undertakings cannot be thus
held to be new undertakings in view of the old mines forming part of such

undertakings. CIT(A) ultimately under para 15.3 held that the activities of the
assessee in two units at Amona and Chitradurga would not amount to
manufacture by observing as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">       "Therefore, in the present case of the assessee, the question whether
       the activities of the two EOUs at Amona and Chitradurga would
       amount to `Manufacture' or not has to be necessarily answered by
       referring to the definition of `Manufacture' provided under <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_118">section
       2(29BA)</a> of the Income Tax Act, which is applicable for the assessment
       year under reference. Considering this definition, it is sufficiently clear
       that the iron ore processing activities of the assessee at the EOUs at
       Amona and Chitradurga do not amount to `manufacture'. Therefore,
       the claim of the assessee to adopt a liberal view for interpreting the
       definition of `manufacture' cannot be accepted.‖

37.1. The CIT(A) is of the view that the percentage of the old machinery in
the case of both the units will certainly exceed 20% of the total value of the
plant and machinery.     Referring to the application of the assessee made
before the Development Commissioner, it was noted by the CIT(A) that the
applications were for conversion of existing DTA units to EOU units and not
for establishment of the new undertaking and ultimately on this basis, the
CIT(A) held that the assessee is not eligible to claim deduction u/s 10<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_119">B of the
Income-tax Act</a> in respect of Amona and Chitradurga units. In respect of Codli
unit the CIT (A) confirmed the finding of the AO that there is no manufacturing
or production or article or thing. What is fed as raw material to the Codli unit is
iron ore and what comes out after processing it also iron ore, the only minor
difference being in the iron content of the material. The CIT (A) relied on the
decision of the Supreme Court in assessee‟s own case 271 ITR 331 for the
proposition that extraction and processing of iron ore together constitutes
production. CIT (A) also held that the assessee company has not produced
any satisfactory evidence with regard to date/year of commencement of
business of the unit. Ultimately the disallowance of the claim of the assessee
u/s 10B in respect of all the three units was sustained.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_129">38. The Learned. A.R. contended that the assessee has 9 units, out of which
it claimed exemption u/s 10B of the Act in respect of profit derived from 3
units. The profits from the 3 units i.e. the EOUs are in the same proportion as
to the other units. Profits from EOU were 48% on sales of Rs.931/- crores
while profit from other units were Rs.1,706/- crores on sale of Rs.3,352/-
crores. Thus the profits from the EOU were 48% while from the other units

were 51%. For the sake of convenience and as argued by both the sides, we
would like to deal with ground relating to exemption u/s 10B in respect of
each of the three units owned by the assessee separately.
</p>
<p id="p_130">38.1 In respect of the Amona plant the assessee claimed exemption u/s 10B
for a sum of Rs. 2,57,23,14,771/-, the learned AR contended that the plant at
Amona was set up in 1985 in Bicholim Taluk. Over the years the plant was
eroded and outdated. During the financial year 2002-03 after complete re-
vamping of the earlier plant, a new plant was set up by installing new
machines alongside using some parts of the old machines. The cost of the
new plant and machineries for all major/critical processes and the civil
structures amounted to Rs.3,96,10,020/- the WDV of the old plant and
machinery used in the new undertaking was Rs.26,17,714/- which was
around 6.7% of the new plant &amp; machinery. Attention was drawn to paper
book Vol-I (45-48). He submitted that the details represent the part of the
depreciation schedule filed along with the return and the books of the
assessee were not rejected during the Financial Year: 2003-04. During the
Financial Year 2008-09, the DTA unit set up in Financial Year 2002-03 was
converted into 100% EOU in terms of approval from the O/O Development
Commissioner, Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, Mumbai, vide approval no.
PER:44(2007)IAII/39-07-08 dated 28-03-2008 and the same was ratified by
the Board of Approval in its meeting held on 03-06-2008 (page 41-44 of the
first paper book). The premises of the undertaking were bonded and licence
no.4/2008 dated 23-07-2008 was issued u/s 58 of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_120">Customs Act</a> at page
280 of the paper book. The conversion of the DTA unit into EOU unit became
final on the receipt of Customs licence No.4/2008 dated 23-03-2008 duly
bonding the premises. The unit started functioning as EOU. The information
for the same was given to the Development Commissioner vide letter dated
24-07-2008. For this attention was drawn to page 64 of paper book Vol.I. It
was submitted that the assessee accordingly made the claim u/s 10<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_121">B of the
IT Act</a> during the year. This was the 7th year of existence of the unit and the
deduction u/s 10B was claimed for the first time. In the months of November
and December, 2011, the Assessing Officer made certain enquiries which
were replied. Attention was drawn to pages 58 to 113 of paper book Vol.I.
On 23-12-2011 a survey u/s 133A was conducted in the premises of all the

units. The survey only re-confirmed that initially a unit was set up during the
year 1985 and major renovation and modernization took place during the
Financial year 2002-03. During renovation and modernization, it was
submitted that not only the new/latest technology on the main process of the
machines i.e., screening / Schenck (Australia) Banana Screening machine
was introduced but the capacity of the plant was also enhanced from 1 MTPA
(Million Tons Per Annum) to aprox. 2 MTPA with further flexibility to increase
the same further. Our attention was drawn towards the production data from
the year 1999-2000 to 2000-01 submitting that production has increased
drastically which was 9.17 lacs MT in 1999-2000 and was 10.38 lacs MT in
2000-01. It was pointed out that during the year 2002-03 the production was
11.29 lac MT and this year was a transition year.    Attention was also drawn
to page-239 of the paper book, which gives the details of production data of
few years after set-up. These are reproduced as under:

Kerkar both technocrats by profession were recorded. This statement is
available at page 728-731 and 714 to 716 of additional paper book Vol.I.
The Assessing Officer took a view that the Amona unit was set up in the year
1985 and alleged that it was not a new unit but merely a re-construction and
disallowed the claim of the assessee u/s 10<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_122">B of the IT Act</a>.       Several papers
were impounded during the survey, but copies of these papers were made

before the CIT(A). The Assessing Officer disallowed the claim made u/s 10<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_123">B
of the IT Act</a>, as the main reason was that there was no production or
manufacture involved in the activities carried out in the unit and the unit is old
one.   In respect of the averment of the Assessing Officer that the said unit is

submitted that the Assessing Officer would not have understood the facts
properly and therefore, a wrong interpretation of the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Sesa Goa Ltd., 271 ITR 331 was taken. As per the
Assessing Officer the ratio of the aforesaid case that both extraction and
processing of crude ore are necessary to make a case of production whereas
in High Court decision which was confirmed by the Supreme Court on appeal
by the department no such reasoning was recorded anywhere. In fact the
references were made to three High Court‟s decision in which it was held that
the extraction itself was production. The famous case of Chowgule (Supreme
Court) in sales tax matter was also distinguished in this case. In fact based
upon Sesa Goa (Supreme Court) several cases have been delivered by the
Supreme Court including „Oracle‟ where one simple process of copying
software onto a blank CD was also held to be production. Reliance was

to run the old unit. The assessee has to take up immediate action for setting
up the new plant during 2002-03.     Substantial capital of Rs.6.5 crores was
inducted while the old machinery worth Rs.26.00 lakhs was used and no
identity of the old unit was retained and the capacity of the plant was
substantially increased from 1 MTPA to 2 MTPA and further in-built flexibility
to expand thereafter which took place during the financial year 2008-09.            If
the new unit was not set up, the existing business of the assessee would
have come to an end.       All major machineries were installed afresh with
capacities more than doubled and with scope to make further expansion. The
earlier physical layout/foundations were totally dismantled and in place of the
same, new foundation were erected. The Assessing Officer merely referred
to the usage of the word „renovation‟ in various communications exchanged
between the assessee and the Village Panchayat of Amona whereas he
completely ignored the newspaper clipping which appeared in the local
Marathi newspaper „Pudari‟ dated 31/7/2002 which carried a full news item in
relation to on-going construction activities at the Amona plant of the assessee
and referred the same as illegal construction of a new plant as also the
„Panchanama‟ conducted by the Amona Gram Panchayat (page 299).                  The
Panchanama was carried on 7/9/2002 stating that it was a new construction
having steel fabrication with RCC foundation.

<p id="p_137">38.7 The production process employed at Amona unit before setting up of
the new plant during financial year 2002-03 and financial year 2005-06
respectively clearly shows that the process underwent a sweeping change
and latest screening technology was introduced (Page-393). The details of
major machinery and equipments employed used in the said unit in the old

      the basic cost of plant &amp; machinery in case of an iron ore beneficiation
      plant is incurred on raising steel and concrete structures on which the
      conveyor belts, crushers, screens and other such equipments are
      installed. The CIT(A) overlooked the basic composition of production
      apparatus required in an iron ore beneficiation plant and made the
      above naive assertion in a casual manner without any real
      understanding of the actual production mechanism involved.                 It is
      erroneous to compare the number of machines and equipments to
      conclude whether substantial expansion took place, when the Act itself
      provides the threshold limit of 20% for the said purpose in Explanation

      Appellant‟s explanation

      It is an admitted fact by the assessee that in view of difficulty faced by
      it in identifying scrap of different machinery items, it opted not to make
      any deletion from the assets. Instead, the value realised from sale of
      scrap was offered to full tax by declaring it separately as „other income‟
      in the profit &amp; loss accounts during the reconstruction period. This
      practice was adopted since some machines were either re-used to
      make out new or modified machines and their steel frames and
      structures   were   also   re-used    (wherever    technically)     possible
      considering its strength). Moreover, it needs to be appreciated that by
      adopting to this treatment, the assessee subjected itself to a
      disadvantageous position since had it made the deletion of scrap value
      from the block of assets, it would have achieved lesser depreciation
      but would have escaped full tax that it paid on the scrap value
      received. But in any case, the written down value of old machines was
      substantially lower than the threshold limit of 20% prescribed in
      Explanation 2 to sec.80-I(2) read with Explanation to sec.10b(2).

</p>
<p id="p_158">      Appellants explanation

      This observation is patently wrong. The input is crude ore whereas the
      output is lumps and fines. Not only the physical appearance is
      absolutely different but even the commercial name and usage are both
      far different. There is practically no use of crude ore but the usage of
      lumps and fins is absolutely essential for steel making industry.                It
      seems that the CIT(A) got misled by the loose usage of the term iron
      ore without verifying the actual facts.
</p>
<p id="p_159">      Moreover during the course of hearing before the Hon‟ble ITAT, the
      assessee company showed samples of the input in the form of crude
      ore and the output in the form of iron ore and lumps. The activity was
      explained in detail which encompass transportation of crude ore,
      crushing, screening and washing, stacking, loading in barges, river
      transportation to the port and export in ships. The assessee has also
      mentioned that it would be willing to show the nature of activity inviting
      the Hon‟ble Members for a site visit in order to have on the spot
      understanding of factual matters. It was requested that though the
      claim was made u/s 10B in respect its three units Amona, Chitradurg
      and Gadia Sado (Codli) but considering the non-feasible to inspect all
      the three units, the nearest unit, Amona 100% EOU may be taken up
      for the site visit. The Hon‟ble Members asked the Departmental
      Representative also to accompany the site visit. Accordingly, a site
      visit to Amona unit was arranged for the Hon‟ble Members on 19-12-
      2012 in the afternoon. From the tax department the Standing Counsel.
      JCIT, ACIT and inspectors together with ITAT Bench Clerk

                                                    ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

The judgment in CIT Vs Sesa Goa Ltd., (2004) 271 ITR 331 was
delivered by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in assessee‟s own case. The
facts were that the assessee owned transport vehicles like dumpers,
etc. which were employed in conveying crude ore from its mines to the
beneficiation plant for processing and thus, declared as plant and
machinery. It was explained that instead of installing the conventional
conveyor belt system from the mines to the beneficiation plant for
conveying crude ore, the assessee had chosen the cost effective way
of conveying it through an on-wheel conveying system i.e. through
dumpers etc., and which machines did not have any other use.
Therefore, for all practical purposes these were not vehicles as
understood in the ordinary sense, but plant and machinery in the case
of the assessee. Accordingly, the assessee claimed investment
allowance u/s 32A on the said assets, but it was disallowed by the
assessing authority under the averment that those assets had not been
used in the manufacturing process. After passing through the course
of appellate proceedings before the CIT(A) and the ITAT the matter
travelled to the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_163">The Hon‟ble Panaji Bench of the High Court of Bombay, while
answering the question „Whether on the facts and circumstances of the
case, the ITAT was justified in holding that the assessee is entitled to
deduction of investment allowance u/s 32<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_128">A of the IT Act</a>, 1961 in
respect of machinery used in mining activity, ignoring the fact that the
assessee is engaged in extraction and processing of iron ore not
amounting to manufacture or production of any article or thing?", held
as under (266 ITR 126):
</p>
<p id="p_164">At the end of last but one para of the order.... ―<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_129">The Act</a> also contains
internal evidence to show that the legislature has treated raw ore
differently from processed ore. A Division Bench of this court in CIT
Vs Emirates Commercial Bank Ltd., (2003) 262 ITR 55 has given the
benefit even in respect of data processing done on computers. In
other words, the legislation being a beneficial piece of legislation, an
expanded meaning should be so given and has to be given.‖




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                               74</span>
                                                      ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

Thus, the Hon‟ble Bombay High Court ratified the position that raw ore
was different from processed ore. Further, while agreeing with the
decision reached on 262 ITR 55 (supra) in respect of the data
processing that the same amounted to production, it has basically
decided that the processing of iron ore also amounts to production
following the same analogy.      It can be so concluded since the data
processing on computers does not involve extraction of an article or
thing from earth, and, therefore, the reliance of the said judgment here
can only be in respect of processing of the ore and not extraction of the
ore.
</p>
<p id="p_165">Further, in the last para of their order, the Hon‟ble Bombay High Court
held..... ―The ore has to be extracted or raised from the earth in which it
is embedded and has to be brought to the surface. What is brought to
the surface is something new which comes into existence as an article
or thing.   If that be the case, winning or extracting of ore would fall
within the expression ‗production'.    Thus, on the question put before
the Hon'ble High Court whether extraction and processing of iron ore
amounted to manufacture or production, it decided that processing of
ore was production and also that extraction of ore was also
production.‖

However, the department preferred further appeal before the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court, where the same question as put before the High Court
was re-examined by the Apex Court.        The Apex Court held as under
(271 ITR 331)....
</p>
<p id="p_166">―The reasoning given by the High Court, in the decisions noted by us
earlier, is in our opinion, unimpeachable. This court had, as early as in
1961 in Chrestian Mica Industries Ltd. Vs State of Bihar (1961) 12 STC
150 defined the word production albeit in connection with the Bihar
Sales Tax Act, 1947. The definition was adopted from the meaning
ascribed to the word in the Oxford English Dictionary as meaning
‗amongst other things that which is produced, a thing that results from
any action, process or effort, a product, product of human activity or
effort. From the wide definition of the word production, it has to follow
that mining activity for the purpose of production of mineral ores would

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                75</span>
                                                     ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

come within the ambit of the word production, since ore is a thing
which is the result of human activity or effort. It has also been held by
this court in CIT Vs N.C. Budharaja &amp; Co., (1993) 204 ITR 412 that the
word production is much wider than the word ‗manufacture'‖.
</p>
<p id="p_167">We are therefore, of the opinion that extraction and processing of iron
ore amounts to production within the meaning of the word in <a href="/doc/1670335/" id="a_130">section
32A(2)(b)(iii)</a> of the Act and consequently, the assessee is entitled to
the benefit of sec.32A(1) of the Act.‖.
</p>
<p id="p_168">It must be appreciated that the Apex Court categorically expressed that
the reasoning given by the High Court on the meaning of word
production as unimpeachable in its opinion, and since a common
phase „extraction and processing of iron ore‟ had been employed in the
question. It was also answered in the singular manner only by the
Apex Court.     However, what must be understood is that the Hon‟ble
High Court in 266 ITR 126 nowhere held that both extraction and
processing of ore shall have to be undertaken together to constitute
production. Therefore, it cannot be understood that the Apex Court
decided the issue in any different manner and it must be safely
concluded that extraction of iron ore and processing of iron ore were
independently held as production. Accordingly, the assertion of the
department that extraction and processing should both be undertaken
together in order to pass the test of production is just misgiving and
against the spirit of the above decisions of the Hon‟ble Bombay High
Court and the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_169">Furthermore, even in the case of Chowgule &amp; Co., Ltd., relied upon by
the department, it must be appreciated the order dated 12/07/2007 of
the Hon‟ble Panaji Bench of ITAT in ITA No.162/Pnj/2006 was
immediately rectified by the same Bench in Misc. Appn. moved by the
assessee inMA.NO.23/PNJ/2007 order dated 19/7/2007 where it was
finally held;   We hold that the assessee-company itself is extracting
the entire iron ores and thereafter processing the same, and therefore,
entitled for the deduction u/s 10B as held by the Supreme Court in the
case of Sesa Goa.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                76</span>
<p id="p_170">                                                     ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

The need for rectification arose since in the original order the Hon‟ble
ITAT had held that the assessee was only processing iron ore but was
not extracting the ore (Pl. See para-5 order dated 19/7/2007 in MA) But
the Hon‟ble ITAT found during the MA proceedings (in the light of sub-
para 8 in para-4 of order dated 19/07/2007) that the assessee-
company was extracting as well as processing the ore, and therefore,
10B deduction was allowed to the assessee company.
</p>
<p id="p_171">It must be understood that EOU and assessee have different meaning.
IT is not necessary that both the extraction of iron ore and processing
of iron ore must be carried out by the EOU itself to claim exemption u/s
10B. It must be understood that the mines and processing units are
always at a safe distance with each other because mine blasting would
otherwise disturb the functioning of the processing units.       EOU unit
has to be a custom bonded area but the mines are spread over
kilometers in area which cannot be made custom bonded. Thus, the
mines cannot be made part of the EOU unit in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_172">However, even if the extraction of iron ore is carried out by the
assessee at mines owned by him or by third party (which cannot be
covered under EOU) unit as explained above) and only the processing
is carried out by EOU unit, even then the assessee will be eligible for
10B deduction for the said EOU as the assessee is extracting as well
as processing the ore.   This is the decision of the Chowgule because
in that case the EOU was using the iron ore extracted by the said
company from its own mines and from the mines of Antao Brothers
which could not be part of the EOU unit of that assessee is any
manner as explained above.
</p>
<p id="p_173">Thus, the basic condition for allowing exemption u/s 10B by holding the
extraction and processing of iron ore as production is that the
assessee should carry on both these activities by itself and it cannot be
understood to mean that both these activities should be carried on by
the EOU itself.
</p>
<p id="p_174"> In other words the Hon‟ble ITAT did not hold that a EOU qualifying for
deduction u/s 10B must undertake both these activities together, rather


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                               77</span>
                                                           ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

      it was held that if the assessee extracted the ore by itself and also
      undertook processing of the ore as its EOU, it would qualify for
      deduction u/s 10B for its ore processing EOU.
</p>
<p id="p_175">      In the present case of the assessee also, there is no dispute that the
      assessee-company namely M/s Sesa Goa Ltd., also undertook both
      the activities of extraction and processing and has correctly claimed
      the deduction u/s 10B in respect of profits arising from processing of
      ore at its EOUs. Thus, the parameters laid down in the above case of

      percentage of old equipments used in the new units even the assets

</p>
<p id="p_177">      The CIT(A) has asserted that to determine the percentage of the old

      machinery employed in the mines of the company are taken into
      consideration, then the percentage of old machine will certainly be
      exceeding the threshold limit of 20% as prescribed.             CIT(A) has
      justified his averments by relying on his interpretation of the judgment
      of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in CIT Vs Sesa Goa Ltd., (004) 271 ITR

      comprise of the extraction a well as the processing of iron ore.

<p id="p_178">      Appellant‟s explanation

      The assessee has claimed deduction u/s 10B in respect of its
      beneficiation units only and not the mines.      Therefore, there is no
      rationale in clubbing the machines employed at the mines with those
      owned by the units for the purpose of calculating the percentage of old
      equipments used in the new unit. Further, the CIT(A)‟s assertion that
      if the value of plant and machinery employed in the mines of the

      machine will certainly be exceeding the threshold limit of 20% as
      prescribed, is nothing but presumptuous.        Moreover, it has already
      been explained that in Hon‟ble Supreme Court „s judgment in271 ITR
      331 read with Bombay High Court‟s ruling in 266 ITR 126 in the case
      of Sesa Goa Ltd., it has actually decided that extraction or ore and
      processing of ore are independently held as production‟.
</p>
<p id="p_179">      Alternatively, by reference to the decision of the Tata Tea Ltd. Vs ACIT
      (2011) 338 ITR 285 (Ker.) and Madhu Jayanti Intl. Ltd., Vs DCIT
      (2012) 137 ITD 377 (Kol.)(SB), it was contended that in case of an
      EOU regard has to be given to the definition of manufacture as
      contained in EXIM policy.       Even if the word manufacture had been
      inserted in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_131">IT Act</a>, it is submitted that it would not deter to draw the
      definition of production from EXIM policy. As it is settled law, that
      production is wider than the word manufacture and every case of
      manufacture can be included in production.         The definition given in
      EXIM policy for manufacture would stand good for the word
      „production‟. Reference was invited to page 174 to 179 of paper book
      Vol.I.

which the fabrication charges etc., were paid o the said parties.

<p id="p_211">Moreover, if the impugned bills did pertain to ordinary repairs, as

adverse comment was ever made in respect thereto by the AO. Thus,
the same stands accepted in scrutiny of the department. Accordingly,
it is submitted that the CIT(A) had no authority to travel back to those
earlier years to hold otherwise that the impugned bills showed that the
related expenditure was in the nature of repairs. This was beyond the
jurisdiction of the CIT(A) and therefore, the said finding is perverse and
has no legal footing.

<p id="p_213">At page 67 as per CIT(A) vide para 11.7: Production data shows that it
increased without investment in plant &amp; machinery.
</p>
<p id="p_214">Production increased from 5.4 metric tons in the year 1999-2000 to
11.49 metric tons in the year 2004-05 without any investment in plant &amp;
machinery. Similarly, the production increased from 10.71 metric tons
in the year 2006-07 to 21.26 metric tons in the year 2007-08 without
any investment in plant &amp; machinery during the year 2007-08.
</p>
<p id="p_215">Appellant‟s explanation

The conclusion drawn by the CIT(A) that without any addition of plant
&amp; machinery, production had sizably increased in the year 2004-05
from that in the year 1999-2000 and asserting that therefore, in the
later years increase in production could not be attributed to installation
of new plant &amp; machinery is totally misplaced. CIT(A) has ignored the
basic fact that the Chitradurga Plant had the existing production
capacity of 1.6 Million tons per annum (or 16 lakh MTPA) before
expansion started in the FY 2005-06 and the said increase in
production from 5.4 lakh MT in 1999-2000 to 11.49 lakh MT was very
much within the existing production capacity of 16 lakh MTPA in those
years.
</p>
<p id="p_216">It is reiterated that after expansion (which started in the FY 2005-06)
the said production capacity was increased from 1.6 MTPA (or 16 lakh
MTPA) in terms of „Lumps‟ to 2.5 MTPA (or 25 lakh MTPA) expressed
in terms of „Lumps‟.
</p>
<p id="p_217">Lumps and fines are two different varieties of iron ore. Whereas „lump‟
iron ore is defined as between 6mm and 30mm in size, anything below

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                87</span>
                                                       ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

6mm is considered fins.     Lumps fetch a higher price than fines. The
reason lump is preferred is that when it is fed into a blast furnace for
steel making, its particle size allows oxygen or air to circulate around
the raw materials and melt them efficiently. The fine iron ore products
have first to be processed into what is called sinter, otherwise it will
effectively, smother the air flow in the blast furnace.
</p>
<p id="p_218">In fact, it was only after the assessee installed a dust suppression
system in FY 2005-06 that is managed to increase the production of
fines in a substantial manner which was getting practically wasted to
that, as a result the overall production of lumps and fines increased up
to 38 to 49 lakh metric tons i.e., even beyond the installed capacity of
25 lakh metric tons expressed in terms of lumps.
</p>
<p id="p_219">It is undisputed that the substantial expansion for this unit started in the
FY 2005-06 in a phased manner spread over the years. There was
some increase in production achieved due to partial expansion in the
FY 2005-06 itself, but the real outcome of the said expansion in terms
of production surfaced in the year in which it was completed i.e., in the
FY 2008-09 (AY 2009-10) when production increased to 31.78 lakh
MT.
</p>
<p id="p_220">As far as the second averment of the CIT(A) is concerned that even
when no investment had been made in plant &amp; machinery in the year
2007-08, production in that year increased to 21.26 MT from 10.71 MT
in the preceding year, it must be appreciated that the plant was
partially closed in the year 2006-07 due to the fact that substantial
expansion was underway in that year and therefore, production in that
year as just 10.71 lakh MT which, as a consequence of the said
expansion, grew up to 21.26 lakh MT in the following year i.e., 2007-
</p><p id="p_221">08. There is nothing unusual about it.     Moreover, it is not understood
how production can increase is on a large scale. Therefore, no parity
can be drawn between investment in plant &amp; machinery in the year
2007-08 and the production level achieved in that very year as has
been attempted by the CIT(A).

The CIT(A) has asserted that except for a few items like vibrating
screen and hydrocone crusher, no other major equipment or machine
was installed during the period which could have helped in increasing
the production capacity.
</p>
<p id="p_224">Appellant‟s explanation

It has already been explained at length that the basic cost of plant and
machinery in case of an iron ore beneficiation plant is incurred on
raising steel and concrete structures on which the conveyor belts,
crushers, screens and other such equipments are installed.               The
CIT(A) has overlooked the basic composition of production apparatus
required in an iron ore beneficiation plant and made the above naive
assertion in a casual manner without any real understanding of the
actual production mechanism involved. In fact, in Karnataka, there are
many plants which are known as Mobile Screening Plant (MSP). The
major machinery in such iron ore plant is screening only.          Thus, no
adverse cognizance of the said assertion of CIT(A) which at best just a
casual remark, can be taken in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_225">At page 79 as per CIT(A) vide para 14: No material change in the input
and the output of the unit, which essentially remains as iron ore.
</p>
<p id="p_226">Appellant‟s explanation

This observation is patently wrong. The input is crude ore whereas the
output is lumps and fines.        Not only the physical appearance is
absolutely different but even the commercial name and usage are both
far-far different. There is practically no use of crude ore, but the usage
of lumps and fines is absolutely essential for steel making industry. It
seems that the CIT(A) got misled by the loose usage of the term „iron
ore‟ without verifying the actual facts.
</p>
<p id="p_227">Moreover, during the course of hearing, before the Hon‟ble ITAT, the
assessee-company showed samples of the input in the form of crude
ore and the output in the form of iron ore fines and lumps. The activity
was explained in detail which encompass transportation of crude ore,

crushing, screening and washing, stacking, loading in barges, river
transportation to the port and export in ships.
</p>
<p id="p_228">The assessee has also mentioned that it would be willing to show the
nature of activity inviting the Hon‟ble Members for a site visit in order to
have on the spot understanding of factual matters. It was requested
that though the claim was made u/s 10B in respect its three units
Amona, Chitradurg and Gadia Sado (Codli) but considering the non-
feasible to inspect all the three units, the nearest unit, Amona 100%
EOU may be taken up for the site visit. The Hon‟ble Members asked
the Departmental Representative also to accompany the site visit.
Accordingly, a site visit to Amona unit was arranged for the Hon‟ble
Members on 19-12-2012 in the afternoon. From the tax department
the Standing Counsel. JCIT, ACIT and inspectors together with ITAT
Bench Clerk accompanied the Hon‟ble Members for site visit.               The
activity was explained on sight to the invite in a details manner.
</p>
<p id="p_229">Appellants‟ explanation

The judgment in CIT Vs Sesa Goa Ltd., (2004) 271 ITR 331 was
delivered by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in assessee‟s own case. The
facts were that the assessee owned transport vehicles like dumpers,
etc. which were employed in conveying crude ore from its mines to the
beneficiation plant for processing and thus, declared as plant and
machinery.    It was explained that instead of installing the conventional
conveyor belt system from the mines to the beneficiation plant for
conveying crude ore, the assessee had chosen the cost effective way
of conveying it through an on-wheel conveying system i.e. through
dumpers etc., and which machines did not have any other use.
Therefore, for all practical purposes these were not vehicles as
understood in the ordinary sense, but plant and machinery in the case
of the assessee. Accordingly, the assessee claimed investment
allowance u/s 32A on the said assets, but it was disallowed by the
assessing authority under the averment that those assets had not been
used in the manufacturing process. After passing through the course
of appellate proceedings before the CIT(A) and the ITAT the matter
travelled to the High Court. The Hon‟ble Panaji Bench of the High

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                 90</span>
                                                         ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

Court of Bombay, while answering the question „Whether on the facts
and circumstances of the case, the ITAT was justified in holding that
the assessee is entitled to deduction of investment allowance u/s 32<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_135">A
of the IT Act</a>, 1961 in respect of machinery used in mining activity.
Ignoring the fact that the assessee is engaged in extraction and
processing of iron ore not amounting to manufacture or production of
any article or thing held as under (266 ITR 126).....
</p>
<p id="p_230">At the end of last but one para of the order.... <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_136">The Act</a> also contains
internal evidence to show that the legislature has treated raw ore
differently from processed ore. A Division Bench of this court in CIT Vs
Emirates commercial Bank Ltd., (2003) 262 ITR 55 has given the
benefit even in respect of data processing done on computers. In
other words, the legislation being a beneficial piece of legislation, an
expanded meaning should be so given and has to be given...'

Thus, the Hon‟ble Bombay High Court ratified the position that raw ore
was different from processed ore. Further, while agreeing with the
decision reached on 262 ITR 55 (supra) in respect of the data
processing that the same amounted to production, it has basically
decided that the processing of iron ore also amounts to production
following the same analogy.      It can be so concluded since the data
processing on computers does not involve extraction of an article or
thing from earth, and, therefore, the reliance of the said judgment here
can only be in respect of processing of the ore and not extraction of the
ore.
</p>
<p id="p_231">Further, in the last para of their order, the Hon‟ble Bombay High Court
held..... "The ore has to be extracted or raised from the earth in which it
is embedded ad has to be brought to the surface. What is brought to
the surface is something new which comes into existence as an article
or thing. If that be the case, winning or extracting of ore would fall
within the expression ‗production'.‖.
</p>
<p id="p_232">Thus, on the question put before the Hon‟ble High Court whether
extraction and processing of iron ore amounted to manufacture or
production, it decided that processing of ore was production and also
that extraction of ore was also production‟. However, the department
preferred further appeal before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, where the
same question as put before the High Court was re-examined by the
Apex Court. The Apex Court held as under (271 ITR 331)....
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                91</span>
<p id="p_233">                                                      ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

The reasoning given by the High Court, in the decisions noted by us
earlier, is in our opinion, unimpeachable. This court had, as early as
in 1961 in Chrestian Mica Industries Ltd. Vs State of Bihar (1961) 12
STC 150 defined the word production albeit in connection with the
Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The definition was adopted from the
meaning ascribed to the word in the Oxford English Dictionary as
meaning ‗amongst other things that which is produced, a thing that
results from any action, process or effort, a product, product of human
activity or effort. From the wide definition of the word production, it
has to follow that mining activity for the purpose of production of
mineral ores would come within the ambit of the word production, since
ore is a thing which is the result of human activity or effort. It has also
been held by this court in CIT Vs N.C. Budharaja &amp; Co., (1993) 204
ITR 412 that the word production is much wider than the word
‗manufacture'.
</p>
<p id="p_234">"We are therefore, of the opinion that extraction and processing of iron
ore amounts to production within the meaning of the word in <a href="/doc/1670335/" id="a_137">section
32A(2)(b)(iii)</a> of the Act and consequently, the assessee is entitled to
the benefit of sec.32A(1) of the Act‖.
</p>
<p id="p_235">It must be appreciated that he Apex Court categorically expressed that
the reasoning given by the High Court on the meaning of word
production as unimpeachable in its opinion, and since a common
phase „extraction and processing of iron ore‟ had been employed in the
question. It was also answered in the singular manner only by the
Apex Court.    However, what must be understood is that the Hon‟ble
High Court in 266 ITR 126 nowhere held that both extraction and
processing of ore shall have to be undertaken together to constitute
production. Therefore, it cannot be understood that the Apex Court
decided the issue in any different manner and it must be safely
concluded that extraction of iron ore and processing of iron ore were
independently held as production. Accordingly, the assertion of the
department that extraction and processing should both be undertaken
together in order to pass the test of production is just misgiving and
against the spirit of the above decisions of the Hon‟ble Bombay High
Court and the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_236">Furthermore, even in the case of Chowgule &amp; Co., Ltd., relied upon by
the department, it must be appreciated the order dated 12/07/2007 of
the Hon‟ble Panaji Bench of ITAT in ITA No.162/PNJ/2006 was
immediately rectified by the same Bench in Misc. Appn. moved by the
assessee in MA.NO.23/PNJ/2007 order dated 19/7/2007 where it was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                92</span>
                                                      ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

finally held; We hold that the assessee-company itself is extracting the
entire iron ores and thereafter processing the same, and therefore,
entitled for the deduction u/s 10B as held by the Supreme Court in the
case of Sesa Goa.
</p>
<p id="p_237">The need for rectification arose since in the original order the Hon‟ble
ITAT had held that the asesssee was only processing iron ore but was
not extracting the ore (Pl. See para-5 order dated 19/7/2007 in MA),
but the Hon‟ble ITAT found during the MA proceedings (in the light of
sub-para 8 in para-4 of order dated 19/07/2007) that the assessee-
company was extracting as well as processing the ore, and therefore,
10B deduction was allowed to the assessee company.
</p>
<p id="p_238">It must be understood that EOU and assessee have different meaning.
It is not necessary that both the extraction of iron ore and processing of
iron ore must be carried out by the EOU itself to claim exemption u/s
10B.   It must be understood that the mines and processing units are
always at a safe distance with each other because mine blasting would
otherwise disturb the functioning of the processing units.        EOU unit
has to be a custom bonded area but the mines are spread over
kilometers in area which cannot be made custom bonded. Thus, the
mines cannot be mad part of the EOU unit in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_239">However, even if the extraction of iron ore is carried out by the
assessee at mines owned by him or by third party (which cannot be
covered under EOU unit as explained above) and only the processing
is carried out by EOU unit, even then the assessee will be eligible for
10B deduction for the said EOU as the assessee is extracting as well
as processing the ore.   This is the decision of the Chowgule because
in that case the EOU was using the iron ore extracted by the said
company from its own mines and from the mines of Antao Brothers
which could not be part of the EOU unit of that assessee is any
manner as explained above.
</p>
<p id="p_240">Thus, the basic condition for allowing exemption u/s 10B by holding h
extraction and processing of iron ore as production is that the
assessee should carry on both these activities by itself. and it cannot


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                                93</span>
                                                     ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

be understood to mean that both these activities should be carried on
by the EOU itself.
</p>
<p id="p_241">In other words the Hon‟ble ITAT did not hold that a EOU qualifying for
deduction u/s 10B must undertake both these activities together, rather
it was held that if the assessee extracted the ore by itself and also
undertook processing of the ore as its EOU, it would qualify for
deduction u/s 10B for its ore processing EOU.
</p>
<p id="p_242">In the present case of the assessee also, there is no dispute that the
assessee-company namely M/s Sesa Goa Ltd., also undertook both
the activities of extraction and processing and has correctly claimed
the deduction u/s 10B in respect of profits arising from processing of
ore at its EOUs. Thus, the parameters laid down in the above case of
Chowgule &amp; Co., by the Hon‟ble ITAT are squarely met by the
assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_243">At page-89 as per CIT(A) vide para 16: For determining the percentage
of old equipments used in the new unit, even the assets held at the
extracting unit must be taken into consideration. The CIT(A) has
asserted that to determine the percentage of the old machine reused in
the new set up it is necessary to take into consideration all the old and
existing machines of the respective units along with the plant and
machinery deployed in the mines of the assessee. He has further
averted that if the value of plant and machinery employed in the mines
of the company are taken into consideration, then the percentage of
old machine will certainly be exceeding the threshold limit of 20% as
prescribed. The CIT(A) has justified his averments by relying on his
interpretation of the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in CIT Vs
Sesa Goa Ltd., (2004) 271 ITR 331 that the activities to be eligible to
be held as „Production‟ should comprise of the extraction as well as the
processing of iron ore.
</p>
<p id="p_244">Appellant‟s explanation

The assessee has claimed deduction u/s 10B in respect of its
beneficiation units only and not the mines. Therefore, there is no
rationale in clubbing the machines employed at the mines with those

      owned by the units for the purpose of calculating the percentage of old

      if the value of plant and machinery employed in the mines of the
      company are taken into consideration, then the percentage of old
      machine will certainly be exceeding the threshold limit of 20% as
      prescribed, is nothing but presumptuous.      Moreover, it has already
      been explained that in Hon‟ble Supreme Court judgment in 271 ITR
      331 read with Bombay High Court‟s ruling in 266 ITR 126 in the case
      of Sesa Goa it has actually decided that extraction of ore and

AO and the CIT(A) could not understand the process involved in the unit.
This EOU employs the process and machinery which are different from other
processing plant. What is fed as input in the plant is tailings, which is the
waste material obtained from other normal processing and from this „iron ore‟
is extracted as output. The input is merely is a waste and has cost practically
all the characteristic of iron ore and cannot be considered as „iron ore‟
extracted from the mines.     From this waste material what is extracted is
called the iron ore which has the utility and marketability. The waste, as such
does not have any commercial marketability.       It was contended that the
decision of M/s Sesa Goa Ltd., (271 ITR 331) has wrongly been interpreted
by the revenue.    Reliance was placed for the preposition of the law that the
said unit is engaged manufacturing or production of an article or thing on the

has to implement the project and commence commercial production within 3
years and had to intimate this to Ministry. The assessee accordingly,

which are already operated by the assessee cannot be treated as new unit. It

activity. The activities carried in the old mines are totally different from the
activity contemplated in the unit.

<p id="p_251">40.5   On the contention of the AO that the fresh approval of the Board is not
available to the unit, it was submitted that the assessee has obtained the
renewal of earlier approval duly ratified by the Board of Approval. For this,
attention was drawn to pages (436 to 439 PB) which contains copy of the
letter dated 13.7.2012 received from the Development Commissioner and
also copy of the letter dated 1.8.2012 was also submitted that during the
course of hearing confirming the approval of Board of Approvals was not
required for renewal granted for continuation as an EOU for further period of 5
years in terms of para 6.6 of foreign trade policy. This letter was duly verified
by us and copy of the same was also given to the DR. On the contention that
the unit has not debited any cost of the waste material used, it was submitted
that the waste was used from tailings/ponds which had neither any cost nor
any commercial marketability. Attention was also drawn to page-376 of paper
book to stress that these facts were duly mentioned in the EOU application
submitted with the SIA/DIPP and was duly shared with the AO. Some piece
of tailing was physically produced at the time of hearing before the Hon‟ble
Bench.

      lost all the characteristics of iron ore the tailings can never be considered
      as iron ore extracted from the mines and therefore, recycling of such
      waste materials cannot be considered to be the same as processing of
      extracted iron ore.' This assertion rather proves the stand of the appellant
      that the output of Codli unit is a "new" product having different
      characteristics and use.

      271 ITR 331.
</p>
<p id="p_254">      Appellant's Explanation:
</p><p id="p_255">      The judgment in CIT Vs. Sesa Goa Ltd. (2004) 271 ITR 331 was
      delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in assessee's own case. The
      facts were that the assessee owned transport vehicles like dumpers, etc.
      which were employed in conveying crude ore from its mines to the
      beneficiation plant for processing and, thus, declared as 'plant and
      machinery'. It was explained that instead of installing the conventional
      conveyor belt system from the mines to the beneficiation plant for
      conveying crude ore, the assessee had chosen the cost effective way of
      conveying it through an on-wheel conveying system, i.e., through
      dumpers, etc. and which machines did not have any other use. Therefore,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                                         98</span>
                                                            ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

for all practical purposes these were not 'vehicles' as understood in the
ordinary sense, but 'plant and machinery' in the case of the assessee.
Accordingly, the assessee claimed investment allowance u/s 32A on the
said assets, but it was disallowed by the assessing authority under the
averment that those assets had not been used in the manufacturing
process. After passing through the course of appellate proceedings before
the CIT (Appeals) and IT AT, the matter traveled to the High Court. The
Hon'ble Panaji Bench of the High Court of Bombay, while answering the
question "Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the
Income-tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in holding that the
assessee is entitled to deduction of investment allowance under <a href="/doc/1757624/" id="a_139">section
32A</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961, in respect of machinery used in mining
activity, ignoring the fact that the assessee is engaged in extraction and
processing of iron ore, not amounting to manufacture or production of
any article or thing?", held as under [266 ITR 126]:
</p>
<p id="p_256">At the end of last but one para of the order: "... <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_140">The Act</a> also contains
internal evidence to show that the Legislature has treated raw ore
differently from processed ore. A division Bench of this court in CIT Vs.
Emirates Commercial Bank Ltd. (2003) 262 ITR 55, has given the benefit
even in respect of data processing done on computers. In other words,
the legislation being a beneficial piece of legislation, an expanded
meaning should be so given and has to be given. "
</p>
<p id="p_257">Thus, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court ratified the position that raw ore
was different from processed ore. Further, while agreeing with the
decision reached in 262 ITR 55 (supra) in respect of data processing that
the same amounted to 'production', it has basically decided that the
'processing' of iron ore also amounts to 'production' following the same
analogy. It can be so concluded since the data processing on computers
does not involve 'extraction' of any article or thing from earth, and,
therefore, the reliance of the said judgment here can only be in respect of
'processing' of the ore and not 'extraction' of the ore.
</p>
<p id="p_258">Further, in the last para of their order, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court
held: "The ore has to be extracted or raised from the earth in which it is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                   99</span>
                                                             ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

    embedded and has to be brought to the surface. What is brought to the
    surface is something new which comes into existence, as an article or
    thing. If that be the case, winning or extracting of ore would fall within the
    expression "production ".
</p>
<p id="p_259">    Thus, on the question put before the Hon'ble High Court "whether
    'extraction and processing' of iron ore amounted to 'manufacture or
r   production'", it decided that 'processing of ore' was 'production' and
    also that 'extraction of ore' was also 'production'.
</p>
<p id="p_260">    However, the department preferred further appeal before the Hon'ble
    Supreme Court, where the same question as put before the High Court
    was re-examined by the apex court. The Apex Court held as under [271
    ITR 331]:
</p>
<p id="p_261">    "The reasoning given by the High Court, in the decisions noted by us
    earlier, is, in our opinion, unimpeachable. This court had, as early as in
    1961, in Chrestian Mica Industries Ltd. Vs. State of Bihar [1961] 12 STC
    150, defined the word "production", albeit in connection with the Bihar
    Sales Tax Act, 1947. The definition was adopted from the meaning
    ascribed to the word in the Oxford English Dictionary as meaning
    "amongst other things that which is produced; a thing that results from any
    action, process or effort, a product; a product of human activity or effort".
    From the wide definition of the word "production", it has to follow that
    mining activity for the purpose of production of mineral ores would come
    within the ambit of the word "production" since ore is "a thing" which is
    the result of human activity or effort. It has also been held by this court in
    CIT Vs. N.C. Budharaja and Co. [1993] 204ITR 412 that the word
    "production" is much wider than the word "manufacture".
</p>
<p id="p_262">    "We are, therefore, of the opinion that extraction and processing of iron ore
    amounts to "production" within the meaning of the word in <a href="/doc/1670335/" id="a_141">section
    32A(2)(b)(iii)</a> of the Act and, consequently, the assessee is entitled to the
    benefit of <a href="/doc/1757624/" id="a_142">section 32A(l)</a> of the Act."
</p>
<p id="p_263">    It must be appreciated that the Apex Court categorically expressed that
    the reasoning given by the High Court on the meaning of word

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                                      100</span>
                                                       ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

'production' was unimpeachable in its opinion; and since a common
phrase - 'extraction and processing of iron ore' had been employed in the
question, it was also answered in the singular manner only by the Apex
Court. However, what must be understood is that the Hon'ble High Court in
266 ITR 126 nowhere held that both 'extraction and processing' of ore shall
have to be undertaken together to constitute 'production'. Therefore, it
cannot be understood that the Apex Court decided the issue in any
different manner, and it must be safely concluded that 'extraction of iron
ore' and 'processing of iron ore' were independently held as
'production'. Accordingly, the assertion of the department that 'extraction
and processing' should both be undertaken together in order to pass the
test of 'production' is just a misgiving and against the spirit of the above
decisions of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_264">Furthermore, even in the case of Chowgule &amp; Co. Ltd., relied upon by the
department, it must be appreciated the order dated 12/07/07 of the
Hon'ble Panaji Bench of ITAT in ITA No. 162/PNJ/2006 was immediately
rectified by the same bench in Miscellaneous Application moved by the
assessee in M.A. No. 23/PNJ/2007 order dated 19/07/07 where it was
finally held: "We hold that the assessee-companv itself is extracting the
entire iron ores and thereafter processing the same, and, therefore,
entitled for the deduction u/s 10B as held by the Supreme Court in the case
of Sesa Goa."
</p>
<p id="p_265">The need for rectification arose since in the original order the Hon'ble
ITAT had held that the assessee was only 'processing' iron ore but was
not 'extracting' the ore (Please see para 5 of order dated 19/07/07 in
MA). But the Hon'ble ITAT found during the MA proceedings (in the light
of sub-para 8 in para 4 of order dated 19/07/07) that the assessee-company
was extracting as well as processing the ore, and, therefore, 10B deduction
was allowed to the assessee-company.
</p>
<p id="p_266">It must be understood that 'EOU' and 'assessee' have different meaning.
It is not necessary that both the extraction of iron ore and processing of
iron ore must be carried out by the EOU itself to claim exemption u/s
10B. It must be understood that the mines and processing units are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                                101</span>
                                                               ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

      always at a safe distance with each other because mine blasting would
      otherwise disturb the functioning of the processing units. EOU unit has to
      be a custom bonded area but the mines are spread over kilometres in
      area which cannot be made custom bonded. Thus, the mines cannot be
      made part of the EOU unit in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_267">      However, even if the extraction of iron ore is carried out by the assessee at
      mines owned by him or by third party (which cannot be covered under EOU
      unit as explained above) and only the processing is carried out by EOU
      unit, even then the assessee will be eligible for 10B deduction for the said
      EOU as the assessee is extracting as well as processing the ore. This is
      the decision of the Chowgule because in that case the EOU was using
      the iron ore extracted by the said company from its own mines and from the
      mines of Antao Brothers, which could not be a part of the EOU unit of that
      assessee in any manner as explained above.
</p>
<p id="p_268">      Thus, the basic condition for allowing exemption u/s I0B by holding the
      'extraction' and processing of iron ore' as 'production' is that the
      assessee should carry on both these activities by itself; and it cannot be
      understood to mean that both these activities should be carried on by the
      EOU itself.   In other words the Hon'ble ITAT did not hold that a 'EOU'
      qualifying for deduction u/s 10B must undertake both these activities
      together, rather it was held that if the assessee extracted the ore by itself
      and also undertook processing of the ore at its EOU, it would qualify for
      deduction u/s 10B for its 'ore processing' EOU.
</p>
<p id="p_269">      In the present case of the appellant also, there is no dispute that the
      assessee-company, namely M/s Sesa Goa Ltd., also undertook both the
      activities of extraction and processing and has correctly claimed the
      deduction u/s 10B in respect of profits arising from 'processing' of ore at its
      EOUs. Thus, the parameters laid down in the above case of Chowgule &amp;
      Co. by the Hon'ble ITAT are squarely met by the appellant.

       hearing in November, 2012 before the Hon'ble IT AT) was indeed
       signed by the Executive Assistant to the Development Commission,
       which is a standard practice that such clarificatory letters are released by
       the EA only under due authority of the Development Commissioner. It
       must be appreciated that it is not the case where the approval of the Board
       of Approvals was not signed by the Development Commissioner and,

plant for which there was no customer and it is being dumped was utilized by
making the ultra-fine ore. The Learned. A.R. brought out the raw material i.e.,
the tailing which was in liquid form and also the ultra-fine ore which was in
powder form and shown it before the bench during the course of hearing.
Thus, he contended that both the things, raw material as well as the ultra-fine
ores produced are different and having different utility.

year 2005-06 (Codli unit), assessment year 2009-10 both Amona unit and
Chitradurga unit made a claim of deduction u/s.10B of the Act. All the three
units as stated above had commenced processing nearly 25 years earlier to

     to claim deduction u/s. 10B of the Act from the previous year in
     which the undertaking begins to manufacture or produce article or
     thing.     Secondly, this claim is providing for a period of ten
     consecutive assessment years, again, from the date when the
     undertaking begins to produce or manufacture article or thing.
     Admittedly, in the facts of the present case the Codli, Amona and
     Chitradurga units of the assessee have not made a claim from the
     date of commencement of processing iron ore. Further all the three
     units    have   not    met    the   consecutive    assessment        years
     contemplated in the Section from the date of commencement of
     processing iron ore.
</p><p id="p_295">ii. The assessee in order to overcome this mandatory provision has
     projected a new contention that all the three units at Codli, Amona

     of iron ore w.e.f. F.Y. 2004-05, 2002-03 &amp; 2005-06 respectively. In

</pre><p id="p_297">  iv. The old unit continuous to function without stopping of processing
     iron ore even for one year.    The only addition made is by virtue of
     adding a few machineries. This has resulted in increased quantum
     of processing iron ore in Amona and Chitradurga units. However
     there is no evidence in this regard in respect of the Codli unit. The
     addition made to the old machinery cannot be termed as a new
     undertaking.

     interpreting of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_150">Section 15C</a> of the Income Tax Act 1922, will not be
     applicable to the facts of the present case as the wordings of

<p id="p_326">a. Assessee‟s contention


   Codli unit, Amona Unit and Chitradurga Unit are independent unit
   carrying on manufacture and production activities of article and
   thing.   Therefore it satisfies the conditions contained in <a href="/doc/801936/" id="a_175">section
   10B(2)(i)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_327">b. Revenue‟s submission:
</p>
<p id="p_328">   Assessee has number of units which carry on independent
   activities. A series of activity from the extraction of iron ore to its
   ultimate export is carried on by these various units.                 The
   jurisdictional Bombay High Court, (2004) 266 ITR 126            CIT Vs.
   Sesa Goa Ltd., held "the processes involved in mining ore
   commencing from extraction of iron ore to selling it for export are
   identified as under":

   Whether these processes involve "manufacture"            or "production"
   was concluded by the jurisdictional High Court as under:
</p>
<p id="p_335">c. Manufacture:
</p>
<p id="p_336">   It would, therefore, not be possible for us to accept the contention
   that extractions of ore and the various processes which it
   undergoes until it is sold amounts to "manufacture". In our opinion,
   the various processes applied do not amount to "manufacture" and
   consequently, it would be difficult to hold that the extraction of ore
   amounts to "manufacture".
</p>
<p id="p_337">d. Production:
</p>
<p id="p_338">   i.   The ore has to be extracted or raised from the earth in which it
        is embedded and has to be brought to the surface. What is
        brought to the surface is something new which comes into
        existence, as an article or thing. If that be the case, winning or
        extracting of ore would fall within the expression "production".
</p>
<p id="p_339">   ii. The matter was carried to the Apex court. The Apex court in
        <a href="/doc/1187063/" id="a_176">CIT vs. Sesa Goa Ltd</a>., (2004) 271 ITR 331 (SC) has held as
        under:

<p id="p_340">   iii. "We are, therefore, of the opinion that extraction and processing
        of iron ore amounts to "production" within the meaning of the
        word in S.32A(2)(b)(iii) of the Act and, consequently, the
        assessee is entitled to the benefit of S.32A(1) of the Act. The
        question whether the High Court was correct in holding that the
        activity did not amount to "manufacture" is left open."
</p>
<p id="p_341">   iv. It should be noted that out of the number of processes carried
        on by the assessee as noticed in the judgment of the
        jurisdictional High Court, the Codli unit, Amona Unit and
        Chitradurga Unit carries on (iii) washing, screening and dressing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">                                115</span>

   the ore. It is the contention of the revenue that this washing,
   screening and dressing of the ore or such other process carried
   on in the benefication plants of the three units does not amount
   to manufacture or production. It is further submitted that this
   controversy is now fairly concluded by the judgment of the
   jurisdictional High Court in the case of the assessee itself.
</p>
<p id="p_342">v. Firstly, examining the term "manufacture", the jurisdictional High
   Court has concluded that not only the limited activity carried on
   by the Codli unit, but the entire activity carried on by the
   assessee i.e. the extraction of iron ore and the ultimate sale of
   the same would not amount to manufacture stands settled and
   concluded in the assessee‟s case.            However as far as the
   Supreme Court level is concerned this issue has been kept
   open.       In the facts of the case of Codli Unit it is only one small
   activity among the large number of processes involved by the
   assessee is carried on. When the large activity itself is held as
   not to be manufacture the question of the Codli, Amona &amp;
   Chitradurga units independently carrying on manufacturing
   activity would not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_343">vi. Further, a bare reading of the judgments of the Apex court in
   1981 AIR (SC) 1014 Chowgule &amp; Co., P. Ltd., Vs. Union of India
   &amp; ors., 1980 SCC (Tax) 319 Dy. Commissioner of Sales Tax
   (Law) Vs. M/s. Pio Food Packers and 1991 AIR (SC) 2222
   Collector of Central Excise Vs. S.N. Sunderson (Minerals) Ltd.,
   would also clearly show that the activity carried on by the Codli,
   Amona &amp; Chitradurga units are not a manufacturing activity, but
   only an activity of "processing".       Earlier even the processing
   activity was treated as manufacture u/s. 10B of the Act.
   However this has been specifically excluded.            Therefore the
   assessee will not be entitled to treat its activity as manufacturing
   activity.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                               116</span>
<p id="p_344">                                                        ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

     vii. <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_177">Section 2(29BA)</a> of the Act defines manufacture. Assessee also
        does not fall within this definition. Hence, assessee does not
        carry on the activity of manufacture.
</p>
<p id="p_345">     viii. Secondly, the claim of the assessee that the processing of iron
         ore amounts to "production" is also not correct. The activity of
         the assessee admittedly is that of a beneficiation plant where
         impurities are removed from the iron ore collected.             Large
         boulders are sized into powder. It is only a screening process.
         The jurisdictional High Court as well as the Apex court in the
         case of the very same assessee as held that extraction of iron
         ore and ultimate sale of the same amounts to "production".
         Production is concluded as "extraction" &amp; "processing" of iron
         ore. If this test is applied to the Codli unit the unit does not
         carry on any extraction of iron ore. Therefore as held in the
         assessee‟s own case by both the jurisdictional High Court and
         the Apex court Codli unit‟s activities cannot be termed as
         production as only a process is carried on.
</p>
<p id="p_346">     ix. Hence, the Codli unit of the assessee does not carry on any
         manufacture of production activity.    It is hit by the restriction
         imposed u/s.10B(2)(i) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_347">     x. Assessee‟s arguments was being addressed regarding the
         actual activity being carried on in respect of Codli, Amona &amp;
         Chitradurga units. This is reflected in the assessee‟s website,
         which is enclosed along with this submission.
</p>
<p id="p_348">e. Important Note: Assessee‟s activity has not changed from the
  inception. The plants under which <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_178">section 10B</a> deduction is claimed
  continues to be the same. The same products are fed. This chain of
  production to ultimate sale cannot be cut into number of independent
  activity. Therefore the contention of the assessee is incorrect to say
  that this is an independent unit. The input which was made earlier and
  now is the same. The contention that it is the end product, tailings, by-

   already in existence. [<a href="/doc/238946/" id="a_180">Section 10B(2)(ii)</a>]
   a. The Codli unit, Amona Unit &amp; Chitradurga Unit commenced their
      activity in the year 1973, 1958 &amp; 1952 respectively. As held by the
      jurisdictional High Court in the case of the assessee itself, the
      assessee carries on number of activities, extraction of iron ore and
      the ultimate export of the same. The assessee after having taken
      over all the three units in the years 1978, 1985 &amp; 1998-99
      respectively has been carrying on a composite activity of extraction
      of iron ore and thereafter exporting the same.       In this process
      assessee has claimed deduction u/s.80HHC of the Act. Out of the
      composite activity of the assessee the Codli unit, Amona Unit and
      Chitradurga Unit carry on only one exclusive activity i.e., washing,
      screening and dressing the iron ore.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                                   118</span>

b. In this composite activity the assessee was claiming deduction u/s.
   80HHC of the Act in respect of the profits earned in the course of
   export, up to the assessment year 2004-05. When the deduction
   u/s. 80HHC of the Act was discontinued from the year 2005-06
   onwards assessee has tried to break up its business activity of
   extraction of iron ore and the ultimate export of the same. One
   such activity carried on by the Codli unit, Amona Unit &amp; Chitradurga
   Unit of washing, screening and dressing the iron ore is being split
   up from the composite activity of the assessee which is prohibited
   under law.
</p><p id="p_360">c. Splitting up: A business already in existence is broken up in to
  different sections and the original integrity is broken vide open.
d. Admittedly, the assessee as identified by the jurisdictional High
  Court was carrying on seven different activities.       The Codli unit,
  Amona Unit &amp; Chitradurga Unit was carrying on one such activity.
  The assessee by claiming this activity as a separate activity would
  amount to splitting up of bifurcation of the original integrated activity
  of extraction of iron ore and export of the same.             Hence, the
  assessee has split up its original activity of business already in
  existence which is contrary to <a href="/doc/238946/" id="a_181">Section 10B(2)(ii)</a> of the Act.
e. Reconstruction of business:       "to rebuild or to reconstitute" must
   necessarily involve the concept that the original business or
   undertaking is not to cease functioning and its identity is not to be
   lost or abandoned. The underlying idea of reconstruction evidently
   must be - and this is brought out by the section itself - of a
   business already in existence. There must be a continuation of the
   activities and the business of the same industrial undertaking. The
   undertaking must continue to carry on the same business though in
   some altered or varied form. If the alterations and changes are
   substantial, there would be little scope for describing what emerges
   as a reconstruction of the business.     (1959) 35 ITR 662 (Bom) CIT
   Vs. Gaekwar Foam &amp; Rubber Co. Ltd.,
f. Admittedly, assessee was originally carrying on an integrated
  activity. Under the guise of claiming deduction u/s. 10B of the Act
  the assessee had identified one of its units and proceeded to make


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">                               119</span>

     some value addition by way of machinery. The original business
     activity continues. The original ownership also continues.
   g. Hence, <a href="/doc/238946/" id="a_182">Section 10B(2)(ii)</a> of the Act, is applicable and the assessee
     is not entitled to claim deduction.

   a. Assessee‟s contention:
</p><p id="p_362">      The Codli Unit, Amona Unit &amp; Chitradurga Unit have no doubt been
      processing iron ore from the years 1973, 1958, &amp; 1952.               The
      assessee to these three units has allegedly claimed that it has
      made certain value addition to the plant and machinery with effect
      from the Financial Years 2004-05, 2002-03 &amp; 2005-06 respectively
      in respect of each unit. Therefore, each of these units should be
      called as new unit entitled for deduction u/s.10B of the Act.
   b. Revenue‟s submission:
</p><p id="p_363">      It is found by the Assessing Officer as well as the Appellate
      Commissioner on facts that these three units have been functioning
      from the years 1973, 1958 &amp; 1952. The processing of iron ore has
      continued continuously year after year, month after month and day
      after day from its inception. The place of business of the three
      units has not changed. The infrastructure provided originally has
      not changed. Only alterations have been made. The capacity has
      been increased. The management continues. The addition made
      or alterations made do not in any manner create a new unit. It can
      be safely concluded that the same infrastructure consisting of plant
      and machinery previously used for other purpose is being utilized in
      this new industry allegedly claimed to have been started by the
      assessee constituting a transfer and is hit by <a href="/doc/997622/" id="a_184">section 10B(2)(iii)</a> of

was denied by the Revenue.             The main reason in all the three units for
disallowing exemption u/s 10B in addition to the other reasons is that the
assessee is not engaged in any ‟manufacture‟ or „production‟ of article or
thing. Therefore, the first issue to be decided in this case is whether the
assessee is engaged in any manufacturing or production of any article or
thing in all the three units, namely, EOU units at Amona, Chitradurga and
Codli. The processes undertaken at each of these units are as under:

       the iron ore beneficiation plants is further processed and low
       grade iron ore is produced. The tailings are first de-slimed by 5"
       de-sliming cyclone equipment. In order to increase the pressure
       (30 psi) as required for the de-sliming operation, high capacity
       slurry pumps are used. The said process result is a finer size
       cut-off which is required to facilitate magnetic separation.

personal visit of Bench Members to its Amona Plant both members in
presence of Mr. Seshachala (DR) Mr. Sanjeev Kumar Bindal (AR) and the
officials of the IT Department and the assessee company made an on sight
inspection of the said plant of M/s Sesa Goa Ltd., located at Amona Village,
North Goa between 03.00 pm to 04.30pm 0n 19.12 12. The purpose of
inspection was to understand the type of plant &amp; machinery installed at the
iron ore Beneficiation plant and also the processes undertaken for production
of iron ore Iron ore Beneficiation plant.    This iron ore beneficiation plant, in
open, we found spread over an area of about 100 square meters but no
production activity was going on.      It was informed that the plant was not
running because of the ban on mining and processing activities since
September, 2012. Heaps of mud mixed with boulders of various sizes, were
found stacked in front of the plant. It was told that the heaps of mud and
boulders were in fact „crude or‟ also called „Run-of Mile‟ (ROM is brought from
the mines situated about 10-15 kilometers from the plant and fed to the plant.
</p>
<p id="p_402">42.3 The boundaries of the plant consisted of retaining walls having a steep
face of about 10 meters on two sides, facing of barbed wires on one side and
open space in front where the final product is stored. The starting point of the
plant as shown to us is a „Hopper‟ which is made up of Mild Steel (MS) plates
wherein ROM is fed to the plant. The hopper was found fitted at the edge of
the retaining wall of about 10 meters height. It was explained that the Rom is
poured by trucks directly into the hopper and is taken for crushing through a
conveyor system, after which it is carried to the screens of various sizes, yet

again through an organized mechanism of conveyor belts.       The whole plant
we noted consists of huge steel structures of about 6-10 meters height on
which the banana screen and the conveyors were found installed. The
process of crushing and screening were told to be repeated till the desired
sizes were obtained.   It was explained that the products then pass through
log washers where the impurities are further removed.             Some of the
conveyors were found open to sky whereas some were found covered with
Galvanized Iron (GI) sheets.      It was seen that the conveyors were made to
carry ore of various sizes from the screens to the log washers where the
output is washed. Log washer was found to be a rectangular drum fitted with
a spiral pinion made of MS plates. The final product, „lumps and fines‟ were
noted to be totally physically different in appearance and use from the initial
input product. We were also shown metallurgical coke plant but that is not
relevant for exemption u/s 10B.

<p id="p_403">42.4   The hearing was earlier concluded on 20/12/2012 after hearing
counsels from both the sides continuously        on different dates, i.e., from
21/11/12 to 20/12/2012. Both sides have exhaustively argued and put up
their submissions and even requested to file the synopsis, which Bench
permitted. Accordingly, synopses were filed from both the sides. After the
concluding of the hearing while the case was under dictation, the revenue
moved an application dated 18/01/2013 on 21/01/2013 for referring the issue
whether the assessee is engaged in production or not in all the three units to

No. 162/PNJ/ 2006 and ITA No. 184/PNJ/2006. Production in relation to extraction and
processing of Iron ore has been held as under.
</p>
<p id="p_409">         'The Supreme Court in fact has held in the case of Sesa Goa Ltd., that "extraction
and processing of mining ore amounts to production". One should read the expression
"extraction" and "processing" together. The ruling of the Supreme Court is not that
extraction as well as processing, independently amounts to production, (emphasise
supplied). If an assessee carries on the business of extracting mineral ore, it amounts to
manufacture or production as per the above judgement. If the same assessee in addition
to extraction, also process the mineral ore, the combined activity obviously amounts to
production/manufacture. But processing the mineral ore without extraction of the ore
has not been held to be production / manufacture by the Supreme Court in the said
decision of Sesa Goa."
</p>
<p id="p_410">        "In the present case also, the process carried on by the assessee is
providing value addition to Iron ore by enhancing its quality. It is in fact upgrading the
quality for apt industrial use. Even though the process employed by the assessee
might require deployment of huge capital and large plant and machinery, such things
do not change the basic character of the activities carried on by the assessee-
company. What is received by the assessee-company is iron ore; what is processed by
the assessee-company is iron-ore and again what is sent outside the assessee-
company is still the iron ore. No new product comes into existence. In this line of trade,
different grades of iron ore will have different nomenclatures and names. But those
expressions of convenience do not mean that the assessee has produced or
manufactured a new article or thing."
</p>
<p id="p_411">       The decision of Hon'ble ITAT in MA No.23/PNJ/2007 has not changed
the above position regarding "production" in the case of iron ore.

<p id="p_418">42.6    During the course of the hearing, the Bench pointed out that Ld.
Departmental Special Counsel has already taken the argument that the case
of the revenue on this issue is duly covered by the decision of this Bench in
the case of Chowgule &amp; Co. ITA No. 162 and in case this Tribunal wanted to
differ the matter be referred on this issue for constituting a Special Bench.
The Bench never observed that the case is covered or not covered by the
decision in the case of Chowgule &amp; co. The Ld. AR on the contrary objected
to the admission of this application as it will tantamount to re-hearing of the
case for which hearing had already been concluded. In this regard he relied
upon certain decisions such as M/s Roger Enterprises Pvt Ltd. Vs. DCIT
SPL. Range 5, New Delhi ITA No. 1515,1516,1517/del/97 dt. 8.5.2003,
Denso India Ltd. Vs. JCIT, TDs Range 22, New Delhi ITA Nos. 3233 to

Govindaraja Mudaliar Vs. Income Tax Appellate Tribunal 206 ITR 62 but on
the basis of natural justice as the order was not finalized and especially when
CCIT had personally appeared, we permitted CCIT to argue on this
application. The CCIT carried us to the order of the ITAT in ITA No. 162 and
184 in Chowgule and Company and also the MA No.23 order to press that the
Coordinate Bench of this Tribunal has taken the view that extraction and
processing of iron ore is necessary for holding that assessee has

not tantamount to be manufacture / production. The decision of co-ordinate
bench dated 12.7.2007 is binding on us. This finding of coordinate bench has
not been reversed by the order passed in M.A No.23 dated 19.7.2007. It was
vehemently contended, that in case this bench want to take a different view
than that has been taken by the co-ordinate        bench in their order dated
12.7.2007, this issue be referred to the Special Bench. He relied in this regard
on the written submissions. Ld. AR on merit relied upon the earlier decisions
referred to by him during the course of hearing. He reiterated and relied on
the decision of Special Bench in the case of Madhu Jayanti International Ltd.
and Others Vs. DCIT (SB)(Kol) (Supra) and that of Kerala High Court in the
case of Tata Tea as well as decision of the Supreme Court earlier referred to.
His main contention was earlier taken was that subsequent to the decision of
Chowgule &amp; Co. Panaji Bench, a number of decisions have been decided by
the Special Bench, High Court and Supreme Court, which are superior forum
than the division bench of the Tribunal on the issue whether the processing of
input amounts to manufacture or production.        We will decide this issue
subsequently as at this stage without discussing the relevant provisions of the
Act, we cannot form an opinion whether the processing of iron ore to make it
fit for export amounts to manufacture or production.

<p id="p_419">42.7   In our opinion, the common issue involved on the facts of the case in
the case of the assessee is whether all the three units in respect of which the
assessee claimed the exemption u/s 10B are engaged in any manufacture or
production of article or thing for the purpose availing of exemption u/s 10B. If
engaged in processing, whether assessee is entitled for exemption u/s 10B in
respect of all these three units. The nature of activities in the case of Amona
plant as well as Chitradurga is similar as explained in the earlier paras. Both
these units as well as Codli plant are approved as 100% EOU units. The
necessary Board approvals are placed in respect of each unit by the
assessee on record. For Codli Unit, approval was given initially for five years,
which was subsequently extended to which we are satisfied as the revenue
did not prove that the letter issued is bogus or forged one. To decide the
issue whether all these units are engaged in any manufacturing or production
of article or thing, it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the

similar to the one provided under sec. 10<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_193">A of the Act</a> to industrial undertaking

<p id="p_427">43.5   In Chowgule &amp; Co. Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Union of India (1981) 1 SCC 653
Hon‟ble Supreme Court, after considering the judgment of Hon‟ble Bombay
High Court in Nilgiri Ceylon Tea Supplying Co. Vs. State of Bombay (1959) 10
STC 500 (Bom.), clearly observed on the question whether the blending of
ore, whilst loading it in the ship by means of the mechanical ore handling
plant, constituted „manufacture or processing or ore for sale within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_213">section 8(3)(b)</a> and Rule 13 of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_214">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, 1956.
Dealing with this question, their lordships held and observed at pages 659
and 660 of the reports as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_107">             ―It still remains to consider whether the ore blended in the
             course of loading through the mechanical ore handling plant can
             be said to undergo processing when it is blended. The answer
             to this question depends upon what is the true meaning and
             connotation of the word ―processing‖ in <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_215">Section 8(3)(b)</a> and Rule
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_108">             13. This word has not been defined in the Act and it must
             therefore be interpreted according to its plain natural meaning.
             Webster's Dictionary gives the following meaning of the word
             ‗process': ―to subject to some special process or treatment, to
             subject (especially raw material) to a process of manufacture,
             development of preparation for the market etc.; to convert into
             marketable form as livestock by slaughtering, grain by milling,
             cotton by spinning, milk by pasteurizing, fruits and vegetables
             by sorting and repacking.‖

             Where therefore any commodity is subjected to a process or
             treatment with a view to its ―development or preparation for the
             market‖, as, for example, by sorting and repacking fruits and
             vegetables, it would amount to processing of the commodity
             within the meaning of <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_216">Section 8(3)(b)</a> and Rule 13. The nature
             and extent of processing may vary from case to case; in one
             case the processing may be slight and in another it may be
             extensive; but with each process suffered, the commodity would
             experience a change. Wherever a commodity undergoes a
             change as a result of some operation performed on it or in
             regard to it, such operation would amount to processing of the
             commodity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_109">             The nature and extent of change is not material. It may be that
             camphor powder may just be compressed into camphor cubes
             by application of mechanical force or pressure without addition
             or admixture of any other material and yet the operation would
             amount to processing of camphor powder as held by the

             Calcutta High Court in Om Prakash Gupta Vs Commissioner of
             Commercial Taxes [16 STC 935 (Cal)]. What is necessary in
             order to characterize an operation as ―processing‖ is that the
             commodity must as a result of the operation, experience some
             change. Here, in the present case, diverse quantities of ore
             processing different chemical and physical compositions are
             blended together to produce ore of the requisite chemical and
             physical composition demanded by the foreign purchaser and
             obviously as a result of this blending, the quantities of ore mixed
             together in the course of loading through the mechanical ore
             handling plant experience change in their respective chemical
             and physical composition, because what is produced by such
             blending is ore of a different chemical and physical
             compositions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">             When the chemical and physical composition of each kind of ore
             which goes into the blending is changed, there can be no doubt
             that the operation of blending would amount to ―processing‖ of
             ore within the meaning of <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_217">Section 8(3)(b)</a> and Rule 13.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_111">             It is no doubt true that the blending of ore of diverse physical
             and chemical compositions is carried out by the simple act of
             physically mixing different quantities for such ore on the
             conveyor belt of the mechanical ore handling plant, but to our
             mind it is immaterial as to how the blending is done and what
             process is utilized for the purpose of blending.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_112">             What is material to consider is whether the different quantities of
             ore which are blended together in the course of loading through
             the mechanical ore handling plant undergo any change in their
             physical and chemical composition is a result of blending and so
             far as this aspect of the question is concerned, it is impossible
             to argue that they do not suffer any change in their respective
             chemical and physical compositions.</blockquote>
<p id="p_428">      Thus the Hon"ble Supreme Court accepted that there is change in
chemical compositions after processing of the iron ore in this case.From the
said decision of the Apex Court, it is apparent that Hon‟ble Apex Court held
even blending of iron ore for the purpose of export involves change in the
chemical and physical composition of iron ore. But if we look to the facts in
the impugned case of the assessee, the assessee is not only blending iron
ore but carrying out various processes as to make iron ore called crude ore
useable to Ispat Industries. The activity of the units of the assessee for
Amona and Chitradurga involved converting input into output consist of
crushing (crude ore called ROM which appeared to be pieces of rocks as we
noted during the course of hearing on the basis of sample shown to us)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">                                     134</span>

screening, washing, stacking, loading in barges, river transportation to the
boat and export in ships. The finished product which comes out are called
lumps and fines which are used for Ispat Industries and brought by the foreign
buyers. The finished product technically after processing had different name.
As shown to us during the course of hearing we noted that the lumps and
fines are entirely different from crude ore. During conversion of crude ore into
lumps and fines, waste is generated which is called tailing and discharged
into tailing pond. In Codli Unit these tailings which are in liquid form are
converted into ultra fine. In our opinion as we noted from this physical sample
also crude ore is entirely different from the lumps and fine in physical
appearance used and chemical compositions even technically names are
also different, similarly what comes as output from the input in codli unit that
is also different in physical appearance and chemical composition. We do not
agree with the learned D.R that there is not any change in physical and
chemical composition of the output than the input as is being processed in all
the three units. If we go to <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_218">section 2(29BA)</a> inserted w.e.f. 1.4.2009, we find
clause (b) of this section clearly states that bringing into existence of new and
distinct object or article or thing with a different chemical composition or
integral structure tantamount to „manufacture‟. The Crude ore once processed
is made marketable and had a different chemical and physical composition
than the ROM (Crude Ore) even though in common paralance both may be
called iron ore. It is no more remains as crude ores. Tailing no more remains
tailing but converted into a powder.In view of this clause and the decision of
Supreme Court in the case of Chowgule &amp; CO. (Supra), it can be held that
the assessee is engaged in these units in „manufacturing‟.
</p>
<p id="p_429">       Further, in CIT Vs N.C. Budharaja &amp; Co. (1993) 204 ITR 412 (SC),
Hon‟ble Supreme Court further observed that the word "production" is much
wider than the word "manufacture". It was said (page 423):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_113">       ―The word ―production‖ has a wide connotation than the word
       ―manufacture‖. While every manufacture can be characterized as
       production, every production need not amount to manufacture...</blockquote>
<p id="p_430">       The word ‗production' or ‗produce' when used in juxtaposition with the
       word ‗manufacture' takes in bringing into existence new goods by a
       process which may or may not amount to manufacture. It also takes in

       all the by-products, intermediate products and residual products which
       emerge in the course of manufacture of goods.‖

43.6   In Christian Mica Industries Ltd. Vs. State of Bihar (1961) 12 STC 150
(SC), Hon‟ble Supreme Court defined the word „production‟, albeit, in
connection with the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The definition was adopted
from the meaning ascribed to the word "production" in the Oxford English
Dictionary, as meaning "amongst other things that which is produced; a thing
that results from any action, process or effort, a product; a product of human
activity or effort". For the wide definition of the word „production‟, it has to
follow that mining activity for the purpose of production of mineral ores would
come within the ambit of the word „production‟ since ore is „a thing‟, which is
the result of human activity or effort.
</p>
<p id="p_431">43.7   According to Webster International English Dictionary, the verb
"produce" means to bring forward, beget, etc. The juxtaposition of the word
"manufacture" with „agriculture‟ and „horticulture‟ is significant and cannot be
lost sight of. The intention in employing the word "produced" obviously was to
introduce an element of volition and effort involving the employment of some
process for bringing into existence some goods.
</p>
<p id="p_432">43.8   In paragraph 7 of its in the case of Chowgule &amp; C0 (P) Ltd. Vs. UOI
(supra), Hon‟ble Apex Court also considered the question whether the
different brands of tea purchased and blended by the assesses for the
purpose producing the tea mixture could be said to have been „processed‟,

preclude the assesses from being entitled to deduct their turnover under
<a href="/doc/686068/" id="a_220">section 8(a)</a>, so as to preclude the value of the tea purchased by them. The
relevant observations made by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in this respective
are quoted and set out herein below for ready reference:

<blockquote id="blockquote_114">       ―7. The Revenue however relied on the decision of the Bombay High
       Court in Nilgiri Ceylon Tea Supplying Co. Vs. State of Bombay [10
       STC 500 (Bom HC)]. The assessees in this case were registered
       dealers in tea under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953 and they
       purchased in bulk diverse brands of tea and without the application of
       any mechanical or chemical process blended these brands of different
       qualities according to a certain formula evolved by them and sold the

tea mixture in the market. The question arose before the Sales Tax
Authorities whether the different brands of tea purchased and blended
by the assessee for the purpose of producing the tea mixture could be
said to have been ‗processed' after the purchase within the meaning of
the proviso to <a href="/doc/686068/" id="a_221">Section 8(a)</a>, so as to preclude the assesses from being
entitled to deduct from their turnover under <a href="/doc/686068/" id="a_222">Section 8(a)</a>, the value of
the tea purchased by them. The High Court of Bombay held that
different brands of tea purchased by the assesses could not be
regarded as ‗processed' within the meaning of the proviso to clause (a)
of <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_223">Section 8</a>, because there was ―not even application of mechanical
force so as to subject the commodity to a process, manufacture,
development or preparation‖ and the commodity remained in the same
condition. The argument of the Revenue before us was that this
decision of the Bombay High Court was on all fours with the present
case and if the blending of different brands of tea for the purpose of
producing a tea mixture in accordance with a formula evolved by the
assesses could not be regarded as ‗processing' of tea, equally on a
parity of reasoning, blending of ore of different chemical and physical
compositions could not be held to constitute ‗processing' of the ore.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_433">Now undoubtedly there is a close analogy between the facts of Nilgiri
Tea Company case [10 STC 500 (Bom HC)] and the facts of the
present case, but we do not think we can accept the decision of the
Bombay High Court in the Nilgiri Tea Company case [10 STC 500
(Bom HC)] as laying down the correct law. When different brands of
tea were mixed by the assessee in Nilgiri Tea Company case [10 STC
500 (Bom HC)] for the purpose of producing a tea mixture of a different
kind and quality according to a formula evolved by them, there was
plainly and indubitably processing of the different brands of tea,
because these brands of tea experienced, as a result of mixing,
qualitative change, in that the tea mixture which came into existence
was of different quality and flavor than the different brands of tea which
went into the mixture. There are, it is true, some observations in the
judgment of the Bombay High Court which seem to suggest that if
instead of manual application of energy in mixing the different brands
of tea, there had been application of mechanical force in producing the
tea mixture, the court might have come to a different conclusion and
these observations were relied upon by the Assessee, since in the
present case the blending was done by application of mechanical
force, but we do not think that is the correct test to be applied for the
purpose of determining whether there is ‗processing'. The question is
not whether there is manual application of energy or there is
application of mechanical force. Whatever be the means employed for
the purpose of carrying out the operation, it is the effect of the
operation on the commodity that is material for the purpose of
determining whether the operation constitutes ‗processing' we are
clearly of view that the blending of ore in the course of loading through
the mechanical ore handling plant amounted to ‗processing' of ore
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_224">Section 8(3)(b)</a> and Rule 13 and the mechanical
ore handling plant fell within the description of ―machinery, plant,
equipment‖ used in the processing of ore for sale...... ―

<p id="p_434">43.10 Therefore, Hon‟ble Supreme Court, in construing the expression
"processing" allowed the appeal of the assessee, in Chowgule &amp; Co. Pvt. Ltd.
(supra), holding, inter alia, that where any commodity is subjected to a
process or treatment with a view to its "development or preparation for the
market" it would amount to processing of the commodity within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_225">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, 1956. Hon‟ble Supreme Court, in the said judgment,
did not consider the expression "manufacture" since the question was
decided only on the expression "processing". However, considering the
judgment of the Bombay High Court in the case of Nilgiri Tea Co. [1959] 10
STC 500, Hon‟ble Supreme Court observed that, for the purpose of producing
a tea mixture of a different kind and quality according to a formula evolved by

change, in that the tea mixture which came into existence was of a quality

<p id="p_435">43.11 Hon‟ble Kerala High Court had the occasion to consider whether
assessee is engaged in the manufacture or production of an article or thing
when assessee was exclusively engaged in blending, packaging and export
of tea bags, tea packets and bulk tea packs in the case of Tata Tea Ltd. Vs.
ACIT 338 ITR 285. The assessee‟s unit was recognized as 100% EOU. The
assessee claimed exemption u/s 10B of the Act for the assessment year
1996-97 onwards which was granted up to the assessment year 2000-2001,
but for the assessment years 2001-02 and 2002-03 the exemption was
denied for the reason that by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_226">Finance Act</a>, 2000, the definition of
‟manufacture‟ which included processing contained in sec. 10B of the Act was
deleted w.e.f. 01/04/2001. (The same reasoning as has been given by the
coordinate bench in the case of Chowgule &amp; co. ITA 162 &amp; 184 heavily relied
by the department under para 14 of their order dt. 12.7.2007.) Hon‟ble High
court noted in that case that the Revenue‟s stand is that manufacture or
production had liberal meaning under the definition clause contained in
<a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_227">section 10B</a> of the Act until its deletion which covers even processing and,
therefore, blending and packaging of tea for export was treated as
„manufacture‟ or „production‟ of an article qualifying for exemption. Hon‟ble
Kerala High Court considered the contention of the assessee that the scheme
of income tax exemption available to units in the SEZ u/s 10<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_228">A of the Act</a> and
units in the free trade zone provided u/s 10AA of the Act and the exemption
available to 100% EOU u/s 10B of the Act are very similar in nature and the
wordings of the statutory provisions are similar in nature. Hon‟ble Kerala High
Court also considered the judgment in the decision of Supreme Court in Tara
Agencies (292 ITR 444 (SC) relied upon by the Sr. Standing Counsel for the
revenue, wherein Hon‟ble Supreme Court clearly held that blending of tea
does not amount to „manufacture‟ or „production‟ of an article or thing, but is
only processing. Hon‟ble High Court allowing the appeal of the assessee held
that the assessee was exclusively engaged in blending and packing of tea for
export and was not manufacturing or producing any other article or thing. It
was recognized as a 100% EOU division and the Department had no case
that the assessee‟s unit engaged in export of tea bags and tea packets was
not a 100% EOU. If exemption was denied on the ground that products

exported were not produced or manufactured in the industrial units of the
assessee‟s 100% EOU, it would defeat the very object of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_229">section 10B</a> of the
Act. (similar to assessee‟s case). Further, industrial units engaged in the very
same activity, i.e., blending, packing and export of tea in the special economic
zones and free trade zones, would continue to enjoy tax exemption under
<a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_230">section 10A</a> of the Act and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_231">section 10AA</a> of the Act respectively. The
assessee was allowed exemption on the profit derived by its 100% EOU
engaged in blending, packing and export of tea bags and tea packets.
Hon‟ble High Court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_118">      ―The finding of this court is that the purpose of incorporation of <a href="/doc/1165347/" id="a_232">section
      2(r)</a> of the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005, into <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_233">section 10AA</a> of the
      Income-tax Act is to provide a liberal meaning to the word
      ―manufacture‖ which takes in even blending, refrigeration, etc. It was
      noticed by this court that the definitions of ―manufacture‖ contained in
      the above definition clauses are very liberal which takes in even
      processing like blending. The contention of the counsel for the
      assessee is that the purpose of removal of the definition of
      ―manufacture‖ from <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_234">section 10B</a> was not to provide a restricted
      meaning for that term contained in the main section because if that
      was so, then the Legislature would have only modified the definition
      clause. Further, the definition of 100 per cent export oriented unit even
      after the amendment is retained in the said section, which defines it as
      an undertaking which has been approved as a 100 per cent export
      oriented undertaking by the Board appointed in this behalf by the
      Central Government in exercise of powers conferred by <a href="/doc/800551/" id="a_235">section 40</a> of
      the Industries (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_236">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951, and the Rules
      made under that Act. It is pertinent to note the products for which the
      assessee's unit is recognized as a 100 per cent export oriented unit
      are tea bags, tea in packets and tea in bulk packs. In fact, the
      assessee is exclusively engaged in blending and packing of tea for
      export and is not manufacturing or producing any other article or thing.
      Still it is recognized as a 100 per cent export oriented unit by the
      concerned authority within the meaning of that term contained in the
      definition clause of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_237">section 10B</a> of the Income-tax Act and the
      Department has no case that the assessee's unit engaged in export of
      tea bags and tea packets is not a 100 per cent export oriented unit. So
      much so, in our view, if exemption is denied on the ground that
      products exported are not produced or manufactured in the industrial
      unit of the assessee's 100 per cent export oriented unit, the same
      would defeat the very object of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_238">section 10B</a>. Further, industrial units
      engaged in the very same activity, i.e., blending, packing and export of
      tea in the special economic zones and free trade zones, will continue
      to enjoy tax exemption under <a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_239">section 10A</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_240">section 10AA</a>
      respectively. The still worse position is that the appellant would be
      denied of export exemption available under <a href="/doc/30524/" id="a_241">section 80HHC</a> even to a
      merchant exporter. In our view, the decision of the Supreme Court in
      Tara Agencies' case [2007] 292 ITR 444 (SC) is not applicable for the
      purpose of considering exemption for industries in the export

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">                                      140</span>

      processing zones, free trade zones and to 100 per cent export oriented
      units covered by <a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_242">sections 10A</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_243">10AA</a> and <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_244">10B</a> of the Income-tax Act.</blockquote>
<p id="p_436">      Therefore, following the judgment of this court above referred to we
      hold that the assessee is entitled to exemption on the profit derived by
      its 100 per cent export oriented unit engaged in blending, packing and
      export of tea bags and tea packets. Consequently, we allow the
      appeals by reversing the orders of the Tribunal and by restoring the
      orders of the first appellate authority declaring the appellant's
      entitlement for exemption.‖

43.12 Hon‟ble high court in this case, in our opinion, has clearly laid down
that once the assessee is recognized as a 100% EOU for engaging in an
activity and assessee is engaged in the same very activity, if the exemption is
denied to the assessee on the ground that there is no production or
manufacturing but only processing of the products exported in the 100%
export oriented unit, the same would defeat the very object of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_245">section 10B</a>.
The Hon‟ble high court took the view that the decision of the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in Tara Agency‟s case 292 ITR 444 will not apply even though
Hon‟ble Supreme Court in that case has held that blending of tea does not
amount to manufacture or production of an article but is only processing.
Thus, the Hon‟ble Kerala high court in the case of Tata Tea Ltd. (supra) gave
the clear cut finding impliedly that even if the assessee is engaged in
processing and is recognized as 100% EOU, it will be entitled for exemption
claimed u/s 10B of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_437">43.13 The crux of the submissions of the Ld. special Counsel for the
department is that the assessee is engaged in these 100% export oriented
units only in processing of iron ore and by processing it get it upgraded for
export, therefore it is not entitled for exemption u/s 10B does not have any
leg to stand in view of the decision of Kerala High Court (supra), Supreme
Court in the case of Chowgule &amp; Co(supra). Even on this issue we have
gone through the decision of Hon‟ble Special Bench in the case of Madhu
Jayanti International Ltd. and Others Vs. DCIT. The question for consideration
and decision of the Special Bench was:

<blockquote id="blockquote_119">      ―Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the

No. 1463/Kol/2007 were that the assessee was engaged in the business of
manufacturing, processing, exporting and dealing in various commodities,
more particularly tea, coffee, jute, pepper, chillies, cardamom, turmeric and
similar other spices, etc. The assessee, as per the claim is a 100% EOU
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_248">section 10B</a> of the I.T. Act, 1961 and claimed
exemption under that section. The assessee buys tea from auctions held in
Tea Board recognized Auction centres at Kolkata, Guwahati, Siliguri, Cochin,
Coimbatore and Coonoor. The assessee conceded the factual position that it
imports small quantity of tea of the type and quality not produced in India. It
further conceded the factual position that it does not grow or manufacture any
tea. According to the assessee, tea so bought in different auctions is
processed with a view to remove all dust and foreign substances and
thereafter it blends different varieties of tea to make it of „uniform and
consistent‟ quality throughout the year. Thereafter, it is packed in consumer
packets of 50, 100, 250, 500 or 1000 gms. Etc. or packed in the form of tea
bags of 1.94 gms. Or 2 gms. etc., as the case may be. The assessee claimed
exemption u/s 10B of the Act in respect of its 100% EOU for export of
manufactured jute bags, packet tea, tea bags, bulk tea, etc. The AO rejected
the claim of assessee of exemption u/s 10B in respect of export of blending of
tea. The rejection of exemption u/s 10B was confirmed by the CIT(A). When

 The aforesaid definition of the expression "manufacture", although

ground that Parliament had taken note of ground reality in inserting

packaging and export of tea bags, tea packets and bulk tea packs in its
modern factory, well equipped with all imported and sophisticated
automatic plant and machineries with the help of over 100 workmen
engaged on contract basis through M/s. Trot Pvt. Ltd. The
manufacturing'. operations are carried in its said factory situated at 19/4A,
Munshiganj Road (under Falta Export Processing Zone), Kolkata. We find
from facts of the case that the details of turnover of the assessee shows
Bulk Tea (0.94%), Packet Tea and Tea Bags .(99.06%),. as. per different
descriptions, brand names and varieties, as listed APR. Assessee

(excluding rejects not exceeding 5%) would have to be exported and that its
registered EOU Unit shall make value addition to a minimum extent of
79%. Undisputedly, the exported consumer products, blended by

<p id="p_446">34. The subject for consideration under <a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_262">sections 10A</a> and/or 10B of the
said Act is manufacture / production of tea ; the object being grant of
benefits of tax exemption to exporters carrying out their operations in
FTZ, EOU, EPZ &amp; SEZ areas in accordance with the Exim Policy declared
by the Government of India in Parliament and in the light of allied and
governing laws; in the light of allied laws e.g. <a href="/doc/1992542/" id="a_263">The Tea Act</a>, 1953, <a href="/doc/32969400/" id="a_264">The
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act</a>, 1953 read with Prevention of Food
Adulteration Rules, 1955. The Tea (Marketing) Control Order, 2003, The
Tea (Distribution &amp; Export) Control Order, 2005 as well as the Rules and
Regulations framed by the Tea Board and also Calcutta Tea Traders
Association from time to time as discussed above.
</p>
<p id="p_447">35. We find from the above facts and circumstances and case laws relied
on by both the sides that the assessee was exclusively engaged in
blending, packaging and export of tea bags, tea packets and bulk tea
packs. The assessee's division enjoys recognition as a 100% EOU, which
is granted by the Development Commissioner, Ministry of Commerce &amp;
Industry, Govt. of India. The assessee claimed exemption u/s. 10B of
the Act for AYs 2000-01 onwards, which was granted upto the AY 2003-
</p><p id="p_448">04. However, for the AY 2004-05, exemption was declined for the reasons
that by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_265">Finance Act</a>, 2000, the definition of `manufacture' which
included 'processing' contained in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_266">section 1OB</a> of the Act was deleted
w.e.f. 01.04.2001. The argument of the department is that manufacture
or production had liberal meaning under the definition clause contained

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">                                144</span>
                                                       ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

in <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_267">section 10B</a> of the Act until its deletion which covers even processing
and, therefore, blending "and packaging of tea for export was treated as
'manufacture' or 'production' of an article qualifying for exemption. We are
of the considered view that the contention of the assessee that the scheme
of income tax exemption available to units in the SEZ u/s. TOA of the Act
and units in the free trade zone provided u/s, 10AA of the Act and the
exemption available to 100% EOU u/s. 1OB of the Act are very similar in
nature and the wordings of the statutory provisions are similar in nature is
correct. We find that Hon'ble Kerala High Court also considered the
judgment in-the decision of Supreme Court in Tara Agencies, supra
relied on by the Ld. CIT, DR, wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court clearly
held that blending of tea does not amount to 'manufacture' or
'production' of an article, but is only processing. We find that the
assessee was exclusively engaged in blending and packing of tea for
export and was not manufacturing or producing any other article or thing. It
was recognised as a 100% EOU division and the Department had no case
that the assessee's unit engaged in export of tea bags and tea packets
was not a 100% EOU. If exemption was denied on the ground that
products exported were not produced or manufactured in the industrial
unit of the assessee's 100% EOU, it would defeat the very object of
<a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_268">sections 10B</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_449">36. We, in view of the above, hold that when the products for which the
assessee's unit is recognized as a 100% EOU are tea bags, tea in packets
and tea in bulk packs and the assessee is exclusively engaged in blending
and packing of tea for export may not be manufacturer or producer of any
other article or thing in common parlance. However, for the purpose of
<a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_269">Section 10A</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_270">10AA</a> and <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_271">10B</a>, we have to consider the definition of the word
"manufacture" as defined in Section 2(r) of SEZ Act, Exim Policy, Food
Adulteration Rules, 1955, Tea (Marketing) Control Order, 2003, etc. We
also find that the definition of 'manufacture' as per Section 2(r) of the SEZ
Act, 2005 is incorporated in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_272">Section 10AA</a> of the Income-tax act with effect
from 10.02.2006. Hon'ble Kerala High Court in the case of Girnar
Industries (supra) had held such amendment in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_273">Section 10AA</a> to be of
clarificatory in nature. The definition of 'manufacture' under the SEZ Act,
Exim Policy, Food Adulteration Rules and Tea (Marketing) Control Order is
much wider than what is the meaning of the term `manufacture' under the
common parlance, and it includes processing, blending, packaging etc. In
view of the above and respectfully following the decision of Hon'ble Kerala
High Court in the case of Girnar Industries (supra) and Tata Tea Limited
(supra), we "hold that the assessee is entitled for exemption under
<a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_274">Section 10B</a> of the Act on account of blending of tea. Similarly, in our
view, the industrial units engaged in the very same activity i.e. blending,
packing and export of tea in the free trade zone shall also be entitled to
enjoy tax exemption under <a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_275">Section 10A</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_450">37. Accordingly, we answer the question referred in favour of the assessee
by holding that the assessees who are in the business of blending and
processing of tea and export thereof, in 100% EOUs are manufacturer/
producer of the tea for the purpose of claiming exemption u/s.10B of the
Act. Further, assessees who are in the business of blending and
processing of tea hi respect of undertakings in free trade zones are


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">                                145</span>
                                                                 ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

           manufacturer/producer of tea for the purpose of claiming exemption u/s.
           10<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_276">A of the Act</a>. We have examined and discussed the facts in the case of
           Madhu Jayanti International Ltd. and found that there is blending of tea
           and consequently the assessee is eligible for exemption u/s. 10B of the
           Act as prayed for. Their appeal for the AY 2004-05 is allowed. As
           regards other appeals and that of the interveners, the matters are
           restored back to the Division Bench, with directions to decide those
           appeals in the light of principle laid down herein, so far as the claim for
           relief u/s. 10A or 10B of the Act in accordance with law.‖



44.1 From the reading of para 35 of the aforesaid judgment we noted that the
Special Bench in this case clearly held that the assessee was engaged only
in processing and was not engaged in the manufacture or production but had
ultimately under para 36 it took the view in view of the fact that the definition
of „manufacture‟ u/s 2(r) of the SEZ Act, 2005 which is incorporated in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_277">section
10AA</a> w.e.f. 10/02/2006 includes „processing‟. Therefore, following the
decision of Kerala High Court in the case of Girnar Industries and Tata Tea
Ltd. (which was discussed by us in the preceding paragraphs) held that the
assessee is entitled for exemption u/s 10B of the Act on account of blending
of tea.
</p>
<p id="p_451">45.       We have also gone through the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Indian Cine Agencies Vs CIT 308 ITR 98. In this case the question before the
Hon‟ble Supreme Court was: When the assessee was engaged in the activity
of cutting jumbo roll films into flat and small rolls in desired sizes, whether
such activity undertaken by the assessee was manufacture or production? In
this case, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court after discussing various cases, the
provisions of different Acts and the dictionary meaning took the view that the
assessee was engaged in manufacture / production. While holding so under
para 12 of its order, Hon‟ble Supreme Court has given the same analogy for
the purpose of eligibility of deduction under <a href="/doc/1509788/" id="a_278">section 80HH</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_279">80-I</a> as has
been given by the Kerala High Court in the case of Tata Tea discussed herein
above for the purpose of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_280">section 10B</a>, that if there was no manufacturing
activity, then the question of referring to item 10 of Eleventh Schedule for the
purpose of exclusion does not arise. From this judgment, thus, it is apparent
that the Hon‟ble Apex Court accepted that manufacture/production includes
processing also.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">                                          146</span>
<p id="p_452">                                                            ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

45.1   We have also gone through the decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in
the case of ITO Vs. Arihant Tiles and Marbles Pvt. Ltd. 320 ITR 79(sc). In this
case when the assessee was engaged in the activity of cutting and polishing
of marble blocks, the question before the Supreme Court was whether the
activities undertaken by the assessee would fall within the meaning of the
words „manufacture or production‟ in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_281">section 80-IA</a> of the Income-tax Act,
1961? In this case, Hon‟ble Supreme Court, after discussing the definition of
„manufacture‟ given in <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_282">section 2(29BA)</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and also
discussing the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_283">section 80-IA(2)(iii)</a> and after going through
various decisions, held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_122">       "22. Applying the above tests laid down by this Court in CIT Vs. N.C.
       Budharaja and Co. 204 ITR 412 (SC) to the facts of the present cases,
       we are of the view that blocks converted into polished slabs and tiles
       after undergoing the process indicated above certainly results in
       emergence of a new and distinct commodity. The original block does
       not remain the marble block, it becomes a slab or tile. In the
       circumstances, not only there is manufacture but also an activity which
       is something beyond manufacture and which brings a new product into
       existence and, therefore, on the facts of these cases, we are of the
       view that the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the
       activity undertaken by the respondents-assessees did constitute
       manufacture or production in terms of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_284">Section 80IA</a> of the Income Tax
       Act, 1961.</blockquote>
<p id="p_453">       23. Before concluding, we would like to make one observation. If the
       contention of the Department is to be accepted, namely that the activity
       undertaken by the respondents herein is not a manufacture, then, it
       would have serious revenue consequences. As stated above, each of
       the respondents is paying excise duty, some of the respondents are
       job workers and the activity undertaken by them has been recognized
       by various Government Authorities as manufacture. To say that the
       activity will not amount to manufacture or production under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_285">Section
       80IA</a> will have disastrous consequences, particularly in view of the fact
       that the assessees in all the cases would plead that they were not
       liable to pay excise duty, sales tax etc. because the activity did not
       constitute manufacture. Keeping in mind the above factors, we are of
       the view that in the present cases, the activity undertaken by each of
       the respondents constitutes manufacture or production and, therefore,
       they would be entitled to the benefit of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_286">Section 80IA</a> of the Income Tax
       Act, 1961.‖

45.2   In this case also, Hon‟ble Supreme Court took the view that cutting and
polishing of the marble blocks is the activity which constitutes „manufacture or
production‟ as after processing marble block no more remains as marble



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">                                      147</span>

block. This decision has also duly considered, in our opinion, whether the
activity of processing is manufacture / production.
</p>
<p id="p_454">45.3   Now, we would like to deal with the submissions of the revenue
whether this issue should be sent to Special Bench or not. We have gone
through the decision of this Tribunal in ITA No. 162/PNJ/2006 dt. 12 th July,
2007 read with Misc. Application in MA No. 23/PNJ/2007 dt. 19th July, 2007 in
the case of Chowgule &amp; Co. In this case we noted that the coordinate Bench
of the Tribunal has interpreted the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in
the case of Sesa Goa 271 ITR 331 that extraction and processing of mining
ore amounts to production; and one should read the expression „extraction
and processing‟ together (this decision was not rendered in respect of
exemption available u/s 10B). Even the coordinate bench of this Tribunal
further held that ―if <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_287">section 10B</a> provides exemption for processing also, the
law would have made it very clear by apparently stating that processing is
also entitled for exemption. When the expression ‗processing' is omitted in
<a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_288">section 10B</a>, we are not supposed to fill up the omission. If something is not
there we should accept as it is not there. We should not provide for the
omission that amounts to judicial legislation. There is no confusion in the
provision of law provided under <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_289">section 10B</a>. The exemption is available only
to manufacture or production. It is not available for processing.‖ Although
subsequently this Tribunal has rectified the order under <a href="/doc/1350584/" id="a_290">section 254</a> vide
order dated 19th July, 2007 on the application of the assessee and took the
view that the assessee is entitled for exemption under <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_291">section 10B</a> as the
assessee-company itself is extracting the entire iron ore from own mines and
mines taken on lease and thereafter processing the same. We cannot look
into the finding of the coordinate Bench whether they have correctly
interpreted the decision of Supreme Court in 271 ITR 331 or not. The Ld. AR
vehemently contended that the decision dt. 12th July, 2007 of this Tribunal in
that case got overruled by the decision of this Tribunal vide order dt. 19 th July,
2007 but we do not agree on this with the Ld. AR. We have gone through the
order dt. 12th July, 2007 as well as order dt. 19th July, 2007 but we noted that
the Tribunal rectified the order as the Tribunal noted the assessee itself was
extracting the entire ores and processing the same. Thus, the assessee
complied with both the conditions of extracting and processing of iron ore.
This Tribunal did not reverse the finding that the processing is not entitled for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_152">                                       148</span>

the exemption. The Tribunal did not reverse the finding that extraction and
processing should go together. Even that bench / tribunal did not visualize
that 100% EOU is approved for a particular location and its boundry cannot
extend beyond that location. It is only the profit derived by the 100% EOU
Unit situated within that location, can be regarded to be the profit derived by
the 100% EOU. The assessee in that case has taken the mines on lease
which were not approved as part of 100% EOU but still the assessee was
allowed exemption u/s 10B even though the iron ore extracted from those
mines which were taken on lease were not part of the 100% EOU

45.4     No doubt the decision of the coordinate Bench is binding on us in
view of the settled judicial principles in the various decisions even relied on by
the Ld. CCIT but there are certain exceptions to this cardinal principle of
judicial discipline. Once the decision of Special Bench or Third Member has
come on similar issue subsequently, the decision of the Special Bench will be
binding on us. If the decision of jurisdictional high court / supreme court has
come subsequently on the similar issue, in view of the <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_292">Article 141</a> of the
Constitution of India that decision will be binding on us. Even this will be
regarded a mistake of law in view of the decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1746188/" id="a_293">CIT vs Saurashtra Kutch Stock Exchange</a> 305 ITR 227 (SC).If
there is no jurisdictional high court decision and subsequently any other high
court has decided the similar issue, this is the settled principle of law that the
decision of that high court has to be followed as the high court is always
superior to the tribunal in preference to the decision of coordinate bench. The
decision so pronounced subsequently if affects the issue relating to the
assessee, in our opinion, these subsequent decisions are binding on us as
judicial discipline require that.   This Tribunal is bound to consider those
decisions and the Tribunal is not bound with the decision of the coordinate
Bench. The jurisdictional Bombay High Court in the case of H.A. Shah &amp; Co.
Vs. CIT (1956) 30 ITR 618, 625 (Bom.) even took the view that in case fresh
material facts came to the knowledge of subsequent bench, the decision of
coordinate bench is not binding. In this regard, Hon‟ble High Court observed
as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_123">       ―Nor are we satisfied that in order to enable the second Tribunal to
       depart from the finding of the first Tribunal it is essential that there
       must be some fresh facts which must be placed before the second

       Tribunal which were not placed before the first Tribunal. If the first
       Tribunal failed to take into consideration material facts, facts which had
       a considerable bearing upon the ultimate decision, and if the second
       Tribunal was satisfied that the decision was arrived at because of the
       failure to take into consideration those material facts and that if these
       material facts had been taken into consideration the decision would
       have been different, then the second Tribunal would be in the same
       position to revise the earlier decision as if fresh facts had been placed
       before it. On principle there is not much difference between fresh facts
       being placed before the second Tribunal and the second Tribunal
       taking into consideration certain material facts which the first Tribunal
       failed to take into consideration‖.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_455">45.5   The other exception is for non-binding of the coordinate Bench
decision is when there had been amendment in law subsequent to the
decision on the basis of which the coordinate bench rendered the decision
and the co-ordinate Bench could not be able to consider the said
amendments, the decision of the co-ordinate Bench is not binding. From para
14 of the order of the Co-ordinate Bench it is apparently clear while deciding
the appeal in the case of Chowgule &amp; Co. (ITA 162 &amp; 184), it had got
impressed that the expression "processing" is omitted in <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_294">Section 10B</a>. The
appeal relates to A.Y.2002-03 not relating to impugned A.Y. Clause (iii) of
Explanation 1 to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_295">section 1OAA</a>, which lays down that the expression
"manufacture" shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in <a href="/doc/1165347/" id="a_296">section 2(r)</a> of the
Special Economic Zones Act, 2005, and <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_297">section 2(29BA)</a> were subsequently brought
into the statute after the rendering of the decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in
the case of Sesa Goa 271 ITR on the basis of Co-ordinate bench decided the
case of Chowgule &amp; Co. Even these provisions were not in the statute during
the assessment year 2002-03 to which year the co-ordinate bench was
entrusted with the issue of claim of exemption u/s 10B. The co-ordinate bench
could not have any occasion to consider the same even though the clause (iii)
of explanation 1 to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_298">section 10AA</a> has already come into force after the
decision of Hon‟ble Apex court in the case of Sesa Goa Ltd 271 ITR 331
when the decisions was rendered but was not inserted with retrospective
effect. Even the provision of <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_299">Section 2(29BA)</a> was also inserted after the
decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of Sesa Goa Ltd(supra). Both

that year for which case was decided. Both these amendments have duly
been considered by the subsequent decision of Special Bench, High Court
and the Supreme Court cited by us in discussion held here in above. We
noted that subsequent to the decision of this Tribunal in ITA No.
162/PNJ/2006 dt. 12th July, 2007, the Special Bench of this Tribunal in the
case of Madhu Jayanti International Ltd. [2012-TIOL-424-ITAT-KOL-SB] has
dealt with the issue exhaustibly whether the assessees who are in the
business of blending of tea i.e processing of tea and export thereof in 100%
EOU can be said to be manufacturer / producer of tea for the purpose of
<a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_301">section 10A</a>/<a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_302">10B</a>. When the Supreme Court has already held in the case of
Tara Agencies 292 ITR 444 that blending of tea is processing. Thus, the
Special Bench has decided the issue in respect of 100% EOU for the purpose
of exemption under <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_303">section 10B</a> whether an assessee who is engaged in
processing can be said to be engaged in manufacture / processing. We also
noted that Kerala High Court in the case of Tata Tea Ltd. Vs. ACIT 338 ITR
285 dealt with the issue in respect of 100% EOU for the purpose of exemption
under <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_304">section 10B</a> whether the processing of tea is treated as manufacture or
production of an article qualifying for exemption. Not only these decisions
subsequent to the decision of the coordinate Bench, Supreme Court has also
decided following cases in which also, in our opinion, similar issue whether
processing is manufacture or production has been decided. These decisions
are given as under:-

<p id="p_459">45.6    We noted that in all these decisions except in the case of Oracle

       ―The Tribunal being the last fact-finding authority, a higher

       Court and if there is no direct authority of the Supreme Court on the

45.7   We noted that the coordinate Bench in the case of Chowgule &amp; Co.
</blockquote><p id="p_460">Ltd. ITA No. 162/PNJ/2006 decided the issue only on the basis of the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of CIT Vs. Gem India
Manufacturing Co. 249 ITR 307, while the said decision has not been
followed by the Supreme Court in their subsequent decisions. Even the case
relate to A.Y.2002-03. No contrary decision subsequent to the decision of the
Special Bench, Kerala High Court and that of the Supreme Court rendered in
the case of India Cine Agency (supra) as well as Arihant Tiles &amp; Marbles
(Supra) was brought to our knowledge which may have taken a different view
that 100% EOU approved by the competent authority if engaged in
processing activity for upgrading a commodity for the purpose of marketability
for export would not be allowed exemption u/s 10B. The Ld. Special Counsel
even could not bring to our knowledge any decision subsequent to the
decision of the Special Bench and Arihant Tiles &amp; Marbles (SC) as well as
Kerala High Court in the case of Tata Tea (Supra) which would have
disallowed the claim of the assessee u/s 10B on this basis after considering
the Explanation (iii) of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_306">section 10AA</a> as well as definition given u/s 2(29BA).
Thus, due to the decision rendered by the Special Bench, High Courts and
Supreme Court subsequent to the date of order in the case of Chowgule &amp;
Co. Ltd. Vs. ACIT in ITA No. 162/PNJ/2006 in our opinion, the issue raised by
the Revenue is not fit to be referred to Special Bench as the decisions of
Special Bench / High Court / Supreme Court are binding on us in preference
to the decision of the coordinate Bench. Thus, we have in our opinion
germane reason not to refer this issue for constitution of a Special Bench as
in our opinion even if the Special Bench is constituted the earlier decision of
the Special Bench in the case of Madhu Jayanti will be binding until and
unless there are special and germane reasons for constituting a large Special

Bench. We, therefore, dismiss the application dt. 18/01/2013 moved by the
Revenue for constituting the Special Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_461">45.8   Now coming back to the issue whether an assessee who is engaged in
processing for upgrading and making the commodity fit for export and which
is a 100% EOU approved by the competent authority can be said to have
been engaged in manufacture or production of an article or thing. We have
noted that this issue is duly covered by the decision of the Special Bench in
the case of Madhu Jayanti International Ltd.(supra). The relevant paragraph
of this judgement has been reproduced by us in the preceding paras.
</p>
<p id="p_462">45.9   In this decision, Special Bench has exhaustively dealt with the
provisions of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_307">section 10B</a>, <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_308">section 2(29BA)</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and
<a href="/doc/1165347/" id="a_309">section 2(r)</a> of the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005; and the various
decisions of the Supreme Court as well as the High Court which dealt with the
similar issue and even the decision of Chowgule &amp; CO (SC) as was referred
to by us in the preceding paras herein above. The Special Bench clearly
noted in this decision, the decision of the Supreme Court in Tara Agencies‟
case 292 ITR 444 in which it was held blending and packing of tea amounts
to processing and is not manufacturing or producing of an article or thing. In
this decision the Special Bench also noted that Kerala High Court in the case
of Tata Tea Ltd. Vs. ACIT 338 ITR 285 (Ker.) which took the view that 100%
EOU engaged in processing cannot be denied exemption on the basis that
the units are not engaged in manufacture or production. Moreover, on facts
exactly similar to the facts of the assessee, in the case of Chowgule &amp; Co.
Pvt. Ltd. Vs Union Of India (1981) 1 SCC 653 AIR 1981 SC 014, Hon‟ble
Supreme Court were concerned with the question whether the blending of
ore, whilst loading it in the ship by means of the mechanical ore handling
plant, constituted „manufacture‟ or „processing‟ of ore for sale within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_310">section 8(3)(b)</a> and Rule 13 of <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_311">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, 1956. The
Hon‟ble Supreme Court, in construing the expression "processing" allowed
the appeal of the assessee, in Chowgule &amp; Co. Pvt. Ltd. (supra), holding, inter
alia, that where any commodity is subjected to a process or treatment with a
view to its "development or preparation for the market" it would amount to
processing of the commodity within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_312">Central Sales Tax Act</a>,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_157">                                     153</span>

1956. The Special Bench ultimately allowed exemption to the assessee on
the similar issue where the assessee was engaged in the business of
blending the tea for upgrading for marketing. Thus, in view of the decision of
the Special Bench and other decisions discussed in the preceding paragraphs
and that of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of Chowgule &amp; co (supra) as
well as definition of „manufacture‟ as inserted w.e.f 1.4.2009 by way of <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_313">section
2</a> (29AB) of the Income Tax Act as referred to by both the parties, we hold
that all the three 100% EOU engaged in processing so as to make crude ore
and waste i.e tailings usable or marketable are entitled for exemption u/s 10B
subject to the other conditions for exemption under <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_314">section 10B</a> are being
fulfilled.
</p>
<p id="p_463">45.10 Now, we will deal with the contention whether the assessee has set
new units or has merely reconstructed the business which was already in
existence. We noted that the assessee had made the following investments
in installing the Plant &amp; Machinery in these EOUs:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_25">    Fin.Year           Amona                Chitradurga                 Codli

</pre><p id="p_464">The contention of the assessee is that it had set up all these units as new
units and had also got the approval for them from the competent authority as
100% EOU units. The old machinery and part of old machineries wherever
used, the value of these machineries were less than 20% in each units. The
old units situated in Amona, Chtradurga and Codli were eroded, non-
productive and non-economical. The revenue has strongly contended that
none of these units even though 100% EOU but were setup long ago. The
assessee had merely renovated these units during the period as claimed by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">                                      154</span>

the assessee. The revenue on the other hand accepted that the assessee
had invested in Amona plant Rs.3,96,10,020/- during the year 2002-03 and in
Chitradurga unit during F.Y. 2005-06 to 2008-09 Rs.8,33,34,046/- but the
assessee had not submitted any evidence in respect of the investments made
in the Codli unit and in which year. We noted that CIT(A) in his appellate
order at page nos. 48-50 has given „Depreciation Charts‟ in respect of Plant &amp;
Machinery previously Used at Amona plant. Likewise, at page nos. 65-66
similar charts in respect of Chitradurga unit have been given. Column
„Additions‟ has been left blank. These charts have been compiled by the
CIT(A) or by the department. This gives an impression as if no addition to
plant &amp; machinery had been made during the financial years concerned in
these plants by the assessee while we verified from page 45 to 58 of first PB
that there are additions in the plant and machinery of the units. This fact is
also verifiable from the minutes of the Board meeting and schedule of fixed
assets forming part of the Balance sheet for the respective financial years,
which were duly audited. The assessee produced the following documents in
support of the fresh capital investment made by it in acquisition of plant &amp;
machinery for its EOUs in each relevant financial year:

<p id="p_465">45.11 These evidences clearly prove, in our opinion, that the assessee
made huge investments in these units. Even the assessee submitted the
evidences for selling the old and obsolete dismantled machines as scrap
sales. We do agree that the assessee had not reduced the block of assets
with these amounts but this in our opinion will not change the true character
of the transaction. We find force in the submission of the assessee that in the
case of Amona EOU, old unit set-up in 1985 had become outdated, obsolete,
even dangerous and uneconomical to run after a span of 17 years. Therefore,
the assessee had to take an immediate action to either abandon it or revamp
it entirely. This fact is also proved with the fact that the production capacity of
this plant which was 1 MTPA earlier got doubled at 2 MTPA coupled with
further flexibility created to increase it more in future after setting up new unit.
The newly increased production capacity had not been denied by the
revenue.    The cost of new plant and machinery for all major / critical
processes and civil structures for those plants amounted to Rs. 3,96,10,020/-
during the FY 2002-03, whereas the WDV of the old plant used in the new
undertaking was just Rs. 26,17,714/-, which is a mere 6.7% of the cost of new
plant &amp; machinery, i.e., within the permissible limit of 20%. The CIT(A), in our
opinion, was not correct in comparing the number of machines and
equipments installed in mining division to be part of old plant and machinery
installed in 100% EOU Units when in fact mining division is not part of 100%
EOU as per the application made by the assessee and the approval allowed
by the competent authorities to ascertain whether substantial expansion had
taken place in the FY 2002-03 at Amona plant or not. Similarly, we find force
in the submissions of the Ld. AR in the absence of any contrary evidence that
the present unit in Chitradurga, Karnataka was initially set-up and run by a
company called M/s A. Narrain Mines Ltd. The said company was acquired by
the assessee-company in the FY 1998-99 and it was later merged into the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_160">                                        156</span>
                                                                   ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

assessee-company. The existing plant in the said unit was quite old and had
become inefficient due to the completion of its economic life. The assessee
undertook a project to set up a new undertaking during the FY 2005-06 in a
phased     manner     to   increase       the   capacity     by     employing        latest
technology/facility in place of existing production facility. The assessee
applied to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board vide its application
dated 09/09/2005 for its Consent for Establishment under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_315">Air
Act</a>s for expansion of iron ore mining capacity from 1.6 MTPA to 2.5 MTPA.
Subsequently, the management of the company also underwent a change
from     Mitsui   group     with    M/s     Vedanta        Group.      Due      to     this
expansion/establishment project could be completed during the FY 2008-09
in three phases having a total production capacity of 6 MTPA. The
investments were made in a phased manner which resulted in creation of new
unit in place of the existing unit. In the FY 2005-06, i.e., the initial year for the
purpose of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_316">section 10B</a>, total investment of Rs. 93,84,633/- was made in
acquisition of new plant &amp; machinery including dismantling of the old plant &amp;
structures. The phase-II of project establishment was completed next year,
i.e., FY 2006-07 in which fresh capital investment of Rs. 35,67,257/- was
made in plant &amp; machinery. Finally the third phase of new plant was
completed in the FY 2008-09 with an addition of Rs.7,03,82,158/- to plant &amp;
machinery. The WDV as on 01/04/2005 of the plant &amp; machinery at
Chitradurga was just Rs.6,93,596/- which was either dismantled completely or
wherever structural steel was usable it was utilized in the erection of new
machinery. The cost of new machinery acquired in FY 2005-06 was Rs.
93,84,633/-. Thus, the value of plant &amp; machinery existing as on 01/04/2005
was merely 7.4% of the cost of new plant &amp; machinery; which is also within
the permissible limit. The accounts books in that year were duly audited and
were not rejected by the Assessing officer in those assessment years. Now
coming to Codli UFR unit, we noted that neither the assessing officer nor the
CIT (Appeals) has disputed the capital investment made in new plant &amp;
machinery in the FY 1999-2000, they have merely expressed their
dissatisfaction on the evidences furnished by the assessee in respect of the
date of commencement of manufacturing or production, which was stated as
08/03/2000 by the assessee on the strength of documentary evidences such
as the Approval from the Board of Approvals, intimation of commencement of

commercial production on 08/03/2000 to the Ministry of Industries, etc., which
have discussed separately in this order by us. The main contentions of the
revenue before us are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_466">(i)     That all old machines were not replaced since there was no
        deletion in the book value of the existing plant shown in the
        depreciation charts for the concerned years.
</p>
<p id="p_467">(ii)    That by carrying out repairs a new unit is not set-up. In the case
        of Chitradurga unit, some bills were found for undertaking
        fabrication, erection and other such works which appear to be
        revenue in nature and not capital in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_468">(iii)   That in the case of Amona plant, correspondence with Village
        Panchayat shows that the construction activities were actually in
        the nature of repairs and renovation.
</p><p id="p_469">(iv)    That the assessee had incorrectly claimed that the entire existing
        plant at Chitradurga was demolished in the FY 2005-06 itself,
        whereas only one bill of Rs. 3,522/- contained demolition or
        dismantling charges.
</p>
<p id="p_470">(v)     That for determining the percentage of old equipment used in the
        new unit, even the assets held at the Extraction units must be
        taken into consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_471">(vi)    That year-wise production data of Chitradurga unit shows that the
        production increased without new investment in plant &amp;
        machinery. Moreover, no major plant &amp; machinery was installed
        at Chitradurga as could help in increasing the production
        capacity.
</p>
<p id="p_472">45.12 According to Revenue, all old machines were not replaced since there
was no deletion in the book value of the existing plant shown in the
depreciation charts for the concerned years. CIT(A) has complied charts in
respect of Amona and Chitradurga units in his appellate order. In this regard
the Ld. AR explained the basic cost of plant &amp; machinery in the case of an
iron ore beneficiation plant is incurred on raising steel and concrete structures
on which the conveyor belts, crushers, screens, etc. are installed. Though all
existing items of machine were scrapped usable steel from the same was
utilized in the erection of new machines and equipments for which only some
additional charges were paid. Thus, the existing dismantled structure got

the relatable value of existing plant, the cost of additional plant acquired
during the year was recorded at net value. Also the scrap of the remaining
existing plant was sold and shown separately in the relevant audited profit &amp;
loss account for the concerned financial year under the head "Service and
Other Proceeds" for which attention was drawn to P &amp; L account and
accordingly these meager sums were not reduced from the schedule of fixed
assets. In this regard, our attention was drawn to Schedule 14 of the profit &amp;
loss account for the years ended on 31/03/2003 and 31/03/2006 and also the
break-up of "Service and Other Proceeds" provided at page nos. 1356 and
1365 of the paper book for the said two financial years respectively. Gross
receipt from sale of scrap for Goa (Amona unit) amounting to Rs. 71,41,971/-
was declared in the FY 2002-03; and that of Rs. 4,67,163/- was declared for
the year ended on 31/03/2006 in respect of Karnataka (Chitradurga unit). We
find substance in the explanation of the Ld. AR that the said contention of the
Revenue does not, therefore, hold good in our opinion. Otherwise also, we
have noted that the value of the existing plant was much below the threshold
limit of 20% required for substantial investment for setting-up of a new unit for
the purpose of <a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_317">section 10B</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_473">45.13 With regard to the contention of the Revenue that in the case of
Chitradurga unit, some bills were found for undertaking fabrication, erection
and other such works which appear to be revenue in nature and not capital in
nature. We noted the explanation of the Ld. AR that the assessments for the
AYs 2006-07 and 2007-08 had been framed u/s 143(3) where depreciation
vis-à-vis capital expenditure (fixed assets) had duly been examined by the
AOs and even some disallowances had been made in respect of depreciation
on assets other than plant &amp; machinery, which was not disturbed, hence,
accepted as correct by the AOs. The copies of the said assessment orders
were furnished. Thus, when the factum of capital investment in plant &amp;
machinery in those years stood accepted by the department, it is beyond the
jurisdiction of the first appellate authority to travel back to the completed
assessments and hold otherwise. Moreover, these bills support the
explanation of the assessee that it had paid fabrication and other such
charges for reusing the existing steel and concrete structures wherever
possible in the process of erecting its new plants. We find no fault with the

explanation of the Ld. AR and therefore do not agree on this with the
authorities below.
</p>
<p id="p_474">45.14 We have examined the contention of the Revenue that in the case of
Amona plant, correspondence with Village Panchayat shows that the
construction activities were actually in the nature of repairs and renovation.
The CIT(A) had referred to only a few correspondence exchanged with
Panchayat to make a case that it was only some repairs or at best a
renovation work undertaken at Amona, whereas several other pieces of
correspondence were ignored by him which prove that the appellant had
factually undertaken a major dismantling and demolition of the existing plant
as well as erection and installation of new plant in its place there. From the
correspondence exchanged with panchayat and newspaper clippings filed in
PB (Pages 293,294,299 &amp; 409-411), we noted the CIT(A) ignored the local
newspaper clippings which in our opinion are vital piece of evidence in this
regard. These clippings clearly bring out the fact that a complete destruction
of old unit was done and altogether new plant was set-up at Amona, albeit,
with the aid of some old machinery and parts thereof. Regarding the
contention of the revenue that there is only one bill of Rs.3,522/- which
contains demolition or dismantling charges, we noted that in the same bill Rs.
65,346/- and Rs. 79,060/- at sl. nos. 13 &amp; 14 for dismantling of structural steel
and crusher hopper respectively were also stated (page nos. 1443-1445 of
the Additional paper book Vol.III). In the case of the assessee we noted and
as has been accepted by the revenue itself that the extraction division and
EOU units are entirely different, and the dispute before us relate only to the
EOU units whether they are new or not, therefore in our view, revenue is not
correct in adding the value of the extraction division for determining 20%
threshold limit of old plant and machinery for establishing the new unit. On
the one side, the revenue is taking the contention that extraction division is
not the part of 100% EOU, therefore the assessee‟s EOU units cannot be
regarded to have been engaged in extraction of ore and iron ore processing,
on the other hand, while determining the threshold limit of 20% of old plant
and machinery, the revenue cannot be permitted to take a contrary
contention. We are of the firm view that while determining the eligibility of a
particular unit u/s 10B, its only the value of old plant and machinery installed
in that very unit will be considered for determining the threshold limit of 20%.

Thus, this contention of the revenue stand dismissed. Production date
submitted by the assessee on record clearly prove that the production in each
of these units got substantially increased as compared to the production in
the old units dismantled or discarded. There is no cogent evidence or material
being brought on record by the revenue which may prove that the old unit
remains in existence merely by reconstituting the same.

      that in the present case the old undertaking no longer existed and
      remained identifiable. It was completely submerged in the new
      industrial undertaking of the assessee. The provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_318">Section 80IA</a>
      of the Act with reference to Explanation 2 do not require that new
      industrial undertaking should be raised on separate plot of land leaving
      the earlier undertaking totally untouched. We find that the processes
      for which the assessee entered into technological collaborations with
      M/s Rotacom Industries, B.V., Netherlands and M/s Seppo Ralli OY,
      Finland were the key processes of the assessee's industrial
      undertaking and other processes such as storage of milk in stainless
      steel storage tanks, pre-warming, pre-heating, pasteurization were only
      of preparatory nature for the manufacturing of the product of the
      assessee. The assessee appears to have introduced almost entirely
      new manufacturing technology and processes.

<p id="p_479">      13. The reconstruction of a business or an industrial undertaking must
      necessarily involve the concept that the original business or
      undertaking is not to cease functioning, and its identity is not to be set
      to be lost or abandoned. The concept essentially rests on changes but
      the changes must be constructive and not destructive. There must be
      something positive about the whole matter as opposed to negative.
      The underlying idea of a reconstruction evidently must be - and this is
      brought out by the section itself - of a 'business already in existence'.
      There must be a continuation of the activities and business of the
      same industrial undertaking. The undertaking must continue to carry
      on the same business though in some altered or varied form. If the
      alteration and changes are substantial, there would be little scope for
      describing what emerges as a reconstruction of the business. (<a href="/doc/793394/" id="a_319">See CIT

        reconstruction of the business, it is nowhere evident that the old
        industrial unit was split up or damaged or destroyed that was
        supposedly reconstructed as a new unit by the assessee. What the
        assessee has done is to set up an industrial undertaking with latest
        technology and with increased capacity and of course, with a fairly
        good amount of fresh investment.‖

        ―11. It is found as a fact that the appellant had begun to manufacture
        or produce articles in the previous year ended on 31-3-1957 with the
        help of thirty hooker cells. It is true that rectifier had not been installed
        in the year 1957-58 but it is not in dispute that with suitable adjustment
        being made to the power system, the thirty hooker cells which had
        been installed were utilised. The use of these new hooker cells had
        resulted in the capacity of the unit gradually increasing and the
        production so made was not experimental but was commercial. This
        being so, the appellant's undertaking must be regarded as having been
        newly established when it had begun to manufacture or produce
        articles by 31-3-1957. As 1957-58 was the first assessment year...

<p id="p_484">        13. This is a case where the manufacturing capacity of the appellant
        was increased on a licence being granted from 13.5 tons per day to 20
        tons per day. In other words, these hooker cells were installed and the
        billeter cells were gradually replaced. The new industrial undertaking
        came into existence when the initial lot of thirty hooker cells were
        installed in the year 1957-58 which had resulted in enhanced
        commercial production. The Tribunal and the High Court, in our
        opinion, rightly came to the conclusion that the undertaking could
        function with thirty hooker cells in the year 1957-58 and further
        numbers were added in the subsequent year. The undertaking having
        thus started, the commercial manufacture in the year 1957-58 could
        not claim the benefit of provisions of <a href="/doc/1863742/" id="a_321">Section 84</a> of the Act because the

       thereof. In the present case, there had been no business in the old
       unit of the assessee for over five years before the start of production
       by the new EOU. That being so, the new EOU of the assessee cannot,
       in any manner, be said to be formed by the reconstruction or splitting
       up of a business already in existence. Then, the authorities below have
       observed that mere registration as a one hundred per cent EOU is not
       the sole criterion for grant of deduction under<a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_325"> s. 10B</a> of the Act. This

       as a one hundred per cent unit with the Development Commr., NEPZ.
       Explanation 2(iv) to<a href="/doc/869435/" id="a_326"> s. 10B</a> of the Act provides for a one hundred per

        The words ―the capital employed‖ in the principal clause of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_340">Section 80-I</a>

        yielding additional profit attributable to the new outlay of capital in a
        separate and distinct unit is essential to earn the benefit of Section 80-

        would not on that score deprive him of the benefit under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_341">Section 80-I</a>.
        Every new creation in business is some kind of expansion and

production started on 8.3.2000 and copy of the said letter was duly sent to
Customs Department which was not disputed by these competent authorities.

<p id="p_501">45.20 In the case of Chitradurga plant also we noted that the assessee vide
its letter dated 14.7.2008 duly intimated to the DC, SEZ that the converted
100% EOU is started commercial production on 6.6.2008. The premises of
the said unit was bonded and the licence no.1/2008 dated 5.6.2008 was

Codli Unit the assessee has duly intimated to the Ministry of Industry vide
letter dated 9.3.2000 that the commercial production is started on 8.3.2000.
None of the aforesaid Government authority has disputed that the assessee
has not started commercial production on that date.

45.21 In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the view that the
assessee is entitled for exemption u/s 10B in respect of all the three 100%
Export Oriented Units, but during the course of the hearing, we noted that the
assessee while computing the exemption u/s 10B has debited ore extracted
from own mines in Amona unit as well as Chitradurga unit at cost of Rs.
45,25,23,692/- and Rs. 20,27,01,458/- respectively, while in view of
provisions of <a href="/doc/350844/" id="a_349">section 10B(7)</a> read with <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_350">section 80-IA(8)</a> the assessee is
required to transfer the crude ore extracted from its own mines at market
value for determining the true profit derived by the 100% EOU for the purpose
of computing the income illegible for exemption u/s 10B. We also noted that
the assessee has also purchased crude ore i.e ROM from outside parties i.e
from mining belonging to the other parties. The price paid by the assessee to
these outside parties, in our opinion can be regarded to be the best evidence
for determining the market value of the crude ore used by the assessee
extracting it from its own mines. Since determination of market value requires
verification on the part of the revenue, we, therefore, restore this issue only
for determining the market value of the crude ore consumed by the assessee
on the basis of the value paid by the assessee for the crude ore to the outside
parties during the year and thereby recomputing the profit derived by the
assessee from the 100% EOU units eligible for exemption u/s 10B.
Accordingly, we direct the Assessing Officer to recompute the exemption
available u/s 10B to the assessee in respect of Amona as well as Chitradurga
units after ascertaining the market value of the crude ores transferred by the
assessee to these units from its extraction divisions on the basis of the
average market value as the assessee has paid to the outside parties for the
crude ores purchased by the assessee from these parties during the
impugned assessment year and substituting as cost of the raw material in
place of cost of the crude ore derived by the assessee from its own mines
after giving proper and sufficient opportunity to the assessee to adduce the
material and evidence in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_503">45.22 With regard to Codli unit, the assessee claimed before us that the
input in this case is „tailings‟ which is merely a waste product and does not
involve any cost and also has not fetched any price in the open market,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_170">                                        166</span>

therefore, its market value is nil for the purpose of computation of profit
eligible for exemption u/s 10B from this unit. We find force in the submission
of the assessee but in the interest of justice and fair play to both the parties,
in respect of this unit also we direct the assessing officer to recompute the
profit of this unit eligible for exemption after satisfying himself about the fair
market value of „tailings‟ after giving proper and sufficient opportunity to the
assessee to prove the market value of the tailings used in the Codli unit and
allow the assessee exemption to the assessee u/s 10<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_351">B of the Income-tax Act</a>,
1961 for Codli unit on the profit so recomputed accordingly. The assessee is
directed to adduce the necessary evidence on which it may rely to prove the
market value of inputs before the assessing officer. Thus, the ground nos. 7,
8 &amp; 9 are partly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_504">46. Grounds nos.10 &amp; 11 in assessee‟s appeal relate to disallowance of
depreciation claimed u/s 32(1)(iia). The brief facts of the case are that the
assessee claimed additional depreciation amounting to Rs.10,91,79,435/- and
Rs.10,01,21,951/- in respect of     iron ore   division and Rs.90,57,484/- for
Metallurgical Coke Division. The AO took the view that the assessee was
not engaged in the manufacture or production of any article or thing and
therefore, the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of the
assessee 271 ITR 331 relating to additional depreciation is not applicable.
The said decision relate prior to 1.4.1999. According to him, there is no
change either in the name or in the composition of the iron ore before
extraction and after extraction and processing and the conditions as laid down
u/s 2(29BA) are not fulfilled. Similarly, it was held that in the case of
conversion of coal into coke there is no different chemical composition or
integral structure in the new article and it has no different character and use.
Reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of CIT
Vs Gem India Manufacturing Co., 249 ITR 307(2001) and Lucky Minerals (P)
Ltd., 116 Taxman 1(SC). The assessee went in appeal before the CIT(A).
The CIT(A) also took the view that the assessee primarily engaged in the
process of converting coal to coke essentially there is not much of difference
in the physical and chemical characteristic of coal and coke. The division is
not associated with any kind of extraction of coal or any other ore as part of
its business activity. In the case of CIT Vs Sesa Goa Ltd., 271 ITR 331(SC)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_171">                                       167</span>

the Hon‟ble Apex Court held that for an activity to be production, it should
comprise of both extraction of iron ore and its processing. The learned AR
reiterated the submissions made before the CIT(A). It was contended that the
assessee engaged in the business of extraction and processing of iron ore.
The assessee is processing the iron ore not only one which is extracted out of
its own mines, but also the one which is extracted from the mines which are
hired. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court has clearly held that the extraction and
processing of iron ore amounts to production. There is no subsequent
amendment in this regard or introduction of the definition of the word
production in the Act. Sec.32(1)(iia) used both the word „manufacture‟ or
„production‟ and does not require that the assessee should be engaged in the
manufacture and production. Sec.2(29BA) of the Act defines the                  word
„manufacture‟. The CIT(A) took the view that the iron ore processing plant at
Codli, Amona and Chitradurga       do not amount to either „manufacture‟ or
„production‟. The revenue is fully aware of that in these plants, the assessee
has used the iron ore extracted from its mines and also from other mines
taken on lease for processing to make it marketable for export. Sec.32(1)(iia)
only requires that the assessee must be engaged in the business of
manufacture or production of any article or thing. Thus, the assessee must
be allowed investment allowance so far as it relates to plant and machinery
used in iron ore division. In respect of claim of the assessee for the additional
depreciation for the plant and machinery installed in metallurgical coke
division, the assessee contended that sec.32(1)(iia) nowhere requires that the
new plant and machinery must be acquired or installed for manufacture or
production. The only condition subject to the proviso therein is that the
assessee must be engaged in the business of manufacture or production or
article or thing. The learned AR also tried to explain the process of coke
division to prove that the coke division is engaged in the production of an
article or thing. The learned DR on the other hand relied on the order of the
CIT(A).

</blockquote>
<p id="p_508">46.2   From the provisions of the section, it is apparent that the assessee is
entitled in the case of any new machinery or plant which has been acquired or
installed by him after 31.03.2005 for the additional depreciation if the
assessee is engaged in the business of manufacture or production of any
article or thing. Proviso to section denies the deduction to an assessee of the
additional depreciation in certain cases. From the balance sheet and all other
evidences filed before us it is apparently clear that the assessee is engaged
primarily in the business of extraction of ore and its processing. The
authorities below interpreted the provisions of section, correctly taking the
view that the plant and machinery should be installed for the production of an
article or thing. The assessee‟s plants at Codli, Amona and Chitradurga
whether engaged for the manufacture or production independently, in our
view, is not relevant. The relevant consideration is that the assessee must be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_173">                                      169</span>

engaged in the business of manufacture or production of any article or thing
and the new plant and machinery must be acquired and installed. The
assessee has extracted the iron ore and also processed it. The case of the
assessee is duly covered by the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in
assessee‟s own case reported in 271 ITR 331(SC) (supra). This section used
the word „business of manufacture or production‟ not the word „manufacture
and production‟. We do not agree with the revenue that the case of the
assessee is not covered by the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in
assessee‟s own case.        Respectfully following the decision of the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court in assessee‟s own case, we delete the disallowance and
allow   the   additional    depreciation   to   the   assessee   amounting          to
Rs.10,91,75,435/-.
</p>
<p id="p_509">Revenue's appeal:-
</p><p id="p_510">47.     The first ground is revenue‟s appeal is general in nature and does not
require any adjudication.
</p>
<p id="p_511">48.     The second ground relates to deletion of the disallowance of
expenditure on research &amp; Development. The brief facts relating to the
ground is that the AO disallowed a sum of Rs.1,94,55,376/ considering the
same as scientific research expenditure by treating it as expenditure of capital
in nature. The AO has dealt with this issue under para-2 page-5 of the order.
When the matter went before the CIT(A), the CIT(A) after getting remand
report on the submissions of the assessee noted that the assessee has not
claimed the sum of Rs.2,60,32,608/- as Research &amp; Development
expenditure neither in the books of accounts nor in the computation of
income. The AO has treated this expenditure which were incurred in usual
course under various heads to be scientific research as in the Director‟s
report such expenditure was classified as expenditure for Research &amp;
Development.     It was also noted by him that out of total expenditure of
Rs.2,60,32,608/- an amount of Rs.65,77,232/- was considered capital
expenditure by the assessee and only the balance amounting to
Rs.1,94,55,376/- debited to the profit &amp; loss account. The AO has not brought
out any specific finding to show that any part of the balance expenditure
under reference is in the nature of capital expenditure. Even no such


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_174">                                       170</span>
                                                               ITA No. 72&amp;85/PNJ/2012

expenditure was debited in the profit &amp; loss account under the head
"Research &amp; Development". The CIT(A) has given the clear cut finding that
the conditions prescribed u/s 35 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_352">IT Act</a> would come to play only if the
expenditure is claimed as expenditure for scientific research. However, in the
present case, considering the definition of scientific research provided u/s
43(4)(i) the AO observed that the case of the assessee is not covered under
the definition of scientific research. The CIT(A) in view of the conclusion of
the AO took the view that the AO should have not again treated this
expenditure to be scientific expenditure and therefore, he deleted the
addition.
</p>
<p id="p_512">49.    We have heard the rival submissions and carefully considered the
material on record. The learned DR although, vehemently relied on the order
of the AO but could not deny that the AO himself observed that the case of
the assessee is not covered under the definition of the scientific research. In
view of this fact, in our opinion, no interference is called for in the order of the
CIT(A) and the CIT(A)has rightly deleted the addition. We accordingly,
confirm the order of the CIT(A) on this issue. Thus, ground no. 2 stands
dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_513">50.    The third ground relate to the deletion of the disallowance made by the
AO as exchange loss incurred on the foreign exchange forward contract. The
AO noted that the assessee has debited forward contract loss on the basis of
the actual settlement of forward contracts. If the assessee has entered into
foreign exchange forward contracts, according to the assessee, to hedge loss
on receipt of the export proceeds. The AO applied provisions of sec. 43(5)
and treated it to be the speculative loss. When the matter went before the
CIT(A), the CIT(A) on the basis of the decision of the jurisdictional High Court
in the case of CIT Vs Badrida Gauridu(P) Ltd.,(261 ITR 256) took the view
that the loss incurred by the assessee on forward contracts had a direct
nexus with it export activities and therefore, such loss is a loss incidental to
the business activities of the assessee.      This loss cannot be regarded to be
the speculation loss. The learned DR even though, before relied on the order
of the AO could not bring to our knowledge any other decision of the
jurisdictional High Court or that of the Supreme Court which would have taken


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_175">                                        171</span>

a contrary view, what has been taken by the Hon‟ble Mumbai High Court into
261 ITR 256. Even this was not the case of the revenue that the said decision
was not applicable in this case. Under these facts of the case, we are of the
view, that no illegality and infirmity is caused in the order of the CIT(A) while
deleting the disallowance on account of foreign exchange on forward
contract. Thus, this is not a fit case which warrants our interference and we
accordingly, dismiss the third ground taken by the revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_514">51.     The last ground in revenue‟s appeal relates to deletion of disallowance
of the expenditure incurred for the issue of bonus shares. This issue, in our
opinion, is no more res-integra in view of the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme
Court in the case of CIT Vs General Insurance Corpn. 286 ITR 32 (SC), which
has been followed by the CIT(A). We therefore do not find any merit in the
ground taken by the revenue accordingly, we dismiss the same.
</p>
<p id="p_515">52. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed, while the
appeal filed by the revenue stands dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_26">
