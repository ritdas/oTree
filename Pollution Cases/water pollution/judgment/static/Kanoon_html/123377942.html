          ============================
                       B.A.No.7479 of 2017
          ============================
              Dated this the 1st day of November, 2017

                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             The petitioners herein seek pre arrest bail under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section

438</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the apprehension of arrest

in connection with Crime No.458 of 2017 of the Nilambur Police

Station, registered under <a href="/doc/1164731/" id="a_2">Sections 270</a> IPC, 120(e) of the Kerala

Police Act, <a href="/doc/73521/" id="a_3">Section 43</a> read with <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Section 24</a> of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a> (the <a href="/doc/701797/" id="a_6">Special Act</a>), and Section 3(2)(a) of

the PDPP Act. They are three accused in the crime.

</p><p id="p_2">             2.   The prosecution case is that these petitioners

collected latrine waste from some hotels, transported it in tanker

lorries, and deposited the waste at the river near the Vadapuram

Bridge at Nilambur, in the night of 13.10.2017 and 14.10.2017. The

police initiated action, and registered crime on a complaint made by

the Assistant Engineer of the Kerala Water Authority, Wandoor. The

main offence alleged against the petitioners is an offence against

public health, and the allegation is serious also.       Anyway, in the

nature of the allegations, I feel it appropriate to direct the petitioners

to surrender before the Investigating Officer for necessary

interrogation. Without such interrogation, the investigation cannot

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">B.A.No.7479 of 2017                     2</span>

be completed. Let the request for regular be considered by the court

below having jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  In the result, this application for bail is disposed of as

follows;
</p>
<p id="p_4">                   a)  The      petitioners    will    surrender before the

Investigating Officer between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. on any day within

seven days from this date for the purpose of interrogation as part of

investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                   b)  After necessary interrogation, the Investigating

Officer will produce the petitioners before the learned Magistrate

having jurisdiction before 4 p.m. on the same day.

</p><p id="p_6">                   c)  In case application for regular bail is filed by the

petitioners, the same shall be judiciously considered and decided on

the same day by the learned Magistrate.
