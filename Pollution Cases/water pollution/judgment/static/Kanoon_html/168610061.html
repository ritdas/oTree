for the offence u/s 15 in contravention of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/75233928/" id="a_5">7</a> of the said Act was filed

by Kuldeep Singh Tomar (R-1). Vide order dated 13.04.2010, learned trial court

declined to take cognizance of the offence. Aggrieved with the order,

complainant preferred a revision petition wherein Sh.Atul Kumar Garg, Ld ASJ-04,

South District, Saket, New Delhi recalled and set aside the order dated

13.04.2010, observing that learned Magistrate was required to decide again the

case on the basis of the facts mentioned in the complaint.

</p><p id="p_3">3.       Thereafter, vide order dated 17.04.2012, learned trial court took cognizance

and listed the matter for pre-summoning evidence u/s 200 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. Complainant

examined himself as PW-1 and vide order dated 20.05.2013, SHO was directed to

investigate              the matter u/s 202 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a> and was asked to file report within two

months. Enquiry report was filed by SI Harbeer Singh, PS Hauz Khas, Learned trial

court noted that IO was not having any experience to enquire into the matter as

the matter was technical and therefore, matter was sent to Delhi Pollution Control

Committee (DPCC), which was directed to investigate the matter and submit

report. On 15th March 2014, inspection report was filed on behalf of DPCC. Vide

order dated 21.01.2015 accused persons (petitioner herein) were summoned by

Ld trial court to face trial u/s 15 of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment Protection Act</a>. This order was

challenged by the petitioners and vide order dated 17.07.2015, Court of Sh.

Sanjeev Jain, Ld. ASJ, South District, Saket Court sent the trial court record back

with the directions to transfer the case to the 'specially designated court' of

learned ACMM (Special Act), Central District after setting aside impugned order

dated 21.01.2015 being without jurisdiction. Thereafter, court of ACMM (Special

                                                                           Case No. 58277/2016


appearing for the petitioners, complainant Sh. Kuldeep Singh Tomar and Sh.

Nilesh Sawhney, Ld counsel for DPCC.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       Sh. Vishal Gosain, Ld counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the

summoning of the Revisionists in the present case is bad in law because there is

not even a whisper of an allegation about how Mrs. Preet Singh is incharge and

responsible for the functioning of the Industry or how she is managing the day to

day affairs of the Industry. It is submitted that it is a matter of record that she is

not the Managing Director of M/s East West Linkers, hence criminal liability

cannot automatically be attributed to her as the concept of vicarious liability is a

concept alien to criminal law. Sh. Gosain contended that trial court overlooked

the fact no notice was served on the State Board or the Government of the State

and the Ministry of Environment and Forests which is mandatory under Rule 11 of

the Environment Protection Rules. It is further submitted that trial court failed to

understand that the issues of Environmental Pollution cannot be determined

unless there is a report of Government Analyst under Rule 8 of the Environment

Protection Rules about the nature of pollution in any given area and which is to

be produced in the Court before which proceedings, if any, are instituted.

</p><p id="p_6">6.       Sh. Gosain, Ld counsel further submitted that trial court failed to appreciate

that the Judgment of the our Supreme Court in MC Mehta vs Union of India (Civil

Writ No. 4677 of 1985) applies only to industries which have been established

after 1.8.1990. It is submitted that it is a matter of record that the said industry

was set up in 1981 which is proved by perusal of the Factory License. Sh. Gosain,

Ld counsel urged that trial court failed to appreciate that the Factory License

permitted              the Revisionists to employ a 100 workers on a given day, thereby

nullifying the allegations of the Respondent No.2. Ld counsel for petitioner

submitted that trial court failed to appreciate that all permissions that were

                                                                          Case No. 58277/2016


required by the Revisionist to run the said industry, be it from the Department of

Factories or from the MCD, were complete. It is further submitted that a perusal

of the receipts of the property tax for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17 reflect that

the Revisionist was paying property tax for the purposes of running an industry.

Furthermore, "Conversion Charges" or "mixed land charges" were being paid to

the MCD, for the purposes of running an industry in a residential area.                 Sh.

Gosain, Ld counsel contended that stance of the Revisionist gets further fortified

by the fact that the MCD had issued a license to run the said industry way back in

1983 and the same was valid till the year 2000, after which the license stood

canceled in light of MC Mehta's case (supra). However, since the industry was set

up in 1981, the MCD, issued ad hoc licenses to the Revisionists. Ld counsel for

petitioner argued that it is in light of the fact that MC Mehta's case( Supra ) has

no bearing on the industry in question; that the Factory License as well as the

license issued by the MCD clearly permitted the usage of the property as an

industry and no air or water pollution is being caused by the running of the

industry; He submitted that the number of workers allowed to work was 100 as

per the factory license and the MCD issued a license to the revisionists for

running of the industry in 1983 and "Conversion" and "mixed land charges" are

being paid till date to the MCD for usage of the land as an industrial plot in a

residential area. Ld counsel submitted that no offence is made out against the

Revisionists herein and the order dated 15.12.2015, summoning the Revisionists

to face trial for offences under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_11">Section 15</a> of the Environment

Protection Act, 1986, is bad in law and is liable to be set aside.

</p><p id="p_7">7.       Sh.Kuldeep Singh Tomar, complainant (R-1) advanced submission in person

submits that Section 3(V) Central Government Act take measures for preventing

environment pollution to restrict the areas/portions close of industries which shall

                                                                          Case No. 58277/2016


or shall not be carried out subject to the provisions of this Act. Sh. K.S. Tomar,

complainant (R-1) submitted that he was an advocate, of Jaswant Singh who had

filed a suit No.466/08 for seeking mandatory injunction for restraining defendant

No.2, against Commissioner MCD as well as petitioner/M/s East West Linkers

owners/occupiers for carrying noise, Air and Water Pollution. It is submitted that

in that suit, written statement was filed by DPCC on 17.04.2009 along with

inspection report dated 10.02.1999. Stand of the DPCC is that in view of <a href="/doc/192574007/" id="a_12">Section

22</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">46</a> of Environment Protection Act 1981 and <a href="/doc/506600/" id="a_14">Section 52</a> Water (Prevention

and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Pollution) Act</a>, the remedy with the plaintiff was to file a complaint

before the Court of Magistrate u/s 19/43 &amp; 49 respectively of the aforesaid Act.

Complainant submitted that suit No.468/08 was withdrawn by the complainant

Jaswant Singh on 18.05.2009 and order dated 18.05.2009 passed by the court,

shows that the said suit was allowed to be withdrawn in view of the reasons

shown in the application.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.       Sh. Nilesh Sawhney, Ld counsel appearing for DPCC submitted that

admittedly, as per the license issued by Inspector factory i.e. Annexure A, filed by

the petitioner, the maximum power capacity permitted was 2.5 HP whereas

admittedly, petitioner is using about 150 KW and moreover, at the left hand

bottom of the Annexure A, it is mentioned that same was valid till the plot/flat

was offered to the license holder and in the present case, admittedly, petitioner

was offered an alternative plot for relocation, however, the same offer was not

availed of by the petitioner by not depositing requisite charges. License placed

on record by the petitioner is only an adhoc license for non confirming area and

was only              valid up to 31st March 2003 and on the same very license, it is

mentioned that adhoc license does not authorizes the petitioner for getting any

license from any municipal department and as such, no license was issued to the



East West Linkers vs Kuldeep Singh Tomar                             Page 5 out of 12
                                                                     Case No. 58277/2016


petitioner and therefore, is not placed on record despite specific directions.

Merely depositing of conversion charges under self assessment method cannot

entitle the petitioner to claim that the land use has actually been converted from

residential to the industrial.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.       It was further pointed out that as per MPD 2021, Chapter 7.3 and 7.4,

household industries are permitted in residential area having maximum five

number of workers and maximum industrial power load of 5KW and industrial unit

is only permitted after provisional registration by the Government of NCTD;

Furthermore, separate industrial electric connection (single phase) and Municipal

License, would be necessary to set up a household industry.

</p><p id="p_10">10. In rebuttal, Sh. Vishal Gosai, Ld counsel appearing for petitioner submitted

that the license to run a factory issued by the Government of NCT of Delhi was

issued on 15th September 1981 and the same was being renewed from time to

time and lastly renewed in 2016 and the number of maximum workers

permissible on any day was '100' and even the permissible limit, in relation to the

usage of electricity is clearly mentioned as 2.5 HP in the third column of the

factory license. Sh. Gosain submitted that there was no violation attributable to

the petitioner in terms of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment Protection Act</a>, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">Air Pollution Act</a> or any

other law in force and case was squarely covered by the order of Supreme Court

in 'MC Mehta vs Union of India', since those parameters were applicable to

industries which had been established after 1st August 1990.                 Ld counsel

submitted that even the Delhi Municipal Corporation had issued a license in the

year 1983-84, which was placed on record as Annexure C of written submission

during arguments in the revision petition before this court and license issued by

MCD was renewed from time to time. It is urged that Municipal Corporation never

raised any objection with regard to the running of this unit, which is reflected

                                                                                           Case No. 58277/2016


from deposit and acceptance of property tax as late as in the year 2015-2016

(filed as Annexure B of written submission before this court). Ld counsel argued

that in these circumstances, there is no contravention of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_18">Section 3</a> punishable u/s

15 of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_19">Environment Protection Act</a> and the impugned order dated 15th

December 2015 passed by the court of Ld ACMM suffers from serious infirmity in

law and on facts and is consequently liable to be set aside.

</p><p id="p_11">11.      In support, Sh. Vishal Gosai, Ld counsel relied upon judgment of Hon'ble High

Court of Delhi in a case titled as <a href="/doc/71516115/" id="a_20">A.K. Ganju vs CBI1</a>, submission made by the Ld

counsel for DPCC are unsustainable as it has been laid down in the said judgment

that in case of any violation under a special statute, proceedings which are

maintainable against the erring party can be instituted only under the said

statute and no other law for the time being in force. It is submitted that even in

the said case, the CBI had sought to institute prosecution under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_21">Prevention of

Corruption Act</a> on the basis of an alleged violation under the MCD laws, however,

Hon'ble High Court was of the view that the proceedings were maintainable only

under the MCD laws and not under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_22">PC Act</a>. It is submitted that applying the

same yardstick to the facts of the present case, even if it is to be assumed that

on the date of the inspection, there was some discrepancy with regard to the

MCD          license,          no          prosecution   under   the   <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_23">Environment   Protection          Act</a>   is

maintainable and MCD had not launched any prosecution against the the

petitioner in the present case and in the impugned order, Ld ACMM held that

there was no violation under Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">Water Pollution Control Act</a>. It is submitted

that the petitioner cannot be held liable beyond the scope of the complaint and

observations made by the Ld ACMM in the impugned order and in these

circumstances, petitioners are entitled to be discharged.

record, this court finds no merits in the contention of Ld counsel for the petitioner

and there is sufficient material on record to proceed further against the petitioner

for the offence punishable u/s 3 punishable u/s 15 of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_25">Environment Protection

Municipal Corporation of Agencies for taking necessary closure action, as per the

Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment dated 7.5.2004 in M.C. Mehta Vs. UOI &amp; ORS,

regarding closure/shifting of the unauthorized/illegal/non-conforming industries in

less than 60 days in the prescribed manner of the alleged offence and his

the Chairman, Member, Secretary, Delhi Pollution Control Board/Committee and

vide order dated 30th August 2011, the revision petition filed by the complainant

was allowed by Ld ASJ which considered the question of the form in which notice

was served and found no fault with the same.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17. As regards, Preet Singh, it has been mentioned in the complaint that Preet

Singh is the owner of M/s East West Linkers and it is mentioned in the body of the

complaint several times that accused persons are carrying illegal industrial

activity and are violating the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_30">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.

Even the license issued by Inspector Factories referred by learned counsel for

petitioner is in the name of Mrs. Preet Singh and East West Linkers. As per

provisions of the Act or the Rules made or Order of direction issued thereunder is

liable.

relied upon by him) during arguments in the revision petition before this court

were not part of record and were neither considered nor could be considered by

the trial court, which has to consider only document filed by prosecution. Even

otherwise, disputed question of facts as to whether the petitioners were having

license from the MCD or when it was issued, it was renewed and what were the

terms and conditions and/or fees was deposited or not are the disputed questions

of fact which can be determined only by the trial court after recording evidence

and giving an opportunity to the parties. For the present purpose, it is noteworthy

that license which was earlier being relied upon on behalf of the petitioners was

issued by the office of the Chief Inspector of Factories, Labour Department,

stated to have been issued on 15th September 1981. The said license has been

mentions maximum number of workers on any day as '50' and maximum

installed power capacity as 2.5 HP whereas as per inspection report of the DPCC

dated 10th February 2009 as well as report dated 26th February 2013 on record

show the details of the power connection as 150 KW, which on the face of it

violates condition of license.

<p id="p_20">19.      Moreover, this court is in agreement with the submission advanced by Sh.

Sawhney, Ld counsel for DPCC that at the left hand bottom of document

Annexure A, mentioned that the license to work a factory issued by Inspector,

Factories and being relied upon by the counsel for the petitioner was valid till the

plot/flat was offered to the license holder and in the present case, admittedly,

petitioner was offered an alternative plot for relocation, however, the same offer

was not availed of by the petitioner by not depositing full charges and the factory

is still being run at the same premises. No satisfactory reason was assigned on

behalf of petitioner as to why the factory was not shifted despite the fact that

250 Sq. M. Industrial plot was allotted in Bawana in Relocation Scheme of

Commissioner of Industries and why charges were not deposited. Moreover, copy

of the license placed on record by the counsel for the petitioner during

arguments is an adhoc license for non confirming area and valid till 31st March

2003 only and on the same very license, it is mentioned that adhoc license does

not authorizes the petitioner for getting any license from any municipal

department and as such, no valid license can be said to be issued to the

petitioner. It is also true that merely depositing of charges under self assessment

method cannot entitle the petitioner to claim that the land use had actually been

converted from residential to the industrial.
