ORAL
ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">	This
petition has been filed by Gujarat Pollution Control Board ('GPCB'
for short).  Petitioner challenges an order dated 28.05.2009 by which
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bharuch allowed the revision
application of respondents No.1 to 6 herein who are the original
accused.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	Accused
are facing charges of starting polluting industries without proper
permissions.  The learned Magistrate by his order dated 06.12.2006
ordered framing of charge under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_1">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">25</a>, <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_3">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_4">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_5">47</a> of
Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.  Accused
challenged the said order before the learned Additional Sessions
Judge who by the impugned order allowed the revision application and
set aside the order for framing of charge.  It is not in dispute that
the entire order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge was passed
on one single ground namely that as held by this Court in 2002(2) GLR
1580, there was no proper sanction for prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	Learned
counsel for the petitioner, however, pointed out that the above view
of the High Court namely that sanction and approval are two separate
and independent aspects, has not been approved by the Apex Court in
the recent judgment rendered in case of <a href="/doc/10671053/" id="a_7">Gujarat Pollution Control
Board v. Nicosulf Industries &amp; Export Private Limited</a> reported
in 2009(2) SCC 171 wherein it is held and observed as  under:
</p>
<p id="p_4"> 17.
The High Court has held that the power to sanction a complaint is
distinct from the power to authorize the complaint.  This view is
clearly unsustainable for the reason that if the provisions are
construed in the context that as a check over the complaint filed,
then the grant of sanction to file a complaint would be in law an
authorization to file the complaint.  The stand of the appellant is
that the difference between sanction and authorization in the context
of provisions of the Act and in contradistinction to the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9"> the Code</a> is more semantic than real.  The stand is well
founded.    
</p>
<p id="p_5">	To
the above aspect, learned counsel for the private respondents was
also not in a position to raise any dispute. The legal position
having been clarified, the order of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge quashing the order of the Magistrate for framing of charge,
therefore, cannot sustain.  The same is, therefore, required to be
set aside.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">	Learned
counsel for the accused, however, submitted that original accused
No.4 is aged about 85 years and is residing at Mumbai.  Accused Nos.5
and 6 are married ladies also residing at Mumbai.  The factory was
situated at Ankleshwar.  The industry has become sick and the factory
is closed down since long.  These accused even otherwise did not have
control over the day to day
functioning of the factory.  He, therefore, submitted that complaint
against such accused should not be allowed to proceed.  In the
present petition, for want of any material in support of the above
contentions and consequential prayer, I make no observations leaving
it open to them to seek remedy in accordance with law.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">	Subject
to above observations, petition is allowed.  Impugned order dated
28th
May 2009 is set aside.
