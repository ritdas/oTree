ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre><p id="p_1"> :
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.	The
appellant - Gujarat Pollution Control Board has preferred the present
appeal u/s 378  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and
challenged the judgment and order of acquittal rendered on 3-6-1998
by learned Chief Metropolitan   Magistrate, Ahmedabad  in Criminal
Case No. 62 of 1995 acquitting accused respondents No. 1  to 4  for
the offence punishable u/ss  25 read with <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_1">Section 44</a> of the Water

</p>
<p id="p_3">2.	According
to the prosecution case, accused No. 1  is the owner and accused No.
2 is the Manager of  Radiant Metal Industries, Industrial Estate,
Odhav, Ahmedabad. The accused are engaged in manufacturing  S.S. 
Belts. The accused use acids and other chemicals for the purpose of
their production  and an outlet  is created for the  discharge of the
trade effluent without prior  consent  of the Board  in a drain
through unauthorised outlet  and  not installed water treatment plant
 and thereby violated the provisions  of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_3">Sections 24</a> and   <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">25</a>  of the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.	Learned
trial Judge framed charge Exh. 24 against the accused for the offence
u/s 25 of the Act. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and
hence the prosecution adduced evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.	After
hearing learned A.P.P. and the learned advocate for the accused, the
learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Ankleswhar acquitted
accused giving them  benefit of doubt. Being aggrieved by the said

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.	I
have heard learned advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the appellant and
learned A.P.P. Ms. Panchal at length and in great detail. I have also
perused the impugned judgment and record and proceeding of the  trial
court.

</p>
<p id="p_26">7.	Rule
27 of the Gujarat Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules
1976 (hereinafter referred to 'the Rules, 1976 ) provides the
procedure for submitting samples to the State Water Laboratory. It
provides that :  
</p>
<p id="p_27">	(a)	The
sample shall be collected 	preferably 		in polythene container and
	shall be labelled 		giving the following 	details, namely :-
</p>
<p id="p_28">	(i)		the
source, and nature of sample,
 

</p><p id="p_29">	(ii)		the
date and time of collection,
 

</p><p id="p_30">	(iii)	the
method of preservation used.
</p>
<p id="p_31">	(b)	Atleast
 2.5   litres of       the materials 		required to be       analyse 
shall be sent 		in a 	container, the capacity    of which 		shall not
be 	less than 3 litres and not be 		more than 5 litre.
</p>
<p id="p_32">	(c)	The
sample shall  accompany with the letter 		from the concerned
authority  and shall give 		the number of parameters to be analysed.
</p>
<p id="p_33">	(d)	The
sample shall be preferably transported 		to the laboratory by a
messenger.
</p>
<p id="p_34">	(e)	The
messenger shall take  receipt of sample 		from the laboratory.
</p>
<p id="p_35">	(f)	Fees
for analyses shall be paid either  in 		advance  or at the time of
submission of 		sample.
</p>
<p id="p_36">	(g)	The
samples shall be preserved as per the 		instruction given in
IS-2488-1966 and 1968 		(Part I, II and III) and IS-4733-1968. 
</p>
<p id="p_37">8.	The
evidence of P.W. 2 Binaben J. Bhatt Exh. 14 indicates that  only one
sample was taken for the purpose of analysis and  no preservative was
 used. It also indicates that no note was made in inspection  report
and forwarding letter Exh. 21 and Exh. 22 that the sample was
preserved  in ice. The evidence of  this witness also indicates that
accused No. 2 gave writing Exh. 18 indicating  that  the sample was
not taken in his  presence. It also  appears that  the sample was not
preserved as required under  Rule 27 (a). There is no evidence with
regard to capacity of the container. It also appears that the
inspection report  did not mention about the persons in charge  of
and responsible for the conduct of   business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_38">9.	In
the decision   of <a href="/doc/979263/" id="a_12">Dahyabhai Kalubhai Solanki V. Devine Intermediates
&amp; Chemicals &amp; Ors</a>., reported in 1996 (1) G.L.R. 729, this
Court has held  that when requirements of Rule 27 of the  Rules 1976
are not complied with the accused is entitled to acquittal. 
</p>
<p id="p_39">10.
	In view of  the evidence of P.W. 2 it appears that   the procedure
under  <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_13">Section 21</a> of the Act was not followed while taking the sample
and there was breach of   Rule 27 of  the Rules 1976. It also appears
that there was no evidence with regard to  liability of the accused
under <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_14">Section 47</a> of the Act. Therefore,   the accused  were entitled
for acquittal and the learned Magistrate was justified in passing the
impugned judgment. 
</p>
<p id="p_40">11.	As
regards the authority to file complaint, the case of M/s. Nicosulf
Industries &amp; Exports Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Another V/s.  State of
Gujarat and Another, reported in 2002 (2) G.L.R.1581, wherein this
Court held that the delegation  of power to file  complaint was not
valid, the case  was taken to the Supreme  Court and the  Court in
Criminal Appeal No.9 of 2002 decided on 4th December, 2008
held that the delegation of power of sanctioning  prosecution by the
Board to  the Chairman was valid and effective even for the purpose
of amended <a href="/doc/655542/" id="a_15">Section 49</a> (1) (a) of the Act. Therefore, learned J.M.F.C.
Committed error in coming to the conclusion that the complainant had
no authority to launch the prosecution. 
</p>
<p id="p_41">12.	In
view of the fact that there was breach of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_16">Sections 21</a> and  <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_17">47</a> of the
Act and Rule 27 of the Rules, 1976, the trial Court was justified in
acquitting the accused. The learned advocate for the appellant Board
has failed to point out that the finding in that regard is erroneous.
Therefore, the impugned judgment does not require any interference. 
</p>
<p id="p_42">13.	For
the foregoing reasons, appeal fails
and stands dismissed and  judgment and order  of acquittal rendered
on 3-4-1998 by learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Ankleshwar
in Criminal Case No. 1755 of 1989 is confirmed.
