              Dated this the 14th day of October, 2018

                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The challenge in both these writ petitions is with regard to

allotment of a plot of land to the 5 th respondent in W.P(C).No.14612 of

2014. The contention of the petitioners is that the allotment of land is in

a food park. It is contended that the allotment of 2.25 acres of land for a

highly polluting industry in an industrial park, which is established for

the purpose of food manufacturing and allied industries, is completely

violative of the very purpose for which the industrial park is set up.

Relying on the decisions of the Apex Court in Vellor's <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_1">Welfare Forum

v. Union of India and others</a> [(1996)5 SCC 647] and <a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_2">Bhopal Gas

Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan v. Union of India</a>                  [(2012)8 SCC

326], it is contended that a general area attached to a food processing

park cannot be used for a highly polluting industry like a gold

manufacturing unit which uses extremely toxic materials. It is stated

that the original proposal submitted by the 5 th respondent was

admittedly for an industry in the red category and the grant of

integrated consent treating the unit as a green category is completely
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       6</span>

violative of the categorisation provided in Rule 12 of the Prevention and

Control of Pollution (Uniform Consent Procedure) Rules, 1999. It is stated

that the revised list of red category industries would show that gold and

silver smithy using sulphuric acid is liable to be treated as a red category

industry and the recategorisation is completely without any basis.

</p><p id="p_2">     2. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in

W.P(C).No.3692 of 2015 would submit that Exhibit P2 licence agreement

would make it clear that the industrial park in question is conceived as a

food processing park. It is stated that the final document of revised

classification of industrial sectors under the 'red', 'orange', 'green' and

'white' categories as on 29.2.2016 would make it clear that gold and

silver smithy is admittedly red category industry. It is stated that melting,

anodizing, burn out, casting and chatka process, which is essential in the

case of a ornament manufacturing unit would undoubtedly render the

industry red category industry. It is stated that the use of sulphuric acid,

nitric acid, potassium cyanide, copper, cadmium, zinc, nickel, selenium,

tellurium, ruthenium, iridium etc. would result in toxic fumes containing

chlorine dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and metal vapor

contaminating the nearby atmosphere and will produce dry deposition

which would be detrimental to the food manufacturing units of the

petitioners. The learned Senior Counsel has also stated that a gold

chatka unit is used for polishing gold jewellery with the use of sulphuric

acid and nitric acid and is a highly polluting exercise.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       7</span>
</p><p id="p_3">     3. The KINFRA has filed a detailed counter affidavit contending that

the industrial park is not conceived as a food park alone and that it has

several zones including food zone, agro based zone, IT/ITES zone and a

general zone. It is stated that the revised proposal submitted by the

project proponent had been scrutinized in detail and found that it

answers all the requirements of an industry under the green category

and integrated consent had been granted for the same. It is stated that

all due precautions will be taken by the KINFRA to see that the industry

does not cause pollution as is apprehended by the petitioners and that it

conforms to all the requirements of a green category industry. It is

submitted that the consent to establish the industry had been given as

early as in 2014 and no challenge is raised against the said consent even

in these writ petitions. It is unequivocally stated that the KINFRA park at

Kakkancheri is not a food park, but is an industrial park with a specifically

defined food manufacturing zone as well.

</p><p id="p_4">     4. The learned counsel appearing for the project proponent has

placed a detailed counter affidavit on record. It is contended therein that

it is after complying with all due procedural requirements that the

industry has been granted integrated consent to operate under the green

category. It is contended that this Court had also been convinced of the

fact that there is no substance in the allegation that the industrial park in

question is a food park and that no other industry can be permitted

therein. It is contended that on the question of pollution that is likely to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       8</span>

be caused, the petitioners had themselves insisted on a study to be

conducted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute

(NEERI), which was impleaded as an additional respondent in these writ

petitions. It is stated that a detailed study had been conducted by the

NEERI and a report had been placed on record as required by this Court

by interim order dated 8.4.2016. It is stated that the final report of NEERI

which specifically addressed all the concerns raised by the petitioners in

these writ petitions had come to the conclusion that there will be

negligible impact on the environment due to the proposed project. All the

conditions which had to be complied with by the project proponent were

also provided in the report. It is submitted that on the basis of the report,

the interim stay granted in these writ petitions are liable to be vacated

and the project proponent is liable to be permitted to operate on the

basis of the integrated consent granted for operation of the green

category industry granted to it. The learned counsel has placed reliance

on <a href="/doc/681001/" id="a_3">State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narmada Bachao Andolan and

another</a> [(2011)7 SCC 639] and <a href="/doc/670543/" id="a_4">Bharat Singh and others v. State of

Haryana</a> [AIR 1988 SC 2181] and submitted that all clearances have

been procured by the petitioners and the continued refusal to permit the

petitioners to operate is completely misconceived. Relying on <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Sections

25(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_6">25(7)</a> of the Water Act, 1974, it is submitted that it is only on

the finding of any pollution after the industry is started that a writ

petition in the nature of the one now attempted would be maintainable at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      9</span>

all. Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the Division Bench of this

Court in <a href="/doc/1251604/" id="a_7">Parayil Granular Industries v. Kumaranalloor Grama

Panchayat</a> [2009(2) KLT 1012]         and A.Shanmughan v. Vandazhy

Grama Panchayat (W.A.No.2476 of 2015) in support of the contention

that when a single window clearance has been obtained under the Act,

the Panchayat is bound to issue a licence.

</p><p id="p_5">     5. I have considered the contentions advanced on all sides at

considerable length. The petitioners in these writ petitions placed

emphasis on the manufacturing process of gold ornaments to contend

that gold smithy and ornament manufacturing work cannot be an

industry under the green category. It is stated that from a realistic

assessment of the amount of work which the project proponent proposes

to carry out in the premises in question, it is clear that the industry can

only be one in the red category and the permission granted for such an

industry in the premises of food park is clearly illegal. However, from the

counter affidavit filed on behalf of the KINFRA, it is clear that the

industrial park in question is not a dedicated food park at all. It is clear

that there is a food processing zone, an allied zone, an IT/ITES zone and a

general zone, which is contemplated in the industrial park in question. In

the above view of the matter, since admittedly a food processing zone is

also involved, what is to be looked into is the chances of pollution which

can be caused by the industry to be run by the project proponent. I

notice from the interim order of this Court referred to above, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                        10</span>

petitioners themselves suggested that a study conducted by the Pollution

Control Board would not be conclusive and that the NEERI should be

entrusted with process of carrying out a study and submitting a report as

to the chances of pollution which the project is likely to produce. A final

report has been submitted. This Court is not an authority to decide on

the question of      pollution which is likely to be caused by a particular

industry. The NEERI, which has acceptable credentials even according to

the   petitioners,   has   submitted    a   final   report   stating   that   the

environmental impact of the proposed project on the environment will be

negligible. In the absence of any clear defects in the study conducted, I

am of the opinion that the report of the NEERI is liable to be accepted.

</p><p id="p_6">      6. With regard to the contention that the project cannot be carried

out as envisaged maintaining the requirements of an industry under the

green category, I am of the opinion that in a case where integrated

consent has already been granted, it is for the Pollution Control Board to

take appropriate steps to see that the industry conforms to the

conditions with regard to the grant of permission under the specific

category as provided in the consent. It is only when there is a violation of

the conditions of the consent that the petitioners will have a cause of

action to raise an allegation as regards the same. In view of the fact that

the project proponent had been granted an integrated consent for

operating a green category industry, I am of the opinion that the

anticipatory orders issued by this Court cannot continue especially in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      11</span>

light of the report submitted by the NEERI.

</p><p id="p_7">      In the above view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the writ

petitions filed seeking interdiction of the functioning of the project cannot

succeed, in view of the fact that the project is envisaged in the general

area of the industrial park. It is made clear that the project will be

proceeded only with all due clearances and permission and in accordance

with the specific terms of the consent issued to it as a green category

industry. The official respondents shall take all steps to see that the

project conforms to the provisions of the       Prevention and Control of

Pollution (Uniform Consent Procedure) Rules, 1999. The standards of

emissions from the project shall be monitored by the Pollution Control

Board to see that it does not exceed the acceptable levels.

</p><p id="p_8">      With the above directions, the writ petitions are disposed of.
