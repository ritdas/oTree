              case has been filed against five accused persons and the petitioner is

              shown as accused no. 4, therein. It is submitted that as per the complaint

              case, the accused persons have established a crushing plant. It is further

              submitted that although the petitioner is having storage but, he is not

              running any crushing plant and only making use of the place for storage.

              In this context, the learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to

              Annexure-2, to show that the petitioner has been given license by the

              Assistant Mining Officer, Pakur vide License No. 46 of 2011, dated 17th

              February, 2011, having validity till 31st December, 2011. By referring

              been renewed from time to time. It is further submitted that the provision

              with regard to the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as

              the alleged offence, as punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_9">Section 37</a> of the Air (Prevention

      submitted that as per the allegations made in the complaint in paragraph 4,

      none of the accused persons had legally obtained 'No Objection

      Certificate' from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board and thus

      they are operating their units illegally in violation of the provisions as laid

      down under the Air and Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.
