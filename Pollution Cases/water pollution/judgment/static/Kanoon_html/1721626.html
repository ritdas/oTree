T.S.Thakur, CJ (Oral)

            After arguing the matter at considerable length, learned

counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is willing to file an

appeal in terms of <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_1">Section 28</a> of the Water (Prevention and Control of

Pollution)Act, 1974 (for brevity to be referred to as the Act), against the

impugned order passed by the Pollution Control Board withdrawing the

consent earlier given by it, provided the petitioner is protected against any

such appeal being dismissed on the ground of limitation. He submits that

the impugned order by which the consent given in favour of the petitioner

was withdrawn, was passed as early as on August 20, 2007. Any appeal

under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_2">Section 28</a> of the Act would, therefore, be time barred as on date. He

seeks a direction to the effect that the appellate authority would entertain

the appeal and dispose the same off on merits as though it had been filed

within the time permissible in the law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            The order impugned in this petition withdraws consent earlier

granted by the State Government and is clearly appealable under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_3">Section

28</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. An appeal

in terms of that decision can be filed within a period of 30 days, from the

date on which the impugned order is communicated to the aggrieved party.

The petitioner ought to have filed an appeal within the period stipulated by

<p id="p_8">the said provision. It has obviously not done so. Learned counsel, for the

petitioner argued that the petitioner was engaged in correspondence with

the Central Government regarding the efficacy of the permission granted in

its favour under the Aravali notification. This correspondence, according to

the counsel, constitutes a sufficient cause for condonation of delay in the

filing of an appeal against the order of withdrawal. We do not for the

present propose to express any opinion about the correctness of that

argument. All that we need say is that if the petitioner prefers an appeal

under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_5">Section 28</a> of the Act, it shall also be entitled to prefer an application

for condonation of delay in filing of the said appeal in terms of proviso to

<a href="/doc/562425/" id="a_6">Section 28(1)</a> of the Act. Since the power to condone the delay is

exercisable by the appellate authority, we do not in these proceedings

propose to clutch at the jurisdiction of the appellate authority and pre-judge

the issue. All that what would say is that if an application seeking

condonation of delay is filed in terms of the proviso to <a href="/doc/562425/" id="a_7">Section 28(1)</a> of the

Act, the Appellate Authority is expected to bestow its consideration to the

same and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law. With the

above observations and        reserving liberty    to the petitioner to seek

appropriate redress before the appellate authority, this writ petition is

dismissed in limine. No costs.
