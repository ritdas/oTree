I. Mahanty, J. The present writ application has come to be filed by the

direct Opposite Party No.2 (Collector, Keonjhar) to issue necessary

surface right operation within a stipulated period.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">2.       After notice was issued in the present writ application to

the State of Odisha, a counter affidavit came to be filed through

Shri Debadutta Suranjita Jena, Under Secretary, Department of

Steel &amp; Mines, Government of Odisha on 22.06.2013, essentially

objecting to the prayer of the petitioner by raising the plea that "the

petitioner failed to submit the approved mining plan within the

stipulated time period and also did not seek extension of the period

for submission of the approved mining plan. Hence, the petitioner is

not entitled to grant of mining lease."
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.       A rejoinder affidavit came to be filed on behalf of the

petitioner, inter alia, stating that the Director of Mines, Odisha vide

its letter dated 04.05.2004 communicated the "precise area map"

over 27.794 hectares. In terms of Rule 22(4) of the Mineral

Concession Rules, 1960 (in short, the "MC Rules"), the petitioner

immediately prepared the mining plan and submitted the same to

the Central Government on 02.07.2004, before the Indian Bureau of

Mines, Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the said mining

plan was duly approved vide communication dated 11.11.2004. The

petitioner also submitted the said approved mining plan with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>



State of Odisha in the department of Steel and Mines under cover of

its letter dated 17.11.2004. Consequently, the allegation of delay in

submitting the aforesaid Mining, as alleged by the State, is not a

fact.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         Insofar as the modification of the area of lease is

concerned, it is alleged that the modification became necessary, on

account of the directions issued by the Odisha State Pollution

Control Board, who under their order dated 18.11.2006 conveyed

their "consent to establish" under Annexure-10, but limited the area

to 24.570 hectares, instead of 27.794 hectares.

</p><p id="p_7">4.       The aforesaid direction of the State Pollution Control Board

was communicated to the Director of Mines, Odisha under cover of

its letter dated 22.08.2009 who, thereafter, once again provided the

"precise area map" by reducing the original area from 27.794

hectares to 24.570 hectares.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         The petitioner in turn, submitted the modified mining plan

to the Central Government under cover of his letter dated

26.11.2009 and the Central Government i.e. the Indian Bureau of

Mines, Ministry of Mines, Government of India accorded its

necessary approval to the modified mining plan on 14.01.2010

under Annexure-18 to the writ application. The said approval of the

modified mining plan was also sent by the petitioner in original to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>



the Director of Mines, Odisha with the request for grant of mining

lease at an early date.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.       In view of the aforesaid facts, it was asserted on behalf of

the petitioner that the delay being the ground on which the State

sought to justify their inaction, is wholly without any application of

judicial mind, since there has been no delay on the part of the

petitioner in seeking for and obtaining the necessary approvals of

the modified mining plan as noted hereinabove.

</p><p id="p_10">6.       Subsequent to the counter affidavit dated 24.06.2013, an

additional affidavit came to be filed on behalf of the State by Sri

Sundar Lal Seal, Additional Secretary, Steel &amp; Mines Department,

Government of Odisha. In the said additional affidavit, it was

asserted that while the petitioner was granted with the mining lease

over 27.794 hectares vide letter dated 08.01.2004, subsequently,

the area approved under <a href="/doc/1797516/" id="a_1">Section 5(1)</a> of the Mines and Minerals

(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 (in short, the "<a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_3">MMDR Act</a>,

1957") was reduced to 24.570 hectares and in view of the

Government of India, Ministry of Mines' Circular dated 31.05.2012,

the State Government has to once again approached the Central

Government under <a href="/doc/1625195/" id="a_4">Section 5(1)</a> of the MMDR Act for approval

although the area originally approved, is sought to be reduced.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>



Accordingly, in Para-5 of the additional counter affidavit, the

following statements have been made:

<p id="p_41">            (a) Delay on the part of the petitioner in getting approval of

               the mining plans.

               MMDR Act, 1957 even in the case of reduction of area prior

               to the execution of lease deed.
</p>
<p id="p_44">11.         As noted hereinabove, insofar as the first objection is

concerned, we are of the considered view that the first objection

relating to the delay in obtaining approval of mining plan, the same

has no factual basis since as noted in Para-9 (viii) (xiii) above, the

petitioner has acted within the statutory period by obtaining necessary

sanction of mining plan from the appropriate authority i.e. Indian

Bureau of Mines, both, for the original lease area sought for as well as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                    14</span>



the revised area. Consequently, this objection on the part of the State

is merely noted to be rejected and we do not record any further

elaborate discussion on this in view of the recording of the rival stand

of the parties as noted in Para-2 &amp; 3 above.
</p>
<p id="p_45">        Insofar as the petitioner's holding six leases are concerned, the

said factual assertion though not denied by the petitioner, learned

counsel for the State as well as the Union of India could not point out

any provision of law either under the <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_28">MMDR Act</a>, 1957 or under the

M.C. Rules under which a person can be denied mining lease on

account of holding any prior holding of the leases under the State.

Consequently, the said objection also has no legal basis and is

accordingly rejected.

<p id="p_46">12.     The challenge to the Circular of the Union of India dated

31.5.2012 under Annexure-36 has to be next taken into consideration.

</p><p id="p_47">        The entire pleading in this regard has been extracted in Para-6

and, therefore, is not being reiterated herein for the sake of brevity. The

stand of the Union of India in this regard has also been extracted

hereinabove in Para-7 and also is not been reiterated herein for the

sake of brevity.

of India before issuing the letter dated 31.5.2012. It appears further

that the Department of Legal Affairs has advised the Ministry of Mines,

Government of India vide its letter dated 16.5.2012, based on which

the Ministry of Mines issued the necessary Circular to the effect that, if

the State Government has obtained previous/prior approval under

<a href="/doc/1625195/" id="a_29">Section 5(1)</a> or 11(5) of the Act for a particular area and the State

Government intends to revise/reduce the area approved by the Central

Government, it is required to approach the Central Government again.

challenge the aforesaid Circular, as an alternative submission, he
