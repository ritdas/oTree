23.04.2018    Present: Mr. Bimal Gupta, Sr. Advocate, as Amicus




                                                                      .

<p id="p_4">                            Mr. Tara Singh Chauhan, Advocate, for
                            respondent No. 9.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                            The instant petition was initiated on the basis of

             a news report, highlighting inaction on the part of various


             functionaries/instrumentalities of the State in complying

             with the environmental laws and not taking steps for


             granting sanction for prosecuting the erring officer(s)/

             official(s).
</p>
<p id="p_6">                            In the State of Himachal Pradesh, there are 61





             urban local bodies, including cantonment boards and as per





             the news report, contrary to the provisions of law, municipal

             solid waste is allowed to be dumped in open, more so along

             the river side.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                            Unscientific disposal of the municipal solid waste

             has    only     aggravated   the   problem       of    environmental

             degradation. On 4th of July, 2017, we had directed the

             Deputy Commissioners of all the Districts, falling within the

             State of Himachal Pradesh, to file their personal affidavits,

             stating the progress with regard to the process initiated for

             taking action against the erring officer(s)/official(s),

     including grant of prosecution sanction. Taking note of such




                                                                .
</p><p id="p_8">    affidavits, on 23rd of October, 2017, we passed the following





    order:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      "One of the grievances pointed out by the
               learned Amicus Curiae is inaction on the part of the
               respondent-State/authorities in considering grant of





               sanction for prosecuting the erring officials/officers,
               who were posted as Executive Officers, Municipal
               Council, Chamba and Parwanoo at the relevant time.
               From the affidavits filed by the Chief Secretary,

               Government of Himachal Pradesh and Principal

               Secretary     (Environment   Science      &amp;    Technology),
               Government of Himachal Pradesh, it is not disputed
               that such action is pending consideration. In fact, our



               attention is invited to communication, dated 29th July,
               2016, that of the Member Secretary, H.P. State




               Pollution Control Board, requesting for grant of
               prosecution    sanction.     Also,   Principal     Secretary





               (Environment Science and Technology), Government of
               Himachal Pradesh in his affidavit does state that





               matter is pending consideration with the Department
               of Urban Development. Why no decision                 stands
               taken till date remains unexplained. Is it that the
               State is actually shielding such officials/officers? Is it
               that in fact such officials/officers have not committed
               any criminal act? Or is it that State will allow status
               quo to continue for an unending period, unmindful of
               the fact that non disposal of garbage is otherwise
               affecting the environment and ecology, apart from the
               environment laws being flouted with impunity.

               decision within next two days.

<p id="p_11">                   We notice that at least with respect to two

    municipal areas, i.e. Municipal Committee, Chamba and


    Municipal Committee, Parwanoo, the regulator i.e. Himachal

    Pradesh State Pollution Control Board has initiated action


    for taking appropriate steps against the erring officer(s)/

    official(s).

    informs that with respect to Municipal Committee, Chamba,

    similar endeavour, though unsuccessfully, was also made in





    the year 2002. However, in so far as the proposed action is

    concerned, the regulator emphatically wants the matter to

    be taken to its logical end and that being prosecution of the

    erring officer(s)/official(s).

    the matter, more so, order dated 26th of October, 2017,

    Counsel wants us to examine certain files indicating that





    not only the concerned erring officer(s)/official(s) were sent

    on tour but also sensitized and made aware of various

    action plans and statutory provisions pertaining to the

    environmental laws. Before we examine the same, it is only

    appropriate that the said material is placed before the


    appropriate authority. We direct the regulator to place

    additional material in support of its request for grant of




    prosecution sanction with the appropriate authority within a





    period of two days so as to enable the Chief Secretary,





    Government of Himachal Pradesh to take an appropriate

    decision.
