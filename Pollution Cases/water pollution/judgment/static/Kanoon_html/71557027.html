</p>
<p id="p_7">                 It is submitted on behalf of convict that convict is aged about 65 

years and he has a family to support. He had closed business activity in the said 

unit in 2000 itself as the cost of regular checkup of the plant was expensive and 

his business was not a big business thought he had purchased the ETP and got 

it installed. It was a  small work and presently the  unit is lying closed and  an 

affidavit to that effect has been filed on record today. Convict is facing trial in the 

present matter for last about 15 years and in view of the ratio laid down in "A­one 

Automobile Case", a lenient view may kindly be taken.

convict has been causing pollution by running/operating his unit of electroplating

 is   prayed   that   maximum   punishment   may   be   awarded   to   the   convict   as 

prescribed in the Act.

<p id="p_9">                 I have heard the rival contentions of both the parties.

                 Now  a  days,  Environment/Pollution  has become  cause  for global 

concern. Every country across the world is working hard on ways to curb the ever 

escalating pollution in environment which is threatening the existence of human 

being, animals and trees on the Earth. Parliament, in bringing a new legislation 

for sound and betterment of Air Pollution, Water Pollution and Noise Pollution 

been hotly debating over the ways to provide clean and healthy environment to 

the citizens which are their fundamental rights. New laws are being enacted and 

new notification is issued regularly to effectively check the pollution levels in the 

atmosphere.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                 Delhi, the Capital of our country, is regarded as one of the most 

polluted cities in the world. If, the pollution in Delhi's atmosphere is not controlled, 

it would not be possible to live with a healthy life in Delhi. The people would start 

migrating to other parts of the country which are comparatively less polluted and 

Delhi would become a ghost city.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                 The Hon'ble Supreme Court explaining the gravity of the issue in 

the case of "<a href="/doc/710418/" id="a_4">UP Pollution Control Board vs. Dr. Bhupender Kumar Modi &amp; Anr</a>. 

(2009) 2 SCC 147", reiterated what was held by it about a decade ago in the case 

of "UP Pollution Control Board Vs. M/s Mohan Makin Ltd. &amp; Ors. AIR 2000 SC 

1456", observed as under:­

        "Courts can not afford to lightly deal with cases involving pollution of air 
        and water. The message must go to all concern. The courts will share the

             parliamentary   concern   on   the   escalating   pollution   level   of   our 
            environment. Those who discharge noxious polluting effluents to streams 
            may be unconcerned about the enormity of the injury which it inflicts on 
            the  public   health  at   large,   the  irreparable   impairment   it   causes   on   the 
            aquatic organisms, the deleteriousness it imposes on the life and health 
            of   animals.   So   the   Courts   should   not   deal   with   the   prosecution   for 
            offences   under   the   Act   in   a   casual   or   routine   manner.   Parliamentary 
            concern   in   the   matter   is   adequately   reflected   in   strengthening   the 
            measures   prescribed   by   the   statute.   The   court   has   no   jurisdiction   for 
            ignoring the seriousness of the subject".
