               Act, 2010. Main grievance of the Applicant is against

               port activities of "Navlakhi Port" operated by Gujarat

               Maritime Board (Respondent No.2).
</p>
<p id="p_3">               3.         Briefly stated, the Applicant's case is that

               without obtaining required lawful consent under

               provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

               Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, Navlakhi Port is handling coal

               units,         dumping   coal   near    open   areas    and

               transportation thereof in the nearby places which

               results into Air and Water Pollution.            Thus, the

               Respondent No.2 is causing violation of the Air

               (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as well

               as that of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

               Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and guidelines provided for coal

               handling.          The Respondent No.1-Gujarat Pollution

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">(J) Application No.41/2013 (WZ)                                               3</span>
                Control Board is a regulatory body which is legally

               bound to control the Air and Water Pollution.                  The

               Navlakhi Port imports coal from foreign countries on

               large scale.         The Port has installed coal handling

               capacity of 8.05 million tons per annum (MTPA) which

               is mainly is imported and huge stock of coal is

               collected in open area.           Thus, coal stocking activity

               results in coal dust emission. The Port is lighterage

               Port. Therefore, big vessels cannot enter the port for

               the purpose of unloading the coal. So, big vessels are

               anchored away from where the coal is transported

               through small vessels to Navlakhi Port where it is

               unloaded and stacked in huge heaps. Thereafter, it is

               loaded in trucks for supply to various consumers. The

               coal handling without proper management system is

               causing Air Pollution. It also leads to health hazard

               viz. breathlessness, eye soar etc. amongst the workers,

               residents of nearby area and passersby. The Maritime

               Board has not provided water fogging and sprinkling

               system in the coal handling area.                 There is no

               compound wall around the coal yards.                The nearby

               agriculture        fields   are   adversely   affected   due    to

               emission of the coal dust which is spreading due to

               the wind and hurricane.                The Gujarat Pollution

                Control Board (GPCB) noted several deficiencies in the

               coal handling of Navlathi Port and gave directions from

               time to time. The consent to operate was also denied

               on two occasions, yet, the coal handling system of

               Navlakhi           Port   did   not   show   any   improvement.

               Consequently, the Applicant filed present Application

               seeking the directions as mentioned above.

</p><p id="p_4">               4.         By filing Affidavit-in-reply, Respondent No.1

               (GSPCB) resisted the Application.                  According to

               GSPCB, consent to operate Navlakhi Port was granted

               which is valid till 23rd April 2018, subject to various

               conditions. It is averred that due to non-compliance of

               certain conditions, the request for extension of the

               consent to operate had been rejected on 18th April

               2009 and 3rd November 2010. It is further stated that

               GPCB informed Respondent No.2 to comply with the

               provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

               Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of

               Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as well as the Hazardous Waste

               Management Rules.                The GPCB had pointed out

               deficiencies in the coal handling at Navlakhi Port. The

               GPCB noticed Air Pollution caused due to unscientific

               handling of the coal loading and the unloading at

               Navlakhi Port and as such, the Maritime Board was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">(J) Application No.41/2013 (WZ)                                                  5</span>
                given directions to improve the coal handling system.

               The stance of the GPCB is that it had issued closure

               directions U/s. 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control

               of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 on 28th April 2013 for certain

               period and thereafter inspections were carried out

               from time to time.             The Maritime Board undertook

               improvement work by providing water sprinkling in the

               area, construction of pave blocked platform of 16000

               sq. mtrs. and RCC road in the port area and therefore,

               the closure order was partly stayed.                  The GPCB

               noticed            certain   deficiencies   during    inspections

               between period of May 2011 till November 2011 and

               had issued Show Cause Notices to the Maritime Board.

               It had taken required measures to ensure due

               compliances of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a>. The GPCB

               has filed supporting documents alongwith the Affidavit

               in reply.
</p>
<p id="p_5">               5.         By       filing   common    counter   Affidavit,   the

               Application is opposed by Respondent Nos. 2 and 3.

               According to them, the activities of Navlakhi Port do

               not cause any environmental damage.                  It is alleged

               that though Navlakhi Port has capacity of about 10

               million metric tone per year, yet, coal of such quantity

               does not normally reach to the fullest capacity in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">(J) Application No.41/2013 (WZ)                                                     6</span>
                stockyard of the coal which is imported at the port.

               The       coal     handling   system   duly    takes   care    of

               appropriate coal loading and unloading, stocking and

               transportation. It is further contended that Navlakhi

               Port is notified as Port under the Gujarat Maritime

               Board Act 1981 and is being operated without causing

               environmental damage. It is further contended that at

               the time of transportation of coal, loaded trucks are

               scrupulously covered by following guidelines in order

               to avoid dusting and spreading of coal particles. It is

               denied that the fugitive emission and coal particle

               causes health hazards to the residents of the nearby

               locality and passersby and workers of the port. It is

               denied that nearby agricultural lands are affected by

               the dust emission due to improper handling of the coal

               in the area as alleged by the Applicant.                      The

               Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have denied all the material

               averments made by the Applicant and have sought

               dismissal of the Application.

               Port was unable to properly manage the coal handling

</p><p id="p_17">               9.         According to the Learned Counsel for Maritime

               Board, above noted directions of the Hon'ble Gujarat

               High Court have been sufficiently complied with and,

               therefore, now it is unnecessary to consider the

               present Application.      We cannot, however, overlook

               the fact that such order was issued by the Hon'ble

               High Court of Gujarat on 10th May 2000. Thereafter,

               much water has flown under the bridge. The record

               particularly number of documents produced by the

               GPCB placed on record go to show that between 2009

               to 2011 the Maritime Board was caught on wrong

               foot.       The GPCB stated that fugitive emission was

               observed near Weigh Bridge in the port area. It was

               further observed that there was no water sprinkling

               on the coal stock stored on the platform at the

               Railway siding. The loading and unloading of the coal

               was being improperly done. The GPCB noticed that

               the directions issued by the Hon'ble High Court of

               Gujarat were as per consent order and had been

               breached by the Maritime Board. The GPCB had also

               directed closure of the Navlakhi Port on one occasion.

               It had declined to extend the consent to operate the

                port activities on 18-4-2009 as well as 3-11-2010 due

               to non compliance of the directions. The Show Cause

               Notices issued to the Maritime Board on 21-1-2014

               and 20-4-2014 go to show that the Maritime Board

               failed to improve the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_13">Port Act</a>ivities, particularly in

               respect of proper coal handling in the port area.

               Dusting was observed in the port area, sprinkling was

               not provided nor fogging system was available in the

               port area.           The Maritime Board had not provided

               metal road in port area. The Maritime Board also had

               not provided hazardous waste storage facility.

</p><p id="p_18">               10.        It is the grievance of the Applicant that though

               GPCB               observed      non-compliances      of    the

               environmental            norms     committed     by   the   Port

               Authorities, they have not taken stringent and

               precipitative action against the Port Authorities.

               Countering this argument, the learned counsel for

               GPCB cited various occasions where instruction

               letters, notices, closure and refusal of consent have

               been done by the GPCB on observing the non-

               compliances.            The learned counsel for Applicant

               pointed out that inspite of such legal actions by the

               GPCB and also, orders of Hon'ble High Court, the

               GPCB           could     not     enforce   the   environmental

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">(J) Application No.41/2013 (WZ)                                                   11</span>
                regulations             to   ensure      consistent       compliance           of

               norms.             We could not find any specific efforts of

               GPCB, as envisaged under <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_14">Section 22</a>/<a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_15">2</a> and <a href="/doc/22265957/" id="a_16">23</a>/<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_17">3</a> of

               Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 for

               taking remedial measures or recovering cost of such

               remedial measures. There is no record to show that

               prosecution as per provision of Air (Prevention and

               <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, has been launched.

               The Tribunal, therefore, feels there is an urgent need

               that GPCB shall revisit its enforcement policy which

               shall effectively integrate various aspects including

               inspection,             monitoring,       standards,           compliances,

               directions,             remedial      measures           and        filing     of

               complaints before the Court as per provisions of

               environmental                 acts,      based           on         culpability

               environmental                damages,         severity        of    pollution,

               repeated violations etc. The enforcement strategy of

               GPCB seems to be restricted to be rounded and cyclic

               in      approach             involving     inspection,             monitoring,

               directions and forfeiture of Bank guarantee which is

               invoked            in   the    event     of     each      observed           non-

               compliance. We, therefore, urge the GPCB to review

               its environmental enforcement policy on priority.

               and the Report of the Site Inspection conducted by

               the GPCB, it goes without saying that the Maritime

               Board failed to take appropriate measures to avoid

               Air and Water Pollution at Navlakhi Port. There is no

               escape from conclusion that inspite of various

               directions from time to time, the coal handling system

               of the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 was not updated and

               improved in order to avoid Air and Water Pollution. It

               appears that after interim orders of this Tribunal,

               certain            improvements   have   been   done   by   the

               Maritime Board.             The Maritime Board has now

               provided paved platform at the Railway siding. The

               Maritime Board is required to seriously deal with the

               issue of Air and Water Pollution.               An additional

</p>
<p id="p_22">              12.         Navlakhi Port handles a significant quantity of

              mainly imported coal which is normally available in

              smaller sizes with significant percentage of fine dust.

              As mentioned earlier, the coal is brought to the port,

              from the large vessels anchored deep in the sea

              through smaller vessels or barges.              Port Authorities

              are using moving machines like poclain for lifting of

              the coal from the smaller vessels and then stocking it

              in the port area.        Subsequently, the stacked coal is

              lifted by similar machines for putting them in the

              transportation trucks.              All this semi-mechanical

              system involves significant number of coal transfer

              points, which are important sources of fugitive dust

              emissions.          In order to plan a comprehensive Air

              Pollution programme, all these potential sources of

              dust emissions need to be appropriately covered,

              which is not possible in the present coal handling

              arrangements. What efforts presently being taken by

              the Port Authorities are towards not allowing further

              spreading of the dust through measures like water

              fogging         compound    wall,     garland    drainage   etc.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">(J) Application No.41/2013 (WZ)                                                  16</span>
               However, for such significant coal handling capacity,

              the Port Authority needs to plan for adopting the

              cleaner technology for handling of coal through

              hermetically sealed conveyance system and also fully

              mechanised coal lifting and also unloading.             Such

              system will control the fugitive dust emission at the

              source itself, and also will lead to reduce the loss of

              coal through the emissions.        Worldwide and even in

              India, several ports are adopting such mechanised

              coal handling practice as an environmental initiative.

              The loss of coal through the dust emissions is nothing

              but an environmental concern alongwith the financial

              loss to the port authorities. The port authorities have

              submitted that they intend to adopt mechanization of

              coal handling process in next five (5) years though

              verbally they agreed to time frame of three (3) years.

              Though we do not find any substantial justification for

              such a long duration, we feel it proper to leave the

              matter to GPCB and GMB to decide on the time frame.

              What we are keen is to ensure regular compliance of

              environmental norms.

              abatement, the coal fine dust needs to be scientific

              controlled rather than just adopting the water fogging

               and sprinkling measures. Though water is one of the

              most primitive agents which are used as dust

              controlled measures, new and clean technology is

              available through certain dust control chemical agents

              which are more effective in suppressing dust and are

              applied much less frequently.            The Port Authorities

              need to carry out a scientific assessment of the

              efficacy of various dust control agents before adopting

              the new initiatives.

<p id="p_24">              13.         We have gone through the Action Plan putforth

              by the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3.               The Respondent

              No.2 stated that some of the compliances have been

              duly done.          It is, however, stated that some of the

              compliances will be done within a time period as

              stated        in    the   last   paragraph.    For   example;

              recommendation that there should be a proper

              drainage system around all coal storage area and

              along roads so that water drained from sprinkling and

              run off is collected at a common tank and can be

              reused after screening through the coal slit or any

              other effective treatment system is given time till end

              of June 2015 for compliance. We fail to see why such

              a long time is needed for compliance of the said

              recommendation. The Maritime Board appears to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">(J) Application No.41/2013 (WZ)                                               18</span>
               rather sitting over the correctional steps/measures

              required to be taken to improve the coal handling

              system. As a matter of fact, in the year 2000 itself,

              the Maritime Board was expected to update the

              system and ensure due compliances to meet the

              environmental norms.          This could have avoided the

              second round of litigation. The proposed Action Plan

              of the Maritime Board shows that in respect of some of

              the recommendations, there are only assurances for

              compliances within a time frame.            We are afraid,

              Maritime Board will again commit breach of the word

              and fail to comply the recommendations of the M.S.

              University.         Be that may as it is, the parties have

              agreed to the recommendations of the M.S. University,

              Baroda and shall have to comply with the same and

              therefore, it would be appropriate to direct the

              Respondent No.2 (Maritime Board) to comply with the

              recommendations in stricto sensu.          Needless to say,

              the Application will have to be partly granted.
