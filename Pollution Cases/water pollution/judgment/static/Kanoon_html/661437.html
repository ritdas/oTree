<p id="p_1">            This order shall dispose of Civil Writ Petitions No. 5079 of

2002 and 5957 of 2007 as common questions of law and facts are

involved in both the cases. For brevity, the facts are being taken from

Civil Writ Petition No. 5079 of 2002, suo-moto initiated by this Court

on the basis of a news item dated 21st March, 2002 which appeared

in the Chandigarh News Line under the caption "This mill rides

roughshod over rules, to discharge a torrent of disease".

[2].        M/s Rana Mohendra Papers Limited, Village Fatehpur

[Sialba], District Ropar [here-in-after referred to as "the Industry"] was

granted consent to manufacture Duplex Board @ 25 TPD on 5th
 CWP NO. 5079 OF 2002.                                    ::-2-::
</p>
<p id="p_2">September, 1990.     Some of the many conditions imposed by the

Punjab Pollution Control Board [ in short "the Board"] were that "the

industry shall dispose of treated effluents conforming to IS:2490

[Part-I]1981 onto land for irrigation and shall not allow to it stagnate

any where inside or outside their premises; the industry shall submit

the performance study of the treatment facility within a period of 3

months after commissioning of the treatment plant; and the industry

shall lay down a proper net work of pipe lines for effective distribution

of trade effluent for irrigation purposes". It appears that the Industry

started manufacturing 'Kraft Paper' in October, 1990 by using straw,

sarkanda, bagasse, rag waste paper, caustic soda and alum as raw

material in violation of the conditions of consent to establish. A

sample of the trade effluent discharged by the Industry was collected

by the Board on 6th February, 1991 and all the parameters like BOD,

TDS and TSS were found in excess of the limits prescribed for such

discharges into inland surface water.
</p>
<p id="p_3">[3].        The report led to the issuance of a show cause notice to

the Industry on 4th July, 1991. However, it was after a lengthy

correspondence and various visits to the Industry by the Environment

Protection Squad of the Board that a notice under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of

the Water [Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution] Act, 1974 [for short "the

Act"] was issued on 30th October, 1996, followed by an order dated

14th February, 1997 "for the closure of the industry". The Industry

then approached this Court by way of Civil Writ Petition No.7241 of

1997 in which interim directions to restore its electricity connection

and to conduct comprehensive study of the Industry, were issued to
 CWP NO. 5079 OF 2002.                                   ::-3-::
</p>
<p id="p_4">the Board. Thereafter, the Industry was allowed to operate only at

that manufacturing capacity at which its existing effluent treatment

plant was adequate. The Industry was further directed not to

discharge any effluent into Siswan Choe and to utilize whole of its

treated trade effluent onto land for irrigation.

[4].        The samples of the effluent taken from the Industry on

11th May, 1998 having failed, the Board declined consent to the

Industry vide order dated 29th July, 1998. On an appeal by the

Industry, the Appellate Authority directed to inspect the industry and

re-collect the samples of the treated trade effluent. The samples

were collected on 28th January, 1999 and 7th April, 1999 respectively

but the same did not meet with the prescribed standards. The

Appellate Authority, in the circumstances noticed above, directed the

Industry to submit     "time schedule for providing adequate water

pollution control devices" but it failed to do so. The Appellate

Authority, after holding that the "Industry is creating water pollution

and causing degradation to environment" and that "ample opportunity

has been extended to the industry to cure these ills but they have

failed to do so", confirmed the directions issued by the Board under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33-A</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_5">[5].        The Industry thereafter      applied afresh for "Consent to

Operate" under the Act on 18th September, 2000 with the plea that it

will use 20% waste paper as raw material instead of the present 5%.

It also submitted affidavits from the nearby farmers that they will use

its treated trade effluent on their land measuring approximately 36

acres. The Industry was allowed temporary power connection for two

</p>
<p id="p_6">months on consideration of this request. However, the sample taken

by the Environment Protection Squad of the Board on 7th December,

2000 failed again. It further appears that even when the digesters of

the Industry were sealed on 22nd March, 2001, it unabatedly

continued to discharge its treated trade effluent into Siswan Choe,

turning it into a disastrous torrent of disease as reported in the news

item.
</p>
<p id="p_7">[6].       On 26th July, 2002, this Court directed the Board

Authorities to collect fresh samples and submit the report after

getting them tested in three different Laboratories. The reports,

however, having been found far from satisfactory, the Haryana

Pollution Control Board was directed on 19th September, 2002 to

collect samples of the effluents being discharged by the Industry and

file a report. The Experts from the Punjab and Haryana Agriculture

Universities were also associated to collect samples of the soil where

the effluents were being discharged by the Industry and test them in

the laboratory to find out whether the crops, fruits and vegetables etc.

grown over there were inflected and could cause any disease to the

consumers.
</p>
<p id="p_8">[7].       Suffice it to say that based on these reports and

meanwhile having regard to the assertion made by the Industry that

various effective steps had been taken by it, this Court got joint

inspections conducted from the Punjab and Haryana Pollution

Control Boards.
</p>
<p id="p_9">[8].       On 18th December, 2006, this Court reminded to one and

all the importance of ecological and environmental issues being the
 CWP NO. 5079 OF 2002.                                    ::-5-::

<p id="p_10">foundation of a citizen's life as also the mandate of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> of the

Constitution which provides much more than an animal existence

with clean air and healthy environment. Learned amicus-curiae was

requested to inspect the site of the industry and submit a report

regarding the discharge of its trade effluent in Siswan Choe.

[9].        Vigorous monitoring done by this Court forced the

authorities to come out of their slumber and take action against the

Industry as permissible in law. The Punjab Board passed an order

dated 5th April, 2007 under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">Section 33-A</a> of the Act whereby the

Industry was directed to dismantle and remove all its outlets and stop

forthwith the discharge of its trade effluent onto land for stagnation or

through any other mode. The Industry was restrained from restarting

any process unless all necessary water pollution control measures

were taken and concentration of various pollutants in its treated trade

effluent conformed to the effluent standards laid down by the Board

for such discharge. It was further directed that the Industry will not

restart discharging the effluents until it obtains the consent of the

Board under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_6">26</a> of the Act. The Punjab State Electricity

Board was also directed to disconnect the electricity supply available

to the Industry.
</p>
<p id="p_11">[10].       The aforementioned order dated 5th April, 2007 has been

assailed by the Industry in Civil Writ Petition No. 5957 of 2007 which

is also being disposed of by this order.
</p>
<p id="p_12">[11].       As the Industry came up with the plea that all remedial

measures have now been taken by it to ensure that its trade effluents

conform to the standards prescribed by the Board, a status report

</p>
<p id="p_13">was asked from the Board authorities. The Assistant Environmental

Engineer, Nodal Office, Mohali has submitted the latest status report

which reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Earlier the petitioner industry was manufacturing duplex
           board using agro waste as raw material. The industry
           changed its manufacturing process and product in Dec.
           2006. Presently the petitioner industry is engaged with
           the manufacturing of writing and printing paper using
           waster paper as raw material.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           The Industry has installed an effluent treatment plan
           consisting of collection sump, settling lagoon, settling
           tank and clarifier. The treated effluent is discharged onto
           land for irrigation. It has also installed 2 Boilers of steam
           generation capacity 8 T/hr. Out of which one is in
           operation and the other is in dismantled condition. Multi
           Cyclone with heat recovery unit has been installed as air
           pollution control device.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           The samples of the treated trade effluent from the outlet
           of Effluent Treatment Plant were collected by the Punjab
           Pollution Control Board on 13.09.2007. As per the
           analysis report, the various parameters of the effluent

           as prescribed by the Board. Accordingly, consent to
           operate an outlet u/s 25/26 of Water [Prevention and
           Control of Pollution] Act, 1974 has been granted to the
           industry by the Board which is valid upto 14.10.2008.</blockquote><p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">           Emission samples from stack attached to the Boiler after
           air pollution control device were also collected by the
           Punjab Pollution Control Board on 13.09.2007. As per the
           analysis report, Suspended Particulate Matter in the
           emission was found to be 446 mg/Nm3 . The industry has

</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">[12].      In addition to the above reproduced status report, which

does suggest that the trade effluents/emissions discharged by the

Industry now conform to the parameters laid down by the Board,

learned counsel for the Board has stated, at the Bar, that for the time

being, no pollution whatsoever is being caused by the Industry.

[13].      Having regard to the subsequent events noticed above

and the categoric stand taken by the authorities of the Punjab

Pollution Control Board that the Industry is no more causing any air

or water pollution, the writ petition filed by the Industry impugning the

action taken against it by the Board under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_7">Section 33-A</a> of the Act, in

a way, has been rendered infructuous. We order accordingly.

[14].      We are further of the view that the stage is now ripe to

dispose of the suo-moto proceedings as well, though with a caveat

that the disposal thereof, in no circumstances, shall be construed to

mean that the authorities in the Board are absolved of their statutory

responsibility to take samples of the trade effluents of the industry

from time to time and keep on monitoring to ensure that no air or

water pollution is caused by the said industry. Since the consent has

been granted by the Board to the Industry for a limited period, i.e., up

to 31st December, 2008, we direct that before granting further

consent, the Board authorities shall collect samples of the trade

effluents/emissions and only after ensuring that the Industry

conforms to the prescribed parameters that further consent shall be

<p id="p_18">[15].       We   have   purposefully   referred    to   the   facts   and

circumstances which led to the devastating impact on the air and

water in the area around the Industry to remind the authorities

concerned that remiss, if any, on their part in future, might lead to

more serious implications and, thus, would invite stringent action by

this Court against them as well as the Industry.
</p>
<p id="p_19">[16].       While expressing our gratitude to the authorities of

Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar as well as Haryana Pollution

Control Board, who extended their expert assistance to this Court

from time to time, we direct the Industry to pay a sum of Rs.21,870/-

incurred by the HAU, Hisar in soil testing as also pay the amount

billed by the Haryana Pollution Control Board for conducting the tests

under the directions of this Court. The needful shall be done within a

period of two months.
