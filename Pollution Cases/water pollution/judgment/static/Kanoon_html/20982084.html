06/13.07.2016</pre><p id="p_1">    Heard the parties.
</p><p id="p_2">                In this application, the petitioner has prayed for quashing the
          entire criminal proceeding in connection with O.C.R. Case No. 37 of
          2014 including the order dated 24.03.2014, passed by the learned
          Chief Judicial Magistrate, whereby and whereunder cognizance has
          been taken for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_1">section 37</a> of the Air
          (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> as also under <a href="/doc/1964073/" id="a_3">Sections 38</a>/<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_4">44</a>
          of Water ( (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_3">                It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner
          that the petitioner has already obtained consent to operate the
          Crusher Machine from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board
          and in fact the complaint petition itself reveals the exact period with
          respect to alleged running of Crusher Machine by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_4">                It has further been submitted that since the complaint petition
          itself is vague and in view of the permission obtained from the
          Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, criminal proceeding as
          against the petitioner deserves to be quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_5">                Learned A.P.P. has opposed the prayer made by the petitioner.
                It appears from the complaint petition that prior to grant of "No
          Objection Certificate" from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control
          Board, the petitioner was running the Crusher Machine. Although no
          specific date has been mentioned in the complaint petition but the
          same cannot by any stretch of imagination be a ground to quash the
          entire criminal proceeding. The petitioner was running the Crusher
          Machine, for which he was repeatedly warned by the Jharkhand State
          Pollution Control Board and ultimately the Board had no option but to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -2-</span>
institute     a   complaint   petition   against   the   petitioner.   The
communication made by the Board to the petitioner itself reveals that
prior to "No Objection Certificate" granted in favour of the petitioner,
the petitioner was indeed running the Crusher Machine illegally
without having any Sanction/"No Objection Certificate"/Consent to
operate from the Board.
</p><p id="p_6">          Since a prima facie case is made out against the petitioner and
this application being devoid of any merit is hereby dismissed.
However, the petitioner is at liberty to raise all the points at
appropriate stage.
