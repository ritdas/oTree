ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	present appeal, under <a href="/doc/1856707/" id="a_1">section 378(4)</a> of the Code of Criminal
	Procedure, 1973, is directed against the judgment and order of
	acquittal dated 20.04.2006 passed by the learned  Judicial
	Magistrate, First Class, Junagadh, in Criminal  Case No. 7367 of
	1993, whereby the learned Magistrate has acquitted the respondents  
	accused from the charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The
	brief facts of the prosecution case is that the respondent No. 1 is
	private limited company and respondents No.2 &amp; 3 are the
	Directors and respondent No. 4 is the Chief Chemist of the said
	respondent No.1   Company. It is alleged that in the said company
	is engaged in doing the business of chemical and discharging the
	effluent water without purifying the same. It is alleged that on
	27.5.1993 Shri K.C. Pancholi, Assistant Engineer, Shri J.D. Kalyani
	and Shri B.R. Kochara, of the office of the Board at Rajkot, have
	visited the factory of respondent No.1 for inspection, after issuing
	the notice. They have taken the sample water from the said company.
	It is alleged that after sealing the sample the same was sent to the
	Public Analyst for analysis. It is alleged that the Public Analyst
	submitted the Report on 17.7.1993 and as per the said Report it was
	found that the accused have committed the breach of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_2">Section 24</a> &amp;
	<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">25</a> of the Water Act and, therefore, they are responsible for the
	offences under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_5">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_6">47</a> of the Water Act. Thereafter,
	after obtaining sanction complaint
	has been filed against the respondents   accused. Thereafter, the
	trial was conducted against the respondents   accused. The trial
	Court examined the witnesses and also considered the documentary
	evidence led before it and after considering the documentary as well
	as oral evidence has acquitted the respondents   accused from the
	charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_3">It
	was contended by learned Advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the appellant
	that  the judgment and order of the learned Magistrate is not
	proper, legal and it is erroneous. He has also contended that the
	learned Magistrate has not considered the evidence of the witnesses.
	He has contended that the Board Officers have followed the rules
	prescribed by law and the Officer of the Board have also followed
	the procedure of taking the sample. The sample was seized and sealed
	properly. Yet, the learned Magistrate has not considered the
	evidence of prosecution. Therefore, the order impugned in this
	appeal passed by the learned Magistrate requires to be quashed and
	set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Learned
	Advocate, appearing for the respondents   original accused,  has
	supported the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the trial
	Court and contended that the trial Court has rightly acquitted the
	respondents   accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">It
	is a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the Appellate
	Court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give fresh
	reasonings when the Appellate Court is in agreement with the reasons
	assigned by the trial court acquitting the accused.  In the instant
	case, this Court is in full agreement with the reasons given and
	findings recorded by the trial Court while acquitting the
	respondents- accused and adopting the said reasons and for the
	reasons aforesaid, in my view, the impugned judgment is just, legal
	and proper and requires no interference by this Court at this stage.
	From the perusal of record it appears that the prosecution has not
	followed Rule   27, which is mandatory and, therefore, there is no
	question to entertain this Appeal. Hence, this appeal requires to be
	dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Even
	in a recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_7">State
	of Goa V. Sanjay Thakran &amp; Anr. Reported</a> in (2007)3 SCC 75,
	the Court has reiterated the powers of the High Court in such cases.
	In para 16 of the said decision the Court has observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_7"> 16.
	From the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that while exercising
	the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal the Court of
	appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal
	unless the approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest
	illegality and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by
	any reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be
	characterized as perverse. Merely because two views are possible,
	the Court of appeal would not take the view which would upset the
	judgment delivered by the Court below. However, the appellate court
	has a power to review the evidence if it is of the view that the
	conclusion arrived at by the Court below is perverse and the Court
	has committed a manifest error of law and ignored the material
	evidence on record. A duty is cast upon the appellate court, in such
	circumstances, to re-appreciate the evidence to arrive to a just
	decision on the basis of material placed on record to find out
	whether any of the accused is connected with the commission of the
	crime he is charged with. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">Similar
	principle has been laid down by the Apex Court in the cases of State
	of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Ram Veer Singh &amp; Ors, reported in 2007 AIR
	SCW 5553 and
	in Girja
	Prasad (Dead) by LRs Vs. state of MP, reported in 2007 AIR SCW 5589.
	Thus, the powers which this Court may exercise against an order of
	acquittal are well settled.
</p>
<p id="p_9">It
	is also a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the
	appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give
	fresh reasonings, when the reasons assigned by the Court below are
	found to be just and proper. Such principle is laid down by the Apex
	Court in the case of State
	of Karnataka Vs. Hemareddy, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417,
	wherein,
	it is held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_10"> &amp;
This court
has observed in Girija Nandini Devi V.
</p><p id="p_11">Bigendra Nandini Chaudhary (1967)1 SCR 93:
(AIR 1967 SC 1124) that
it is not the duty of the appellate court when it
agrees with the view of the trial court on the evidence to repeat the
narration of the evidence or to reiterate the
reasons given by the trial court expression of
general agreement with the reasons given by the Court the decision of
which is under appeal, will ordinarily suffice. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">Thus,
	in case the appellate court agrees with the reasons and the opinion
	given by the lower court, then the discussion of evidence is not
	necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_13">I
	have gone through the judgment and order passed by the trial court.
	I have also perused the oral as well as documentary evidence led by
	the trial court and also considered the submissions made by learned
	Advocate for the appellant. The trial court while considering the
	oral as well as documentary evidence has clearly observed that the
	prosecution has not followed the mandatory provision of Rule 27. 
	The trial Court has clearly found that the  prosecution has failed
	to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Even in the present
	appeal, nothing is produced or pointed out to rebut the conclusion
	of the trial Court. Thus, from the evidence itself it is established
	that the prosecution has
	not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_14">Mr
	Sunil Mehta learned Advocate  for the appellant is not in a position
	to show any evidence to take a contrary view of the matter or that
	the approach of the trial court is vitiated by some manifest
	illegality or that the decision is perverse or that the trial court
	has ignored the material evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_15">In
	the above view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that
	the trial court was completely justified in acquitting the
	respondent of the charges leveled against him.
</p>
<p id="p_16">I
	find that the findings recorded by the trial court are absolutely
	just and proper and in recording the said findings, no illegality or
	infirmity has been committed by it.
</p>
<p id="p_17">I
	am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
	conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the
	court below and hence find no reasons to interfere with the same.
	Hence the appeal is hereby dismissed. R &amp; P to be sent back to
	the trial Court, forthwith. Bail bond, if any, stands cancelled.
