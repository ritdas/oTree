ORAL
ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	appellant had filed this Appeal under <a href="/doc/1903086/" id="a_1">Section 374</a> of the Code of
	Criminal Procedure, 1973 against the judgment and order of acquittal
	dated 28th December 2006 passed by the learned 2nd
	Additional Senior Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class,
	Junagadh, in Criminal Case No. 7379 of 1993, whereby the
	respondents accused have been acquitted from the charges levelled
	against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The
	brief facts of the prosecution case is that the Respondent
	No.2-accused is a Firm and Respondent Nos.3 to 7 are the Directors
	of Respondent No.1 and the Respondent No.8 is a Plant In-charge of
	the Respondent No.1 Firm. It it also the case of the prosecution
	that the Respondent No.1 Firm is manufacturing Reactive Dyes using
	raw materials like H. Acid, Vinyl Sulphone, K. Acid, etc.  It is
	also the case of the prosecution that on 21st May 1993
	officials of the appellant had visited the Respondent No.1 and
	prepared a Report. They had also collected water samples from the
	Respondent No.1 Firm. It is also the case of the prosecution that on
	24th May 1993 they had sent the sample to the Analysis
	Board for analysis. The appellant had received the Analysis Report
	on 28th June 1993, which shows that the respondents have
	committed breach of <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_2">Section 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_4">47</a> of the Water Act. It is
	also the case of the prosecution that every month the respondents
	manufactured 1 MT Reactive Dyes and generating polluted water. This
	polluted water is discharged by the respondents without any consent
	taken from the appellant. Therefore, a complaint was filed by the
	appellant against the respondents under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_5">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">25</a> of The
	Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 in the Court
	of learned 2nd Additional Senior Civil Judge and Judicial
	Magistrate First Class, Junagadh. Pending the trial, original
	accused no.6 had expired and case against him was abated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">Thereafter,
	the trial was initiated against the respondents accused in the
	Court of learned Magistrate. To prove the case against the
	respondents accused, the prosecution has examined the witnesses
	and also produced documentary evidence and at the end of the trial,
	the learned Magistrate has acquitted the respondents accused from
	the charges levelled against them, vide judgment and order dated
	28th December 2006 in Criminal Case No.7379 of 1993.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Being
	aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said judgment and order
	passed by the learned Magistrate, the appellant has filed the
	present Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Learned
	advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, has contended that
	the judgment and order of Trial Court is against the provisions of
	law. The Trial Court has not properly appreciated the facts and
	evidence led by the prosecution and looking to the provisions of law
	itself it is clearly established that the prosecution has proved the
	whole ingredients of offence against the respondents-accused.
	Learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant has also taken
	this Court through the oral as well as documentary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">I
	have perused the oral as well as documentary evidence. I have also
	considered the submissions made by the learned advocate on behalf of
	the appellant. From the perusal of the judgment of the Trial Court
	it is established that has not supported the case of prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Thus,
	in my opinion, looking to the evidence on record, from the evidence
	itself it is  clearly established that the prosecution has not
	proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_8">At
	the outset it is required to be noted that the principles which
	would govern and regulate the hearing of appeal by this Court
	against an order of acquittal passed by the Trial Court have been
	very succinctly explained by the Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of
	decisions. Thus, the powers which this Court may exercise against an
	order of acquittal are well settled. Thus, in case the Appellate
	Court agrees with the reasons and the findings given by the lower
	Court, then the discussion of evidence is not necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_9">I
	have gone through the judgment and order passed by the Trial Court
	and have also perused the oral as well as documentary evidence
	produced before me and also considered the submissions made by the
	learned advocate for the appellant. On going through the judgment
	and order passed by the Trial Court and the papers placed before me,
	I am of the opinion that the Trial Court has not committed any error
	in not believing the case of the prosecution. I find that the
	findings recorded by the Trial Court are absolutely just and proper
	and in recording the said findings no illegality or infirmity has
	been committed by it. The learned Judge has rightly come to the
	conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the
	case against the respondent accused.
</p>
<p id="p_10">I
	am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
	conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the
	Court below and hence find no reason to interfere with the same.
	Hence, the Appeal is hereby dismissed at the admission stage.
</p>
<p id="p_11">In
	view of above, the Appeal is dismissed. The judgment and order dated
	28th December 2006 passed by the learned 2nd
	Additional Senior Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class,
	Junagadh, in Criminal Case No.7379 of 1993 is hereby confirmed. Bail
	bond, if any, shall stands cancelled.
