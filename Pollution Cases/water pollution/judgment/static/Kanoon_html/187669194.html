                 DEVAN RAMACHANDRAN, J.
              ---------------------------------------
                   WP(C) No.4326 of 2014
              ---------------------------------------
            Dated this the 22nd day of March, 2017

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner claims to be a resident of Edarikkode,

Malappuram and he says that a multi-storied residential complex

has been constructed by the 9th respondent close to his

residential house. He alleges that because of the construction of

this building and because of the large water extraction by the

residents of the said building, using a bore-well constructed in

the complex, water sources to his property, including his well,

has become now attenuated, on account of the severe drought

that our State is presently facing. He has, therefore, filed this

writ petition avouching that the construction of a bore-well will

require permission from the Grama Panchayat under Rule 91 of

the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules [for brevity, the Rules] and

that the 9th respondent, in not having obtained such a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP(C) No.4326 of 2014            2</span>



permission, the bore-well constructed by him should be deemed

to be illegal and therefore, shut down. The petitioner has made

other corollary prayers also, but what has been recorded above

appears to be his primary line of contention.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. I have heard Sri.Harish Vasudevan, the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner, the learned Government Pleader

appearing for respondents 1,3,5,6 &amp; 7, Sri.K.R. Avinash Kunnath,

the learned Standing Counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent,

Sri.T. Naveen, the learned Standing Counsel appearing for the 4th

respondent and Sri.T. Krishnan Unni, the learned Senior Advocate

assisted by Sri.Devesh, appearing for respondents 8 &amp; 9.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. Since the hypostasis of the petitioner's contentions is

Rule 91 of the Rules, I have examined it quite in extenso. The

provisions relating to wells in general are governed by        by

Chapter XIV of the Rules, which begins from Rule 91 and ends

with Rule 97. Rule 91 provides that no new well can be dug

without the permission of the concerned Local Self Government

Institution [LSGI]. Rule 93A thereof further provides that in the

case of a tube-well, clearance from the Ground Water

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP(C) No.4326 of 2014            3</span>



Department shall be obtained and produced prior to the issuance

of the permit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. Even on an exfacie examination of these Rules, it

becomes indubitable that under the regime of these Rules, even a

bore-well cannot be dug without the permission of the Secretary

of the LSGI and without first obtaining clearance from the Ground

Water Department. To that extent, the petitioner is justified in

contending in this writ petition. However, in this case I notice

that the bore-well admittedly was drilled, by respondents 8 &amp; 9,

as early as in the year 2011 when Rule 93A had not been

engrafted into the Statute. This Rule was introduced into the

Rules by the Kerala Panchayat Building [Amendment] Rules,

2014, which obtained effect from 10.01.2014. I cannot see from

the amendment that it is intended to operate retrospectively.

Viewed from that perspective, the construction and digging of the

tube-well by respondents 8 &amp; 9 in the year 2011 cannot be found

to be hit by the rigor of the requirements under Chapter XIV of

the Rules. Even though Rule 91 says that no well shall be dug

without the permission of the Secretary until 2014, the Rules did

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP(C) No.4326 of 2014              4</span>



not provide for these provisions to apply also to tube-wells. All

the provisions in the Rules relating to the tube-wells were

introduced only with effect from the amendment noticed above.

In such view of the matter, the petitioner's action in having dug

the tube-well in the year 2011 without the permission of the

Panchayat cannot be found to be at fault or to be foul of law. This

is more so because I see from Ext.R9(e), which is an information

given by the Panchayat themselves, that prior to 2014 there was

no requirement to obtain any such licence from its Secretary.

When the Panchayat itself has understood the Rules to be so, I

cannot blame respondents 8 &amp; 9 in having dug a tube-well in the

year 2011 without first obtaining a permission from the

Secretary.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. That having been said, what is now remaining for my

consideration is as to what is the relief that the petitioner can

justifiably expect from this Court. I understood that the

petitioner's concern is that respondents 8 &amp; 9, by indiscriminate

drawing of water through the bore-well, would cause shortage of

water in the vicinity, specifically this year when Kerala is facing a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WP(C) No.4326 of 2014              5</span>



major drought. I am certain that the petitioner's anxiety is

justified, since indiscriminate and uncontrolled exploitation of

water sources would cause ruin to wells and other sources of

water in the neighbourhood and this cannot be permitted.

However I do not require to labour much because I see that the

Ground Water Department has already prescribed certain strict

conditions in its Ext.P7 order, to be followed by respondents 8 &amp;

9 while operating the tube-well. I find those conditions to be very

pragmatic and prudent. I am also told that the conditions in

Ext.P7 have now also been incorporated into the Consent to

Operate issued by the Pollution Control Board under the

provisions of the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a>. If this be so, obviously most

of apprehension of the petitioner has been already allayed and

his anxiety to a large extent of doused.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. Having found that the petitioner is now bound by very

strict conditions as prescribed in Ext.P7 and that such conditions

are now part of the Consent to Operate, I have to now ensure

that respondents 8 &amp; 9 comply with these conditions scrupulously

in its letter and spirit without violation or exception.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WP(C) No.4326 of 2014           6</span>
</p><p id="p_7">      7. Since I see that Ext.P7 has been issued as early as

11.06.2013 and since after that order our State is facing a severe

drought, I am of the view that a fresh joint inspection by the 4th

respondent-Environmental Engineer and the 7th respondent-

District Officer, Ground Water Department will have to be done in

the presence of the petitioner, respondents 8 &amp; 9 and the

Secretary of the Grama Panchayat. This exercise shall be done by

these respondents as early as possible, but not later than two

weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this

judgment. The drawal of water by respondents 8 &amp; 9 from the

tube-well will depend thereafter on such report to be made by

these respondents after the joint verification and subject to such

modifications as may be warranted to Ext.P7 order.

</p><p id="p_8">      8. However, until such time, as there is any such

modification, respondents 8 &amp; 9 will be bound by the terms of

Ext.P7 and to follow any modification after the joint verification

as above in future.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9. I deem it appropriate that the 7th respondent cause

inspection of the bore-well of respondents 8 &amp; 9 on a periodic

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WP(C) No.4326 of 2014             7</span>



basis, since climatic and weather conditions change constantly

and availability of water in the sources would also vary subject to

such climatic or atmospheric changes.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      10. The above being said and ordered, there is one issue

that I think requires to be pointedly noticed by this Court at this

time. I see that Ext.P17 is a reading of the water meter attached

to the bore-well. It is distressing that in the 3rd page of the said

document, the water reading had been recorded in what appears

to be in an improbable manner. This is because, on 29.03.2016,

the water meter is recorded to show a reading of 797, whereas

on 30.03.2016 it shown as 717. The petitioner says that this is

on account of manipulation, but I do not propose to hold so

conclusively in the absence of proof, even though the probability

of there being a machination behind this, cannot be completely

ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      11. In such circumstances, I direct the 7th respondent to be

personally in charge of the water meter installed in the tube-well

and to ensure that the reading of the same is conducted properly

without any manipulation or guile and in an open and transparent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WP(C) No.4326 of 2014             8</span>



manner and by ensuring that respondents 8 &amp; 9 draw water only

in the strictest compliance of the terms of Ext.P7 or such other

orders modifying it, in future.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      I clarify that nothing in this judgment would however stop

respondents 8 &amp; 9 from approaching the competent Authorities

namely the 7th respondent or the 4th respondent from seeking

modification of Ext.P7 or further orders as may be passed from

time to time, depending upon the availability of water in the

natural sources, which modification will depend substantially on

scientific evidence to be gathered by the competent Authorities

through proper verification.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      This writ petition is thus ordered as above. In the peculiar

facts and circumstances of this case, I make no order as to costs

and I direct the parties to suffer their respective costs.
