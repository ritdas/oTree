Litigation--Protection	of environment and keeping  it	free
from   pollution--Indispensable	  necessity  for   life	  on
earth--Directions  given to exhibit Cinema slides, films  on

HEADNOTE:
    This  application is in public interest  seeking  relief
for issuing appropriate directions of this Court to  Cinema,
exhibition  hails to exhibit slides  containing	 information
and messages on environment free of cost. Further directions
for spread of information relating to environment in nation-
al and regional languages vide broadcast thereof on the	 All
India  Radio, exposure thereof on television in regular	 and
short term programmes with a view to educating the people of
India  about  their social obligation in the matter  of	 the
upkeep	of the environment in proper shape and	making	them
alive  to their obligation not to act as polluting  agencies
or factors. It is further prayed that environment should  be
made  a	 compulsory  subject in schools and  colleges  in  a
graded	system	so that there would be a general  growth  of
awareness.
    Till  1972 general awareness of mankind to the  environ-
ment for the well being of mankind had not been appropriate-
ly appreciated. In 1975 the Constitution underwent an amend-
ment  by  incorporating	 an <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_1">Article  51A</a>  with	the  heading
"Fundamental  Duties"  Clause  (g)  thereof  requires  every
citizen	 to  protect  and improve  the	natural	 environment
including  forests, lakes, rivers and wild life and to	have
compassion  for every living creature. In 1974 Water  Pollu-
tion  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_2">Central  Act</a>  came on the statues book.  In  1981	 Air
Pollution (Central Act) and finally in 1986 the	 <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment
Protection Act</a> were enacted.
    Law	 is  a	regulator of human conduct but	no  law	 can
indeed	effectively work unless there is an element  of	 ac-
ceptance by the people in society.
379
    There  has been an explosion of human  population,	over
the  last 50 years. Life has become competitive so  the	 age
old  norms  of good living are no longer  followed.  It	 has
therefore,  become  necessary that people be made  aware  of
vice  of pollution and its level of  consequenceS.  Keepingg
the  citizen informed is an obligation of the Government  as
well as the responsibility of society to adequately  educate
every component of it so that social level is kept up.
Disposing of the matter, the Court,
    HELD  The  principle  on which the praayer	is  made  is
accepted and the following directions are issued
    1.	That the Cenaral  Governmeent, the State  Government
and Union Tcrritories should invariably	 enforce as a condi-
tion  of  license of all cinema halls, touring	Cinemas	 and
video  parlours	 to  exhibit.  free of	cost  at  feast	 two
slidcs/messages	 on environment in each show  undertaken  by
them.  The Ministry of Environment should within two  months
from.  now come out with appropriate slide material on	var-
ious  aspect  of environment and  pollution.  This  material
should be circulated to the collectors who arc the licensing
authori	 ties for compliance without any further  directions
and failure to comply with the Court order should be treated
as  a ground for. cancellation of the licence by the  appro-
priate authorities. [382 A-C]
    2.	The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of	 the
Government  of India should without delay start	 pronouncing
information  films of short duration on various	 aspects  of
environment  and  pollution bringing out  the  benefits	 for
society on the environment protection and hazardous involved
in environment pollution. [382 D]
    3.	 The national network, the State Door  Darshan	Cen-
tres,  All India Radio, Television should take proper  steps
to  exhibit  such films and interesting	 programmes  on	 the
subject. There should be regular compliance of these  direc-
tions be followed from February 1, 1992. [382 G-H]
    4.	The principle that through the medium of educational
awareness  of  the environment and  its	 pollution  problems
should	be taught as a compulsory subject at every level  of
education.  University Grants Commission should prescribe  a
course	on  environment in a graded manner as  a  compulsory
subject	 in  college education. The compliance of  this	 re-
quirement be done in the next academic year. [383 A-C]
380
     Since  there  is a general	 acceptance  throughout	 the
world as also in our country that protection of	 environment
keeping	 free of pollution is an indispensable necessity  of
life to survive on earth so everyone must turn his immediate
attention  to  the proper care to sustain environment  in  a
decent way.



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">ORIGINAL  JURISDICTION:	 Writ Petition (Civil)	No.  860  of
1991.
</p><p id="p_2">(Under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India).
Petitioner in person
    G. Ramaswamy, Altar Ahmad, Anil Katiyar, A.M. Khanwilkar
and M.P. Sarawala for the Respondents.
</p><p id="p_3">The following Order of the Court was delivered:
</p><p id="p_4">    This  application  is in public interest  and  has	been
filed	by   a	practising advocate of this  Court  who	 has
consistently  been  taking interestin  matters	relating  to
environment and pollution. The reliefs claimed in
this  application under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_5">Article 32</a> of the  Constitution	 are
for  issuing  appropriate directions  to  cinema  exhibition
halls to exhibit slides containing information and  messages
on environment free of cost: directions for spread of infor-
mation relating to environment in national and regional
languages  and for broadcast thereof on the All India  Radio
and exposure thereof on the television in regular and  short
term programmes with a view to educating the people of India
about their social obligation in the matter of the upkeep of
up the environment in proper shape and making them alive  to
their  obligation not to act as polluting agencies  or	fac-
tors."	There  is also a prayer that environment  should  be
made a compulsory
subject	 in schools and colleges in a graded system so	that
there would be a general growth of awareness. We had  issued
notice to the Union of India on the petition and the Central
Government has immediately responded.
</p><p id="p_5">    Until  1972, general awareness of mankind to the  impor-
tance  of environment for the well-being of mankind had	 not
been  appropriately  appreciated though over the  years	 for
more  than  a century there was a growing  realisation	that
mankind	 had to live in tune with nature if life was  to  be
peaceful,  happy  and satisfied. In the name  of  scientific
development, man started distancing himself from Nature	 and
even developed an urge to conquer nature. Our ancestors	 had
known that nature was not subduable and, therefore. had made
it an obligation for man to surrender to nature and live  in
tune with it. Our Constitution underwent an amendment in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">381</span>
1976  by  incorporating an <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_6">article (51A)</a>  with	the  heading
"Fundamental  Duties".	Clause (g)  thereof  requires  every
citizen	 to  protect  and improve  the	natural	 environment
including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to	have
compassion for living creatures. Soon after the internation-
al conference on environment the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Pollution Control Act</a>
of 1974 came on the statute book; the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Air Pollution  Control
Act</a> came in 1981 and finally came the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment Protection
Act</a> of 1986.
</p><p id="p_6">    Law is a regulator of human conduct as the professors of
jurisprudence  say, but no law can indeed  effectively	work
unless	there is an element of acceptance by the  people  in
society. No law works out smoothly unless the interaction is
voluntary. In order that human conduct ,nay be m  accordance
with  the  prescription of law it is  necessary	 that  there
should be appropriate awareness about what the law  requires
and  there is an element of acceptance that the	 requirement
of  law is grounded upon a philosophy which should  be	fol-
lowed.	This would be possible only when steps are taken  in
an  adequate measure to make people aware of the  indispens-
able necessity of their conduct being oriented in accordance
with the requirements of law.
</p><p id="p_7">    There has been an explosion of human population over the
last 50 years. Life has become competitive. Sense of  ideal-
ism  in the living process has systematically eroded.  As  a
consequence of this the age old norms-of good living are  no
longer followed. The anxiety to do good to the
needy  or  for the society in general has  died	 out,  today
oblivious of the repercussions of one's actions on  society,
everyone  is prepared to do whatever is easy and  convenient
for his own purpose. In this backdrop if the laws are to  be
enforced and the malaise of pollution has to be kept
under control and the environment has to be protected in  an
unpolluted  state it is necessary that people are  aware  of
the vice of pollution and its evil consequences.
    We	are  in a democratic polity where  dissemination  of
information  is	 the foundation of the system.	Keeping	 the
citizens informed is an obligation of the Government. It  is
equally the responsibility of society to adequately  educate
every  component of it so that the social level is kept	 up.
We  therefore, accept on principle the prayers made  by	 the
petitioner.  We are happy to find that the learned  Attorney
General who appeare for the Union of India has also appreci-
ated the stand of the petitioner and has even cooperated  to
work out the procedure by which some of the prayers could be
granted.
</p><p id="p_8">We  dispose of this writ petition with the following  direc-
tions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">382</span>
    (1) Respondents 1, 2, &amp; 3 shall issue appropriate direc-
tions  to  the State Governments and  Union  Territories  to
invariably  enforce as a condition of license of all  cinema
hails, touring cinemas and video parlours to exhibit free of
cost atleast two slides/messages on environment in each show
undertaken  by	them. The Ministry of  Environmental  should
within	two months from now come out with appropriate  slide
material  which	 would be brief out  efficiently  carry	 the
message	 home on various aspects of environment	 and  pollu-
tion.  This  material should be circulated directly  to	 the
Collectors who are the licensing authorities for the  cinema
exhibition halls under the respective slate laws for compli-
ance  without any further direction and helping	 the  cinema
halls and video parlours to comply with the requirements  of
our order. Failure to comply with our order should be treat-
ed as a ground for cancellation of the licence by the appro-
priate	authorities. The material for the slides  should  be
such that it would
    at	once be impressive, striking and leave as impact  on
every one who sees the slide.
</p><p id="p_9">    (2) The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of	 the
Government  of	India should without delay  start  producing
information films of short duration as is being done now  on
various	 aspects of environment and pollution  bringing	 out
the benefits for society on the environment being  protected
and the hazards involved in the environment being  polluted.
Mind  catching aspects should be made the central  theme  of
such  short films. One such film should be shown, as far  as
practicable.  in one show every day by the cinema hails	 and
the Central Government and the State Government are directed
to  ensure  compliance of this condition  from	February  1,
1992.
</p><p id="p_10">    (3)	 Realising the importance of the matter of  environ-
ment and the necessity of protecting it in an unpolluted for
as  we had suggested to learned Attorney General to  have  a
dialogue  with the Ministry of Information and	Broadcasting
as  to	the manner the All India Radio and  Doordarshan	 can
assist	this process of education. We are happy to  indicate
that,  learned	Attorney General has told us  that  five  to
seven  minutes can be devoted every day and there could	 be,
once  a week, a longer programme. We do not want to  project
an impression that we are authorities on the subject, but we
would  suggest to the programme controlling  authorities  of
the Doordarshan and the All India Radio to take proper steps
to make interesting programmes and broadcast the same on the
radio  and exhibit the same on the television. The  national
network as also the State Doordarshan Centres should immedi-
ately  take steps to implement this direction so  that	from
February 1, 1992, regular compliance can be made.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">383</span>
<p id="p_11">    (4)	 We accept on principle that through the  medium  of
education  awareness  of the environment  and  its  problems
related	 to pollution should be taught as a compulsory	sub-
ject.  Learned Attorney General pointed out to us  that	 the
Central	 Government  is	 associated with  education  at	 the
higher	levels	and  the University  Grants  Commission	 can
monitor	 only the under graduate and post graduate  studies.
The rest of it, according to him, is a State subject. He has
agreed	that  the  University Grants  Commission  will	take
appropriate steps immediately to give effect to what we have
said, i.e., requiring the Universities to prescribe a course
on  environment.  They	would consider	the  feasibility  of
making	this a compulsory subject at every level in  college
education.  So for as education up to the college  level  is
concerned, we would require every State Government and every
Education Board connected with education up to the  matricu-
lation	or stage even intermediate colleges  to	 immediately
take steps to enforce compulsory education on environment in
a  graded way. this should be so done that in the next	aca-
demic year there would be compliance of this requirement.
    We	have not considered it necessary to hear  the  State
Governments and the other interested groups as by now  there
is a general acceptance through out the world as also in our
country	 that protection of environment and keeping it	free
of  pollution  is  an indispensable necessity  for  life  to
survive	 on earth. If that be the situation, every one	must
'turn his immediate attention to the proper care to  sustain
environment in a decent way.
</p><p id="p_12">    We	dispose of the matter with the	aforesaid  direction
but  give  liberty to Mr. Mehta to apply to the	 Court	from
time to time for further directions, if necessary.
