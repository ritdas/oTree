                      =====================
               Dated this the 5th day of February 2014

                             JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">                             -----------------
</p>
<p id="p_2">
       The petitioner who is conducting an engineering workshop

filed this writ petition on being aggrieved by Ext.P9 notice dated

15.01.2014. As per Ext.P1 the petitioner was informed that pursuant

to an enquiry conducted by the Senior Environmental Engineer

attached to the Kerala Pollution Control Board it was found that the

engineering workshop is being conducted without obtaining the

consent to operate and also without setting up the necessary

machineries for controlling pollution. In the said circumstances,

the petitioner was asked to suspend the functioning of the workshop

till he obtains the requisite consent to operate from the Pollution

Control Board. The petitioner was also cautioned with coercive

steps in case of his failure to comply with the said direction in tune

with the provisions under the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       I have heard the learned senior counsel appearing for the

petitioner, the learned standing counsel appearing for the 1st

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C.NO.3491 OF 2014                 2</span>

respondent and also the learned Government Pleader. The

petitioner did not have a case that he is in possession of a valid

consent to operate obtained from the Pollution Control Board. The

position that no workshop could function without obtaining such a

valid consent to operate cannot be disputed. In the said

circumstances, I do not find any reason to interfere with Ext.P9

notice as it was issued in tune with the statutory requirements. The

learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that

the petitioner has already approached the 1st respondent with an

application for grant of consent to operate and it is yet to be

considered. In the said circumstances, this writ petition is disposed

of with a direction to the 1st respondent to consider the application, if

any, submitted by the petitioner for getting consent to operate the

engineering workshop which is referred to Ext.P9 notice and pass

appropriate orders thereon expeditiously and in accordance with law

after conducting a proper inspection regarding the remedial steps

taken by the petitioner to rectify the defects. Needless to say that on

such inspection if any further defect is noted or rectification is found

inadequate the petitioner shall be given communication in that

regard. Such inspection for the aforesaid purposes shall be done

expeditiously, at any rate, within a period of three days from the date

of receipt of a copy of this judgment. After conducting such an

inspection order on the application submitted by the petitioner for

grant of consent to operate shall be taken up for consideration and

orders shall be passed thereon within a further period of ten days.

</p><p id="p_4">       This writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
