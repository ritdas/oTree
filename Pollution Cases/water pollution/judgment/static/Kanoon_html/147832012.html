     THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS

DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
                              :3:


                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This appeal is directed against the judgment and

order dated 31.07.2015 passed by the Additional Civil

Judge and II Additional JMFC, Ranebennur, whereby the

learned   Magistrate   has   acquitted   the   respondents   -

accused of the offences punishable under Sections 43 and

44 of Karnataka Water Pollution and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_1">Control Act</a>, 1974.


</p><p id="p_2">     2.     The case of the prosecution is that accused

No.1 is a company incorporated under Gwalior Company's

Act, within the meaning of Company under the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. Accused

No.2 is the Executive President, who managed the entire

affairs of the above units. Since 31.12.1989, the accused

have been discharging effluents into the river Tungabhadra

without consent, in violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_3">Section

25(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_4">Section 26</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. Further, by discharging

trade effluents in excess of tolerance limits, the accused

have violated <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_6">Section 25(4)</a> of the Act, rendering them
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             :4:</span>


liable for conviction under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_7">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_8">44</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.


</p><p id="p_3">     3.    Before the Trial Court, accused denied the

charges and claimed trial. The complainant examined the

Executive Engineer of Pollution Control Board as P.W.1 and

produced in evidence 27 documents. However, he did not

tender himself for cross-examination. In paragraph 15 of

the impugned judgment, the learned trial Judge has noted

that the evidence of P.W.1 cannot be looked into.


</p><p id="p_4">     4.    The prosecution has not examined any other

witness other than P.W.1, in proof of the allegations

levelled against the accused or in proof of the documents

produced by it. As the evidence of P.W.1 stands eschewed

from record, there is absolutely no material whatsoever to

substantiate the offences charged against the accused. If

for any reason, P.W.1 was not in a position to appear

before the Court for the purpose of cross-examination, the

complainant could have examined any other officials or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             :5:</span>


could have examined the authors of the documents sought

to be produced in evidence. The impugned judgment

reveals that the complainant did not even seek for an

opportunity to examine any other witness which indicates

total negligence and carelessness on the part of the

officers of the complainant in conducting the case. In the

absence of any evidence, the Courts are handicapped to

record any finding either in respect of the allegations made

against the accused or with regard to the documents relied

on by the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      5.    The complainant having failed to substantiate

the charges by producing any evidence, much less any

cogent evidence, the Trial Court was justified in acquitting

the accused. Though the learned counsel for the appellant

contends that the accused did not obtain the requisite

consent from 31.12.1989 onwards which itself is an

offence, yet in the absence of any material to this effect

and the said circumstance having not been put to the

accused in his examination under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C.,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             :6:</span>


solely on the basis of the oral submission of the learned

counsel, the impugned judgment cannot be reversed.


</p><p id="p_7">      6.     I do not find any merit in the contentions

urged in the memorandum of appeal. The appellant having

failed to adduce any evidence in support of the charges

levelled against the accused, the appeal is liable to be

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
      In view of the said order, I.A. No.1/2017 and I.A.

No.2/2017 do not survive for consideration and the same

are dismissed.
