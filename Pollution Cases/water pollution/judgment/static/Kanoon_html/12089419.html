<p id="p_1">                    Heard counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_2">                    The relief claimed in this petition is to issue writ against the
             respondent-Company to stop diversion work of Baghaiya Nala.
             According to the petitioner, the attempt of the respondent-Company
             is to divert the river stream at Baghaiya.
</p><p id="p_3">                    This factual assertion has been refuted by the respondent-
             Company on affidavit. In addition, the respondent has placed on
             record the permissions granted by statutory authorities under the
             provisions of Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Pollution Act</a>s respectively. Even the
             State Administration (Collector) has permitted the respondent to
             start the mining activities at the stated places. The argument of the
             petitioner is that no permission for diversion of the river stream is
             forthcoming. According to the respondent, there is no attempt of
             diversion of river stream at all. The Nala is formed on account of
             seasonal rains as is noticed from the scheme submitted by the
             respondent to the authorities.
</p><p id="p_4">                    Notably, petitioner has not impleaded the concerned State
             Authorities including the Pollution Control Board, who would be in
             a position to respond to the stand taken by the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_5">                    As a result, we are not inclined to entertain this petition. The
             petitioner is free to take recourse to the proceedings before
             National Green Tribunal, if so advised, in which all aspects can be
             considered after giving opportunity to the State Authorities and
             Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_6">                    Petition is disposed of.
</p><p id="p_7">                    Interim relief is vacated.
