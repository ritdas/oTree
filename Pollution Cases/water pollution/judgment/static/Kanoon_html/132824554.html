<p id="p_1">3   12-01-2018               Leave is granted to Mr. Alok Kumar Sinha, learned

                  counsel appearing for the petitioners to implead the Pollution

                  Control Board through the Member Secretary as respondent

                  no.13 to the present proceedings during the course of the day in

                  the Court pleadings as well as in the pleading of the respondents.

</p><p id="p_2">                             Let two copies of the brief be served on Mr. Shivendra

                  Kishore, learned senior counsel representing the Pollution

                  Control Board during the course of the day.

</p><p id="p_3">                             Heard the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                             A complaint by the respondent no.6 has led to the

                  order impugned, whereby the petitioners have been debarred

                  from operating their sale counters for sale of meat products.

</p><p id="p_5">                             The allegation against the petitioners is of causing

                  pollution and health hazard. It is in exercise of powers under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.3469 of 2017 (3) dt.12-01-2018                                  2</span>
<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">section 33A</a> of the Water Pollution (Prevention and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_2">Control)

              Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>') that the

              Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Aurangabad has proceeded to pass

              the order impugned directing the petitioners to close their sale

              counters.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                          It is not in dispute that all these petitioners are licensee

              under the Nagar Parishad, Aurangabad although their respective

              licence has not been renewed since after 2003. That is the

              default on their part and for which they are liable to seek

              renewal which exercise requires to be taken by these petitioners

              but that is not the issue raised.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                          It is on the complaint of the private individual as I

              have said that the exercise has been carried out and even though

              the provisions of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">section 33A</a> of the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a>' vests power in

              the Pollution Control Board to issue directions, the Sub-

              Divisional Magistrate in absolute abuse of powers has usurped

              the jurisdiction to issue direction even in absence of any order

              being passed by the Pollution Control Board. At least no such

              order has been discussed in the order impugned passed by the

              Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Aurangabad.

</p><p id="p_8">                          Let a counter affidavit be filed by the Sub-Divisional

              Magistrate, Aurangabad as to the source of power whether

</p><p id="p_9">                                  Issue notice to the respondent nos.6 to 12, for which

                      requisites etc. both under ordinary process as well as under

                      registered cover with A/D be filed within one week, failing

                      which this writ petition as against the concerned respondents

                      shall stand rejected without further reference to the Bench.

</p><p id="p_10">                                  Put up this matter after service of notice and/or

                      appearance of the private respondent nos.6 to 12 whichever is

                      earlier under the heading 'For Orders'.

                      order dated 18.11.2016 passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate,

                      Aurangabad in Miscellaneous Case No.1857 of 2016 impugned

                      at Annexure-4 shall remain stayed.
