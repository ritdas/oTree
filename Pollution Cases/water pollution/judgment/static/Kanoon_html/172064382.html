</p><p id="p_7">1.   The present case raises a fundamental issue with regard to

necessary   averments    to   invite    vicarious    liability   of   persons

concerned with the affairs of the company by virtue of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_1">Section 141</a>

of the Negotiable Instruments Act for commission of an offence

under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> thereof in relation to dishonouring of a cheque,

the primary liability for which falls on the drawer company.
</p>
<p id="p_8">2.   The petitioner has sought quashing of the proceedings arising



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -1-</span>
 out of Complaint Case No.1718/1/03 filed by the respondent for

commission of such offences, on the ground that there is no

averment in the complaint as to how or in what manner the

petitioner was responsible for the conduct of the business of the

company or otherwise responsible in regard to its functioning. It is

submitted that the petitioner has not issued any cheque and the

averments in the complaint taken in their entirety do not disclose

commission of any offence under the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>,

1881 by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.   The respondent filed a complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">Sections 138</a> to <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_5">142</a> of

the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, read with <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_6">Section 420</a> of the

Indian   Penal   Code     against   the   Digitech   Solutions   Limited;

<p id="p_10">Shri Anoop Sareen; Shri Rajiv Goel and Shri Nitin Mishra-its directors

and one Darshan-its accountant on the allegations that they

approached and transacted with the respondent-complainant for the

purchase of computer software items and that in partial discharge

of liability, issued four cheques being Cheque nos.705515, 705516,

705517 &amp; 705518 which were dishonoured on presentation due to

insufficiency of funds in the bank account of the company.

 placed on several pronouncements of the Apex Court reported at

2005 SCC (Crl.) 1975 SMS Pharmaceutical Limited Vs. Neeta

Bhalla &amp; Anr.; (2007) 3 SCC 693 Saroj Kumar Poddar Vs.

</p>
<p id="p_13">5.   On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent has

vehemently opposed the submissions made by the petitioner. It is

contended that the complaint was filed in the year 2003 and the

petitioner has waited to raise this challenge in the year 2007. It is

urged that the matter is at the stage of evidence and no

interference is called for at this stage. It is further urged that the

respondent-complainant has placed reliance not on <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_7">Section 138</a>

alone but the complaint contains substantive allegations inviting the

applicability of <a href="/doc/38262/" id="a_8">Section 141(2)</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act,

1881. The submission is that the pronouncements relied upon by

the petitioner do not deal with the necessary averments and

ingredients laid down under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_9">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable

Instruments Act, 1881. Learned counsel has urged at length that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 -3-</span>
 the expression "consent", "connivance" and "neglect" as appear in

<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_10">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, have not been

explained by the legislature and have to derive their meaning from

the meaning given to them in common parlance. My attention is

drawn to the meaning of this expression given           in the Legal

Glossary issued by the Government. In support of this contention,

reliance is placed on the pronouncements of the Apex Court

reported at 2007 (4) JCC (NI) 364 Ramji Lal Vs. Amit Ved &amp;

2007 (4) JCC 3083 Krishana Dwivedi Vs. Surender Kumar. It

</p>
<p id="p_22">9.   The exposition of law by the Supreme Court in 2005 SCC

(Crl.) 1975 SMS Pharmaceutical Limited Vs. Neeta Bhalla &amp;

Anr. sets out the applicable principles succinctly and can be

usefully adverted to. They read as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">          "4.     In the present case, we are concerned with
          criminal liability on account of dishonour of cheque. It
          primarily falls on the drawer company and is
          extended to officers of the Company. The normal rule
          in the cases involving criminal liability is against
          vicarious liability, that is, no one is to be held
          criminally liable for an act of another. This normal
          rule is, however, subject to exception on account of
          specific provision being made in statutes extending
          liability to others. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_16">Section 141</a> of the Act is an
          instance of specific provision which in case an
          offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_17">Section 138</a> is committed by a
          Company, extends criminal liability for dishonour of
          cheque to officers of the Company. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_18">Section 141</a>
          contains conditions which have to be satisfied before
          the liability can be extended to officers of a
          company. Since the provision creates criminal
          liability, the conditions have to be strictly complied
          with. The conditions are intended to ensure that a
          person who is sought to be made vicariously liable
          for an offence of which the principal accused is the
          Company, had a role to play in relation to the
          incriminating act and further that such a person
          should know what is attributed to him to make him


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 -9-</span>
 liable. In other words, persons who had nothing to do
with the matter need not be roped in. A company
being a juristic person, all its deeds and functions are
result of acts of others. Therefore, officers of a
Company who are responsible for acts done in the
name of the Company are sought to be made
personally liable for acts which result in criminal
action being taken against the Company. It makes
every person who. at the time the offence was
committed, was incharge of and was responsible to
the Company for the conduct of business of the
Company, the Company, liable for the offence. The
proviso to the sub-section contains an escape route
for persons who are able to prove that the offence
was committed without their knowledge or that they
had exercised all due diligence to prevent
commission of the offence.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">10. While analysing <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_19">Section 141</a> of the Act, it will be
seen that it operates in cases where an offence
under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_20">Section 138</a> is committed by a company. The
key words which occur in the Section are "every
person". These are general words and take every
person connected with a company within their
sweep. Therefore, these words have been rightly
qualified by use of the words " who, at the time the
offence was committed, was in charge of and was
responsible to the company for the conduct of the
business of the company, as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence etc."
</blockquote><p id="p_23">What is required is that the persons who are sought
to be made criminally liable under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_21">Section 141</a>
should be at the time the offence was committed, in
charge of and responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company. Every
person connected with the company shall not fall
within the ambit of the provision. It is only those
persons who were in charge of and responsible for
conduct of business of the company at the time of

</p><p id="p_24">                       - 10 -
</p><p id="p_25"> commission of an offence, who will be liable for
criminal action. It follows from this that if a director
of a Company who was not in charge of and was not
responsible for the conduct of the business of the
company at the relevant time, will not be liable under
the provision. The liability arises from being in
charge of and responsible for conduct of business of
the company at the relevant time when the offence
was committed and not on the basis of merely
holding a designation or office in a company.
Conversely, a person not holding any office or
designation in a Company may be liable if he
satisfies the main requirement of being in charge of
and responsible for conduct of business of a
Company at the relevant time. Liability depends on
the role one plays in the affairs of a Company and
not on designation or status. If being a Director or
Manager or Secretary was enough to cast criminal
liability, the Section would have said so. Instead of
"every person" the section would have said "every
Director, Manager or Secretary in a Company is
liable"....etc. The legislature is aware that it is a case
of     criminal    liability  which    means       serious
consequences so far as the person sought to be
made liable is concerned. Therefore, only persons
who can be said to be connected with the
commission of a crime at the relevant time have
been subjected to action.

<p id="p_26">18. To sum up, there is almost unanimous judicial
opinion that necessary averments ought to be
contained in a complaint before a persons can be
subjected to criminal process. A liability under
<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_22">Section 141</a> of the Act is sought to be fastened
vicariously on a person connected with a Company,
the principal accused being the company itself. It is a
departure from the rule in criminal law against
vicarious liability. A clear case should be spelt out in
the complaint against the person sought to be made
liable. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_23">Section 141</a> of the Act contains the
requirements for making a person liable under the
said provision. That respondent tallies within

</p><p id="p_27">                        - 11 -
</p><p id="p_28"> parameters of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_24">Section 141</a> has to be spelled out. A
complaint has to be examined by the Magistrate in
the first instance on the basis of averments
contained therein. If the Magistrate is satisfied that
there are averments which bring the case within
<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_25">Section 141</a> he would issue the process. We have
seen that merely being described as a director in a
company is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement
of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_26">Section 141</a>. Even a non director can be liable
under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_27">Section 141</a> of the Act. The averments in the
complaint would also serve the purpose that the
person sought to be made liable would know what is
the case which is alleged against him. This will
enable him to meet the case at the trial.
</p><p id="p_29">19. In view of the above discussion, our answers to
the questions posed in the Reference are as under:
</p><p id="p_30">(a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint
under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_28">Section 141</a> that at the time the offence was
committed, the person accused was in charge of, and
responsible for the conduct of business of the
company. This averment is an essential requirement
of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_29">Section 141</a> and has to be made in a complaint.
Without this averment being made in a complaint,
the requirements of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_30">Section 141</a> cannot be said to be
satisfied.
</p><p id="p_31">(b) The answer to question posed in sub-para (b) has
to be in negative. Merely being a director of a
company is not sufficient to make the person liable
under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_31">Section 141</a> of the Act. A director in a company
cannot be deemed to be in charge of and responsible
to the company for conduct of its business. The
requirement of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_32">Section 141</a> is that the person sought
to be made liable should be in charge of and
responsible for the conduct of the business of the
company at the relevant time. This has to be averred
as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a director
in such cases.
</p><p id="p_32">(c) The answer to question (c ) has to be in
affirmative. The question notes that the Managing
Director or Joint Managing Director would be
admittedly in charge of the company and responsible

</p><p id="p_33">                      - 12 -
</p><p id="p_34">           to the company for conduct of its business. When
          that is so, holders of such positions in a company
          become liable under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_33">Section 141</a> of the Act. By virtue
          of the office they hold as Managing Director or Joint
          Managing Director, these persons are in charge of
          and responsible for the conduct of business of the
          company. Therefore, they get covered under Section
</p><p id="p_35">          141. So far as signatory of a cheque which is
          dishonoured is concerned, he is clearly responsible
          for the incriminating act and will be covered under
          Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_34">Section 141</a>."

              cheque dated 23.6.2001 for Rs. 1,24,406/-
              on the account maintained by the company.
              On presentation of the said cheque to the

demonstrates that the statutory requirements
contained in <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_36">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable

be true that it is not necessary for the complainant

opinion that the accused are vicariously liable.
</blockquote><p id="p_37"><a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_37">Section 141</a> raises a legal fiction. By reason of the
said provision, a person although is not personally
liable for commission of such an offence would be
vicariously liable therefore. Such vicarious liability
can be inferred so far as a company registered or
incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_38">Companies Act</a>, 1956 is
concerned only if the requisite statements, which
are required to be averred in the complaint petition,
are made so as to make the accused therein
vicariously liable for the offence committed by the
company. Before a person can be made vicariously
liable,   strict   compliance    of    the    statutory
requirements would be insisted. Not only the
averments made in paragraph 7 of the complaint
petitions does not meet the said statutory
requirements, the sworn statement of the witness
made by the son of Respondent herein, does not
contain any statement that Appellants were in
charge of the business of the company. In a case
where the court is required to issue summons which
would put the accused to some sort of harassment,
the court should insist on strict compliance of the
statutory requirements. In terms of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_39">Section 200</a> of
the Code of Criminal procedure, the complainant is
bound to make statements on oath as to how the
offence has been committed and how the accused

ultimately, the prosecution is found to be frivolous or
otherwise mala fide, the court may direct
registration of case against the complainant for mala

reiterated the principle laid down in Saroj Kumar

complainant to state how a Director who is sought to
be made an accused, was in charge of the business of
the company, as every director need not be and is not
in charge of the business of the company. If that is the
position in regard to a director, it is needless to
emphasise that in the case of non-director officers,
there is all the more the need to state what his part is
with regard to conduct of business of the company and
how and in what manner he is liable.

virtue of a legal fiction. Penal statutes are to be
construed      strictly.   Penal      statutes   providing
constructive vicarious liability should be construed
much more strictly. When conditions are prescribed for
extending such constructive criminal liability to others,
courts will insist upon strict literal compliance. There is
no question of inferential or implied compliance.
Therefore, a specific averment complying with the
requirements of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_64">Section 141</a> is imperative. As pointed
out in <a href="/doc/141294/" id="a_65">K. Srikanth Singh v. North East Securities Ltd</a>.
2007 (12) SCC 788, the mere fact that at some point of

on account of any legal fiction but on account of the
specific part played - consent and connivance or
negligence. If a person is to be made liable under Sub-

company" occurs not only in <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_69">Section 141(1)</a> of the Act
but in several enactments dealing with offences by
companies, to mention a few - <a href="/doc/1417100/" id="a_70">Section 278B</a> of the
Income Tax Act, 1961, <a href="/doc/1893901/" id="a_71">Section 22C</a> of Minimum Wages
Act, 1948, <a href="/doc/259762/" id="a_72">Section 86A</a> of the Employees State
Insurance Act, 1948, <a href="/doc/7754/" id="a_73">Section 14A</a> of Employees
Provident Fund and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_74">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>,
1952, <a href="/doc/183371/" id="a_75">Section 29</a> of Payment of Bonus Act, 1965,
<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_76">Section 40</a> of The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_77">Control of

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_79">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. But
neither <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_80">Section 141(1)</a> of the Act, nor the pari materia
provisions in other enactments give any indication as
to who are the persons responsible to the company, for
the conduct of the business of the company. Therefore,
we will have to fall back upon the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_81">Companies Act</a>, 1956 which is the law relating to and
regulating companies. <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_82">Section 291</a> of the said Act
provides that subject to the provisions of that Act, the
Board of Directors of a company shall be entitled to
exercise all such powers, and to do all such acts and
things, as the company is authorised to exercise and
do. A company though a legal entity can act only
through its Board of Directors. The settled position is
that a Managing Director is prima facie in charge of
and responsible for the company's business and affairs
and can be prosecuted for offences by the company.
</p>
<p id="p_62">                      - 21 -
</p><p id="p_63"> But insofar as other directors are concerned, they can
be prosecuted only if they were in charge of and
responsible for the conduct of the company's business.
A combined reading of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_83">Sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1202543/" id="a_84">291</a> of
Companies Act, 1956 with the definitions in clauses
(24), (26), (30), (31), (45) of <a href="/doc/328668/" id="a_85">Section 2</a> of that Act
would show that the following persons are considered
to be the persons who are responsible to the company
for the conduct of the business of the company :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">     (a) the managing director/s;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">     (b) the whole-time director/s;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">     (c) the manager;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">     (d) the secretary;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">     (e)    any person in accordance with whose
           directions or instructions the Board of
           directors of the company is accustomed to
           act;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">     (f) any person charged by the Board with the
         responsibility of complying with that provision
         (and who has given his consent in that behalf
         to the   Board); and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">     (g) where any company does not have any of the
         officers specified in clauses (a) to (c), any
         director or directors who may be specified by
         the Board in this behalf or where no director is
         so specified, all the directors.
</blockquote><p id="p_64">It follows that other employees of the company, cannot
be said to be persons who are responsible to the
company, for the conduct of the business of the
company.
</p><p id="p_65">15. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_86">Section 141</a> uses the words "was in charge of, and
was responsible to the company for the conduct of the
business of the company". It is evident that a person
who can be made vicariously liable under Sub-section
(1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_87">Section 141</a> is a person who is responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the
company and in addition is also in charge of the
business of the company. There may be many
directors and secretaries who are not in charge of the

</p><p id="p_66">                          - 22 -
</p><p id="p_67"> business of the company at all. The meaning of the
words "person in charge of the business of the
company" was considered by this Court in <a href="/doc/64654035/" id="a_88">Girdhari Lal
Gupta     v.   D.N.    Mehta</a>    MANU/SC/0487/1971     :
</p><p id="p_68">[1971]3SCR748 followed in <a href="/doc/443284/" id="a_89">State of Karnataka v.
Pratap Chand</a> MANU/SC/0237/1981 : 1981CriLJ595 and
Katta Sujatha v. Fertiliser &amp; Chemicals Travancore Ltd.
MANU/SC/0897/2002 : (2002)7SCC655 . This Court held
that the words refer to a person who is in overall
control of the day to day business of the company. This
Court pointed out that a person may be a director and
thus belongs to the group of persons making the policy
followed by the company, but yet may not be in charge
of the business of the company; that a person may be
a Manager who is in charge of the business but may
not be in overall charge of the business; and that a
person may be an officer who may be in charge of only
some part of the business.
</p><p id="p_69">16. Therefore, if a person does not meet the first
requirement, that is being a person who is responsible
to the company for the conduct of the business of the
company, neither the question of his meeting the
second requirement (being a person in charge of the
business of the company), nor the question of such
person being liable under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_90">Section
141</a> does not arise. To put it differently, to be
vicariously liable under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_91">Section 141</a>,
a person should fulfill the 'legal requirement' of being a
person in law (under the statute governing companies)
responsible to the company for the conduct of the
business of the company and also fulfill the 'factual
requirement' of being a person in charge of the
business of the company.
</p><p id="p_70">17. Therefore, the averment in a complaint that an
accused is a director and that he is in charge of and is
responsible to the company for the conduct of the
business of the company, duly affirmed in the sworn
statement, may be sufficient for the purpose of issuing
summons to him. But if the accused is not one of the
persons who falls under the category of 'persons who
are responsible to the company for the conduct of the
business of the company' (listed in para 14 above),

</p><p id="p_71">                       - 23 -
</p><p id="p_72"> then merely by stating that 'he was in charge of the
business of the company' or by stating that 'he was in
charge of the day to day management of the company'
or by stating that he was in charge of, and was
responsible to the company for the conduct of the
business of the company', he cannot be made
vicariously liable under <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_92">Section 141(1)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_73">18. It should, however, be kept in view that even an
officer who was not in charge of and was responsible
to the company for the conduct of the business of the
company can be made liable under Sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_93">Section 141</a>. For making a person liable under <a href="/doc/38262/" id="a_94">Section
141(2)</a>, the mechanical repetition of the requirements
under <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_95">Section 141(1)</a> will be of no assistance, but there
should be necessary averments in the complaint as to
how and in what manner the accused was guilty of
consent and connivance or negligence and therefore,
responsible under Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_96">Section 141</a> of the
Act.
</p><p id="p_74">19. Another aspect that requires to be noticed is that
only a Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer can
be made liable under Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_97">Section 141</a>.
But under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_98">Section 141</a>, it is
theoretically possible to make even a person who is
not a director or officer, liable, as for example, a
person falling under category (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_99">Section 5</a> of
Companies Act, 1956. When in SMS Pharma (I), this
Court observed that 'conversely, a person not holding
any office or designation in a company may be liable if
he satisfies the requirement of being in charge of and
responsible for conduct of the business of the
company', this Court obviously had in mind, persons
described in clauses (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_100">Section 5</a> of
Companies Act. Be that as it may.
</p><p id="p_75">20. The position under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_101">Section 141</a> of the Act can be
summarized thus :
</p><pre id="pre_4">(i)       xxx              xxx           xxx


(ii)      xxx              xxx           xxx

          defined in <a href="/doc/1602854/" id="a_102">Section 2(24)</a> of the Companies Act) or a
          person referred to in clauses (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_103">Section 5</a> of
          Companies Act, an averment in the complaint that he
          was in charge of, and was responsible to the company,
          for the conduct of the business of the company is
          necessary to bring the case under <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_104">Section 141(1)</a>. No
          further averment would be necessary in the complaint,
          though some particulars will be desirable. They can
          also be made liable under <a href="/doc/38262/" id="a_105">Section 141(2)</a> by making
          necessary averments relating to consent and
          connivance or negligence, in the complaint, to bring
          the matter under that Sub-section.
</p><p id="p_77">          (iv) Other Officers of a company can not be made
          liable under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_106">Section 141</a>. Other
          officers of a company can be made liable only under
          Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_107">Section 141</a>, be averring in the
          complaint their position and duties in the company and
          their role in regard to the issue and dishonour of the

</p><p id="p_79">16. So     far   as   the   expressions    "neglect",   "consent"   and

"connivance" are concerned, the same have been described in the

legal glossary of the Government of India thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">         "Neglect: to disregard; to pay little or no attention

         failure to prevent or oppose it"
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">     These meanings would guide the consideration of the acts and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_45">                                  - 25 -
</blockquote><p id="p_80"> omissions attributed to the petitioner under sub-section 2 of Section

141 of the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_81">17. Before this court, the respondent has not only described the

petitioner as a director of the company but the complaint makes a

specific allegation that the petitioner along with the other accused

persons approached and transacted with the complainant for the

purchase of software items; the accused persons (which included

the petitioner arrayed as accused person no.4 in the complaint)

issued cheques to the complainant; that the accused persons never

had any intention of making payment to the complainant for the

purchase of the software; the accused nos.2 to 5 (including the

present petitioner) have fraudulently induced the complainant to

supply software without the intention of making payment, thereby

leading to financial loss to the complainant; the legal notice dated

17th August, 2003 was sent on 18th August, 2003 on behalf of the

complainant to all the accused persons which asked them to make

payment of the amount of cheque.         Despite receipt of the legal

notice, the accused persons (including the petitioner), have not

made any payment towards the amount of the cheques to the

complainant within fifteen days from the receipt of the legal notice

and consequently have committed the offence of dishonour of



</p><p id="p_82">                                - 26 -
</p><p id="p_83"> cheques under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_108">Section 138</a>/<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_109">141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act,

1881. It has been specifically averred in para 6 of the complaint

that the petitioner as well as the other accused are principal officers

of the accused company and are responsible for the conduct of its

business.   It is urged that the accused persons have with the

consent and connivance of one another, committed the said

offences. In para 6 noticed hereinabove, the respondent has made

a specific averment that accused nos.2 to 5 have actively

participated in the transaction with the complainant in their

capacity as principal officers of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_84">     So far as the cause of action for filing the complaint is

concerned, in para 7 of the complaint, the complainant has stated

that the cause of action arose when the cheques were dishonoured

and on the failure to make the payment to the complainant within

the stipulated period of 15 days from the receipt of the legal notice

by the accused person.
</p>
<p id="p_85">18. From the above it appears that the respondent-complainant

has not merely reproduced the words of the statute merely but has

actually attributed certain acts of commission and omission against

the petitioner.   Apart from the averment that the petitioner is a

director, it has been specifically averred that the petitioner



</p><p id="p_86">                                 - 27 -
</p><p id="p_87"> negotiated and participated in the dealings and transactions with

the complainant.      It has also been contended that despite the

service of the legal notice upon the petitioner, the petitioner has

failed to make payment of the same. In addition to the above, it

has been urged that the offence alleged by the company has been

committed with the consent and connivance of the accused nos.2 to

5 with one another.     No reply was even sent by the petitioner to

the legal notice.
</p>
<p id="p_88">19. It needs no elaboration that while testing the maintainability of

a complaint on the ground that it fails to disclose any commission of

offence or the order of summoning by the trial court, it is trite that

the complaint has to be examined and the averments made therein

have to be taken as true at their face value.
</p>
<p id="p_89">20. The pleas taken up by the petitioner are undoubtedly in the

nature of defence which could be urged before the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_90">However on a consideration of the allegations made in the

complaint taken at the face value as noted hereinabove, the

complaint filed by the petitioner is one in which the necessary

averments attracting the applicability of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_110">section 138</a> and <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_111">141</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act are made out.
</p>
<p id="p_91">     The present case challenges a summoning order. In view of



</p><p id="p_92">                                 - 28 -
</p><p id="p_93"> the principles laid down in para 17 of <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_112">K.K. Ahuja Vs. V.K. Vora &amp;

Anr</a>. (supra), the challenge in the instant case is misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_94">21. Yet another submission urged on behalf of the petitioner

deserves to be considered. It is contended that the respondent has

arrived at a settlement and in this behalf on 7th October, 2005, an

amount of Rs.1 lakh has been received before the trial court by way

of a demand draft. Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant

has explained that a settlement was being explored with Sh. Anoop

Sareen and Shri Rajeev Goel who were arrayed as accused person

nos. 2 and 3.   No settlement was ever contemplated or negotiated

with the present petitioner.     No payment has been made or

received from the petitioner. No details of any settlement have also

been placed on record. In this background, settlement, if any, with

any of the other accused persons would not assist the petitioner in

any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_95">22. So far as a settlement is concerned, the legal principles which

govern the same have been succinctly stated by this court in the

pronouncement reported at 106 (2003) DLT 708 <a href="/doc/771950/" id="a_113">Jindal Aromatic

vs. South Spices Exports Pvt. Ltd</a>. in the following terms :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">       "23. The legal position which emerges from the
       aforesaid judgment is that an accord discharges the
       performance of obligations under the contract. A
       dispute pertaining to satisfaction furnishes a fresh


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">                                - 29 -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">        and independent cause of action, until and unless it is
       provided that the performance of the satisfaction was
       a condition precedent for discharge under the
       contract. If promise is received in satisfaction, it is a
       good satisfaction, but if the performance and not the
       promise is intended to operate in satisfaction, then
       there will be no satisfaction without performance.
       Wherever there is an accord, obligations under the
       original contract would be discharged until and
       unless it is specifically provided that the performance
       of the satisfaction would discharge the obligations
       under the contract."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_96">23. The plea of a petitioner that the respondent-complainant had

arrived at a settlement and received payment of amounts as well

pursuant thereto meriting quashing of the criminal complaint

therefore is contrary to the well settled principle on this issue.
</p>
<p id="p_97">Apart from the fact that whether an accord having been arrived at

between the parties would amount to discharge of performance of

obligations under the contract between them and whether the same

could discharge the criminal liability for commission of an offence

under the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_114">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> is a separate issue.          The

question which requires to be considered is as to whether there was

any settlement of the original cause based whereon the complaint

was filed. In the instant case, there is nothing on record to show

that the parties had arrived at any settlement or the terms of

accord if any, between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_98">     From the above, it is also evident that a mere plea of a


</p><p id="p_99">                                - 30 -
</p><p id="p_100"> settlement would not ipso facto lead to a conclusion that the

original cause is therefore brought to an end.    The accord or the

terms of the settlement have to be placed and examined.           The

intent of the parties is required to be determined from a scrutiny

thereof. It has to be ascertained as to whether the parties intended

the accord by itself to bring the disputes to an end or the

satisfaction of the terms thereof which would do so.
</p>
<p id="p_101">24. In the instant case no accord or terms or conditions of any

settlement have been placed on record. There is nothing on record

to show discharge of even the civil liability by any accord or terms

or conditions thereof. In this background, the submission that there

was a settlement which could defeat the maintainability of the

criminal proceedings is factually baseless and devoid of legal merit.
</p>
<p id="p_102">25. In support of the plea that the present petition is highly

belated, learned counsel for the respondent has drawn my attention

to the pronouncement of this court reported at 2007 (4) JCC (NI)

364 Ramji Lal vs. Anant Yadav (since expired) in this case, the

court had refused to exercise inherent powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_115">section 482</a> of

the CrPC for quashing of a complaint case which was pending for

trial for more than five years holding that the petition for quashing

was an abuse of the process of law which was dismissed with costs.
</p>
<p id="p_103">                                 - 31 -
</p><p id="p_104"> 26. Again in 2007 (4) JCC 3083 <a href="/doc/129176/" id="a_116">Krishna Dvivedi vs. Sunder

Kr</a>., this court held that the plea taken in the petition for quashing

of the criminal complaint was really in the nature of the defence of

the petitioner which he could take during the trial and that this

court was not the forum to conduct the trial between the parties. It

was also observed that the order of summoning was passed more

than two years before the challenge thereto and that there was no

explanation for the delay.     In these circumstances, again the

petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_117">section 482</a> of the CrPC seeking quashing of the

prosecution was allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_105">27. Before this court, the matter has been pending before the trial

court since 2003 and a challenge has been laid to the proceedings

only in 2007. There is no explanation at all for the delay which has

ensued.
</p>
<p id="p_106">28. The last submission on behalf of the petitioner was that he has

been wrongly described as Nitin Meshram in the complaint whereas

his correct name is Nitin Mishra.        So far as this submission is

concerned, it is noteworthy that in addition to the name, the

complaint has indicated that the petitioner arrayed as respondent

no.5 was the director of the firm.         The petitioner has rightly

understood that the reference was to him and has made no



</p><p id="p_107">                                - 32 -
</p><p id="p_108"> objection after he was summoned to stand trial in the case. The

petitioner accepted the summons as described in the complaint and

applied for bail. No dispute as to identity has been raised at any

time before the trial court where the complaint has remained

pending since 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_109">29. In view of the above discussion, it is held that in the instant

case, the complaint does not deserve to be rejected at the outset

and the complainant is required to be given an opportunity to

establish its case.
</p>
<p id="p_110">     For all these reasons this petition is dismissed with costs which

are quantified at Rs.20,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_111">30. It is made clear that nothing herein contained is an expression

of opinion on the merits of the allegations in the complaint.
