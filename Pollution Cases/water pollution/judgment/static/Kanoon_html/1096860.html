<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 The industry was revisited by the officer of the PPCB on

           12.12.2008 for the monitoring noise levels and the noise

           monitoring reveals that the noise level recorded at the main

           gate of the industry at 4 PM, the noise level when industry was

           in operation was 67.6 db(A) Leq. Against the permissible limit

           of 55 db(A) Leq. (for residential area) and when not in

           operation noise recorded was 51.5 db(A) leq.          The noise

           contribution generated by the industry was found to be 16.1 db

           (A) Leq. And as per the 'Noise Pollution (Regulation &amp;

           Control) Rules, 2000' the complaint is considered to be valid

           for action under said rules if the contribution of noise level is

           more than 10 db(A) Leq. from the permissible limit of 55 db(A)

           Leq. In this case the noise level is much more than 55 db(a)

           Leq. and contribution of noise level is also more than 10 db(A)

           Leq. so it is established that the industry is generating noise

           pollution from the operation of the industry.</blockquote><p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">                 It is further added that the industry has been established

           without the consent to Establish (NOC) of the Board. The

           industry has also not obtained the consent to operate under

           Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a> and is operating its unit in violation of the

           provisions of the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>. As per the policy of the
 CWP No.18915 of 2008                                                 [4]

            Board      no   unit   can   be   established   within     Municipal

            Corporation/Council limit in residential zone and the said

            industry has been established within Municipal limit in

            residential zone. PSEB has released the electric connection to

            the industry without obtaining any clarification from Punjab

            Pollution Control Board, which has lead to the cause of public

            complaint in the area. The PSEB be also restrained to release

            electric connection to the industries who have not obtained the

            NOC of the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The release of

            electric connection to the industries in residential zone by the

            PSEB is causing an haphazard development of industries and

            ultimately giving rise in the pollution levels in the residential

            zone. The action against the industry under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a> 1981 and

            <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> 1974 is under active consideration of the Board."

            It is admitted case of the parties that petitioner has not replied

to the show cause notice issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The

present writ petition is disposed of with a direction that petitioner may reply

to the show cause notice issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board and

the Punjab Pollution Control Board shall finalize the proceedings within

one month from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
