<p id="p_1">(Order delivered by the Bench)

     This application is brought-forth by the appellant in Appeal No. 7 of 2012 (SZ)
seeking condonation of delay of 84 days in preferring this appeal No. 7 of 2012 (SZ)
whereby the applicant has sought for the quashing the order of the 1st respondent
made on 30th July 2012 confirming an order of the 3rd respondent passed in Appeal
No. 95 of 2012 dated 16.07.2012. The Tribunal heard the learned counsel for the
applicant and also for the respondent Nos. 2 and 3.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2)      Since this is an application seeking condonation of delay, it is not
necessary to place the facts of the case except stating that the applicant was running
a stone crushing unit and the 3rd respondent made an order dated 16.7.2010 for the
closure of the unit. The applicant challenged the same before the Appellate Authority,
Tamil Nadu Pollution Control under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water Act</a> and the said
appeal was rejected on 30.7.2012. Aggrieved over the same, the applicant filed a writ
petition before the High Court of Madras and the same was returned on different
dates and finally on 4.10.2012 and under the said circumstances, he has preferred
this appeal wherein a delay of 84 days had occasioned. Seeking condonation of the
delay, this application is filed. The only question which would arise for consideration
is whether this delay of 84 days needs to be condoned. Admittedly, the order of the
Appellate Authority under challenge came to be passed on 30.7.2012. The said order
was received by the applicant on 10.08.2012 and hence the appeal should have
been preferred within 30 days from the date of receipt of the order, i.e., on or before
09.09.2012. In the instant case, the appeal has been filed only on 17.11.2012 and
there was a delay of 84 days in preferring the instant appeal.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      Page 2 of 4</span>
<p id="p_3">      3)   It is contended by the learned counsel for the applicant that after passing of
the order by the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control on 30.07.2012 and
received by the applicant on 10.8.2012, the applicant filed a writ petition before the
High Court of Madras on 07.09.2012 and the said writ petition was returned on
10.8.2012 for the first time and finally on 4.10.2012 on the last representation. Thus
the applicant has exercised his diligence and care in preferring the writ petition for
quashing the order under challenge and thus he can avail the benefit of <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_2">Section 14</a> of
the Limitation Act since he has initiated proceedings before another forum on the
bonafide belief. The learned counsel has relied on the Apex Court judgment in
(2008) 7 SCC page No. 169, (Consolidated Engineering Enterprises Vs.
Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and others) and he appeals that the
delay has got to be condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4)   The learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 would submit that the
application has to be dismissed since the delay is not only on the higher side but also
inordinate.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     5)   After hearing the contentions putforth by either side, the Tribunal is of the
considered opinion that the application has to be allowed. As could to be seen from
the available materials, the copy of the order made by the first respondent dated
30.7.2012 was received by the applicant only on 10.8.2012. The applicant should
have preferred the appeal within 30 days, the period available to prefer an appeal
under the provisions of NGT Act. But he has not done so. In the instant case, it is
also noticed that the appeal was not preferred even within 60 days period in which
case the delay could be condoned by the Tribunal, if sufficient causes are brought to
the notice of the Tribunal. But the appeal is preferred only on 17.11.2012. Thus there
was a delay of 84 days beyond the said period of 90 days.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     6)       The Tribunal is able to notice the following circumstance which stands in
favour of the applicant. After the receipt of the order under challenge on 10.8.2012,
the applicant has preferred a writ petition to quash the order before the High Court of
Madras on 7.9.2012. As seen from the order of return, the last return of writ petition
was made on 4.10.2012 by the High Court of Madras. It is quite evident that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        Page 3 of 4</span>
 applicant instead of preferring an appeal before the Tribunal, has chosen another
forum and filed writ petition and thus it is a case where the applicant can have the
benefit of <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_3">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act. Apart from the same, the judgment of the
Apex Court made in (2008) 7 SCC page No. 169, (Consolidated Engineering
Enterprises Vs. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and others) and relied
on by the applicant stands to the benefit of the applicant. From the reading of the
judgment, it can be seen that the said period which was taken by the party in
preferring the proceedings in another forum but with bona fide belief is not extended
by the court, but it has only excluded the period of limitation and thus in view of the
above and that too in a matter connected to and concerned with environment, the
opportunity of being heard is given to the applicant and the said delay has got to be
condoned with costs. A cost of Rs.2,500/- is to be remitted by the applicant to the Bar
Association of National Green Tribunal, Southern Zone, Chennai on or before
04.03.2013. The matter is posted to 06.03.2013.
