     of Rajasthan, Bench at Jaipur with the prayer to direct closure of

     brick kiln activities in Bundi District and in areas adjacent to Bundi

     city in the State of Rajasthan. In pursuance to the order dated 23rd

     consonance with the order dated 9th August, 2012 of the Hon'ble

     Supreme Court passed in Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog

      Sangathan and Others Vs. Union of India &amp; Others (2012) 8 SCC

     326, the above said writ petition was transferred to the Central Zone

     Bench, Bhopal of National Green Tribunal. Upon its transfer, the

     writ petition was registered as OA No. 114/2013 and notices were

     issued to all the parties vide order dated 5th December, 2013. Later

     on, the case was heard on 27th January, 2014, 18th February, 2014,

     14th March, 2014 and finally on 21st April, 2014. None appeared for

     the Applicants on all the aforesaid dates of hearing.

</p><p id="p_2">  2. In the writ petition it has been stated by the Applicants that they are

     residents of District Bundi, involved in various social activities and

     participating in various programmes to spread environmental

     awareness in larger public interest. They stated that Bundi city is

     having more than seven centuries of history with rich heritage. It is

     rich in agricultural activities and is surrounded by the famous

     Aravali Hills attracting foreign and local tourists. It is also rich in

     water resources and forests giving a look of a mini hill station. Of

     late, many brick kilns for manufacturing bricks for commercial

     purpose, have been started around the city of Bundi and other parts

     of the district without following the safety norms leading to

     environmental pollution and also causing damage to the health of

     the citizens. The Applicants averred that the Respondents without

     following the prescribed procedure allowed the brick kiln owners to

      continue their activities in violation of various state and

     environmental laws.
</p>
<p id="p_3">  3. The Applicants further contended that under Section 3 of the

     Rajasthan Land Revenue (Allotment &amp; Conversion of Land for

     Establishment of Brick Kilns) Rules, 1987 there is a provision for

     allotment of unoccupied Government land and conversion of

     agricultural land by Khatedar tenant for the establishment of the

     brick kilns in the whole of the State of Rajasthan with the condition

     that the land should not be situated within one kilometre of the

     village Abadi, the kiln owner shall obtain Mining Lease (in short

     ML) from the Mining Department and also NOC issued by the

     concerned village/municipal/local authority who while issuing

     NOC shall ensure that the proposed brick kiln shall not cause any

     pollution or fire hazard to village Abadi and storage godowns or

     places of religious worship or places of historical or tourist

     importance. However, in the case of brick kilns located in Bundi

     District and around Bundi city, above said Rules are not being

     followed and brick kilns are allowed to mushroom in the area. The

     kiln holders have started digging brick earth in valuable agricultural

     lands in the vicinity of Bundi city in an illegal and impermissible

     manner causing damage to the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_4">  4. The Applicants further averred that they have submitted various

     representations to the Respondents for stopping the brick kiln

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">O.A. No. 114 of 2013                                            Page 4 of 18</span>
      activities but the Respondents failed to take any steps to safeguard

     the heritage and environment of the Bundi city and District. Due to

     illegal manufacturing activities in the brick kilns tourism industry

     got affected in Bundi District very badly. Further, the brick kiln

     owners besides digging valuable agricultural lands, have also started

     illegal collection of firewood from the adjacent forests affecting the

     environment in the vicinity of Bundi city and district. The brick kiln

     units scattered around the city of Bundi are having large ovens for

     firing or burning or drying the bricks and releasing huge quantity of

     ash and poisonous gases into the atmosphere causing environmental

     pollution besides adversely affecting the fertility of the agricultural

     lands. In the above circumstances, the Applicants have prayed for

     closure of the illegal brick kilns to maintain the heritage of the Bundi

     District and Bundi city and also to protect the environment.

</p><p id="p_5">  5. Reply has been filed on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 with

     the affidavit of Sub-Divisional Officer, Bundi denying that no brick

     kilns were allowed to operate by the Respondents without

     permission and they were allowed only after granting licence and

     after obtaining NOC from Superintendent of Police, concerned

     Tehsildar, concerned Municipal Board/Gram Panchayat as well as

     Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (in short RSPCB). If any

     unauthorised brick kilns were found to be established and are under

     operation, they were not only removed but the concerned persons

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">O.A. No. 114 of 2013                                              Page 5 of 18</span>
      were inflicted with suitable punishments and only those brick kilns

     which got licences issued by the Mining Department as per the

     provisions of the Rajasthan Minor Mineral (Concession Rules),

     1986 were allowed to be operated.
</p>
<p id="p_6">  6. The Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 further stated that in case the

     agricultural lands proposed to be utilised for establishing the brick

     kilns, are not situated near the National Highway or Abadi areas,

     there is no need of taking permission for using the land measuring a

     maximum of 2500 sqr. mtrs. and in case any brick kiln owner uses

     the land more than 2500 sqr. mtrs. near Abadi area or National

     Highway action is taken against them and such brick kilns are

     removed besides recording such lands as siwai chak under the

     provisions of Section 177 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955. It is

     further stated that licence issued by the Mining Department is only

     as per the provisions of the Government of Rajasthan Notification

     dated 10th June, 1994 issued under Rule 65A of the Rajasthan Miner

     Mineral (Concession) Rules, 1986 wherein there is a prescribed

     procedure of granting permission for manufacturing bricks by using

     the brick earth. It was also stated by the Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 that

     allotment of the land and it's conversion for the purpose of

     establishment of brick kilns, is governed by the Rajasthan Land

     Revenue (Establishment of Brick Kilns) Land Allotment Rules,

     1987 in non-command areas and by the Rajasthan Colonization

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">O.A. No. 114 of 2013                                            Page 6 of 18</span>
      Project area Brick Kiln (Lease) Conditions 1966 in command areas.

     It was further stated that during 2007, the Government of Rajasthan

     issued Notification dated 2nd April, 2007 notifying the Rajasthan

     Land Revenue (Conversion of Agricultural Land for Non-

     Agricultural Purposes in Rural Areas) Rules, 2007 wherein specific

     provision has been made for various activities of utilization of

     agricultural land for non-agricultural purpose and whenever brick

     kilns are allowed to be established in agricultural land, these Rules

     are followed before granting licence. It is also stated that no brick

     kilns are allowed to be established within one kilometre from Abadi

     area and if any contravention of Rules by any brick kiln holder is

     noticed, not only the kilns are removed but penalty is also imposed

     against such brick kiln owners. In one such action about 15 brick

     kilns were removed by the Tehsildar, 4 Brick kilns were removed

     by the Municipal Board with the help of the District Administration.

     It was further stated that as per the report of the Divisional Forest

     Officer, no illegal cutting of firewood is reported in the forest areas

     by the brick kiln owners.

<p id="p_7">  7. The Respondent No. 7 RSPCB in their reply stated that there are

     about 200 brick kiln units in the District Bundi and the units are

     required to obtain consent of the Pollution Control Board for

     establishment as well as for operation and for making discharge of

     emission of air pollutants under the provision of Air (Prevention &amp;

     These units are also required to comply with the emission standards

     prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (in short

     EP Rules) issued under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (in

     short EP Act). It was further stated that only in respect of two brick

     kiln units i.e. M/s. National Brick Industries located in Khasra No.

     457 near village Ajela, District Bundi and M/s Ash Brick Company

     located in Khasra No. 599, village Rehana, District Bundi Consent

     was granted under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a> and the remaining units are found to

     be operative without the consent of the Board in violation of the

     provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a> and EP Rules. Therefore, the Board with a

     view to prevent and control pollution caused by the unauthorised

     brick kiln units, has addressed all the Tehsildars in the District

     Bundi to provide the complete list of brick kilns in their respective

     jurisdiction. All the Tehsildars were informed that as the brick kiln

     units were permitted by the District Administration under the

     Revenue Laws, they would be directed to seek Consent to establish

     and operate the units only after applying to the State Pollution

     Control Board. It was also stated by the State Pollution Control

     Board that the State Board vide its letter dated 2nd September, 2005

     directed all the District Collectors in the state including the District

      Collector, Bundi for taking appropriate action against the defaulting

     brick kiln units.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       Discussion and Conclusions :-
</p>
<p id="p_9">  8. Having gone through the writ petition and the replies filed by the

     Respondents and having heard the learned counsel for the

     Respondents, it is evident that a large number of brick kiln units are

     established in District Bundi and around Bundi city after taking

     permission from the Revenue and Mining authorities but no

     'Consent to Establish' and 'Consent to Operate' was obtained by the

     brick kiln owners from the RSPCB in violation of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a> and

     EP Act. It appears that the brick kilns are permitted to be established

     after their application for land conversion is examined and

     processed by the District Administration/Revenue Department but

     no action is being taken to direct them to obtain consent from the

     State Pollution Control Board. Therefore, the following directions

     are issued for compliance : -

               process) under Orange category. As per the Rajasthan Dept. of

               Environment notification GSR No. 105 dated 6.2.2013 given

               under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a> and GSR No. 106, dated 6-2-2013 given under

               (Sl.No.07). However, the record placed before us does not

               indicate anything about evolving a policy and prescribing

               guidelines to regulate and monitor the Brick Kilns activities in

               the state of Rajasthan though the measures required to be taken

               by the brick kiln industry for control of Air and Water

               Pollution warrant consideration of applications for granting

               Consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a> . Therefore some

               of the points which are suggested to be taken into account by

               RSPCB, District Administration and Mining Authorities as the

               case may be, in granting approval/consent for brick kilns are:
