                             ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">           (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)


      Petitioner has challenged       the order dated 26.3.2013 as at
Annexure A to the petition under which the petitioner was directed
to stop the industrial activity at its unit located at Survey No.76 to 81
of village Dari, Taluka Patan, Dist: Junagadh. In the said order it
was conveyed that electricity connection would be discontinued and
even if the petitioner was running the industry with its captive power
plant, the same should also be discontinued. Such order was passed
after giving notice and hearing to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      From the affidavit in reply filed by the GPCB, it emerges that
the petitioner was not complying with the environmental norms.

The petitioner did not have consolidated consent and authorization
which was valid upto 10th March 2009. Since the petitioner was not
complying with the environmental norms, such authorization was
not continued thereafter. GPCB has also stated that currently the
petitioner is carrying on such activity in violation of the provisions
of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">section 25</a> of the Water Act, <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_2">section 21</a> of the Air Act and relevant
provisions       of Hazardous Waste Rules framed under the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986. It is also stated that the activity is
being carried out within 400 meters of coastal area and hence was
also required to obtain clearance under CRZ Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Though affidavit in rejoinder is filed to such reply filed by the
GPCB, these vital aspects are not seriously disputed.                The
petitioner's main contention appears to be that the GPCB did not
grant clearance without proper reasons and only to stop the
petitioner's production activity.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Under the circumstances, we have no reason to interfere with
the impugned order passed by the GPCB. The petitioner carrying on
industrial activity was required to obtain necessary authorization
from GPCB. As an industrial unit within 400 meters of the coastal
region, it   also required CRZ clearances.        In absence of such
statutory requirements, the petitioner cannot continue its industrial
activity. Merely by stating that GPCB only with a view to stopping
the activity did not grant such clearance would not be sufficient.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      In view of the above discussion, this petition is dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_7">          C/SCA/7222/2013                               ORDER



However, if the petitioner applies to GPCB and other regulatory
authorities after satisfying necessary requirements for restarting the
industry, such applications shall be considered in accordance with
law and this order will not come in way of the petitioner in pursuing
the request for fresh authorization.
