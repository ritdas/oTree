HONBLE SRI JUSTICE U.DURGA PRASAD RAO          

WRIT PETITION NOS.19727 AND 19821 OF 2016       


COMMON ORDER : (per Honble the Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan)      


        W.P. No.19727 of 2016 is filed by G.J. Multiclave (India)
Private Limited and W.P. No.19821 of 2016 is filed by Medicare
Environmental Management Pvt. Ltd questioning the order dated 
28.05.2016, passed by the Telangana State Pollution Control
Board (hereinafter referred to as the TSPCB), as arbitrary, illegal,
in violation of principles of natural justice, without jurisdiction and
as contrary to the Bio Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016  
(hereinafter referred to as the 2016 Rules) read with the Central
Pollution Control Board Guidelines for Common Bio Medical Waste 
Management treatment facilities.  A consequential direction is
sought to direct the respondents to permit the petitioners to collect,
transport, treat and safely dispose of Bio Medical Waste generated
from HCE hospitals situated in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy  
Districts as per the earlier consent order granted in their favour.
        Facts</pre><p id="p_1">, to the limited extent necessary, are that both the
petitioners are companies which have established a Common Bio  
Medical Waste Management Facility (hereinafter called the facility)
in Hyderabad for bio-medical waste treatment.  They were granted
consent for establishment by the A.P. Pollution Control Board,
pursuant to which they established the facility.  Earlier, as the
existing facilities were found insufficient, the services of M/s. G.J.
Multiclave (India) Pvt. Ltd was extended to Kurnool,
Mahaboobnagar and Nalgonda Districts.  Both the petitioners were
granted consent for operations by the TSPCB which later informed
all the facilities operating in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Districts,
by proceedings dated 28.05.2016, that they proposed to demarcate 
the operation areas, among the facilities in Hyderabad and Ranga
Reddy Districts, based on the location of the Health Care
Establishments; thereby particular operational areas were assigned
to each of the existing facilities, and the other facilities were
prohibited from operating in such areas.  The petitioners claim that
this proposal for demarcation of areas was sought to be
implemented by the TSPCB without undertaking any study, and  
without calling for any expert report/recommendations; and the
impugned proceedings were issued, at the behest of the
Government of Telangana, only to favour the unofficial respondent
i.e M/s. Sattva Global Services Pvt. Ltd.
</p><p id="p_2">      Before examining the rival submissions put forth both
against, and in support of, the impugned proceedings dated
28.05.2016, it is necessary to note, albeit in brief, the functions
which the Bio Medical Waste Management Facilities discharge. 
Bio-Medical Waste is generated during diagnosis, treatment or
immunisation of human beings or animals or research activities
pertaining thereto.  The purpose which Bio Medical Waste
Management seeks to achieve is to provide safe and economically 
viable disposal of waste generated from medical diagnosis,
treatment etc.  The hospital waste, once generated, is required to be
segregated, collected, transported, safely treated and disposed off
without causing damage to human health and the environment. 
The Environmental Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter called the
1986 Act) and the Environmental Protection Rules, 1986
(hereinafter called the 1986 Rules) provide the legal frame work
for regulation of bio-medical waste. The Central Government also
made the 2016 Rules for management of bio-medical waste which  
are required to be complied by all Health Care Establishments and
bio-medical waste management facilities.  These Rules prescribe
the duties of health care establishments, and bio-waste
management facilities, in the management, treatment and disposal
of bio-medical waste.
</p><p id="p_3">        It is the petitioners case that the TSPCB permitted additional
facilities to be established for treatment of bio-medical waste in
Medak and Nalgonda Districts in the year 2015; M/s. Sattva
Global Services Pvt. Ltd. obtained consent for establishment and
authorisation from the TSPCB on 11.12.2015, and have 
commenced their operations; the petitioners were informed, by the
impugned order dated 28.05.2016, that the TSPCB proposed to  
demarcate the operational areas of each of the facilities in
Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Districts, based on the location of the
Health Care Establishments; all the major areas i.e., Khairatabad,
Secunderabad, Shamirpet and Qutbullapur Mandals, wherein a  
majority of the corporate hospitals, Government hospitals,
commercial laboratories and diagnostic centres are concentrated,
have been allotted to the unofficial respondent which is a new and
inexperienced operator in the market; the petitioners
representations, objecting to such a proposal, was of no avail; and
the petitioners were left with no other alternative except to invoke
the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India.
</p><p id="p_4">        The subject matter of the impugned order dated 28.05.2016
relates to deficiencies and competition among the facilities,
demarcation of the areas among the facilities operating in
Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Districts, to increase the regulatory
mechanism, and to fix responsibility of the common bio-medical
waste treatment facilities for proper handling of bio-medical waste.
Directions were issued by the TSPCB purportedly under Rule 6 of
the 2016 Rules, and under Section 5 of the 1986 Act.  Among the
letters referred to, in the said order dated 28.05.2016, are the
representations from the facilities operating in Hyderabad and
Ranga Reddy Districts, the representations of the petitioner in W.P.
No.19821 of 2016 dated 09.06.2015, and the petitioner in W.P.
No.19727 of 2016 dated 18.06.2015.  Reference is also made 
therein to a series of meetings which were held with the
representatives of all the four facilities on 11.01.2016, 21.01.2016,
12.02.2016 and 26.04.2016, and the representation of the
Telangana CBMWTF Association dated 12.12.2015.    
</p><p id="p_5">        The impugned order dated 28.05.2016 records that, as per
the Central Pollution Control Board (hereinafter called the CPCB)
guidelines, the facilities are permitted to establish their units in
any area; however one facility is allowed to cater only upto 10,000
beds at the rate approved by the prescribed authority; the facilities
are also not allowed to cater to health care establishments situated
beyond a radius of 150 kms; if in any area 10,000 beds are not
available, within a radius of 150 kms, another facility may be
allowed to cater to the health care units situated outside the 150
kms radius; the Chairman, CPCB, in his letter dated 07.10.2009,
informed that some of the  States had not complied with the
guidelines for Common Bio Medical Waste Treatment Facilities, and 
Guidelines on the Design &amp; Construction  of Bio Medical Waste
incinerators; the State Pollution Control Boards  were requested to
examine these issues while granting consent/authorisation,
particularly with regards new facilities so as to ensure strict
compliance with the bio-medical waste management handling  
Rules, 1998 (hereinafter called 1998 Rules), and the amendments
made thereto; the status of implementation of the 1998 Rules were
being constantly monitored by the Board by conducting special
drives from time to time, based on complaints, adverse news items
etc; based on the observations and violations noticed by the Board
officials, during their inspection, the defaulting Health Care
Establishments  (HCE) and the facilities were reviewed; there has
been a significant increase in the establishment of a number of
hospitals, and the respective bed strength, from year to year
requiring additional facilities to be permitted in this area; the
TSPCB had permitted two facilities in the year 2015; an adverse
news item was published in a Telugu daily on 25.05.2015
regarding lapses/information for implementation of the 1998
Rules; a review meeting was conducted on 30.05.2015 by the 
Government, in the chambers of the Minister of Environment and
Forests, Science and Technology, with TSPCB officials and
CBMWTFs Officials; while reviewing the lapses noticed in the
GHMC area, the Principal Secretary to the Government, 
Environment  and Forests, Science and Technology Department   
had instructed the TSPCB and CBMWTFs to work out the areas    
through which bio-medical waste from hospitals is transported,
based on geographical locations, for smooth functioning of the
facilities; and the TSPCB was advised to divide the areas in
Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Districts, based on geographical  
locations, to avoid duplication of movement of vehicles, and to fix
responsibility on particular facilities for effective monitoring.
</p><p id="p_6">        The impugned order also records that the three facilities
operating in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Districts, in their
representations dated 09.06.2015 and 18.06.2015, had informed
that the charges had decreased abnormally due to competition
among the facilities; subsequently another adverse news item, on
the facilities, was published in a Telugu daily on 15.07.2015
stating that they were not following the 1998 Rules regarding
collection and disposal of bio-medical waste, due to competition
among the facilities operating in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy
Districts; a review meeting was held by the Government on
07.09.2015, in the Chambers of the Honble Minister, with officials
of the TSPCB; the Honble Minister had directed demarcation of
areas among the facilities to avoid unhealthy competition among
them, for effective implementation of the 1998 Rules, and to fix
responsibility on each particular facility for the areas allocated to
them, in accordance with the CPCB guidelines; the Telangana 
CBMWTF Association had addressed letter dated 12.12.2015   
requesting division of areas, according to the bed strength of the
facilities, to provide bio-medical waste services in Hyderabad and
Ranga Reddy Districts, avoid unhealthy competition between the
operators, and ensure equal rates across the State of Telangana;
the TSPCB had undertaken the exercise of demarcation and  
allocation of the areas, among the four facilities that had obtained
consent for operation from them, based on the proximity of the
location of the facilities limited to the bed strength of 10,000, as
per the CPCB guidelines; a series of meetings were held by the
officials of the TSPCB with representatives of the facilities which
were permitted to operate in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy  
Districts; from out of the four facilities two, including the unofficial
respondent, had agreed in principle for demarcation of the area
based on the facility location; however the other two (writ
petitioners), which were established in 2000 and were catering to
more than 10,000 beds, had opposed the proposal for demarcation 
of the areas, and had questioned the authority of TSPCB to direct
demarcation; they had sought permission to operate and provide
services, in the open competitive market, as per existing practices;
they had opposed demarcation stating, among others, that they did
not support the area distribution, as it restricted competition and
favoured a specific new facility; the TSPCB was issuing bio-medical
waste authorizations to the HCEs existing in Hyderabad and
Ranga Reddy Districts with a condition that bio-medical waste
shall be disposed of for treatment after disinfection and segregation
between the four facilities; the HCEs, existing in Hyderabad and
Ranga Reddy Districts, were tying up with all the facilities in
operation as per their choice; as the TSPCB had earlier stipulated a
condition for the HCE to tie up with any of the facilities permitted
by the TSPCB, this had resulted in competition among the
facilities; the TSPCB was facing difficulties in monitoring the
services provided by the facilities, as it had permitted all the four
facilities to cater to the HCEs in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy
Districts without demarcating their area of operations; all the
facilities were operating, within each of the areas, causing
duplication; this had resulted in the inability of the TSPCB to fix
responsibility on each facility to prevent dumping of bio-medical
waste in municipal dump areas or in open areas; for effective
implementation of the 2016 Rules, to fix responsibility on the
facilities, and for an effective monitoring mechanism, the TSPCB
had decided to allocate separate areas to each of the four facilities
which were earlier permitted to operate in Hyderabad and Ranga
Reddy Districts; demarcation of separate areas is based on the
proximity of the location of the facility with respect to the bed
strength of upto 10,000; after careful and detailed examination, the
TSPCB decided to demarcate HCEs located in Hyderabad and    
Ranga Reddy Districts based on the proximity of hospitals, their
geographical location as per the map, along with a statement
showing the number of beds allocated to each facility within the
upper limit of 10,000 beds as per CPCB guidelines; and four
facilities were allocated the areas and bed strength as mentioned in
the order.
</p><p id="p_7">        The impugned order further records that a committee,
consisting of the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare Department of the Government of Telangana, the Secretary,
Environment, Forest, Science and Technology Department, and the  
Member Secretary, Telangana State Pollution Control Board, after
detailed discussion and careful examination of the deficiencies, had
observed that the present practice suffered from deficiencies; the
regulatory mechanism should be strengthened, and responsibility
should be fixed among the facilities, for proper handling of bio-
medical waste; they had approved the proposal for demarcation of
areas, and the respective bed strength among the four facilities
permitted to operate in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Districts;
these steps were taken to ensure effective implementation of the
2016 Rules; in the exercise of its powers under Rule 6 of the 2016
Rules, and Section 5 of the 1986 Act, the TSPCB had directed the
petitioners to restrict their services to HCEs located in the specified
area as per the enclosed map limiting their bed strength to 10,000
beds; these directions were issued in order to (1) fix responsibility
among the facilities, to ensure that each HCE located in the area
was covered, and to take action against the facility, if any violation
(dumping of bio-medical waste in municipal areas) was noticed; (2)
to avoid unhealthy competition among the facilities, thereby
regulating reduction in the price fixed by the prescribed authority
for waste collection from the HCE; (3) avoid bidding for collection of
waste from the facility; (4) reduction of price for collection of waste
was hampering proper collection, transportation, treatment and
disposal of bio-medical waste; (5) it would be easier for the facility
to conduct training or awareness programmes for a particular area
for proper segregation of bio-medical waste, to avoid its being
mixed with municipal waste, and for better management of records
as per the Rules; (6) to avoid duplication of vehicle movement in
the same route by all the facilities, which was also cost effective to
the facility; and (7) fixing of routes for movement of vehicles,
allocated in a particular area to the specified facility, would ensure
effective monitoring by GIS tracking.
</p><p id="p_8">        By the impugned order the petitioners were directed to
identify the HCEs, which were not covered in their respective area,
and intimate the same to the TSPCB for immediate compliance.  
They were also directed to conduct training classes to the HCE
management and staff for handling bio-medical waste as per the
Rules, to comply with the directions scrupulously as per the
guidelines issued by the CPCB for the facilities, and to hand over a
detailed list of the HCEs which were being catered to by the
facilities outside their respective areas, with intimation to the
HCEs.  The petitioners were informed that failure to comply with
these directions would result in action being taken under the
provisions of the 1986 Act; and they should submit compliance
status, on implementation of the impugned order, within 15 days
along with route map, list of HCEs covered, and the number of
beds being catered to.
</p><p id="p_9">        Elaborate oral submissions were made on behalf of the
petitioners by Sri R. Raghunandan and Sri S. Niranjan Reddy,
Learned Senior Counsel.  Written submissions have also been filed,
on behalf of the petitioners, by Sri Sri V.B. Subrahmanyam, and
Ms. Gorantla Sriranga Pujitha, Learned Counsel appearing on
their behalf.  The Learned Additional Advocate General, appearing
on behalf of the respondents, supplemented his detailed oral
submissions with written arguments.  It is convenient to examine
the rival submissions, urged by Learned Counsel on either side,
under different heads.
</p><p id="p_10">I. NO POWER IS CONFERRED ON THE STATE POLLUTION             
    CONTROL BOARDS, UNDER THE 2016 RULES, TO          
    DEMARCATE THE AREA OF OPERATIONS OF THE            
    FACILITIES:
</p>
<p id="p_11">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that Rule 6 r/w
Schedule III Item No.6 of the 2016 Rules prescribes the
powers/responsibilities of the State Pollution Control Board (the
SPCB for short); the power to demarcate areas has not been
conferred on the SPCB thereunder; these Rules only authorize the
TSPCB to initiate action against the facilities for violation of the
Rules; the doctrine of Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius would
apply; Schedule III S.No. 6(i) relates to inventorisation, and does
not include the power of demarcation; the power conferred under
this provision merely enables the State Pollution Control Boards to
make a list/inventory of data as provided therein; the power
conferred on the State Pollution Control Board should be
construed strictly; and the provisions of the 1986 Act r/w the 2016
Rules do not authorize demarcation of areas for operation among
the facilities.
</p><p id="p_12">      On the other hand, the Learned Additional Advocate-General
would submit that the 2016 Rules were made in exercise of the
powers  conferred under Sections  6,8 and 25 of the 1986 Act; in
exercise of the powers conferred by the 2016 Rules, and in order to
regulate the mechanism, the TSPCB has undertaken   
inventorisation  of the facilities,  in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy
districts, by the impugned order; and the reasons for
inventorisation, and  consequential demarcation of areas among all
the facilities, are detailed therein.
</p><p id="p_13">      Section 6(1) of the 1986 Act enables the Central Government,
by notification in the official gazette, to make rules in respect of all
or any of the matters referred to in Section 3 thereof.  Section
6(2)(c) enables such rules to provide for the procedure and
safeguards for the handling of hazardous substances and clause (d)
enables the Rules to provide for the prohibition and restriction on
the handling of hazardous substances in different areas.  Section 8
stipulates that no person shall handle or cause to be handled any
hazardous substance except in accordance with such procedure,  
and after complying with such safeguards, as may be prescribed.
Section 25(1) of the 1986 Act enables the Central Government, by
notification in the official gazette, to make rules for carrying out the
purposes of the 1986 Act.  A delegated power to legislate, by
making rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act, is a general
delegation without laying down any guidelines. It cannot be so
exercised as to bring into existence substantive rights or
obligations or disabilities not contemplated by the provisions of the
Act itself. (<a href="/doc/1598183/" id="a_2">Kunj Behari Lal Butail v. State of H.P</a>., ). Section
25(2)(b) of the 1986 Act enables such rules to provide for the
procedure in accordance with, and the safeguards in compliance
with, which hazardous substances shall be handled or cause to be
handled under Section 8.
</p><p id="p_14">      The 2016 Rules were made by the Central Government in the
exercise of its powers under Sections 6, 8 and 25 of the 1986 Act,
and in supersession of the 1998 Rules. These rules, notified in the
Gazette of India on 28.03.2016, apply to all persons who generate,
collect, receive, store, transport, treat, dispose or handle bio-
medical waste in any form including hospitals, nursing homes,
clinics, dispensaries, veterinary institutions, animal houses,
pathological laboratories, blood banks, ayush hospitals, clinical
establishments, research or educational institutions, health camps,
medical or surgical camps etc.
        Rule 3(f) of the 2016 Rules defines bio-medical waste to mean
any waste, which is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or
immunization of human beings or animals or research activities
pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biological or in
health camps, including the categories mentioned in Schedule-I of
the Rules.  Rule 3(g) defines bio-medical waste treatment and disposal
facility to mean any facility wherein treatment, disposal of bio-
medical waste or processes incidental to such treatment and
disposal is carried out, and includes common bio-medical waste
treatment facilities.  Rule 3(j) defines health care facility to mean a
place where diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human
beings or animals is provided irrespective of the type and size of the
health treatment system, and research activity pertaining thereto.
Rule 3(m) defines occupier to mean a person having administrative
control over the institution and the premises generating bio-
medical waste, which includes a hospital, nursing home, clinic,
dispensary etc.  Rule 3(n) defines operator of a common bio-medical
waste treatment facility to mean a person who owns or controls a
common bio-medical waste treatment facility for the collection,
reception, storage, transport, treatment, disposal or any other form
of handling of bio-medical waste.  Rule 3(o) defines prescribed
authority to mean the State Pollution Control Board in respect of a
State, and Pollution Control Committees in respect of Union
territories.
</p><p id="p_15">        Rule 5 of the 2016 Rules relates to the duties of the operator
of a common bio-medical waste treatment and disposal facility and,
thereunder, it is the duty of every operator, among others, to (a)
take all necessary steps to ensure that the bio-medical waste,
collected from the occupier, is transported, handled, stored, treated
and disposed of without any adverse effect to human health and
the environment, in accordance with the Rules and guidelines
issued by the Central Government or the Central Pollution Control
Board, (b) ensure timely collection of bio-medical waste from the
occupier as prescribed under the Rules, (c) establish bar coding
and global positioning systems for handling of bio-medical waste
within one year, (d) inform the prescribed authority immediately
regarding the occupiers which are not handing over segregated bio-
medical waste in accordance with the Rules, (e) provide training for
all its workers involved in handling of bio-medical waste at the time
of induction, and at least once a year thereafter, (f) assist the
occupier in training conducted by them for bio-medical waste
management, and (k) allow occupiers, who are giving waste for
treatment to the operator, to see whether treatment is carried out
as per the Rules.
</p><p id="p_16">        Rule 6 relates to the duties of authorities and, thereunder,
the authority specified in column (2) of Schedule-III shall perform
the duties as specified in column (3) thereof in accordance with the
provisions of the Rules.  Rule 7 relates to treatment and disposal.
Rule 7(1) requires bio-medical waste to be treated and disposed of
in accordance with Schedule-I, and in compliance with the
standards provided in Schedule-II by the health care facilities and
common bio-medical waste treatment facility.  Rule 7(2) requires
the occupier to hand over segregated waste as per Schedule-I to the
common bio-medical waste treatment facility for treatment,
processing and final disposal.  Under the proviso thereto, the
highly infectious bio-medical waste generated shall be pre-tested by
equipment like autoclave or microwave.  Rule 7(3) prohibits an
occupier from establishing on-site treatment and disposal facility, if
the service of a common bio-medical waste treatment facility is
available at a distance of 75 kilometers.  Rule 7(4) stipulates that,
in cases where the service of the common bio-medical waste 
treatment facility is not available, the occupiers shall set up
requisite bio-medical waste treatment equipment like incinerator,
autoclave or microwave, shredder prior to commencement of its
operations as per the authorization given by the prescribed
authority.  Rule 7(5) stipulates that if any person, including an
occupier or operator of a common bio-medical waste treatment
facility, intends to use new technologies for treatment of bio-
medical waste, other than those listed in Schedule-I, he shall
request the Central Government for laying down standards or
operating parameters.
</p><p id="p_17">        Rule 8 relates to segregation, packaging, transportation and
storage, and Rule 8(1) stipulates that no untreated bio-medical
waste shall be mixed with other waste.  Rule 9 relates to the
prescribed authority and, sub-rule (1) thereof, prescribes that the
authority, for implementation of the 2016 Rules, shall be the State
Pollution Control Boards with respect to the States, and the
Pollution Control Committees with respect to Union territories.
Rule 9(2) stipulates that the prescribed authority, for enforcement
of the provisions of the Rules in respect of all health care
establishments including hospitals, nursing homes, clinics,
dispensaries, veterinary institutions etc., shall be the Director-
General, Armed Forces Medical Services who shall function under
the supervision and control of the Ministry of Defence.  Rule 9(3)
stipulates that the prescribed authorities shall comply with the
responsibilities as stipulated in Schedule-III of the Rules.
</p><p id="p_18">        Rule 18 relates to the liability of the occupier and the
operator of a facility and, under sub-rule (2) thereof, the occupier
or operator of the common bio-medical waste treatment facility
shall be liable for action under Sections 5 and 15 of the 1986 Act
in case of any violation.       Schedule-I relates to bio-medical waste
categories, and the segregation, collection, treatment, processing
and disposal of bio-medical waste.  Schedule-III is the list of
prescribed authorities and their corresponding duties.
</p><p id="p_19">        As the dispute, in the present cases, relates to the
jurisdiction of the TSPCB to demarcate areas, and restrict services

</p>
<p id="p_52">        By the impugned order, the area of operations of each of the
facilities has been prescribed.  The power to so prescribe falls
within the ambit of laying down the criteria for establishing common bio-
medical waste treatment facilities in the country which, under clause 4(v)
of Schedule-III, is a duty required to be performed only by the
Central Pollution Control Board, and not by the State Pollution
Control Boards. Inventorisation of occupiers and data on bio-
medical waste generation, treatment and disposal is an exercise
undertaken to prepare a list of occupiers i.e., a list of health care
facilities wherein bio-medical waste is generated.  The power
conferred under clause 6(iv) on the State Pollution Control Board is
to monitor compliance of the provisions of the Act and the Rules,
and the conditions of authorization; and, under clause 6(v), to take
action against common bio-medical waste treatment facilities for
violation of the Rules.
</p><p id="p_53">      While the State Pollution Control Board has been conferred
the power to monitor compliance of various provisions and
conditions of authorization, such a power does not bring within its
fold exercise of the power to demarcate areas, as such a power is
conferred, by clause 4(v), on the Central Pollution Control Board.
As shall be detailed hereinafter, the CPCB has not fixed any
particular area within which these facilities are required to operate.
Consequently the question of the petitioners having failed to
comply with the provisions of the Act, and the conditions of
authorization, by operating beyond the demarcated areas does not
arise.  As the CPCB has not demarcated the area of operations of
each of these facilities, these facilities cannot also be said to have
violated the provisions of the Act, the Rules and the conditions of
authorization in operating beyond the areas demarcated by the
TSPCB.  While the petitioners failure to adhere to the provisions of
the Act and the Rules, and the conditions of authorization, for
proper disposal of bio-medical waste would enable the TSPCB to
take action against them, that does not confer on the TSPCB the
power to demarcate the area of operations nor can it be said to be
incidental to their power to monitor compliance of the provisions of
the Act, the Rules and the conditions of authorization.
</p><p id="p_54">      This question can be examined from another angle also.  The
very fact that the rule making authority has conferred the power to
lay down the criteria for establishing common bio-medical waste
treatment facilities on the CPCB under clause 4(v) of Schedule-III of
the 2016 Rules, can only mean that such a power has not been 
conferred on, or such an obligation entrusted to, the State
Pollution Control Boards.  The maxim expressio unius est exclusio
alterius means that expression of one thing is the exclusion of
another. Mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another.
When certain persons or things are specified in a law, an intention
to exclude all others from its operation may be inferred. (<a href="/doc/1863909/" id="a_3">Gram
Panchayat v. Director, Consolidation of Holdings</a> ).
</p><p id="p_55">      Schedule-III of the 2016 Rules assigns different duties to
different authorities, and these duties do not overlap.  Once the
CPCB prescribes the criteria for establishing common bio-medial
waste treatment facilities, which would include prescribing the
area within which these facilities should operate, the concerned
facility would be obligated to adhere to such criteria, and it is only
thereafter would the State Pollution Control Boards be entitled to
monitor compliance of operations within each such demarcated 
area by each such facility, or to take action against them if they
operate beyond the area demarcated in their favour.  It is not in
dispute that no such criteria has been laid down by the CPCB till
date and, in the absence of such criteria being prescribed, it is not
open to the TSPCB to take upon itself the task of demarcating the
areas within which each of these facilities should carry on their
operations. Demarcation of areas, by the TSPCB under the 
impugned order dated 28.05.2016, within which each of the
facilities are required to operate, is ultravires the 2016 Rules and is
without jurisdiction.

</p>
<p id="p_57">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that Section 3
r/w Section 5 of the 1986 Act gives power to the Central
Government to issue directions for the purposes of the Act; in the
exercise of its powers under Section 23 of the 1986 Act, the Central
Government, vide notification in S.O.No.372(E) dated 10.04.2001,
delegated its powers, to issue directions to any industry or any local or other
authority, for violation of the standards and rules relating to bio-medical waste,
to the Andhra Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (APSPCB); 
the State Pollution Control Board, a delegated authority under
Section 23 of the Act r/w the notification in S.O.No.372(E) dated
10.04.2001, cannot demarcate areas, as no such power has been  
conferred on it under the 1986 Act or under the 2016 Rules; the
SPCB, being a creation of the statute (<a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the Air
Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1981), should act within
the powers conferred on it; under the notification in S.O.No.372(E)
dated 10.04.2001, the SPCB has been conferred the power to issue 
directions to any industry or any local or other authority for
violation of the standards and rules relating to bio-medical waste; a
delegatee must exercise its powers strictly within the four corners
of a statute; delegated power cannot be so exercised as to bring into
existence substantive rights, obligations or disabilities not
contemplated by the provisions of the Act itself; the impugned
order dated 28.05.2016 is beyond the delegated power conferred on
the TSPCB, and is without jurisdiction; the power exercised, under
the impugned order, is not for the purposes of issuing directions to
any industry or any local or other authority for the violations of the standards
and rules relating to bio-medical waste;  the impugned order is without
sanction of law, and cannot be traced to <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act;
the power to demarcate areas of operation, for each facility, cannot
be inferred when it has not been expressly provided for; the 1986
Act, the 2016 Rules and the notification in S.O. No. 372(E) dated
10.04.2001 do not expressly authorize the TSPCB to demarcate  
and assign areas of operation to each facility; the Notification in
S.O.No.372(E) does not confer power on the TSPCB to pass the  
impugned order; it only authorises the TSPCB to issue directions
for violation of standards and rules relating to bio-medical wastes,
hazardous chemicals, industrial solid waste and municipal solid
waste including plastic waste notified under the 1986 Act; since
there are no violations, the said notification is not applicable to the
present case; and where a statute contemplates such a power to be 
exercised by the executive, it should be expressly provided for as in
the Sugar Cane Control Order, 1960.
</p><p id="p_58">        On the other hand, the Learned Additional Advocate General,
appearing on behalf of the TSPCB, would submit that, in the
instant case,  the competent authority ie the Chairman, TSPCB,
having noticed the serious violations (as is referred to in the
impugned order), has undertaken the regulatory mechanism; the 
Legislature, in its wisdom, has used different expressions in several
enactments like closure, prohibition and regulation; while the first
two are specific in terms, the word regulation is  a generic term,
and it would take within its ambit several regulatory factors or
directions which may not amount to  prohibition or closure; the
instant demarcation of areas, amongst the four operators,  is one
such regulatory measure; in a case where the PCB had  insisted on
Bank Guarantees being furnished for complying with the
conditions of CFE and CFO, the same was challenged by way  of an  
appeal before the National Green Tribunal (the matter went from
Odisha State); the National Green Tribunal considered the matter
at length, particularly  in the light of  the regulatory power vested
in the PCB; though the power to insist on a Bank Guarantee was
neither traceable to the Regulations nor to the Rules made by the
Central Government, the National Green Tribunal, after
considering  <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Section 31-A</a> of the Air Act and the relevant provisions
on this aspect, had upheld the action of the Board.
</p><p id="p_59">        While examining the aforesaid contentions, it must be borne
in mind that a delegatee must exercise its powers within the four
corners of the statute; the power of a sub-delegatee is more
restricted; a delegatee cannot act in violation of a statute; a sub-
delegatee cannot exercise any power which is not meant to be
conferred upon him by reason of the statutory provisions; and it
must conform to the provisions of the regulations and the Act.

</p><p id="p_64"> MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS NOTIFICATION             
New Delhi, the 10th April, 2001
       S.O. 372 (E) --  In exercise of the powers conferred by
<a href="/doc/47804736/" id="a_27">Section 23</a> of the       Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (29 of 1986),
the Central Government  hereby delegates the powers vested         
in it under <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_28">section 5</a> of the said Act to the Chairman, State
Pollution Control Board / Committees as given in the Table below,
to issue directions to any industry or any local or other authority
for     the violations of the standard and rules relating to bio-
medical waste, hazardous chemicals, industrial solid waste and
municipal solid waste including plastic waste notified under the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_29">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,   1986, subject to the conditions that
the Central Government may revoke such delegation of powers or 
may itself invoke the provisions of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_30">Section 5</a> of the said Act, if in
the opinion of the Central Government such a course of action is
necessary in the public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_65">      The power conferred on the SPCBs, under notification
No.S.O.No.372(E) dated 10.04.2001, is a power delegated to it by
the Central Government under <a href="/doc/22265957/" id="a_31">Section 23</a> of the 1986 Act.  The
delegation is of the power vested in the Central Government under
<a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_32">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act.  Such delegation of power must be
confined strictly within the limits authorised by the instrument by
which the power was delegated.  Exercise of the delegated power by
the TSPCB is limited to the extent of the delegation specified in
S.O.No.372(E) dated 10.04.2001, and not beyond. 
</p><p id="p_66">      If, under the impugned order dated 28.05.2016, directions
had been issued to the facilities for violation of either the standards
or the rules relating to bio-medical waste, then the SPCB, which
passed the impugned order, would be held to have had the power
to do so.  The Rules, which are applicable, are the 2016 Rules
which came into force on its publication in the Gazette of India
dated 28.03.2016, and as noted hereinabove do not confer power
on the TSPCB to demarcate areas within which these facilities are
required to operate.  In the absence of any such prescription in the
rules, the question of its violation does not arise.  The power to
issue the impugned order is therefore not referable to the delegated
power, to issue directions for violation of the rules, under S.O.
No.372(E) dated 10.04.2001.  As shall be detailed hereinafter, no
standards were prescribed by the CPCB relating to demarcation of
areas when the impugned order dated 28.05.2016 was passed by   
the TSPCB.  Consequently the impugned order dated 28.05.2016   
also travels beyond the powers delegated to the State Pollution
Control Boards, under S.O. No.372(E) dated 10.04.2001, to issue
directions for violation of the standards relating to bio-medical
waste.
</p><p id="p_67">      While the power conferred on the Central Government, under
<a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_33">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act, is no doubt wide and includes the power
to direct the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry,
operation or process or stoppage or regulation of any service, such
power, under <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_34">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act, is conferred on the Central
Government and not on the State Pollution Control Boards.  It is
wholly unnecessary for us, therefore, to examine whether the word
regulation, in Explanation (a) to <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_35">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act, brings
within its ambit the power to demarcate areas amongst the
facilities also, as the power to do so has been exercised, in the
present case, not by the Central Government under <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_36">Section 5</a> of
the 1986 Act, but by the TSPCB.  While the power of delegation,
conferred on the Central Government under <a href="/doc/22265957/" id="a_37">Section 23</a> of the 1986
Act, would include the power to delegate the power to issue any of
the directions as is referred to in <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_38">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act (apart
from the power to constitute an authority under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_39">Section 3(3)</a> and
the power to make rules under <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_40">Section 25</a>), the question which
necessitates examination is whether or not the power to regulate
the facilities, or to prescribe regulatory measures such as
demarcation of areas of operations among all the facilities, has
been delegated by the Central Government to the State Pollution
Control Boards.
</p><p id="p_68">      As is evident from the Notification, in S.O.372(E) dated
10.04.2001, the Central Government has not delegated all its
powers, to issue directions under <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_41">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act, to the
State Pollution Control Boards.  The power delegated under the
Notification, in S.O.372(E) dated 10.04.2001, is not even the power
to prescribe standards and rules relating to bio-medical waste, but
only to issue directions to an industry for violation thereof.  As
noted hereinabove, it is only if such standards and rules, relating
to demarcation of areas of operations among the facilities, are
prescribed, can the State Pollution Control Board be said to have
been delegated the power to issue directions in case any industry
violates such standards and rules.  In the absence of prescription,
there cannot be any violation of such standards and rules.
Consequently the TSPCB lacks authority, under the Notification in
S.O.No.372(E) dated 10.04.2001, to issue any directions for
violation of non-existent standards and rules.

Government to reserve any area, where any sugar cane is grown for

down as not being a reasonable restriction under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_50">Article 19(6)</a> of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_72">      On the other hand the Learned Additional Advocate General
would submit that, by the impugned order passed by the TSPCB,  
the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_51">Article 19(1) (g)</a> of Constitution of India
is not affected; even otherwise, the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_52">Article
19(1)(g)</a> is not absolute; the State is entitled to impose reasonable
restrictions in line with <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_53">Article 19(6)</a> of Constitution of India; and
the power of the State, to impose reasonable restrictions in the
instant case, is traceable to the provisions of the 1986 Act, and the
power delegated to it by the Central Government in this regard.
</p><p id="p_73">      Under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_54">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, a citizen has the
right to carry on any occupation, trade or business, and the only
restriction on this right is the authority of the State to make a law
imposing reasonable restrictions under clause (6). (<a href="/doc/67871/" id="a_55">Bishambhar
Dayal Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P</a>., ).  The freedom
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_56">Article 19(1)(g)</a> is not free of restrictions or
limitations.  Normally the restrictions can be in two different forms
 one is by way of a reasonable restriction to which the right is
made subject to by the Constitution itself, while the other would be
by virtue of a law that may be enacted by the State.  The right to
carry on business is not an absolute right but is a conditional right
and is subject to such restrictions as may be placed.
</p><p id="p_74">      The fact that the petitioners have the fundamental right,
under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_57">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India to carry on the
business of operating the facility, is not in dispute.  <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_58">Article 19(6)</a>
stipulates that nothing in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_59">Article 19(1)(g)</a> shall affect the operation
of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or to prevent the State
from making any law imposing, in the interests of the general
public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the rights
conferred by the said clause.  In view of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_60">Article 19(6</a>), the
fundamental right to carry on business, under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_61">Article 19(1)(g</a>), is
subject to any law already made or which the State may make. 
Such law must, however, fulfil the twin conditions of (a) being in
the interest of the general public, and (b) the restrictions imposed
thereby being reasonable.  Environmental laws prescribe
restrictions on the establishment of such facilities and require
them to obtain Consent for Establishment (CFE), and the Consent 
for Operations (CFO), from the State Pollution Control Boards.  The
petitioners-facilities have been granted consent, both for
establishment and for operations, by the State Pollution Control
Board.
</p><p id="p_75">      The expression reasonable restriction in <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_62">Article 19(6)</a>
signifies that the limitation imposed on a person, in the enjoyment
of the right, should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature,
beyond what is required in the interests of the public. The test of
reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each
individual statute impugned, and no abstract standard, or general
principle of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable in all
cases.  Any restriction, which arbitrarily or excessively invades the
right, cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and,
unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed
in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_63">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and the social control permitted by clause (6) of

by way of an administrative order.  Law must possess a certain
form.  It must contain a clear mandate/explicit command which
may be prescriptive, permissive or penal.  It must also seek to
achieve a clearly identifiable purpose. While the form itself, or
absence thereof, is not determinative, and its impact has to be
considered as a lending or supporting force, the disclosure of a

very least, there must be some special rule or regulation or

</p><p id="p_82">      As shall be detailed hereinafter, the guidelines issued by the
Central Pollution Control Board, which were in force when the

TSPCB to demarcate the areas within which alone these facilities
must operate.  Neither the 1986 Act nor the 2016 Rules, or for that
matter the Central Pollution Control Board guidelines, confer any
power on the TSPCB to demarcate the area of operations of each of
these facilities.  The impugned order passed by the TSPCB dated
28.05.2016, demarcating the area of operations of each of these
facilities, is not a law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_79">Article 19(6)</a> of the
Constitution of India as it neither contains a clear
mandate/explicit command which is either prescriptive, permissive
or penal nor does it seek to achieve a clearly identifiable purpose.
It is merely an administrative order issued specifically to the

restrictions on the petitioners fundamental right to carry on
business under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_80">Article 19(1)(g</a>), and as it does not have the force of

IV. IS THE IMPUGNED ORDER DATED 28.05.2016 CONTRARY           
     TO THE CPCB GUIDELINES?    
</p>
<p id="p_83">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the TSPCB
had limited the boundaries of operations of all the facilities by the
impugned order contrary to the CPCB guide lines which are
mandatory; the TSPCB has not been conferred the power of 
demarcation/bifurcation of the area of operations; sanction from
the CPCB has not been obtained by the TSPCB; the impugned    
order is contrary to the CPCB guidelines under which one facility
can cater upto 10,000 beds within a radius of 150 Kms; if the bed
strength is more than 10,000, another facility may be provided;
though there is no proper inventory, the TSPCB has not only
restricted the jurisdiction of the facilities, but has also defined their
area of operations, which is in violation of the mandatory
guidelines of the CPCB; if, for any reason, the bed strength falls
below 10,000, the petitioner-facility cannot extend its jurisdiction
since it is prescribed and fixed by the impugned order; the
impugned order creates a situation where the existing facility
would not only suffer business loss, but there would be no further
scope to enhance its jurisdiction upto 150 KM; this would result in
taking away the benefit conferred by the CPCB guidelines;  even if
any excess bed strength is available,   the same can be allotted to a
new facility, but cannot be adjusted from the jurisdiction of the
existing facility which has been providing services since long;
though  Ranga Reddy and Hyderabad districts fall within a radius
of 150 Kms of the petitioners facility, other service providers were
granted permission to establish units; such units are also
operating, along with the petitioners, in the same area; each of
them have clients (Hospitals) of their own; the action of the TSPCB,
being damnum sine injuria, cannot be justified on the ground
that a maximum of 10,000 beds are prescribed for each facility;
Rule 6 of the 2016 Rules, <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_82">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act, and the
amendments thereto do not permit the TSPCB to restrict the
services of a facility contrary to the CPCB guidelines; or to bifurcate
areas within a 150 km radius.
</p><p id="p_84">      The Central Pollution Control Board framed guidelines for
Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facilities.  Clause D of the 
CPCB Guidelines relates to the coverage area of the facility and
reads as follows :
</p><p id="p_85">        In any area, only one CBWTF may be allowed to cater up to
10,000 beds at the approved rate by the Prescribed Authority.   A
CBWTF shall not be allowed to cater healthcare units situated
beyond a radius of 150 km.   However, in an area where 10,000
beds are not available within a radius of 150 Km, another CBWTF
may be allowed to cater the healthcare units situated outside the
said 150 km.
</p>
<p id="p_86">      The guidelines for common bio-medical waste treatment
facilities, laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board,
prescribe the coverage area of each facility; and requires, in any
area, for only one facility to be allowed to cater upto 10,000 beds at
the rate approved by the prescribed authority. It prohibits the
facility from being allowed to cater to health care units situated
beyond a radius of 150 km.  However, in an area where 10,000
beds are not available within a radius of 150 km, another facility
may be allowed to cater to the healthcare units situated outside the
said 150 km.  In terms of the aforesaid guidelines issued by the
Central Pollution Control Board, each of the facilities, including
the petitioners herein, are required to cater only upto 10,000 beds
at the rate approved by the prescribed authority. Within the
prescribed radius of 150 km, a facility is free to provide services to
such healthcare establishments which desire to avail their services
provided they do not cater beyond 10,000 beds, and do not exceed
the rate approved by the prescribed authority. The respondents are
not taking action against the petitioners herein for catering beyond
10,000 beds in health care establishments.  It is not in dispute that
all the healthcare establishments, which the petitioners-facilities
serve, are situated within the permissible radius of 150 km.
</p><p id="p_87">      In the absence of any stipulation in the CPCB guidelines,
regarding the manner in which the health care establishments in
an area, (within a radius of 150 KM having more than 10,000
beds), should be allotted among the existing facilities, it is for the
health care establishments to choose the facility to which they
should entrust the task of collection of bio-medical waste.  In an
unregulated market, the best available service provider would be
chosen by the health care establishments concerned.  While the
upper limit of 10,000 beds per facility cannot be breached, the
facilities from which services should be secured, is for the health
care establishments to decide. These are all matters of agreement
between the health care establishments and the facility concerned
and, in the absence of any guidelines being prescribed by the
Central Pollution Control Board in this regard, the TSPCB cannot
prescribe the area within which, and the health care units to
which, each of these facilities should provide their services.
</p>
<p id="p_88">V. DO THE CPCB GUIDELINES HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW?             
</p>
<p id="p_89">      It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the Central
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Guidelines, prescribing the
coverage area of 10,000 beds for each Bio-Medical Waste Treatment 
facility, is not a law; reliance placed by the TSPCB on the
guidelines issued by the CPCB prescribing the coverage area of
10,000 beds for each bio-medical waste treatment facility, to justify
the impugned order of demarcation of areas, is misplaced; these
guidelines are mere suggestions issued by CPCB to the State 
Pollution Control Board, and are not statutory in nature; they do
not have the force of law; and they cannot be relied upon by the
TSPCB to enforce obligations which would cause prejudice to the
petitioners.
</p><p id="p_90">      As noted hereinabove, Rule 6 of the 2016 Rules relates to the
duties of the authorities, and the authorities specified in Column
(2) of Schedule III are required to perform the duties specified  in
Column (3) thereof.  The CPCB has been entrusted the duty, in the
table referred to in Schedule-III, of preparing guidelines for bio-
medical waste management, and submit it to the Ministry of
Environment, Forests and Climate Change; and to lay down the 
criteria for establishing common bio-medical waste treatment
facilities in the Country.  While the power conferred on the CPCB
to prepare guidelines on bio-medical waste management, is
referable to Schedule-III of the 2016 Rules which are statutory in
character, the said power to prepare guidelines is circumscribed by
the requirement of such guidelines being submitted to the Ministry
of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. It does appear that
the guidelines are submitted to the Central Government for it to
exercise its powers under <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_83">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act to issue
directions to industries in this regard.  It is only if the CPCB
guidelines have the force of law, can they be enforced in
proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_84">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.  While
Schedule III of the 2016 Rules requires the CPCB to lay down
guidelines for establishing common bio-medical waste management  
treatment facilities in the country, and it does appear that, on such
criteria being laid down, it would be obligatory for these facilities to
adhere to such criteria, it is wholly unnecessary for us to dwell on
this aspect as to whether these guidelines have the force of law,
since no guidelines were prescribed by the CPCB in this regard
when the impugned order dated 28.05.2016 was passed by the  
TSPCB.  
</p><p id="p_91">VI. EFFECT OF THE NEW DRAFT GUIDELINES ON THE           
       IMPUGNED ORDER DATED 28.05.2016:     
</p>
<p id="p_92">        It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that a conjoint
reading of all sub-clauses in Clause 6 of the CPCB Guidelines, with
regards Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facilities, as sought  
to be amended by the Draft Guidelines dated 26.02.2014 issued by
the CPCB make it clear that additional beds can only be allotted to
a new facility, and the existing area of operation cannot be split up
and allotted to different facilities.
</p><p id="p_93">      The revised draft Guidelines for Common Bio-medical Waste
Treatment Facilities, which is made available in the official website
of the Central Pollution Control Board, and which were not in force
when the impugned order dated 28.05.2016 was passed, reads as  
follows:
</p><pre id="pre_5">3)      ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS APPLICABLE FOR            
ESTABLISHMENT OF A CBWTF:        

</pre><p id="p_94">Prior to allowing any new facility, the regulatory authority is
required to conduct inventory with regard to the bio-medical waste
generation, as well as existing bio-medical waste treatment
capacities. In case it is found that additional treatment capacity is
required for a particular locality, in such a case action may be
initiated by the prescribed authority for allowing additional
treatment capacity in the form of a new CBWTF in the particular
locality without interfering the coverage area of the existing CBWTF
in that locality as per these guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_95">        Clause 6 thereof, which relates to the suggested coverage
area for development of a facility is as follows: (i) Considering the
economic viability and feasibility, and to have minimal impact on
the environment, in any area only one CBWTF may be allowed to  
cater upto 10,000 beds at the approved rate by the prescribed
authority; (ii) the CBWTF shall not be allowed to cater to healthcare
units situated beyond a radius of 150 km; however, in an area
where 10,000 beds are not available within a radius of 150 km, the
existing CBWTF in the locality may be allowed to cater to the
healthcare units situated outside the said 150 km, provided there
is no other facility in the next 150 km region; (iii) in case, the
number of beds exceeds more than 10,000 in a locality, in such a
case, one more CBWTF may be allowed in such locality to cater 
services only to such additional bed strength in HCEs; and, in
such a case, the area of influence shall be prescribed by the State
Pollution Control Board.
</p><p id="p_96">      Clause 6(iii) provides for a situation where the number of
beds in a locality exceed 10,000; and in such a case one more
facility, in addition to the existing facility, may be allowed in such
a locality to service only such additional bed strength in healthcare
facilities and, in which event, the area of influence shall be
prescribed by the State Pollution Control Board.  After these draft
guidelines are brought into operation, it may possibly enable in
State Pollution Control Board to prescribe the area of operation of
the new facility to service the additional bed strength in the health
care establishments in the locality, without interfering with the
services rendered to health care establishments by the existing
facilities.  In any event, the revised draft guidelines framed by the
CPCB were not in force when the impugned order dated 
28.05.2016 was passed.  The earlier guidelines, which were in force
when the order dated 28.05.2016 was passed, did not permit the
TSPCB to prescribe the area of operations of each of these facilities
i.e., to demarcate the areas within which the facilities are required
to operate.
</p><p id="p_97">VII. WAS THE IMPUGNED ORDER DATED 28.05.2016 PASSED            
       IN VIOLATION OF PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE       
       AND DOES IT FALL FOUL OF <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_85">ARTICLE 14</a> OF THE      
       CONSTITUTION? 
</p>
<p id="p_98">      It is submitted, on behalf of the petitioners, that the rationale
of proximity adopted by the TSPCB, in demarcating and allocating
areas of operation to each facility, does not satisfy the test of a
permissible classification under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_86">Article 14;</a> the impugned order
suffers from non-application of mind; demarcation of areas, among
the facilities does not have any rationale nexus with the object
sought to be achieved; while proximity was sought to be made the
basis for demarcation, the table, submitted to this Court, would
demonstrate that several areas which are proximate to one operator
have been allotted to another; the impugned order is in violation of
principles of natural justice as it was issued without notice, and
without calling for objections on the proposed areas of demarcation
for each facility; even if it were to be assumed that the TSPCB has
the power to issue an order, for demarcation of areas, it is not in
dispute that no notice of the areas, proposed to be demarcated and
allotted to each facility has been issued by the TSPCB; the
impugned order is vitiated on the ground of non-adherence to the
proper procedure, and non-compliance with principles of natural
justice; the manner in which the areas were proposed to be
demarcated among the facilities was not known to the petitioners,
and their objections were not invited by the TSPCB; in issuing an
administrative order/ executive order, which causes prejudice to a
person and has civil consequences, the authority must follow the
proper procedure, and must comply with principles of natural
justice; the contention that notice was issued by the TSPCB to the
petitioners for violation of the rules, and hence action was
necessitated for demarcation of areas is baseless; the notice issued
by the TSPCB pertains only to the operation of the facilities by the
petitioners, and does not pertain to violation in collection/disposal
of bio-medical waste; the CFO issued to the petitioner is still in
force; and without assigning any reason or affording any
opportunity to them, and in the absence of violation of the
prescribed conditions, the TSPCB cannot restrict their area of
operations contrary to the CFO.
</p><p id="p_99">      On the other hand the Learned Additional Advocate-General
would submit that, while  undertaking the process of demarcation
of areas between the four operators,  the Competent Authority has
ensured  that each of them got 10,000 beds as per the Guidelines,
for Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facility, published by 
the CPCB which deals with the Coverage Area; all the four facility
operators were put on notice  through e-mail on 11.2.2016, before
demarcation of the areas, intimating the date of the meeting for
demarcation of the areas  among them; all the four operators
received the said notices, and participated in the meeting; the
respondent authority has not violated principles of natural justice;
and after elaborate consideration of all issues, during the review
meetings at the highest level, the impugned order was passed.
</p><p id="p_100">      The rules of natural justice are not embodied rules. The
question whether the requirements of natural justice have been
met by the procedure adopted in a given case must depend to a
great extent on the facts and circumstances of the case in point,
the constitution of the authority, and the rules under which it
functions. (<a href="/doc/1629479/" id="a_87">Suresh Koshy George v. University of Kerala</a> ;
<a href="/doc/986468/" id="a_88">Purtabpore Co. Ltd. v. Cane Commr. of Bihar</a> ).   Where the
Statute is silent as to the manner in which the power conferred
should be exercised by the authority acting under it, exercise of
power will depend on the express provisions of the statute read
along with the nature of the rights affected, the manner of disposal
provided, the objective criteria, if any, to be adopted, the effect of
the decision on the person affected, and other indicia afforded by
the Statute. The mere fact that the Act in question or the relevent
Regulations do not make it obligatory on the authority to call for
an explanation, and to hear the person concerned, is not
conclusive of the question whether the authority has to act in
compliance with the rules of natural justice when exercising its
power under the statute. (<a href="/doc/290962/" id="a_89">Board of High School and Intermediate

Purtabpore Co. Ltd.21).
</p><p id="p_101">      While it does appear that the facility operators were
intimated of the date of the meeting, for demarcation of the areas,
neither were they put on notice nor were they given an opportunity
of being heard regarding the actual area within which they were
required to operate.  Failure of the TSPCB to do so, has no doubt
caused the petitioners substantial prejudice, as they are now
required to cater to health care establishments not of their choice,
or for that matter of the health care establishments, but to render
service to health care units which were being catered to by others.
</p><p id="p_102">      While geographical location of each of these facilities, and
their proximity to the health care units, is said to be the basis for
demarcation of the areas, the petitioners contend that it is not so,
and have placed a table before us in support of their submission
that the exercise of demarcation of areas, undertaken by the
TSPCB, is irrational, and does not satisfy the test of a valid
classification under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_90">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.  Though
geographical location, and proximity of the facilities to the health
care establishments, can form the basis of a valid classification, the
question which necessitates examination is whether the actual
allocation of HCEs among the facilities satisfies the geographical
location and proximity tests, for it is only then can the allocation of
HCEs, among all the facilities, be said not to fall foul of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_91">Article 14</a> of
the Constitution of India.  While it would be wholly inappropriate
for us, in proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_92">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India, to take upon ourselves the task of allotment of health care
establishments among each of these facilities, and stipulate the
HCEs to whom these facilities should provide the service of
collection of bio-medical waste, we are satisfied that no such
exercise could have been undertaken by the TSPCB either, more so 
without putting each of these facilities on notice of the proposed
health care establishments to whom they would be required to
render services, informing them of the basis on which these health
care establishments are proposed to be distributed among the
existing facilities, and giving them an opportunity of being heard,
before demarcating the area of operations of each of these facilities.
It is evident, therefore, that the impugned order is also in violation
of principles of natural justice.</p>
<p id="p_103">VIII. LETTER ADDRESSED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF          
FACILITY         OPERATORS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE:         
</p>
<p id="p_104">        Learned Additional Advocate General would submit that,
from out of the four facility operators, two have given their consent
for demarcation; and it is a matter of record that  the Association,
on behalf of the Petitioners, has requested, vide its letter dated
12.12.2015, that areas be specified to avoid unhealthy competition
and equal rates across the State of Telangana.  On the other hand,
it is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the letter dated
12.12.2015 said to have been submitted by the Telangana 
CBMWTF Association, requesting the TSPCB to bifurcate the areas  
by specifying the areas to the facilities (CBMWTFs) for providing
services at Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Districts,  has not been
approved by the petitioners, nor  were the petitioners a party to the
said letter; and, hence, no reliance can be placed on the said letter
to non-suit the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_105">      While it does seem that the petitioners are members of the
Association which appears to have requested the State Government 
to demarcate the area of operations among the facilities, the
petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court complaining
of violation of their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and
19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.  As the fundamental rights
guaranteed under the Constitution cannot be waived (<a href="/doc/709776/" id="a_93">Olga Tellis
v. Bombay Municipal Corporation</a> ), the respondents cannot be
heard to contend that the petitioners have waived their rights.
Even otherwise, the exercise undertaken by the TSPCB, for
demarcation of areas, is without jurisdiction. Consent, that too of
an Association of facility operators, would not confer jurisdiction
on the TSPCB to demarcate areas in the absence of such a power  
being conferred on it either by the 1986 Act or the 2016 Rules, or
even by the CPCB guidelines. 
</p><p id="p_106">IX. IS THE TSPCB JUSTIFIED IN TAKING ACTION ON THE       
      COMPLAINTS RECEIVED AGAINST PETITIONERS?         
</p>
<p id="p_107">      Learned Additional Advocate-General would submit that the
Central Pollution Control Board, by its letter dated 7.10.2009,
informed that  some States are not complying with the  Guidelines
for Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facilities, and the 
Guidelines on Design and Construction of Bio-Medical Waste 
Incinerators; the SPCBs were requested to examine the above 
issues, while granting consent for operaton to the facility operators;
in this background, the TSPCB has constantly monitored these 
issues, conducting special drives  from time to time, based on
complaints and adverse news items  etc; it has noticed several
violations  on the part of the operators, and has then reviewed the
matter; and all these facts have been stated in the impugned order
itself.
</p><p id="p_108">      It is no doubt true that, for a more effective control and
monitoring of Environmental laws, the High Courts must shoulder
greater responsibilities in tackling environmental issues which
arise or pertain to the geographical areas within their respective
States; and the primary effort of the Court, while dealing with
environmental-related issues, is to see that the enforcement
agencies, whether it be the State or any other authority, take
effective steps for the enforcement of such laws (<a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_94">Indian Council
For Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India</a> ), that would not
mean that jurisdiction can be conferred on the TSPCB which
neither Parliament in enacting the 1986 Act, nor the Central
Government in making the 2016 Rules, have chosen to confer on 
them.  It is the duty of the High Court, in exercise of its powers of
judicial review, to also ensure that the State and its
instrumentalities function within the limits of the power conferred
on them by Legislation  plenary and subordinate, and do not
exceed their jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_109">      All that we are called upon to examine in these Writ Petitions
is the validity of the exercise undertaken by the TSPCB to
demarcate areas within which each of these facilities are required
to operate.  Violation of the provisions of enactments relating to
environmental protection, or the Rules made thereunder, or the
conditions subject to which consent was accorded by the State
Pollution Control Board for establishment of the facility or for it to
carry on its operations, would undoubtedly call for action being
taken against the defaulting facilities by the TSPCB, after
complying with the principles of natural justice.  Suffice it to make
it clear that the order now passed by us is confined only to an
examination of the issue regarding exercise of power by the TSPCB
to demarcate the areas within which the facilities are required to
operate.  This order would not preclude the TSPCB from taking
action against the errant facilities for violation, if any, of the
provisions of environmental laws/the rules made thereunder/and
the conditions subject to which consent was  accorded for
establishment and for operation of these facilities.
X. ALTERNATIVE REMEDY:      
</p><p id="p_110">      Learned Additional Advocate-General would submit that the
Writ Petition as filed is not maintainable, as an effective alternative
remedy is provided under <a href="/doc/148809041/" id="a_95">Section 5-A</a> of the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986, read with <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_96">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/75377431/" id="a_97">16(g)</a> of the
National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (the 2010 Act for short); the
National Green Tribunal (NGT for short) has been conferred the
power and jurisdiction to adjudicate upon any directions issued
under the enactments mentioned in Schedule-I  of the National
Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (<a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_98">Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog  
Sangathan v. Union of India</a> ); and following the said Judgment,
a Division Bench of this Court, in W.P.No.19064 of 2015 dated
30.07.2015, had refused to entertain the Writ Petition, and had
directed the Petitioners therein to avail the alternative remedy
under the 2010 Act.
</p><p id="p_111">        It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that <a href="/doc/148809041/" id="a_99">Section 5A</a>
of the 1986 Act is not an effective remedy in the present case;
availability of an alternate remedy is not a bar for entertaining a
writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_100">Article 226</a> of the Constitution in three
contingencies; all the three contingencies, under which a writ
petition may be entertained by the High Court, are fulfilled in the
present case; the petitioners have not violated any rule or direction
relating to the environment; <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_101">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_102">16(g)</a> of the 2010 Act
r/w <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_103">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act are inapplicable to the facts of the
present case; the NGT does not have jurisdiction over the subject
matter; the impugned order is neither referable to <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_104">Section 5</a> of the
1986 Act nor to Rule 6 of the 2016 Rules; and the remedy of an
appeal is, therefore, not available under <a href="/doc/148809041/" id="a_105">Section 5-A</a> of the 1986
Act, or under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_106">Sections 14</a> or 16(g) of the 2010 Act.
</p><p id="p_112">      In examining the question whether the petitioners have an
effective remedy under <a href="/doc/148809041/" id="a_107">Section 5A</a> of the 1986 Act read with
<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_108">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_109">16(g)</a> of the 2010 Act, it is necessary to consider,
in the first instance, whether there exists such an alternate
remedy; and secondly, even if such an alternate remedy is
available, would it disable this Court from entertaining these writ
petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_110">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.  Section 5-
A of the 1986 Act provides for an appeal to the NGT and,
thereunder, any person aggrieved by any directions issued under
<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_111">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act, on or after the commencement of the
2010 Act, may file an appeal to the NGT (which is established
under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_112">Section 3</a> of the 2010 Act) in accordance with the provisions
of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_113">        Chapter III of the 2010 Act relates to the jurisdiction, powers
and proceedings of the NGT established under <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_113">Section 3</a> of the said
Act.  <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_114">Section 3</a> relates to the establishment of a Tribunal and
confers power on the Central Government, by notification, to
establish, with effect from such date as may be specified therein, a
Tribunal to be known as the National Green Tribunal to exercise
the jurisdiction, powers and authority conferred on such Tribunal
by or under the 2010 Act.  <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_115">Section 14(1)</a> stipulates that the NGT
shall have jurisdiction in all civil cases where a substantial
question relating to the environment (including enforcement of any
legal right relating to the environment) is involved, and such
question arises out of the implementation of the enactments
specified in Schedule I.  Among the enactments specified in
Schedule I is the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, at serial No.5
thereof.
</p><p id="p_114"> <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_116">Section 14(2)</a> of the 2010 Act requires the NGT to hear
disputes arising from the question referred to in <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_117">Section 14(1)</a>, and
settle such disputes and pass orders thereon.  <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_118">Section 16</a> confers
appellate jurisdiction on the NGT and, thereunder, any person
aggrieved by any direction issued, on or after commencement of the
2010 Act under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_119">Section 5</a> of the 1986 Act, may, within a period of
thirty days from the date on which the order or decision or
direction or determination is communicated to him, prefer an
appeal to the NGT.  Under the proviso thereto, the NGT may, if it is
satisfied that the appellant is prevented by sufficient cause from
filing the appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed under
<a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_120">Section 16</a> within a further period not exceeding sixty days.  The
NGT has both original as well as appellate jurisdiction. Apart from
the bar of jurisdiction of civil courts under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_121">Section 29</a>, the 2010
Act is also given overriding effect over any other law under Section
</p><p id="p_115">33.  (<a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_122">Vellore Citizens Welfare Forums v. Union of India</a> ).
</p><p id="p_116">      The order, impugned in this writ petition, is dated
28.05.2016 and was subjected to challenge by way of a writ
petition filed before this Court on 20.06.2016 within the 30 day
period, prescribed in <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_123">Section 16</a> of the 2010 Act, for preferring an
appeal to the NGT.  The 30 day period expired soon after
28.06.2016.  The 60 day period, prescribed under the proviso to
<a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_124">Section 16</a> of the 2010 Act, has also expired and, as on date, the
statutory remedy under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_125">Section 16</a> of the 2010 Act is no longer
available to the petitioners herein.
</p><p id="p_117">      Learned Additional Advocate General would, however,
contend that, since the statutory remedy of invoking the
jurisdiction of the NGT was available when the writ petition was
entertained by this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_126">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India, and as the petitioners chose to file a writ petition under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_127">Article 226</a> instead of availing the statutory remedy under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_128">Section
16</a> of the 2010 Act, the petitioners cannot take advantage of their
own failure to invoke the jurisdiction of the NGT, and be heard to
contend that they are now disabled from invoking the appellate
jurisdiction of the NGT under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_129">Section 16</a> of the 2010 Act.
</p><p id="p_118">        Under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_130">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, the High Court,
having regard to the facts of the case, has the discretion to
entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But the High Court
has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which is that, if
an effective and efficacious remedy is available, it would, normally,
not exercise its jurisdiction. But the existence of an alternative
remedy does not operate as a bar in at least three contingencies.
The extraordinary remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_131">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India can be invoked, despite the availability of an alternate
statutory remedy, in cases where (a) the writ petitions are filed for
enforcement of any of the fundamental rights, (b) where there has
been a violation of the principles of natural justice, and (c) where
the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction (Whirlpool
Corporation vs. Registrar of Trademarks ).  On the ground that
all the aforesaid conditions are fulfilled in the present case and,
therefore, mere existence of an alternate remedy under <a href="/doc/148809041/" id="a_132">Section 5A</a>
of the 1986 Act is not a bar for entertaining the writ petition under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_133">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the petitioners have
invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.
</p><p id="p_119">      In Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan25, a three
Judge bench of the Supreme Court held that, keeping in view the
provisions and scheme of the 2010 Act, particularly <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_134">Sections 14</a>,
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_135">29</a>, <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_136">30</a> and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_137">38(5)</a>, it could safely be concluded that environmental
issues and matters covered under Schedule  I of the NGT Act,
should be instituted and litigated before the National Green
Tribunal; and such approach may be necessary to avoid the
likelihood of conflict of orders between the High Courts and the
NGT.  The Supreme Court directed that all the matters instituted,
after coming into force of the NGT Act and which are covered under
the provisions of the NGT Act and/or in Schedule I to the NGT Act,
shall stand transferred and can be instituted only before NGT as
this would help in rendering expeditious and specialised justice in
the field of environment to all concerned. In M/s. Bulk Drug
Manufacturers Association v. Central Pollution Control Board,
New Delhi , a Division bench of this Court held that there was a
remedy of an appeal under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_138">Section 28</a> of the Water Act, against the
impugned proceedings which was concerned with the monitoring  
steps on the preventive principles governed by the Air, Water and
the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_139">Environment (Protection) Act</a>s.
</p><p id="p_120"> <a href="/doc/345808/" id="a_140">In Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society Limited v. Union
of India</a> ), the Supreme Court, by an interim order dated
10.3.2014, stayed the operation of paragraphs 40 and 41 of its
decision in Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan25].  
However, the application was withdrawn on 11.8.2014.   (Vellore
Citizens Welfare Forums26). 
</p><p id="p_121">      It is no doubt true that the Supreme Court, in Bhopal Gas
Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan25, has held that, in all matters
falling with the ambit of the National Green Tribunal, it is only the
jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal which can be invoked;
and the petitioners should not be permitted to invoke the
jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_141">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution.   The fact, however, remains that the power of
judicial review, conferred on the High Court under Articles 226 and
227 of the Constitution of India, is part of the basic structure of the
Constitution (<a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_142">L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India</a> ), and
therefore such a power cannot be negated or circumscribed or
obliterated even by a constitutional amendment made in exercise of
the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_143">Article 368</a> of the Constitution, far less
by Legislation  plenary or subordinate.  The judgment in Bhopal
Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan can, therefore, only be 
understood as requiring any person, aggrieved by the order passed
by the State pollution control board, to ordinarily invoke the
jurisdiction of the NGT under the 2010 Act and for the High Court,
while exercising its extra-ordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_144">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution, to bear in mind the existence of such an alternate
remedy while deciding whether or not to exercise discretion under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_145">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to entertain the Writ
Petition.  The observations in the aforesaid judgment cannot be
understood as the statutory provisions of the 1986 Act or the 2010
Act barring exercise of the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_146">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India, as that would fall foul of the seven judge
bench judgment of the Supreme Court in L. Chandra Kumar30. As  
the seven judge bench judgment in L. Chandra Kumar30 was not  
noticed by the three judge bench of the Supreme Court in Bhopal
Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan25, the High Court would be   
bound by the law declared in L. Chandra Kumar30.  We must,  
therefore, express our inability to agree with the submission of the
learned Additional Advocate General, appearing on behalf of the
State of Telangana, that the jurisdiction of this Court, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_147">Article
226</a> of the Constitution of India, is barred because of the existence
of an alternate statutory remedy under the provisions of the 1986
Act read with the provisions of the 2010 Act.
</p><p id="p_122">XI. OTHER CONTENTIONS:     
</p>
<p id="p_123">      It is submitted, on behalf of the petitioners, that the TSPCB
is not a delegated authority under S.O. No. 372(E) dated
10.04.2001 as the said notification expressly confers powers of
delegation only on the SPCBs specified therein, which includes the
Andhra Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (APSPCB); the  
power of the Central Government, to prescribe the maximum area 
of operations for service providers, cannot extend to specifying a
particular area within which a particular service provider should
operate; the TSPCB did not find any deficiencies in the petitioners
units at any point of time; the impugned order was passed to make
room for a newcomer to grab the entire business; as a result, the
petitioners will have to approach Hospitals which are the clients of
other service providers; another facility i.e M/s. Roma Industries
was granted CFE on 16.02.2015 permitting them to collect bio-
medical waste from HCEs, located in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy    
Districts, along with the other three facilities including the
petitioners; though  CFE was granted in favour of M/s. Roma
Industries, long before M/s. Sattva Global Services Pvt. Limited,
the impugned order was passed without considering the same, and 
completely ignoring M/s. Roma Industries; if this fact is taken into
consideration, the entire exercise undertaken by the TSPCB would
be rendered futile; G.O.Ms.No.148 dated 18.12.2000 prohibits
setting up of any new air polluting industry in and around the bio-
technology park; the site was allotted to M/s. Sattva Global
Services Pvt Ltd in express violation of GO Ms. No. 148 dated
18.12.2000, as their processing facility is located in the bio-
technology park; the action of the TSPCB in favouring and
benefiting the M/s. Sattva Global Services Pvt Ltd, to the prejudice
of other facilities, and in violation of government orders, is malice
in law; and the TSPCB should have favourably considered the
objections of the facilities, as is recorded in the impugned order, as
it is in accordance with the CPCB guidelines.
</p><p id="p_124">      As we have held that the impugned order passed by the
TSPCB violates the petitioners fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_148">Article
19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India, it is without jurisdiction, and
is in violation of principles of natural justice, it is wholly
unnecessary for us to examine any of the afore-said contentions.
Suffice it to make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion
on the above-mentioned contentions and they are left open, if need
be, to be agitated in appropriate legal proceedings.
XII. CONCLUSION:  
</p><p id="p_125">      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order of
the TSPCB dated 28.05.2016 is set aside as ultra-vires the 2016
Rules, without jurisdiction, in violation of principles of natural
justice and as it violates the petitioners fundamental rights under
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_149">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.  The Writ Petitions are
allowed.  However, in the circumstances, without costs.
Miscellaneous Petitions, if any pending, are also closed.
