<p id="p_1">K.M. Joseph, J

     Appellant is the third respondent in the writ petition. The

writ petition was filed seeking the following relief :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "(i) Issue a writ of mandamus commanding the
             respondents 1 and 2 to ensure that the third
             respondent is not conducting the pig farm without
             obtaining statutory license/clearance from the first
             respondent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        (ii) to direct the first respondent to take further action
             pursuant to Exhibit P2 invoking <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_1">section 31A</a> of the
             Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1981
             and <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_3">Section 33A</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of
             Pollution) Act</a> 1974."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     2. Briefly put, the case of the writ petitioner is as follows :</blockquote><p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     The      petitioner     is    residing      with     his    family in

Kumaramangalam Village of Idukki District. The 3rd respondent is

running a pig farm without licence or statutory clearance.

Adjacent to the dwelling house of the petitioner, the pig farm is

conducted in a most unscientific manner and causing threat to

the public hygiene. The petitioner along with 59 other residents

of the locality preferred complaint before the 1st and 2nd

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WA.No.1893/13                      2</span>

respondents. The 1st respondent has directed the 3rd respondent

by issuing order dated 16.7.2012 to remove the pig farm and

report within 15 days. Even after the receipt of the order, the 3rd

respondent is continuing his illegal acts. The petitioner furnished

representations before the 1st respondent seeking further action

pursuant to the order issued by the 1st respondent.          The  1st

respondent is bound to give directions to the police as well as the

Electricity Board for the stoppage of the unauthorised pig farm

and stoppage of electricity supply for the running of the farm

invoking <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_5">section 31</a> A of the Air (prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. Being aggrieved by the inaction on the part

of the respondent 1 and 2 the above writ petition is preferred.

</p><p id="p_4">      3. Counter affidavit is filed. There is no reply affidavit.

</p><p id="p_5">      4.  Learned Single Judge found that the appellant is not

entitled to run the piggery without obtaining a proper and valid

licence from the competent authority. The interim order against

the running of the farm was made absolute and the concerned

respondents were directed to take necessary steps to cause the

same to be closed down. It is also make clear that it will not bar

the way of appellant in pursuing the matter before the Tribunal.

Ultimately if the 3rd respondent obtains necessary licence, it will

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WA.No.1893/13                    3</span>

be open for the third respondent to run the piggery thereafter

subject to satisfaction of the conditions to be imposed, both by

the local authority and also by the Pollution Control Board.

Considering the persuasive submission made by the learned

counsel for the appellant, three weeks time was granted to close

down the piggery, failing which it will be for the concerned

respondent to implement the closure.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     5.   We heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned

counsel for the Pollution Control Board and learned counsel for

the writ petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     6. Learned counsel for the appellant would point out that

learned Single Judge has not considered the effect of Ext.R3(b),

which is passed by the Tribunal in the revision filed against the

appellate order of the Panchayat. By R3(b) order the Tribunal has

stayed the decision of the appellate Authority directing closure of

the farm. Apparently it is a case where the appellant is running

the pig farm. Admittedly the appellant does not have a licence.

His case is that application has been filed for licence.

</p><p id="p_8">     7. Further facts which we notice is that when the Pollution

Control Board took steps, the appellant actually sought three

months time to dismantle the farm and to shift vide annexure-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WA.No.1893/13                    4</span>

R1(3) dated 7.11.2012.      According to the writ petitioner, the

application for licence was sent subsequently. As of now, there is

no licence as such for the appellant to continue the pig farm.

Obtaining of licence is a legal necessity. As far as present writ

petition is concerned, it is filed for enforcing the orders under

Pollution Control Authority. Ext.P2 is the direction, which appears

to be appealable. No appeal has been carried so far.

</p><p id="p_9">      Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we only

modify the judgment granting two weeks time from today for

closing down the farm. This will be without prejudice to any

other remedy open to the appellant.
