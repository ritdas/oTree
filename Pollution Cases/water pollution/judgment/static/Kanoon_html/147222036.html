 therefore this Petition is filed.



</p><p id="p_9"> 4.               The   brief   facts   leading   to   file   the 

 Petition, in brief, are as under :- 

  

 (A)              The entire area of the AMC is 138 sq. km. 

 which   is   divided   in   8   zones   and   83   wards. 

 Aurangabad is one of the largest growing cities in 

 the State in as much as the population has nearly 

 doubled from 1991 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2011 as 

 is evident from the census report. The development 

 in   industries   in   pharmaceuticals,   auto,   spare 

 parts etc as well as the urban migration has led 

 to   a   troubling   increase   in   the   solid   waste 

 generation in the city.

 (B)              At   present   the   daily   solid   waste 

 generation is nearly 400 MT out of which 160 MT is 

 domestic waste whereas the rest is commercial and 

 industrially   generated.   Nearly   61%   of   this   waste 

 is   bio-degradable   whereas   the   rest   is   either 

 construction   material,   metal,   plastic   or   glass. 

 These   details   of   the   current   solid   waste 

 generation   of   Aurangabad   Municipal   region   are 

 evident   from   the   statistics   maintained   and 

 recorded in a proforma by the National Solid Waste 

 Association of India (NSWAI) as well as a research 

 paper published in 2016 issue of IOSR Journal of 

 Mechanical and Civil Engineering (IOSR-JMCE).

 Municipal   Solid   Wastes   (Management   and   Handling)

 the entire waste is only being dumped for decades

 (D)              Prior to 1980's the entire solid waste of 

 the municipal region of Aurangabad was dumped at a 

 site   at   City   Naka   behind   Mahatma   Gandhi   Mission 

 College.   However,   after   1980-81,   the   planning 

 authority   shifted   the   dumpyard   to   Gut   No.4   in 

 village   Naregaon   which   was   then   outside   the 

 municipal   limits   of   Aurangabad.   In   less   than   2 

 years, when the Municipal Council was transformed 

 into   a  Corporation   subsuming   within   it  many   sub-

 urban   areas,   the   gram   panchayat   of   Naregaon   was 

 also   subsumed   in   the   Aurangabad   Municipal 

 Corporation.   Immediately   thereafter,   a   decision 

 was   taken   to   shift   the   dumpyard   few   kilometers 

 away   from   the   then   site   at   Gut   No.4,   village 

 Naregaon to take it beyond the city limits of AMC. 

 It   was   then   that   the   50   acre   Government   gairan 

 land situate at Gut No.78 and 79 in Mandki village 

 was   targeted   by   the   AMC   for   dumping   the   entire 

 waste of the city.

 (E)              It has been more than 35 years since the 

 entire waste generated in the municipal limits of 

 the AMC is merely collected by the AMC and dumped 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21"> at the 50 acres land situate at Gut No.78 and 79 </span>

 in village Mandki.

 (F)              The   Rules   of   2000   as   well   as   Rules   of 

 2016 mandate that the disposal of solid waste has 

 to   involve   various   stages   of   collection, 

 segregation,   processing   and   treatment   to   ensure 

 limited impact on environment. It is mandatory for 

 the   planning   authority   to   get   a   site   identified 

 and approved from the Ministry of Environment and 

 Ministry   of   Urban   Development   Department   after 

 clearance   from   the   Maharashtra   Pollution   Control 

 Board to use a site as Solid Waste Land-fill (SWL)

 stating   that   the   Municipal   Commissioner, 

 Aurangabad Municipal Corporation has not obtained

 (H)              The   73rd   and   74th   amendment   to   the 

 Constitution of India introduced a system of local 

 self   governance   and   led   to   decentralisation   of 

 power and trickling down of decision making to the 

 people   and   their   direct   representatives.   Thus   it 

 is   under   the   constitutional   scheme   of   self-

 governance   and   decentralisation   of   power   that 

 institutions   such   as   the   Gram   Panchayat   were 

 constituted   and   empowered   to   collect   taxes   and 

 take   representative   decisions   for   the   people

 to   be   used   for   grazing   of   milking   animals   and 

 livestock of the villagers of Mandki. However, the 

 same   is   being   illegally   used   as   dump-yard   for 

 solid waste generated within the AMC limits, that 

 too without obtaining necessary no-objection from 

 the Gram Panchayat.

<p id="p_16">

 (J)              The present dump-yard is less than 4 kms 

 from   the   Aurangabad   Airport   which   has   daily   3-4 

 flights. The Airport Authority of India Act, 1994, 

 the   <a href="/doc/356807/" id="a_2">Aircraft   Act</a>,   1934   and   Aircraft   Rules   1937

 accumulated   in   vicinity   of   the   Airport   so   as   to 

 prevent hovering of vultures and other scavenging 

 birds or smog from the burning of waste leading to

 (K)              Thus   it   is   clear   that   the   AMC   is 

 illegally dumping entire solid waste generated in

 necessary approvals under the law.

 decades together has become like sedimentary rocks

 fugitive gases. So also, the large amount of waste

 25   years   earlier,   when   it   was   assured   that 

 immediate   action   will   be   taken   by   the   AMC   to 

 initiate   a  processing  and   treatment   plant   at  the 

 writ land. The said initiative was allotted to one 

 Satyam Fertilizer Company run by one Satyanarayan 

 Chandak which constructed a treatment plant at the 

 site to re-use the bio-degradable waste. However, 

 it   was   a   hoax   only   to   grab   the   subsidy   made

 AMC had spent nearly INR 10 Cr to undertake land 

 filling at the writ land wherein 2 large pits of 5 

 acre each were dug out and most of the waste was 

 filled under the ground in plastic. The work was 

 undertaken   by  the  Mule   builders   and  no   procedure 

 for   landfilling   including   segregation   and 

 processing   was   followed   rather   the   entire   waste 

 was   mechanically   dumped   under   the   ground   further 

 affecting the contamination levels of the ground-

 water and soil.

 settlement was reached wherein the AMC had assured 

 that it would shift the dumpyard to alternate site 

 within a period of 3 months. When the same was not 

 completed   even   after   a   period   of   3   months,   the 

 villagers   have   restarted   the   protest   and   blocked 

 the   trucks   and   tractors   from   dumping   the   solid

 municipal limits of Aurangabad is being stored at 

 several places in the city and not dumped in the 

 land   situated   at   Gut   No.   78   and   79   at   village 

 Mandki.   It   is   owing   to   this   situation   that   a 

 petition   was   filed   by  one  Rahul  Kulkarni   seeking 

 direction   from   this   High   Court   that   the   waste 

 shall be dumped at 'appropriate place'.

 court constituted body for Waster Management, IIT

 for   the   site-selection   for   these   activities.   The

 No.3184  of 2015  in Writ  Petition   No.8445  of 2015

 recommend the waste disposal mechanism to be used 

 in   Mira-Bhayandar   Municipal   Corporation,   on   a

 Body,   however,   no   mention   is   made   about   the 

 adequacy   of   funds   with   the   Aurangabad   Municipal 

 Corporation. Similarly, if the funds are received 

 only   by   21.03.2018   and   30.04.2018,   no   real   work 

 for   any   of   the   waste   disposal   efforts   can   be 

 possible   prior   to   that.   With   the   current 

 situation,   it   is   necessary   to   immediately   invite 

 the tenders or enter into private treaty contracts 

 with   reputed   agencies   for   installing/constructing 

 the   decentralized   compost   pits,   bio-gas   plant, 

 decentralised   dry-waste   sorting   and   recycling

 (gg)             With   regards   to   the   time-line   for   the 

 waste disposal activities, which is as follows:  



 [i]              It   is   the   stand   of   the   Aurangabad 

 Municipal   Council   that   transportation   and 

 collection is being done in all wards, whereas the 

 segregation is done in 81 out of 115 wards, then 

 no  question  arises   of 3 months  time  required   for

 mere segregation in all 115 wards.   It is utmost 

 essential   to   start   95-100%   segregation   of   bio-

 degradable   and   non-bio   degradable   waste 

 immediately at war-footing, if necessary by using 

 penal action to ensure 100% segregation so as not 

 to escalate the problem of disposing mixed waste. 



 [ii]             The Rules of 2016 more specifically Rule 

 15   [m],   [q],   [u]   and   [v]   mandate   decentralised 

 composting   so   as   to   ensure   civic   responsibility 

 upon   each   resident   to   segregate   waste,   failing 

 which   they   would   be   immediate   affected   persons. 

 However,   the   affidavit   has   vaguely   stated 

 centralised   /   decentralized   composting   without 

 giving   any   details   of   how   it   will   be 

 decentralised.   There are several vacant lands in 

 each   ward   which   may   be   used   for   composting 

 purposes if it fulfills all the criteria mentioned 

 under the Rules, 2016.

 development   shall   not   take   more   than   3-4   weeks. 

 Thus, this time is also required to be reduced in 

 light   of   the   contravention   of   the   time-line   as 

 suggested   in   the   SWM   Rules,   2016   as   well   as 

 judgment and order of the High Court at Principal 

 seat dated 02.04.2013 in the matter of Vinay Tatke 

 at serial No.10 in the compendium of judgments.  



 (hh)             With   regards   to   scientific   closing   down 

 the dump site at Naregaon, the time of 12 months 

 is not permissible as the assurance to do the same 

 is being given from 1996 onwards whereas the Court 

 direction in that regard in the Writ Petition of 

 2002 was also long passed and continuation of the 

 dump   site   at   Naregaon   after   2004   January   is   in 

 fact   action   in   contempt   of   the   orders   of   this 

 Court.   Since the processing has to be conducted 

 at   a   suitable   site   as   per   Rules   of   2016,   the 

 transportation   of   the   waste   shall   be   started 

 immediately   to   the   scientifically   selected   site 

 and the land fill be dug out and restored to its

 Corporation   subsuming   within   it   many   suburban 

 areas and the Gram Panchayat of Naregaon was also 

 subsumed   in   Aurangabad   Municipal   Corporation. 

 Thereafter   dumpyard   was   shifted   few   Kilometers

 gainful to reproduce herein below Paragraph Nos.4, 

 8 and 12 from the said Judgment, which reads thus:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">            "4.  The   question   that   arises   for   our 
            consideration   is,   whether   the   same   is 
            maintained   in   good   order,   after   the 
            industry itself has become functional. The 
            industry   requiring   "consent   to   operate", 
            can   be   permitted   to   run,   only   if   its 
            primary   effluent   treatment   plant,   is 
            functional.   We,   therefore,   consider   it 
            just  and appropriate,  to direct  the  State 
            Pollution   Control   Boards   concerned,   to 
            issue   notices   to   all   industrial   units, 
            which require "consent to operate", by way 
            of   a   common   advertisement,   requiring   them 
            to   make   their   primary   effluent   treatment 
            plants   fully   operational,   within   three 
            months   from   today.   On   the   expiry   of   the 
            notice   period   of   three   months,   the   State 
            Pollution   Control   Board(s)   concerned   are 
            mandated   to   carry   out   inspections,   to 
            verify,   whether   or   not,   each   industrial 
            unit requiring "consent to operate", has a 
            functional   primary   effluent   treatment 
            plant. Such of the industrial units, which 
            have   not   been   able   to   make   their   primary

            to   disconnect   the   electricity   connection 
            of the defaulting industry. We, therefore, 
            hereby   further   direct   that   in   case   the 
            State   Pollution   Control   Boards   concerned 
            make   a   recommendation   to   the   electrical 
            supply   and   distribution   agency/company 
            concerned,   to   disconnect   electricity 
            supply to an industry, for the reason that 
            its   primary   effluent   treatment   plant   is 
            not   functional,   it   shall   honour   such 
            recommendation,   and   shall   disconnect   the 
            electricity   supply   to   such   defaulting

                  general   public"   in   <a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_35">Article   19   [5]</a>   is   a 
                  comprehensive   expression   comprising 
                  several   issues   which   affect   public 
                  welfare,   public   convenience,   public 
                  order,   health,   morality,   safety,   etc., 
                  all   intended   to   achieve   the   socio-
                  economic   justice   for   people.   The 
                  expression   "life"   enshrined   in   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_36">Article 
                  21</a> of the Constitution does not connote 
                  mere   animal   existence   or   continued 
                  drudgery   through   life.     It   has   a   much 
                  wider   meaning   which   includes   right   to 
                  livelihood,   better   standard   of   living, 
                  hygienic conditions in the workplace and 
                  leisure.   The   right   to   life   with   human 
                  dignity   encompasses   within   its   fold, 
                  some   of   the   finer   facets   of   human 
                  civilisation   which   make   life   worth 
                  living. The expanded connotation of life 
                  would mean the traditional and cultural 
                  heritage of the persons concerned."

 and as a result and as informed by the counsel for 

 the Petitioners that more than 20,00,000 cubic ton 

 solid waste / garbage is lying on the said site as 

 it is.   There is no serious attempt of Respondent 

 No.7 to set up solid waste disposal plant at the 

 site.   The State Government and Urban Development 

 Department   which   has   administrative   control   over 

 the   local   bodies   i.e.   Municipal   Councils   and   the 

 Municipal   Corporation   has   not   taken   effective 

 steps to address serious issue and taken remedial 

 steps   to   compel   respondent   No.   7   to   strictly 

 follow   the   procedure   for   processing   solid   waste 

 dumped   at said  site in  accordance  with  the Rules 

 prescribed in that behalf.   The method adopted by 

 Respondent   No.7   for   dumping   of   solid   waste   / 

 garbage   in   unscientific   manner   at   the   said   site 

 has created numerous problems of health as well as 

 damaged to environment in the vicinity of the said 

 site creating air as well as water pollution.   At 

 no   point   of   time,   at   least   from   the   year   2004

 Order. The prayer is vehemently opposed by learned 

 counsel   appearing   for   the   Petitioners.   In   the 

 light of reasons assigned in the Judgment, we are 

 unable   to   persuade   ourselves   to   accede   to   the 

 prayer   of   the   counsel   appearing   for   Respondent 

 No.7. Hence the prayer stands rejected.
