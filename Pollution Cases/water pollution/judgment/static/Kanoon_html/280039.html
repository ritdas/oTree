Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the  records  and  to  quash  the  enquiry

respondent herein not to entertain any such complaint or matters  relating  to
'pollution' in the State of Tamil Nadu.

        3.      The case  of  the second respondent in WP No.  2570 of 2000 is
that they have given a complaint to the  first  respondent  herein  that  M/s.
Sterlite Industries Limited, Tuticorin, which is a copper smelter plant, emits
sulphur  dioxide which settles down in the vicinity of the factory causing air
pollution, as a result, the people of the vicinity including the employees  of
the second  respondent  are  seriously affected.  The first respondent, on the
complaint of the second respondent felt  it  necessary  to  hold  enquiry  and
issued the impugned notice.  The facts involved in the case is that W.P.  Nos.
15501  to  15503/1996,  5789/1999  and 16861 of 1998 were filed seeking common
relief of quashing the clearance given by  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and
Forest and  Tamil  Nadu  State  Environment  Committee.    When  the said writ
petitions are pending, the first respondent has  issued  the  impugned  notice
dated  07-12-1999  to  the  writ  petitioner  alleging pollution caused by the
Sterlite Industries and for its closure.

        4.      The case of the second respondent in WP No.  9139 of  2000  is
that it has given a complaint to the first respondent stating that M/s.  India
Cements  Limited  is  causing  air pollution which affects the public and also
agricultural activities in the locality.  On the  said  complaint,  the  first
respondent felt it necessary to hold an enquiry and issued the impugned notice
to the  petitioner.   The facts involved in this case is in respect of alleged
violation caused by India Cements Limited, Shankar  Nagar,  Tirunelveli,  writ
Petitions are  filed  in  WP  No.  7822 and 13508 of 1998 seeking direction to
prevent the smoke emanated from the said factory and  to  assess  the  damages
caused to  the  residents  due  to  the  said  pollution.   When the said writ
petitions are pending, the first respondent issued notice dated 17-05-2000  to
the  petitioner  alleging  pollution  caused  by  India Cements Limited and to
assess the alleged damages caused to the residents.

        5.      The  common  grounds  taken  in  the  writ  petitions  by  the
petitioners  is  while  the  writ petitions are pending in respect of the same
subject matter before the Green bench of this Court, the first  respondent  is
prohibited  under  Regulations (g) of Regulations 9 of State Human Rights (TN)
(Procedure) Regulations, 1997.  The enquiry proceedings initiated by the first
respondent would lead to multiplicity of cases and encourage  unnecessary  and
unlimited litigation.  It is not proper for the first respondent Commission to
entertain  the  complaint  against  the  Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in
respect of matters relating to pollution, which falls under the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>,  <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air  Act</a> and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a>.  Any such action by the
first respondent will defeat the very purpose of the aims and objects  of  the
various  Acts,  under  which  the Board functions and exercising its statutory
powers and it is an appellate authority constituted under the respective  Acts
and Rules.    Under  <a href="/doc/47804736/" id="a_5">Section  23</a>  of  the  Environment Act, 1 986, the Central
Government has delegated powers vested in it under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_6">Section 5</a> of the Act to the
Tamil Nadu Government by notification  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and
Forest dated 10-02-1988, in and by the said notification, the State Government
can also issue directions in writing to any persons, officers or any authority
for  closure  or  prohibition  or  regulation  of  any industrial operation or
process and such person shall be bound to comply with such  conditions.    The
Central  Government,  under  the  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment (Protection) Act</a> constituted the
Loss of Ecology (Prevention and payment of  Compensation)  authority  for  the
State of Tamil Nadu, which is vested powers under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of the Environment
Act and also assess loss to the ecology and environment for the affected areas
and  identify  the  individual  and  families  which  suffered  because of the
pollution, while so, if any person is aggrieved in respect of  any  pollution,
they  can  seek  the  remedy  with  the said authority and there is no need to
entertain any complaint by the first respondent.  <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_9">Section 16</a> of Protection  of
Human Rights Act contemplates that persons likely to be prejudicially affected
to be  heard.    If  on  any  such of the enquiry, the Commission considers it
necessary to enquire into the conduct of any person; or is of the opinion that
the reputation of any person is likely to  be  prejudically  affected  by  the
enquiry,  it shall give to the person reasonable opportunity of being heard in
the enquiry and to produce evidence in his defence  provided that nothing  in
this  section  shall apply where the credit of the witness is being impeached.
By virtue of the above provisions, the first respondent ought not have treated
the petitioner as respondent in the case before it,  in  the  absence  of  any
allegation  against  the  petitioner  in  the  complaint  filed  by the second
respondent in respect of either its conduct or reputation.

        6.      The first respondent/Commission has filed its  counter  in  WP
No.   2  570  of  2000  stating  that  the Commission is not aware of the case
pending before this Court; that the  violations  committed  by  third  parties
namely M/s.   Sterlite Industries Limited within a period of one year prior to
26-04-1999; that the subject matter  pending  before  the  Commission  do  not
appear  to  be  the  subject  matter of the case pending before this Court; no
documents were produced by the petitioner to show that the subject  matter  of
the  case  pending  before  this  Court  is  the  subject matter for which the
Commission has ordered notice under <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_10">Section 16</a>  of  the  Protection  of  Human
Rights  Act; that if there is a complaint regarding deprivation of human right
suffered by any person due to pollution or lack of safety measures  and  clean
environment, the Commission is empowered to hold an enquiry on such complaint;
that the averment that the Commission is not a civil Court and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment
(Protection)  Act</a>  does  not  exclude the jurisdiction of the Commission; that
under <a href="/doc/171616267/" id="a_12">Section 10</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_13">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, the Commission  is
empowered  to  regulate  its  own  procedure  read  with  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_14">Section  29</a>  and the
Commission framed its own regulation; that the Regulation 9 (g) provides  that
the  Commission shall dismiss in limine any complaint which are subjudice in a
Court or Tribunal, but the subject matter in dispute are not  subjudice  in  a
Court  or Tribunal; <a href="/doc/122461477/" id="a_15">Section 1</a> <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_16">2</a> (a) of <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_17">Protection of Human Rights Act</a> empowers
the Commission to inquire suo motu or on a  petition  presented  to  it  by  a
victim  or  any person on his behalf, into the complaint of violation of human
rights or abatement thereof or negligence in the prevention of such  violation
by  a public servant; that the petitioner herein is a public servant and there
is negligence on the part of the petitioner herein in the prevention  of  such
violation,  hence,  it  had  rightly proceeded against the petitioner; that no
immunity can be conferred upon the petitioner or its staff; that after receipt
of the complaint from the complainants, the Commission ordered notice  to  the
petitioner  and the petitioner also appeared in person and later filed written
statement; that before considering the case  on  merits,  the  petitioner  has
approached  this  Court; that the Commission has never rejected the objections
of the petitioner and prayed for dismissal of the writ petitions.

        7.      <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_18">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India  guarantees  the  life
with dignity.    This  article worded with simple language, its scope has been
extended to life, liberty, education, health etc., since  it  is  the  subject
matter in  large  number  of  litigation.  It prohibits deprivation of life or
personal liberty except due  process  of  law.    It  essentially  deals  with
personal liberty,  it  is expanded to cover environment and public health.  It
concern about 'life' when deals with environment; and concern about  'liberty'
when deals with human rights.

        8.      Human  right  means  the  rights  relating  to  life, liberty,
equality and dignity of the  individual  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  or
embodied  in  the  International Covenants and enforceable by Courts in India.
Human Rights are those  minimal  rights,  which  every  individual  must  have
against  the  State  or  other  public authority by virtue of his/ her being a
member of the human family, irrespective of  any  other  consideration.    The
first  documentary  used  the  word human right is found in the charter of the
United Nations which was adopted at Sanfransisco on June 25, 1945 and ratified
by majority of signatories in October of that year.  The first  concrete  step
by way of formulating various human rights was taken by United Nations General
Assembly  in  December  1948  by  adopting  the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.  The Universal Declaration has operated merely as statement of  ideals
which  was  not  of the nature of legal binding covenants and no machinery was
provided for its enforcement.  A deficiency  was  removed  by  United  Nations
General  Assembly  by  adopting  two  covenants in December 1956 which are the


covenants of (i) civil and human rights and (ii) economic, social and  secular
rights.  Thereafter,  the two covenants came into force in December 1976.  The
history given supra shows the emergence of human rights.

        9.      In India, the Honourable Supreme Court has  drawn  inspiration
from  the  international  charters with the result, Indian Courts attempted to
interpret statutes to conform to Rules of International Law or  convention  to
which India  is  a  party.   The National Human Rights Commission is an expert
body in itself.  It is also a body sui jurist created under the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_19">Protection  of
Human  Rights  Act</a>,  1993,  for  examining  and  investigating the question of
complaints relating to violation of human rights as also the negligence on the
part of the public servants in preventing such violation Paramjit Vs.    State
of Punjab    AIR  1999  SC  340.    The State Commission is also endowed with
similar powers.

<p id="p_6">        11.     Environment  protection  is  the  watchword  of  the last 20th
Century, however, during the last two decades, there has  been  an  increasing
concern  for  an  awareness  towards  environmental protection at the domestic
level as also international.  The Honourable Supreme Court, while  giving  due
importance  to  the protection of environmental and having regard to the grave
consequences of pollution of  water  and  air  and  need  for  protecting  and
improving   the  natural  environment,  which  construes  to  be  one  of  the
fundamental duties under the statutes had expressed the view in  M.C.    Mehta

Central Government to direct all the educational institutions throughout India
to teach at least one hour in  a  week  lessons  relating  to  protection  and
improvement of  natural environment.  <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_44">Article 48A</a> of the Constitution provides

</p>
<p id="p_53">        India is a party to international covenants  on  civil  and  political
right  and  the  international  covenants  on  economical, social and cultural
rights adopted by the General Assembly of United Nations on 16-12-1966.  After
wide  range  of  discussions,  the  Human  Rights  Commission  Bill  1993  was
introduced in  the  Lok  Sabha  on  14-05-1993.  In view of the urgency of the
matter, the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_72">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, 1993 was promulgated by  President
of India  on  28-09-1993.    The  salient  features  of the bill were that the
Commission will be a fact-finding body with powers  to  conduct  enquiry  into
complaint of  violation  of  human rights.  The Commission will be assisted by
investigating agency of Central and State Governments.    The  Government  may
also constitute one or more special investigating teams.  The State Government
may  set  up  Human  Rights  Court for speedy trial on offences arising out of
violation of human rights and may also specify a Public Prosecutor or  appoint
an Advocate as a Special Public Prosecutor for the purpose of conducting cases
in such Courts.  The Commission may take steps for effective implementation of
the existing  Laws  and  treaties  on  common rights.  The Commission may also
undertake research in the field  of  human  rights  and  measures  to  promote
awareness of human rights among all sections of the society.

Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 are decline in  environmental  quality  has
been  evidenced  by increasing pollution, loss of vegetal cover and biological
diversity, excessive  concentrations  of  harmful  chemicals  in  the  ambient
atmosphere  and  in  food  chains, growing risk of environmental accidents and
threats to life support system.  Although  there  are  existing  laws  dealing
directly  or indirectly with several environmental matters, it is necessary to
have a general legislation for environmental  protection  and  also  to  cover
major  areas  of  environmental  hazards, multiplicity of regulatory agencies,
need for an authority which can assume the lead role of studying, planning and
implementing  long  term  requirements  of  environmental  safety   and   give
protection  to  and  coordinate  a  system  of speedy and adequate response to
emergency situations threatening  the  environment.    In  view  of  the  said
factors,  there  is  an  urgent  need for enactment of a general resolution on
environmental  pollution  which  interalia  should  enable  co-ordination   of
activities   of   various   regulatory  agencies,  creation  of  authority  or
authorities with advocate powers for environmental protection,  regulation  of
discharge  of  environmental  pollutants and handling of hazardous substances,
speedy  response  in  the  event  of  accidents  threatening  environment  and
deterrent  punishment  to  those  who  endanger  human  environment safety and
health.
