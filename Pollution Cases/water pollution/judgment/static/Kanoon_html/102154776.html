<p id="p_1">     The petitioner herein is arrayed as the eighth

accused in Crime No.172/2017 of Vandoor Police Station

for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_1">sections 278</a> and <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_2">269</a> of the

Indian Penal Code and <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_3">sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">43</a> of the Water

</p><p id="p_2">     2.   The allegation of the prosecution is that on

10.08.2017 at about 4 am, the accused 1 to 6, dumped

poultry waste in the property of the sister of the

was the care taker and he permitted the waste to be

dumped for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.   Essentially, from the nature of allegations

custodial interrogation of the petitioner herein does not

appear to be warranted. Hence I am inclined to grant bail

to the petitioner herein on the following conditions:

officer within ten days from today and shall undergo

interrogation. Thereafter, if he is         proposed to be

arrested, he       shall be released on bail on executing a

bond for a sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees forty thousand

only) with two sureties for the like sum each.

</p><p id="p_5">      (ii) He shall appear before the investigating officer

as and when called for.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      (iii) He shall not threaten, coerce or intimidate the

defacto complainant or the witnesses.

</p><p id="p_7">      (iv) He shall not get involved in any other identical

offence.
