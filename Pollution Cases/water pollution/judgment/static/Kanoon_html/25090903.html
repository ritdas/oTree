                  for the State from the Additional District Magistrate &amp;

                  District Land &amp; Land Reforms Officer, Burdwan that

                    Tribunal. The Hon'ble National Green Tribunal has
                    issued show cause notices to all such unauthorized
                    brick fields including the instant brick field for operating
                    their brick klins illegally. The Hon'ble Tribunal is also of
                    the view that those brick fields had breached the
                    statutory provisions of <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>,

                    pay penalty for violation of environmental norms."
