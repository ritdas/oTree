<p id="p_1">1.          This Application is filed under Section 14(1)(2) read

with 15 and 18 of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010,

The Applicant, named above is Doctor by profession.                       He

alleges that that untreated sewage and the Municipal Solid

Waste (MSW) disposal practices adopted by the Municipal

Council of Saswad, District Pune, are causing pollution of



                                                                        Page 2
(J) Appln. No.46 of 2013 (WZ)
 the water flowing through river 'Karha' and its streams and

other water bodies.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.          The Applicant has arrayed Saswad Municipal Council

(hereinafter called "Municipal Council") as Respondert-1.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB for short) as

Respondent-2. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB for

short) as Respondent-3, Collector, Pune is Respondent-4.

Respondents 1, 2 and 3 have filed affidavit. However,

Respondent-4 has not filed any affidavit nor participated in

this proceedings, though Collector is overall in charge of

Municipal Councils as per provision of the Maharashtra

Municipalities' Act and also, is overall responsible to ensure

compliance of MSW rules by Municipal Council.

</p><p id="p_3">3.        Briefly stated, the case of the Applicant is that

Saswad Municipal Council, is not operating existing Sewage

Treatment Plant (STP), nor installing the full-fledged new

sewage treatment plant, to treat large volume of sewage

generated in the city. This untreated sewage goes in to river

'Karha' and its streams directly, thereby causing water

pollution. This river further flows downstream where 'Nazre'

Dam at Jejuri, Taluka Purandar, District Pune, is located

and its water is used for drinking and irrigation purpose in

the surrounding areas. The Applicant also alleges that the

Council is dumping the MSW near the School and Junior

College, causing health hazards. He submits that he had


                                                         Page 3
(J) Appln. No.46 of 2013 (WZ)
 made complaints to the Authorities and the Authorities

have also investigated the complaints and affirmed that the

existing sewage treatment and MSW management are not in

compliance with the Environment Regulations and the

Authorities have also issued Notices, directions, forfeiture of

bank         guarantees         etc.   He   claims   that,   however,     no

substantial improvements or up gradation has been done

by the Council and the Authorities have not done anything

further than issuing paper Notices. He, therefore, prays for

an order directing the Council to stop water pollution and

unscientific disposal of municipal solid waste disposal in

the river or any water body which will cause health hazards.

</p><p id="p_4">4.          The MPCB filed first Affidavit on 13-1-2014, and

mostly corroborated the facts mentioned by the Applicant.

The MPCB submits that they have issued directions to the

Council on 15.2.2013, giving them time of one (1) year for

submission of approval of the sewage treatment plant. The

MPCB also submitted that as the Council has failed to

comply with the directions, the Board has issued Show-

Cause Notice for prosecution under the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 on 3.12.2013. The

MPCB submits that the Council has sought time of 3-4

years for installing the STP.               The MPCB further submits

that the Board has granted authorization under the

Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,


                                                                        Page 4
(J) Appln. No.46 of 2013 (WZ)
 2000 to Saswad Municipal Council to set up and operate

waste processing/waste disposal facility on Survey No.195,

Kumbharvalan, Tal. Purandar, on 14th June, 2013. The

MPCB submits that the Council has failed to comply with

the statutory provisions and also directions of the Board, in

order to comply the provisions of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and the Municipal Solid

Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000.

</p><p id="p_5">5.          The Applicant further filed certain documents on

record to show that the water in Nazre Dam is being used

for drinking purpose in the adjoining villages and there are

increased incidences of water borne diseases in the

surrounding area.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.          The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), i.e.

Respondent No.4, has filed affidavit on 24th January, 2014

and submits that they have visited Saswad Municipal

Council on 14.12.2012, to investigate complaints of the

Applicant. The main observations of the Report are as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      i.       Raw sewage is auctioned and supplied to farmers
               by Saswad Municipal Corporation for irrigation.
               Water quality of raw sewage exceeds the general
               discharge standards for irrigation, with respect to
               Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Chemical
               Oxygen Demand (COD).

       iii.     Sewage treatment plant located near Chaukande
               Aali is non-functional from last 15 years.


</p><p id="p_9">7.       The CPCB further emphasizes that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             1. That MPCB shall enforce the direction issued to

                 Saswad town.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">8.           The Respondent No.1, Chief Officer of Saswad

Municipal Council filed several affidavits, which needs to be

summarized for clarifying their submissions. The Council

informs that total water consumption of the Council is

about 4 MLD, of which, 80% i.e. 3.2 MLD sewage is

generated, that is presently disposed of through Council's

sewerage system, without any treatment. The Council had

constructed STP with an oxidation ditch many years ago for

treatment of sewage; however, same is not in operation


                                                                         Page 6
(J) Appln. No.46 of 2013 (WZ)
 since long and is in dilapidated condition.                  The Council

claims that being Class-C Municipal Council, they do not

have their own sufficient funds to install and operate the

sewage treatment plant and therefore, they have requested

State Govt. for providing funds and expertise for installing

the STP. The Council further states that the Council has

been collecting/ disposing of the MSW at Survey no.88,

which was originally outside the town area, since last thirty

(30) years. However, subsequently development has taken

place         in       the      surrounding    areas.   Considering    this

development, the Council has acquired the land at village

Kumbharvalan, having a total area of 5Ha for the purpose

of      MSW            management.       The    Council    has   obtained

authorization from the MPCB and the work for providing the

MSW treatment and processing plant, is going on.                      Once

this plant is made operational the problem of MSW disposal

will be solved.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.           During interim hearing, noting the existence of old

oxidation ditch, we directed the authorities to inquire

whether such plant can be made operational on priority till

the time full-fledged STP is made operational. Saswad

Municipal Council had approached to the Maharashtra

Jeevan Pradhikaran and accordingly, the Council informed

that technical sanction for project has been obtained from

the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran and tender work


                                                                      Page 7

 already started. The Council also submits that they have

provided           basis        infrastructure      at   the   MSW    plant   at

Kumbharvalan                    and   will    be    setting    up   mechanized

segregation unit for which tender is approved. It is the

submission of the Counsel for Municipal Council that it is

mandatory upon them to obtain technical sanction from the

Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran and also, administrative

approval from Collector, Pune for issuing the work orders

for both these projects.                     Considering this, the Counsel

submits that the MSW plant will be fully operational from

March 2015, though shifting of the waste from existing area

and also, windrow composting on platforms will be initiated

in phrases in between. Similarly, during hearing the

Counsel for Municipal Council, on instructions from the

Chief Officer, submitted that within three (3) months,

oxidation ditch will be fully commissioned and about 60% of

sewage will be taken to oxidation ditch, as informed by the

implementing agency i.e. Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran.

</p><p id="p_12">10.          We have gone through rival pleadings of the

contesting parties and are of the opinion that the following

issues need consideration in the present matter:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           I)        Whether Saswad Municipal Council, is
                     complying         with        the   Environmental
                     Regulations?

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                                                          Page 8
(J) Appln. No.46 of 2013 (WZ)
            II)       What directions can be given to the
                     Respondents for ensuring compliance of
                     Environmental Regulations, through time
                     bound works?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">Re: Issue (I)
</p><p id="p_14">11.         Before entering into the arena of the present case, we

would like to discuss the waste management practices in

the Urban Local Bodies. The Municipal areas generate large

quality of sewage and MSW. With increasing population and

also economic growth, the rate of consumption of water and

generation of waste material is increasing in the urban

areas. This poses a serious challenge for small Municipal

Councils, as an adequate sewage treatment and MSW

processing, are capital intensive, technically challenging

and complex, besides high maintenance activity, which are

generally opposed by the people, who are staying nearby to

the STP and MSW plants. In the instant case too, though

the Council has installed small STP in the form of oxidation

ditch, way long ago, the same could not be operated and

maintained due to various reasons, but primarily due to

negligence             from     the   Council.   However,   with   growing

population and increased quantity of sewage, the problem

of water pollution of rivers, is getting severe. This is further

aggrieved due to the fact that most of the rivers in this

region are not perennial and the population is dependent

either on reservoirs or groundwater for drinking purpose.

</p><p id="p_15">                                                                      Page 9
(J) Appln. No.46 of 2013 (WZ)
 Under these circumstances, pollution of river water is

caused due to untreated sewage and has become a serious

concern.
</p>
<p id="p_16">12.           Admittedly, the Municipal Council does not treat

any of its sewage though they have an existing STP with an

old oxidation ditch, which is lying in dilapidated condition.

The Council also is not treating its MSW in compliance with

the Municipal Solid Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules,

2000 and just dumping its waste at Survey No.88. The

Municipal              Council    is   required   to    provide   necessary

treatment to its sewage in compliance with the provisions of

the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.

Further, the Council is required to provide necessary MSW

treatment and processing facility in compliance with the

Municipal Solid Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules,

2000. Admittedly, the Council is not complying with both

the Regulations and, therefore, it can be concluded that the

Council           is      not    complying   with      the   Environmental

Regulations.               We find that since atleast 2000 the MSW

Rules ought to have been implemented, may be in phase

wise manner, but till filing of the Application, there is no

affirmative action taken by Saswad Municipal Council.

Hence, the issue No.I is answered in the Affirmative.

                                                                      Page 10
(J) Appln. No.46 of 2013 (WZ)
</p><p id="p_17"> 13.         As discussed above, we are aware that the sewage

treatment and MSW management in the small class

Municipalities, is a tricky issue. The report of CPCB on the

status of sewage treatment in India, 2012, highlighted

seriousness of untreated sewage from the Municipal areas.

Even, it has been observed that the Municipalities, which

are more financially sound and that are more autonomous

in functioning, are also in non-compliance zone. In the

instant case too, the compliance levels are absolutely below

the mark. Still however, we are optimistic in the present

case, with the approach and efforts shown by the

Respondent No.1, to take aid and support of other

Governmental organizations, including the Collector, to

tackle this problem. We are however sure; mere optimism

will not work for effective compliance of the Regulations. We

feel that unless a time bound program is outlined, backed

up with judicial order, the compliance will not be achieved

in a realistic manner, by overcoming various procedural and

operational hindrances.             The issue No.II is therefore,

answered in the Affirmative.
