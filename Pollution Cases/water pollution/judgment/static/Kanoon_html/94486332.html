                                   (Judgment)


  1.          Environmental Clearance (EC) granted by the State Level
       Environment Impact Assessment Authority ( "SEIAA" in short)
       of Gujarat State vide          Order No. SEIAA/ GUJ/ EC/
       3(a)/122/2011 dated 23.6.2011        permitting M/S Jindal Saw
       Limited,     the Respondent No.5, for expansion of "Smaller
       Diameter Ductile Iron Pipe" Plant upon land bearing Survey
       Nos.      334/1,335,336/2 &amp; 336/3, of Village Samaghogha,
       Taluka: Mundra, District: Kutch and incidental amendment
       thereto dated 9.8.2011, are assailed in the present Appeal.


  2.          The Appellants, residents of village Samaghogha, situated
       in the proximity of the proposed project site, claim that the
       environment, in which they live and make their living is going
       to be affected seriously as a result of the expansion of the said
       "Ductile Iron Pipe" Plant; and more so as the village
       Samaghogha is substantially polluted due to concentration of
       several    industries   including   manufacturing   unit   of   the
       Respondent No. 5 producing iron pipes,         having come up
       within the limits of Village Samaghogha.


  3.          Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> leading to the impugned Environmental Clearance
       (in Short 'EC') and amendment thereto are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_2">       The Respondent No. 5 established a Blast furnace and Ductile
       Iron (DI) Pipe manufacturing Unit at Village Samaghogha after

</p><p id="p_3">3|Page
     duly    obtaining      various     governmental       and     regulatory
    clearances        including    Environmental      Clearance          dated
    21.10.2004.        DI Pipes were / are manufactured from the
    molten iron metal obtained from Blast furnace.                        The
    respondent No. 5 proposed expansion of the capacity of its
    existing Blast furnace with addition of new blast furnace of
    capacity of 2, 80,000 TPA in the year 2009, and for this
    purpose EC was obtained from the Government of India,
    Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests ( MoEF) on 26.11.2009.
    The Gujarat State Pollution Control Board issued 'consent to
    establish' the said project on 13.4.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           The Respondent No. 5 took a decision to establish a
    separate facility for producing smaller Diameter DI Pipes in its
    existing factory at Samaghogha, and pursuant thereto applied
    for necessary EC therefor to the Respondent No. 4 - State
    Level Expert Appraisal Committee (In short, 'SEAC') it being
    the project falling under category B- Activity No. 3(a)(c) in the
    schedule     of    Environment     Regulation,    2006      issued    vide
    Notification No. S.O 1533( E) dated 14.9.2006 ( in short EC
    Notification).
</p>
<p id="p_5">           In   the   meeting     of   SEAC   held   on    30.9.2010       the
    Application of the Respondent No. 5 for finalisation of Terms of
    Reference (in short 'ToR') for EIA study was considered. ToR
    dated 30.11.2010 were issued and communicated to the
    Respondent No. 5 thereafter. However, the EIA study was
    carried out between October 2010 and December, 2010.
    Based on this EIA study, a draft EIA Report and its summary
    were prepared by the Respondent No. 5 and the same were
    submitted to the Respondent No. 4- SEAC.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           Thereupon, the process of holding a Public Hearing was
    initiated and it was scheduled to be held on 29.3.2011. A
    public notice in that regard, as contemplated under the EC

</p><p id="p_7">4|Page
        Notification was published in issues dated 27.2.2011 and
       2.3.2011 of 'Divya Bhasker' - a daily newspaper in vernacular
       language (Gujarati) and 'The Times of India' - a daily national
       newspaper in English, respectively. As scheduled the Public
       Hearing was held in the school- O.P. Jindal Vidhya Niketan
       School run by the Respondent No. 5 at village Samaghogha.
       Members of public gathered, numbering 275 persons, were
       heard and responded to by the project proponent in the
       presence of Additional District Magistrate and Additional
       District Collector, District Kutch and the Regional Officer of
       Gujarat     Pollution   Control   Board,    Bhuj.   Ultimately,   on
       appraisal of the final EIA Report and outcome of the Public
       Consultations the SEAC recommended grant of Environmental
       Clearance on certain terms and conditions to the said project,
       which resulted in grant of impugned Environmental Clearance
       by the SEIAA.
</p>
<p id="p_8">  4.        According to the Appellants, the entire process of grant of
       Environmental Clearance is tainted for the following reasons:
</p><p id="p_9">       1. Construction of the project was started prior to the grant of
         Environmental Clearance.
</p><p id="p_10">       2. ToR were issued on 30.11.2010.          However, the EIA study
         was done between October 2010 and December, 2010 prior
         to the communication of ToR.
</p><p id="p_11">       3. Notice of Public Hearing was not adequate in terms of the
         mandate of EC Regulation.
</p><p id="p_12">       4. Summary of EIA Report was not supplied in vernacular
         language in stipulated time.
</p><p id="p_13">       5. Summary of EIA Report was inadequate and not as required
         by the EC Regulation.
</p><p id="p_14">       6. Public hearing was not held in neutral venue so as to
         permit free, fair and open participation of the members of
         public.
</p><p id="p_15">       7. Minutes of meeting were not prepared or read over to the
         participants as required.
</p>
<p id="p_16">5|Page
</p><p id="p_17">        8. There was no detailed scrutiny of final EIA Report and
         outcome of Public consultation for the purpose of appraisal
         as required under the said Regulation and the grant of EC
         was recommended mechanically by the SEAC; in violation
         of the mandate of the EIA Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_18">  5.         The Respondent No. 4 -SEAC Gujarat, resisted the
       appeal with an affidavit in reply dated 6.11.2012 and placed
       before us its version of events leading to the grant of EC in
       question.
</p>

       Kumar Varma for the Respondent No. 5 submitted that the
       entire proceedings of the Public Hearing were videographed
       and nothing more needs to be scrutinised to ascertain the
       manner in which such proceedings of               Public Consultation
       were held. He further submitted that the Respondent No. 5
       had commenced the construction activities for setting up of
       the     new blast furnace within the available open area of its
       factory premises at Village Samagogha in a bid to expand steel
       plant on the strength of EC granted dated 26.11.2009 and
       "Consent to Establish" dated 13.4.2010; and no sooner it was
       objected to vide notice dated 18.3.2011 issued under Sec.
       33(A) of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
       1974, the Respondent No. 5 had stopped the said construction
       activities and given an undertaking dated 19.3.2011 to abide
       by such directions to the Respondent No. 4; and SEAC had
       appraised the project only after the construction work was
       stopped and given green signal to the grant of EC to the
       project upon due consideration of the final EIA Report and
       outcome of Public Consultation.
</p>
<p id="p_32">               Ld. Adv. Verma          for the Respondent No. 5      further
       pointed out that the Office Memorandum dated 19.8.2010
       issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt. of
       India        restrained   all   the   projects   undertaken   without
       Environmental Clearance from going on with the construction
       activity except fencing of the site to protect it from getting
       encroached and construction of temporary sheds for the
       guard(s).
</p>
<p id="p_33">7|Page
          MoEF is vested with sufficient discretion to suspend or
    revoke the Terms of Reference (ToR) and also to invoke the
    Penal provisions. He further pointed out that the MoEF has
    not exercised the discretion so vested to suspend or revoke the
    proceedings for grant of Environmental Clearance but has
    opted for invoking penal provisions for initiation of prosecution
    of the Project Proponent for the lapses committed by it.
</p>
<p id="p_34">         As regards to carrying out the EIA study prior to the
    communication of TOR, Learned Advocate for the Respondent
    No. 5 invited our attention to the minutes of the meeting in
    which the TOR were settled. He pointed out that the Project
    Proponent was present at the time of settlement of ToR and as
    such had the knowledge about the TOR on the basis of which
    EIA study was carried out before the ToR were issued or
    officially communicated. He submitted that there is nothing to
    point out that the EIA study thus carried out was contrary to
    Terms of Reference (ToR) as settled in the said meeting or that
    it did not meet the expectation for which such study is
    designed.
</p>
<p id="p_35">         Learned Advocate for the Respondent No. 5 invited our
    attention to the Public Notice on Public Hearing published in
    Gujarati Daily Newspaper "Divya Bhasker" issue dated 27.2.11
    vide Annexure-5 in Compilation II of the Appeal, and
    submitted that notice of Public Hearing was published in
    Vernacular language in time for the benefit of the public at
    large, particularly the local people, in    as much as it was
    adequate in terms of the mandate of Environment Clearance
    Regulations/EIA Notification. Adverting to Annexure R-8 &amp; R-
    9 Annexed to the reply filed by the Respondent No.5- the copy
    of the letter dated 1.3.2011 of Gujarat State Pollution Control
    Board (GSPCB) issued by its Regional Office and the
    acknowledgments obtained by Gujarat State Pollution Control
    Board (GSPCB) acknowledging the receipt of summary of EIA
    report, he submitted that the exception taken on the ground of

</p><p id="p_36">8|Page
       non- supply of summary of EIA report in Vernacular language
      is without any merit.
</p>
<p id="p_37">           Further inviting our attention to the minutes of Public
      Hearing the Learned Advocate for the Respondent No. 5
      submitted that all the issues raised in Public Hearing were
      suitably addressed and the same were duly considered by the
      SEAC before recommending the grant of EC. He submits that
      there is no violation of EIA Notification while granting the EC
      in question and the Appeal deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_38">           Controversies thus raised calls for answering the
      following points:
</p>
<p id="p_39">  1      Whether the construction of the project was started prior to
         the granting of Environmental Clearance in question.
  2      Whether summary of EIA report was not furnished in
         Vernacular Language.
</p><p id="p_40">  3      Whether summary of EIA report was inadequate and not as
         required by the Environmental Clearance Regulations /EIA
         Notification.
</p><p id="p_41">  4      Whether the Public Hearing was not held in neutral venue.
  5      Whether there is any contravention of the Environmental
         Clearance Regulations /EIA Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_42">  6      Whether any such contravention would vitiate the grant of
         Environmental Clearance in question.
</p>
<p id="p_43">  Reasons

           Point No. 1.       Admittedly,   the        Respondent      No.   5,
           namely the Project Proponent, had commenced the
           construction activity for setting up of new Blast Furnace
           within the available open area of its factory premises at
           Village   Samaghogha.      Reply       to    the   Appeal     dated
           19.1.2012 filed by the Respondent No. 5 reveals that it
           had commenced the said construction activity for setting
           up of the new Blast Furnace in a bid to expand steel


</p><p id="p_44">9|Page
                making plant on the strength of EC dated 26.11.2009
               and during the continuance of the said construction
               activity decision was taken to expand its DI Pipe Plant
               within the said area which had resulted in making of
               Application for obtaining necessary EC in question.
               Respondent No. 5 further averred that since there were
               certain common technical features between the Steel
               making expansion plant and the DI Pipe expansion plant,
               construction   continued    for   some    time    after    the
               Application for grant of Environmental Clearance for the
               DI Pipe Plant i.e. Environmental Clearance in question
               was made. However such construction was stopped and
               undertaking dated 19.3.2011 not to undertake any
               excavation and foundation work relating to the plant
               expansion      project     was    given      on    receiving
               notice/directions dated 18.3.2011 issued under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_2">section
               33(a)</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution)
               Act</a>, 1974, by the Respondent No. 4.
</p>
<p id="p_45">               Photographs     in   Annexure-4   to   the   Appeal       show
               excavation and foundation work and nothing beyond it.
               However, the Respondent No. 5 has not clarified in its
               Affidavit in   reply     as to what were those common
               technical features between the Steel making expansion
               plant and DI expansion Plant thereby clearly indicating
               the works involving such common technical features
               undertaken by it . As a result the point needs to be
               answered affirmatively.
</p>
<p id="p_46">               Point No. 2.    Perusal of the copy of the letter dated
               1.3.2011 of Gujarat State Pollution Control Board and
               the acknowledgment obtained by GSPCB at Annexure
               R-8 &amp; R-9 respectively to the reply filed by the
               Respondent No. 5 , irrefutably and vividly reveals delivery
               of draft and summary of EIA report ( in English and
               Gujarati) to the local bodies /Authorities namely the

                District Collector, District Development Officer, General
               Manager of District Industrial Centre, District, Kutch.
               Chief Conservator of Forest, Taluka Development Officer,
               Taluka Mundra District, Kutch as well as to the local
               Gram Panchayat between 3.3.2011 and 16.3.2011.
               Pertinently no grievance was raised by anybody in that
               regard in time prior to filing of the present Appeal much
               less at or before the Public Hearing in question.
               Grievance in that regard is, therefore, a far cry from the
               truth. The point is therefore answered negatively.
</p>
<p id="p_47">               Point No. 3.     Public consultation is one of the stages
               prescribed in the Environmental Clearance Regulations
               in the process of granting EC. It is the process by which
               concerns of local affected persons and others who have a
               plausible stake in the environmental impacts of the
               project or activity are ascertained with a view to taking
               into account all the material concerns in the project or
               activity design as appropriate. To facilitate effective
               Public Consultation summary EIA Report both in English
               and    Vernacular         language   are   prepared.   The
               Environmental Clearance Regulations, 2006 at para 7,
               stage-3 Public consultation --- sub para (vi)refer to
               inviting of responses from other concerned persons by
               placing on the website of the        concerned Regulatory
               Authority the summary EIA report prepared in the format
               given in Appendix (III-A) along with a copy of the
               Application in the prescribed form. Appendix (III) A
               describes the contents of summary EIA Assessment in

</p>
<p id="p_55">               Environmental Clearance Regulations, 2006 casts duty
        on     the   Project   Proponent    to    address   all    the    material
        environmental concerns. Thus, the focal point of EIA report is
        anticipated environmental impact and mitigation measures.
        We find in summary EIA report reference to assessment of air
        pollution, noise pollution, water pollution and land pollution
        at Para No. 8(11)(1) to 8(11)(4)and mitigation measures to be
        adopted by the Project Proponent. Except a statement nothing
        has been pointed out by the Appellant to show how this EIA
        report was inadequate so as to thwart public response as
        contemplated in EC Regulations. The point is, therefore,
        answered negatively.
</p>
<p id="p_56">        Point No. 4.             Admittedly, the Public Hearing in the
        present case was held in the premises of the O. P. Jindal
        Vidhya Niketan school run by the Respondent No. 5 company
        in Village Samaghogha. According to the Learned Counsel for
        the Appellant the venue of holding of Public Hearing was not a
        neutral one the same being within the premises of the school
        run by the Respondent No. 5 company and, therefore, such
        venue was not conducive to free, fair and open participation of
        the locals as well as other persons who were likely to be
        affected by the proposed project. In this context our attention
        was invited to para 7 stage-3 (iii) of the Environmental
        Clearance Regulations, 2006, by the Learned Counsel for the
        Respondent No. 5. According to him, there was no legal
        impediment for holding Public Hearing in the premises under


13 | P a g e
         the control of Project Proponent. Environmental Clearance
        Regulation, 2006 mandates at the said provision as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_57">               The Public Hearing at 'or in close proximity to' the site(s)
        in all cases shall be conducted by the SPCB or the UT
        Pollution    Control Committee       concerned in the specified
        manner and forward the proceedings             to the Regulatory
        Authority concerned within 45 days of request to the effect
        from the Applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_58">               Nowhere Environmental Clearance Regulations, 2006
        abjures the use of premises in control of the Project Proponent
        but in fact chooses the very site of the project which is in
        control of the Project Proponent, for holding a Public Hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_59">               Answer to the question as to why this is so can be easily
        found in the purpose of holding a Public Hearing. A Public
        Hearing is one of the components of Public consultation and is
        the process by which concerns of local affected persons who
        are likely to suffer due to the environmental impact of project
        or activity, are ascertained. Naturally, therefore it is expected
        to hold a public Hearing at or in close proximity to the project
        site in order to ensure and facilitate wide participation of the
        Public particularly those who are likely to be affected by the
        project, being in close proximity. Needless to say that the
        environmental impact of any project or activity is likely to be
        felt or perceived immediately and pronouncedly by the local
        persons living in close proximity of the project site and       as
        such they richly deserve participation in Public Consultation
        with ease. As a corollary to the mandate of the Environmental
        Clearance Regulation, 2006 as aforesaid it can be seen that
        holding of Public Hearing at the project site implies holding of
        Public Hearing at a place under the control of the Project
        Proponent. Legally, therefore there can be no sustainable legal
        exception to holding of      a Public Hearing at the premises
        controlled by the Project Proponent more so when there is no
        case that the Public Hearing was not held in close proximity
14 | P a g e
         to the project and    as such   it posed inconvenience to the
        members of the public particularly the local persons in
        attending the proceedings of Public consultation

               Perusal of the record, both documentary and video
        graphic, reveals that the Public Hearing was held in the
        presence of Additional District Magistrate and Additional
        District Collector, District Kutch, the Regional Officer of PCB,
        Bhuj and was attended by 275 persons from various villages
        including the village Samaghogha situated around the said
        site. It is clearly demonstrated that the Members of the Public
        were provided with the platform for free, fair and open
        participation at the said venue. Nothing was pointed from the
        record that anything was amiss in holding of Public Hearing at
        the said venue which could be construed as violation of
        Environmental Clearance Regulations 2006. The point is,
        therefore, answered is negatively.
</p>
<p id="p_60">        Point No. 5          Environmental Clearance Regulations is
        essentially the product of exercise of power conferred by sub-
        section (1) and Clause (v) of sub Section (2) of Section (3)
        <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 read with Clause (d) of sub
        Rule (3) of Rule (5) of the Environment(Protection) Rules, 1986.
        Thus, it is a piece of delegated Legislation stipulating the
        requirements of prior EC from the Central Government as the
        case may be by SEIAA duly constituted by the Central
        Government under the said Act, for construction of new
        projects or activities or the expansion or modernization of
        existing projects or activities listed in the Schedule there
        under, anywhere in India. Besides categorization of the
        projects or activities based on the spatial   extent of potential
        impacts on human health and natural and manmade
        resources and classifying authorities     empowered to grant
        prior EC, the said regulations charter a course to be adopted
        in the process of granting EC. Substantially, it governs the
        matters of procedure relating to grant or rejection of prior EC.
</p>
<p id="p_61">15 | P a g e
                 Keeping this in mind one has to apply the standards
        stipulated therein to evaluate the process of grant of EC.
        Evidently a public notice in respect of Public Hearing
        scheduled to be held on 29.3.2011 was duly published in
        issues dated 27.2.2011 and 2.3.2011 of "Divya Baskar" daily
        newspaper in vernacular language (Gujarati) and the "Times of
        India     "daily   newspaper   in   English   respectively.    The
        Respondent No. 5 have categorically averred that requisite
        numbers of hard and soft copies of EIA report including the
        summary of EIA report in English and in Gujarati were
        communicated after scoping as per Clause- 2.2, Appendix 4 of
        EC Regulations/EIA Notification, 2006. It is also revealed that
        the Respondent No. 4 had forwarded a copy of EIA Report and
        summary EIA Report in English and in Gujarati to the local
        authorities with request to display the same and to make them
        available to the public at large. It is also evident that the
        Respondent No. 4 had also directly supplied the summary of
        EIA Report to as many as 16 Gram Panchayats in the vicinity.
        The Respondent No. 5 averred that the EIA and its summary
        were available on the website of Respondent No. 4 where
        anybody could get a copy of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_62">                If one looks into the Appendix -IV to the Environmental
        Clearance Regulations, 2006 it is not difficult to find that the
        Applicant     seeking EC is required to forward to the SPCB a
        letter of request to arrange the Public Hearing along with ten
        hard copies and equivalent numbers of soft copies of draft EIA
        Report including the summary of EIA Report in English and
        in state/Local Language and to make arrangements to forward
        such copies that is one hard and one soft of the draft EIA
        Report along with summary EIA Report          to the authorities
        namely District Collector/      Magistrates/Zilla   Parishad    or
        Municipal Corporation, Panchayat Union, District Industries
        Office, Urban Local Bodies and Concerned Regional Officer of
        MoEF, who are obliged to make available the draft EIA Report


16 | P a g e
         for inspection electronically or otherwise to the public during
        normal office hours. The Concerned SPCB is also required to
        make similar arrangement for giving publicity about the
        project in question. Pertinently, no outer limit of time is given
        for such publicity prescribed under sub Para 2.2 Appendix-IV
        of Environmental Clearance Regulations, 2006. However, sub
        Para 3.1 of the said Appendix speaks       of the advertising of
        the notice of Public Hearing in news media          and further
        stipulates a minimum notice period of 30 days to the public
        for furnishing their responses. Pertinently, this concerns
        Public Hearing which is one of the component of the Public
        consultation process devised to ascertain concerns of local
        affected persons.
</p>
<p id="p_63">               Undoubtedly, in the instant case, the object of giving
        clear notice of 30 days of the proposed Public Hearing to the
        local persons could be said to have been very well achieved
        by publication of the notice in State/ Vernacular language i.e.
        Gujarati     Daily News Paper    "Divya Bhaskar" issue     dated
        27.2.2011. This can also be discovered from the material
        placed before us i.e. the responses received in Gujarati as well
        as in English from the locals and others as well as responses
        to the publication of draft EIA Report electronically. A little
        delay in publication of the notice of Public Hearing in the 'The
        Times of India' has made any difference with the process of
        ascertaining the concerns of local affected persons.
</p>
<p id="p_64">               The Respondent No. 5 has not disputed the fact of
        having     commenced EIA study in October, 2010 and having
        completed it in December, 2010. Thus, the EIA study was
        commenced prior to final communication of ToR dated
        30.11.2010. Reading of Affidavit in reply of Respondent No. 4
        dated 6.11.2012 and the Annexures thereto clearly reveals
        that the Respondent No. 5 (Project Proponent) was present in
        the meeting dated 30.9.2010 of State Level Expert Appraisal
        Committee( for short 'SEAC') when the issue of ToR was

17 | P a g e
         deliberated upon and ToR dated 30.11.2010 were duly settled.
        Thus the Respondent No. 5 (Project Proponent) did gather the
        knowledge of the ToR and, therefore, could embark upon the
        EIA study in October, 2010 Official Communication of ToR
        vide letter dated 30.11.2011 of State Level Expert Appraisal
        Committee       therefore has worth only    of creating official
        record of the communication of the ToR and nothing more.
        Commencement of EIA study in October, 2010 therefore
        cannot be regarded contravention of Environmental Clearance
        Regulations by embarking upon the        EIA study before the
        communication of ToR.
</p>
<p id="p_65">               So far as the commencement of the construction of
        project is concerned the Respondent No. 5 did over step the
        limitation imposed by EC Regulations.      However it is also a
        fact that the construction activity was undertaken and was
        halted, on an undertaking given to abide by the directions
        issued by the Respondent No. 4 SEAC. Cognizance          of this
        fact was taken by the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee
        in its meeting dated 9.5.2011 vide minutes of the meeting at
        Annexure -2 to the Affidavit in the reply of Respondent No. 4
        (SEAC) dated 6.11.2012. The Affidavit of the Respondent No. 4
        further reveals that the Gujarat State Pollution Control
        Board's officials had visited the project site on 19.5.2011 and
        noticed that the excavation and foundation work was stopped
        by the Project Proponent and no construction equipment or
        activity was seen at the site vide Annexure R-3 Affidavit in
        reply of the Respondent No. 4, SEAC.
</p>
<p id="p_66">               Reading of Annexure R-3 to the Affidavit in reply of the
        Respondent No. 4 (SEAC) reveals that the SEAC in its 103rd
        meeting dated 31.5.2011 did examine whether the proposed
        project or activity was appropriately categorized or not,
        examine its competence vis. a. vis the categorization of project
        or activities undertaken as per the Schedule of the said

                 Ultimate para of the minutes of the SEAC dated
        31.5.2011 which is       quoted hereunder brings forth the mind
        of the members of the SEAC in recommending the case for EC.
</p>
<p id="p_75">               "During the meeting, various issues raised during the
        public hearing were discussed at length. The main concerns
        during the public hearing were regarding starting construction
        work before prior environmental clearance, depriving farmers
        from their right to use existing cart track passing in between
        the proposed survey numbers, ground water extraction by the
        company, local employment, noise pollution etc. The project
        proponent explained that earlier they had planned to set up
        Steel Melting Shop at the place where the new DI Pipe Plant is
        proposed. He        quoted   that they obtained environmental
        clearance from the MoEF on 26/11/2009 for the Steel Melting
        Shop and they were to transfer molten metal from the new
        Mini Blast Furnace (2,80,000 TPA) to the Steel Melting Shop,
        which was to set up on other side of the existing cart track. He
        added that due to the market considerations, they have now
        planned to set up DI Pipe Plant at the same place where Steel
        Melting Shop was to be set up but in either case the molten
        metal had to be transferred from the new Mini Blast Furnace
        (2,80,000 TPA) and hence the existing cart road has to be

19 | P a g e
         closed in view of safety of the farmers passing through the
        track. The project proponent submitted (i) Extracts from the
        minutes of meeting of Board of Directors held on 12th May,
        2011 and (ii) Notarized undertaking stating that they have
        provided an alternate new track for free and safe movement of
        people and it is hardly 400m from the existing track, new
        proposed track land will be dedicated for use of villagers and
        the company will not claim the ownership of the cart track
        land in future and they shall abide by the decision of the
        Court. However, the committee insisted the project proponent
        to get permission from the Mamlatdar, Mundra for the new
        proposed track. While asking by the committee, the project
        proponent clarified that due to the proposed expansion,
        production of hot metal/ pig iron shall not exceed 5,80,000
        TPA    for   which   EC     was   obtained   from   the   MoEF   on
        26/11/2009. The committee felt that one of the reasons for
        agitation during the public hearing was failure of the company
        to fulfill the commitments made during the earlier public
        hearing and hence asked the project proponent to submit the
        CSR action plan for the year 2011-12 including the details on
        the proposed activities along with the budget allocation for the
        same. After deliberation on various issues, the committee
        decided to recommend the case to SEIAA for grant of
        environmental clearance after submission of following:
</p>
<p id="p_76">        1). Permission from the Mamlatdar, Mundra allowing use of
        the alternate cart track.
</p>
<p id="p_77">        2). Detailed CSR Action Plan for the year 2011-2012 including
        the details on the proposed activities along with the budget

<p id="p_78">               Thus, the minutes of the meeting of the SEAC clearly
        reveal that SEAC had not recommended the grant of EC
        mechanically and had applied its mind to the final EIA report
        and outcome of Public consultation for the purpose of
        appraisal as required under the said EC Regulations. Nothing
20 | P a g e
         has been pointed that the Minutes of the meeting were not
        recorded as per the EC Regulations. The point is, therefore,
        answered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_79">        Point No. 6           Before arriving at the final conclusion it
        is necessary to consider the judgments cited on behalf of the
        Applicant. In T. Mohana Rao's Case this Tribunal, while
        allowing the Appeal, concluded that the public was deprived of
        the relevant information which formed the basis of grant of EC
        and , therefore , directed the MoEF to revisit EIA report from
        the stage of Public Hearing. It appears that the EIA study was
        carried out earlier to the settlement of ToR and the EIA did not
        contain the finding of the special studies thereby giving rise to
        the cloud of suspicion with regard to due application of mind
        by the EAC. It further appears that EIA Report was not
        available to anyone till the time of Public Hearing. Facts in the
        present case do differ from the facts of T. Mohana Rao's case
        as discussed above. In M/s Vedenta Aluminum Ltd. case the
        Hon'ble High Court of Orissa declined to reverse the decision
        of the MoEF to withdraw the TOR and consequently the Public
        Hearing organized in the process of grant of EC for expansion
        of Aluminum refinery on the ground that the Project
        Proponent had completed 50 to 55 per cent construction of the
        project prior to grant of EC. In the said case due opportunity
        was given to the Project Proponent by the MoEF to explain its
        conduct and only there after the impugned decision to
        withdraw the ToR was taken.          The Hon'ble High Court of
        Orissa found justification in MoEF's view to hold the process
        for Environmental Clearance de novo        and at Para 36 of its
        judgment made passing reference to settled legal proposition
        based on legal maxim "Expressio Uniusest exclusion alteris."
        What weighed most in the mind of Hon'ble High Court            was
        the justifiable view of the MoEF to hold process of EC de novo
        vis. a. vis 50 to 55 % construction of the project prior to grant of
        EC.

        as the expression "shall" in said provision primarily indicates
        mandatory compliance and this is more so considering
        expropriatory character, nature    and the design of the said
        legal provisions. In Humanity and Another Case the Hon'ble

<p id="p_83">               In Utkarsh Mandal's case the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi
        noticed flaw in the Public Hearing and proceeded to set aside
        the Environmental Clearance granted to two groups of mines
        and remanded the issue to the MoEF for fresh consideration of
        each of the objections raised at the Public Hearing and to
        render reasoned decision thereon. It appears that as many as
        six Public Hearings were scheduled in regard to the various
        projects including the mining projects in question by the SPCB
        on the same date, time and the venue and an             executive
        summary was received by the Gram Panchayat of Village

         Report and its summary was published in Indian Express
        dated 18.12.2006. All this the Hon'ble High Court observed

        reduced the whole exercise to empty formality.

</p>
<p id="p_85">               Taking cite from the aforesaid Judgments, the nature,
        character    and     design     of     the     Environmental        Clearance
        Regulations need to be examined.                 From the form and its
        content, Environmental Clearance Regulations can be seen as
        set rules governing the procedure of the grant or rejection of
        Environmental        Clearance       to   the    projects     and    activities
        enumerated therein. It has been so designed to dispense
        justice to the local affected persons, public at large and the
        Project   Proponent      keeping          in    mind    all   the    material
        Environmental concerns.              It is therefore, a tool to dispense
        justice and not the justice itself. Such being the position of the
        procedure and methodology expressed therein, the use of
        mandatory words therein may be construed as directory
        keeping in mind the course of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_86">               From the facts it is disclosed before us that there is
        nothing to demonstrate or suggest that any lapse in strict
        compliance of the procedure prescribed in Environmental
        Clearance Regulations has in any way prejudicially affected
        the    course   of    justice    keeping        in     mind   the    material
        Environmental Concern. It is nobody's case that draft EIA
        report and its summary were not made available when asked
        for except saying that the same were received on 16.3.2011.
        Making available things and receiving it have different
        connotations. The word 'available' means able to be used or
        obtained whereas the word "receipt" has a connotation                       as
23 | P a g e
         what has been obtained. There is nothing before us to show
        that anyone was disabled for any reason to use or obtain draft
        EIA report or its summary after publication of notice of Public
        Hearing in Vernacular Daily Divya Bhaskar issue dated
        27.2.2011. The amount of response i.e. placed before us is
        sufficient to demonstrate the publicity which was given to the
        draft EIA Report and its summary in Vernacular. No prejudice
        is seen to have been caused to the course of justice in the
        present case.

<p id="p_87">               Perusal of the recommendation made by SEAC at
        Annexure R-4 to the affidavit reply of the Respondent No. 4
        SEAC     reveals      conditions      imposed     for      grant       of     such
        Environmental      Clearance.         No   irrationality    or       procedural
        impropriety has been pointed out in making of such
        recommendations. The recommendations are exhaustive and
        the conditions stipulated, cover not only the general concerns
        of the locals but also govern the environmental parameters
        like water, air, noise, solid/ hazardous waste and green belt.
        Amendment to the Environmental Clearance done at later
        stage is incidental one made only to correct the description of
        the project. The point is, therefore, answered negatively.
</p>
<p id="p_88">        9.     Nevertheless, the Project Proponent did over step the
        limitation    imposed        by    the      Environmental            Clearance
        Regulations by starting        with the construction before grant of
        Environmental Clearance. Regarding construction activities
        undertaken prior to the grant of EC, we do not agree with the
        contention    of   the      Project    Proponent        that     the        alleged
        construction work relates to the grant of earlier EC. It may not
        be proper to accept such contention in view of the fact that the
        Project Proponent, as revealed from the record, has been in the
        habit of flouting the procedure of Law by undertaking
        construction work during 2004 before the relevant EC was
        granted. Thus, the Respondent No. 5 (Project Proponent) was
        not    the   novice    to    procedure      prescribed         for    grant      of

24 | P a g e
         Environmental Clearance in as much as it had obtained
        Environmental Clearance before the Environmental Clearance
        in question.
</p>
<p id="p_89">        10. It is also necessary to prescribe a safeguard for checking
        indiscriminate use of groundwater. The Gujarat State Pollution
        Control Board is directed to monitor the ground water levels
        and TDS of the water from bore wells within the premises of
        the Project Proponent every six months and also to take
        measures to check the depletion of ground water levels or TDS
        levels from going beyond the dangerous level.
</p>
<p id="p_90">        11. Considering the fact that previously the project was
        subjected to grant of EC before expansion and that even
        though there was no EC issued by the MoEF yet the Project
        Proponent had started the construction activity, such conduct
        of the Project Proponent shows that he has no sense of
        impunity.   The construction work had been started because
        the Project Proponent perhaps believed that the EC will be
        granted.    The Project Proponent started such construction
        activity in 2004 also. It has been again repeated when the EC
        was sought in 2011.       It is but natural to assume that the
        Project Proponent has no compunction in repeating the same
        kind   of   dereliction   and   proceeded   to   undertake   the
        construction activity although prior EC was not granted for
        expansion of the project. The conduct of the Project Proponent
        is, therefore, reprehensible. The tendency to proceed with the
        project activity in spite of absence of the EC order has to be
        dealt with stern hand.
</p>
<p id="p_91">        12. In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the
        Project Proponent (Respondent No. 5) shall be directed to
        deposit Rs. 1,00,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore only) with this
        Tribunal which may be remitted to Environment Relief Fund.
        The Registry shall ascertain to whom the fund may be
        transferred and shall do accordingly.

        NGT within four (4) weeks and the same shall be disbursed as

        shall make six-monthly monitoring of Ground Water Level and
        TDS content of ground water within the premises of the project
        and take necessary steps to check the water level and TDS
        content before reaching dangerous level.
