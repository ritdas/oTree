Hon'ble Mr. Justice M. Chockalingam,
Judicial Member




       In pursuance of an order of transfer of the W.P.No. 19006 of 2012 made by

the Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh, this application was taken on file.

</p><p id="p_3">       2. This application challenges an order of the Appellate Authority under Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 of the State of Andhra Pradesh ( for short 'Appellate Authority')

made in Appeal No. 6 of 2010 filed by respondent No. 1 under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_3">section 28</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_5">section 31</a> of                Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 whereby an order of the Andhra

Pradesh Pollution Control Board ( for short 'Board') the 1 st Applicant herein to stop all

activities in the premises of first respondent/industry by 31.07.2011 and shift to an

alternate place, was set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       3. The brief facts of appeal grounds can be stated thus:
</p>
<p id="p_5">       M/s. Visakha Industries Limited, the first respondent in this appeal is an

Asbestos Cement Product Manufacturing Unit established in the year 1985 in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                        2</span>
 Yelumala Village, R.C. Puram Mandal, Medak District, Andhra Pradesh. The industry

is located within 10 km radius of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar lakes (herein

after called 'the lakes'). The first respondent's industry is a Red Category industry as

per the classification in the Notification dated 20.12.1999 issued by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests ( for short 'MoEF') and the said industry is also recognised

in the list of polluting industry as per G.O.Ms. No. 2, Environment, Science and

Technology (Environment) Department dated 23.01.1995 of the Government of

Andhra Pradesh.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       4. In view of the Government policy to shift industries located within 10 km

radius of the lakes, directions were issued by the Constitutional Court to protect the

same in implementation of the orders of the Hon'ble Apex Court and a Government

orders was issued vide G.O. Ms. No. 111, Municipal Administration and Urban

Development Department dated 08.03.1996. As a consequence to the decision of

the Apex Court and other courts, and with reference to the Government order dated

08.03.1996 various industries located within 10 km radius of the said lakes were

identified and orders were passed for their relocation. The Government of Andhra

Pradesh had also directed the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation

to allot lands to the industries to enable them to shift and relocate the industries.

</p><p id="p_7">       5. The 1st respondent/industry was being reviewed for its performance

periodically and in the meeting held on 18.11.2010 of the Task Force Committee, the

performance of the 1st respondent/s industry was again reviewed and directions were

issued to the 1st respondent/industry to stop all activities in the present premises by

31.07.2011 and shift to the alternate site provided by the Andhra Pradesh Industrial

Infrastructure Corporation or any other place and to furnish a bank guarantee for Rs.

10,00, 000/- ( Rupees ten lakh) only. The 1st respondent/industry approached the

Appellate Authority in Appeal No. 6 of 2011 and the Appellate Authority passed an

order on 25.03.2011 in the above appeal setting aside the order of the Board. It is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                        3</span>
 the said order which has been impugned against which this appeal has been

preferred by the Applicant/Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_8">      6. Per contra, the averments in the counter affidavit of 1st respondent/industry

run as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_9">      The Appellate Authority had set aside the order of the Board directing the 1st

respondent/industry to stop all activities in the present premises by 31.07.2011

based on the report of the 1st respondent/industry filed before the Hon'ble Supreme

Court of India in February 2002 as well as the latest status report dated 04.03.2011

filed by the Board. The Appellate Authority took into consideration of the report of the

Board filed before the Hon'ble Apex Court wherein it was stated that there was no

water pollution from the 1st respondent/industry and that there were no boilers or

furnaces except diesel generator sets which were occasionally used during power

cut. There was no release of SO2/NOx emissions from the process of the 1st

respondent/industry which is water polluting.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      7. The Board in its wisdom constituted a Committee to inspect the 1st

respondent/industry subsequent to the order passed by the Appellate Authority dated

25.03.2011 to inspect the industry which inspected the premises on 19.07.2012 and

found that the industry was not meeting the standards which necessitated the Board

to issue show cause notice dated 02.12.2011 and the hearing was held on

12.12.2011. However, based on the explanation of the 1st respondent/industry the

Board again inspected the 1st respondent/industry on 03.03.2012 and filed the latest

report dated 12.06.2012 before the Tribunal whereby the Board has admitted the fact

that as on date the 1st respondent/industry is fully within the established norms. The

1st respondent/industry has been given the consent order vide order dated

29.09.2011 valid upto to 30.06.2002 and after that the industry has been making

applications for renewal of consent every year which were never returned. The Board


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                                       4</span>
 has been accepting the fee which was being paid by the respondent/industry for

renewal of consent order. The Board has never taken any action against the

respondent/industry for over a period of 30 years as the industry is strictly adhering

to the pollution control norms in letter and spirit. As per the latest report of the Board

dated 12.06.2012 no illegal discharges are found during the inspection with regard to

the water pollution and the 65 KLD of water is totally reused and also recycling

facilities are in place. Sewage Treatment Plant has been provided to treat the

domestic wastewater and after treatment it is used for gardening within the premises.

Hence, the respondent/industry seeks to dismiss the appeal.

</p><p id="p_11">       8. The only point for determination in the appeal is whether the order of the

Appellate Authority made in Appeal No. 6/2010 dated 25.03.23011 has to be set

aside for all or any of the reasons putforth by the appellant and the order of the 1st

respondent/Board in the appeal before the Appellate Authority dated 02.12.2011 has

to be restored.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       9. The arguments advanced on either side were heard. The averments made

in the pleadings and all the documents, materials and in particular the judgment

under challenge are looked into.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       10. Admittedly, M/s. Visaka Industries Limited, the 1 st respondent herein an

Asbestos Cement Products Manufacturing industry was established in the year 1985

and is a red category industry as per the classifications made under Schedule VIII

annexed to the Notification issued by the MoEF, Government of India dated

20.12.1999. A consent order to operate the said industry was issued on 21.09.2001

which was valid upto 30.06.2002. It is not disputed by the Board that the

respondent/industry has been applying for renewal of consent and no orders of

renewal were passed. But, the Board has been accepting the fee for renewal of

consent paid by the respondent/industry continuously. The application filed by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                                         5</span>
 respondent/industry for consent to operate the industry was returned by the Board by

an order dated 28.12.2011 which was the subject matter of the Appeal No. 36/2012

before the Appellate Authority. The judgment by the Appellate Authority dated

15.09.2012 disposed of the appeal by setting aside the order of the Board and the

matter was remitted back to the Board for considering the application of the

respondent/industry subject to final outcome of the W.P.No. 19006 of 2012 in the

Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh. As stated above, the said writ petition by an

order of the High Court was transferred to the Tribunal and taken as Application No.

16 of 2013 (SZ).
</p>
<p id="p_14">       11. Assailing the judgment of the Appellate Authority, it is contended by the

applicant Board that the respondent/industry is under red category as per the

classification in the Notification dated 20.12.1999 issued by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests (for short 'MoEF') and the said industry is also recognised

in the list of polluting industry as per G.O.Ms. No. 2, Environment, Science and

Technology (Environment) Department dated 23.01.1995 of the Government of

Andhra Pradesh since the said industry has high pollution potential. In view of the

Government policy for shifting industries located within 10 km radius of the lakes

there arose a necessity to issue a direction to the 1st respondent/industry to stop its

activities and shift its location.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       12. The Hon'ble Apex Court has also issued direction for shifting of industries

located within 10 km radius from the lakes. In view of the decision of the Apex Court

and G.O. Ms. No. 111 dated 08.03.1996 of the Government of Andhra Pradesh,

various industries located within 10 km radius of the said lakes were identified and

orders were also issued for their relocation. The 1st respondent/industry was being

reviewed for its performance periodically. In a meeting held on 08.11.2010 by the

Task Force Committee, the 1st         respondent/industry was reviewed and suitable

direction inter alia were issued to the industry on 31.12.2010 to stop all its activities in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                                          6</span>
 the present premises by 31.07.2011 and shift to the alternate site provided by the

Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation or any other place and also to

furnish a bank guarantee for Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakh) only and thus, the

direction issued to the 1st respondent/industry for stopping activities and relocation

was based on the sufficient reasons warranted by the circumstances and in view of

the order of the Apex Court.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       13. In order to substantiate the above, the learned counsel for the applicant

took the Tribunal to G.O. Ms. No. 2, Environment, Science and Technology

(Environment) Department dated 23.01.1995 and G.O. Ms. No. 111 dated

08.03.1996 of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The judgment of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court made in the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board Vs. M.V. Naidu

reported in 2001(2) SCC 62 in support of the order passed by the Board. The learned

counsel for the applicant relied on the report along with the observation made by the

committee consisting of senior officers of the Board, who made the inspection of the

industry in question on 19.11.2011. Countering all the above contentions, the

counsel for the 1st respondent/industry would submit that the judgment of the

Appellate Authority has to be sustained since it was thoroughly based on the report

of the Board filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in 2/2002 and as well as

the latest status report dated 04.03.2011 filed by the applicant before the Appellate

Authority. Pointing to the report filed by the Board before the Apex Court, the counsel

would submit that there was no water pollution caused by the 1st respondent/industry

and that there are no boilers, furnaces except diesel generator sets which were

occasionally used during power cut and there was no release of SO2/ NOX emission

from the process of the 1st respondent/industry which were polluting the atmosphere.

The latest report dated 04.03.2011 would clearly indicate that the emission level of

1st respondent/industry was within the prescribed parameters and there was no water

pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                                     7</span>
</p><p id="p_18">       14. While filing the writ petition the respondent Board in the writ petition has

taken an untenable stand that subsequent to the impugned judgment by the

Appellate Authority, the Board had constituted a committee to inspect the industry

which made an inspection on 19.11.2011 and found that the industry was not

meeting the standards which necessitated the Board to issue a show cause notice on

02.12.2011 and the hearing was held on 12.12.2011 and following the explanation

submitted by the industry, the Board made another inspection on 03.03.2012 and

filed a latest status report dated 12.06.2012 which fully supported the case of the 1st

respondent/industry and never stood in favour of the applicant/Board. The 1 st

respondent/industry has been in existence for more than 3 decades without any

complaint from any quarters and nearly 500 employees are working in the industry,

who were residing very close to the 1st respondent/industry, but no one has

complained of any health issue or otherwise. The 1st respondent/industry has been

subjected itself to periodic analysis of ambient air quality and report of the

Government approved laboratory has certified that the 1st respondent/industry is

adhering to the pollution norms.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      15. Based on the report filed by the applicant/Board, the Appellate Authority

set aside the order and strangely within 4 months from the report the Board

reconstituted another committee to inspect the 1st respondent/industry as if it was

operating beyond the pollution control norms. But, latest report has tacitly admitted

the fact that the 1st respondent/industry is very well within pollution norms. The

learned counsel took the Tribunal to the latest inspection report of the 1 st

respondent/industry made by the Board. The Board cannot place any reliance on

G.O. Ms. No. 111 dated 08.03.1996 with regard to the location of the industry within

10 km radius of both the lakes since the Hon'ble Apex Court directed the Board to file

the report with regard to the existing industries. The Board in its report has clearly

admitted the 1st respondent/industry does not have water polluting potential. All these


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                                     8</span>
 would be clearly indicative of the fact that the 1st respondent/industry is strictly

adhering to all pollution control norms. Taking into consideration of all the above, the

Appellate Authority has made the impugned judgment which has got to be sustained.


</p><p id="p_20">       16. As could be seen from the available materials, the 1st respondent/industry

is an asbestos cement products manufacturing industry falling under red category

and is in existence from 1981. G.O. Ms. No. 111 dated 08.03.1996 of the

Government of Andhra Pradesh speaks on the Government policy for shifting the

industries located within 10 km radius of both the lakes in order to protect the same

from pollution. The said Government order was taken up for consideration inter alia

by the Apex Court in Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board Vs. M.V. Naidu

reported in 2001(2) SCC 62 and the paragraph 75 of the judgment reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            " 75. The State of Andhra Pradesh is, therefore, directed hereby to

            identify those industries located within 10 km radius of these two

            lakes and to take action in consultation with the A.P. Pollution

            Control Board to prevent pollution to the drinking water in these

            two reservoirs. The State and the Board shall not permit any

            polluting industries within 10 km radius. A report shall be

            submitted to this Court by the State of Andhra Pradesh in this

            behalf within four months from today, in regard to the pollution or

            pollution potential of industries, if any, existing within 10 km of the

            lakes is received, the matter may be listed. Point 6 is decided

            accordingly."</blockquote><p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">       17. Following the said order of the Apex Court, dated 01.12.2000, 02.08.2011

and 05.11.2001, an action taken report was filed by the Board dated 01.02.2002 and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                                       9</span>
 the said report was accepted by the Apex Court with observations that no more order

was required. The final part of the said action taken report reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              " Accordingly, the A.P. Pollution Control Board has initiated

             action as directed by the State Government and issued directions

             to 55 industries direction " not to manufacture any product without

             prior permission of the Board", issued closure orders to 13

             additional industries, issued directions to 6 industries directing "

             not to start any process/product, which generate pollution" and

             issued directions to 5 pollution potential industries directing " not

             to start ny new process/product." <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">The Act</a>ion Taken Report (31

             copies) of the Board is enclosed for information and necessary

             action."</blockquote><p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">       18. The reading of the report would clearly indicate that the directions issued

were to 55 industries. It is not made known by the applicant as to under what

category of these 55 industries the 1st respondent/industry would fall. It is pertinent to

point that the Apex Court in its order has directed the Andhra Pradesh Government

to identify the industries located within 10 km radius of the lakes. It is true that the

State Government and the Board were directed not to permit any polluting industries

within 10 km radius and a report was to be filed within four months there from with

regard to the polluting and pollution potential industries, if any existing within 10 km

radius of the lakes. It remains to be stated that the Board never stated in the report

that the 1st respondent/industry was a polluting or pollution potential industry, though,

admittedly it is existing within 10 km radius of the lakes.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                                       10</span>
</p><p id="p_26">       19. It is not in controversy that the 1st respondent/industry was commenced in

the year 1981 and the consent order dated 29.01.2001 was valid upto 30.06.2002.

All applications filed for renewal of consent were kept by the Board without any

orders either way. But, the Board was accepting necessary fees for every year. It is a

matter of surprise to note that no notice was issued before the inspection made on

10.09.2010. At no point of time even before or after the passing of the G.O.No. 111

dated 08.03.1996 or after filing of the report pursuant to the direction of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, the 1st respondent/industry was found to be a polluting industry. The

impugned order passed by the Board dated 31.10.2010 reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     1. The industry uses Asbestos fiber, cement, fly ash, cotton rock pulp and

        hard ground waste as raw material for producing asbestos cement

        sheets and accessories.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     2. The industry uses about 80 KLD of water in the process for mixing the

        raw materials, 15 KLD for cooling make-up and 20 KLD for domestic

        purposes.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     3. The industry generates about 65 KLD of process waste water and 20

        KLD of domestic waste water.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     4. The industry was collecting the process water into two numbers of

        conical tanks of capacity 1 lakh liters each and after settlement this

        water was reused into the process. The domestic waste water

        disposed into septic tank followed by soak pit.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     5. The industry has provided bag filter and wet scrubber followed by

        chimney of height about 40 ft. to control the asbestos dust emissions

        emanated from the fibre mill. The industry has also provided cyclone

        dust collector to control cement dust emission from the site.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      6. The industry generates solid wastes such as process sludge of 4

        tonnes per annum and broken hard pieces of 685 tonnes per annum.

        They were collecting the process sludge and re-used in the process.

        The broken hard pieces were collected and recycled through the wet

        ball mills.

remains to be stated that the Board, though not satisfies with explanation of the 1 st

respondent/industry, again caused an inspection to be made on 03.03.2012 and file

a status report dated 12.06.2012 before the Appellate Authority. The following

respondent/industry was fully adhering to all pollution control norms and entire water

used in the industry is totally re-cycled and that illegal discharge was not found

during the inspection and with regard to the water pollution, it is stated that 65 KLD of

water was totally re-used and there were recycling facilities and STP has also been

provided to treat the waste water and after treatment used for gardening within the

premises.

      The industry has provided 3 Nos. of wet ball mill for grinding of broken and

      The industry provided 5 machines for cutting of broken pieces into small chips

</p><p id="p_35">    28. Thus, it could be seen that the 1st respondent/industry is neither a water

polluting industry nor a pollution potential industry. The contentions putforth on the

side of the applicant/Board that the directions to stop the activities and for shifting

was issued to the 1st respondent/industry only in view of the adherence to the order

of Hon'ble Supreme Court cannot be countenanced. The Apex Court has issued a

direction to find out and file a report in respect of all the industries situate within 10

km radius of the lakes, but directed the State/Board not to permit any polluting

industries within 10 km radius. Hence, to sustain the above direction to stop and shift

the 1st respondent/industry the applicant/Board must be able to show that the 1 st

respondent/industry is a polluting or pollution potential industry. In the instant case,

the 1st respondent/industry is shown to be situated within 10 km radius, but not as an

industry polluting or with pollution potential. The Appellate Authority has correctly

pointed out that the 1st respondent/industry is not at all a polluting industry to which

the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court with regard to the relocation of

industries can be applied. The Appellate Authority has also pointed out the 1 st

respondent/industry listed as Sl. No. 75 in the report though shown as falling under,

red hazardous and 30 category, there was no water pollution from the industry, there

was no emission of SO4 or NOX emission from the process, that there was no boiler

or furnaces except diesel generator set which was occasionally used during power

cut, that the industry is meeting the standards of pollution control norms. The

contentions putforth by the 1st respondent/industry that the asbestos industry is kept

under red category mainly due to the potential for occupational health hazards to

those working in the industry and hence, the industry is to be exempted from the list

of industries which are possible source of pollution threat to both the lakes has to be

 accepted. The 1st respondent industry which came into existence in the year 1999

and operational all along was in the list for careful monitoring of its operations from

the year 2002 onwards. But, no action was taken all along these years cannot but be

due to the meeting and maintaining of the prescribed standards all these years.


</p><p id="p_36">   29. As stated above, even the latest status report dated 04.03.2011 stood in

support of the case of the 1st respondent/industry that the emission levels were within

the prescribed levels and does not support the case of the applicant directing the 1 st

respondent/industry to stop its activities and shift to alternate place.

with the reasoned judgment of the Appellate Authority made in Appeal No. 6/2010.

Hence, the application is dismissed.
