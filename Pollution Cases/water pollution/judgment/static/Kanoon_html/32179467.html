      THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-

                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned advocate for the petitioner

and the learned HCGP for the respondent-State.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.     Petitioner     was       working    as   a   Municipal

Commissioner, City Municipal Council, Chitradruga. A

private complaint in P.C. No.433/2006 was lodged by

the   Karnataka         State     Pollution      Control      Board

contending      inter     alia    that     the   petitioner    had

committed offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a> of

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.

The   private     complaint           is   now    converted      as

C.C.No.394/2007. The petitioner, in this petition, has

prayed for quashing the said proceedings.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span>
</p><p id="p_3">      3.     Sri.Vishwanath.R.Hegde, learned advocate

for   the   petitioner   urged     a   solitary   ground    that

permission     under     <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section    197</a>    Cr.P.C.   was     not

obtained by the respondent before filling the private

complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.     It is trite that no sanction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section

197</a> Cr.P.C. is required before initiating prosecution as

held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

V.C.Chinnappa       Goudar         -vs-   Karnataka        State

Pollution Control Board and Another reported in

(2015) 14 SCC 535.            Hence, the solitary ground

urged by the petitioner is untenable.

</p><p id="p_5">      In the circumstances, in my view, this petition

does not merit consideration and deserves to be

dismissed, and is accordingly dismissed.

</p><p id="p_6">      No costs.
