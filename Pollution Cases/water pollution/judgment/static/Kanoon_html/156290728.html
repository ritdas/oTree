<p id="p_11">6.    The     facts,     giving   rise     to      this    litigation,      may       be
summarized as under;
</p>
<p id="p_12">6.1   This litigation has something to do with the serious issue
of pollution caused by the Ceramic Industries at Morbi. Morbi-
Wankaner ceramic cluster is located about 235 km South-West
of Ahmedabad and 65 km North of Rajkot, spread in a 35 km
belt in the Morbi District along the National Highway No. 8A.
The production of ceramic tiles accounts for nearly 80% of the

country's total output. Most of the ceramic industries in the
area were issued the Consolidated Consents &amp; Authorization
(CCA) with the condition of using PNG/LNG as the fuel. With
increase in the PNG/LNG prices. The industries switched over
to coal gasifier of very poor technology of gas cleaning without
the prior permission from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board
(GPCB), which led to major water, air and land pollution
problems. The Gasifier operators started illegally disposing off
the wastewater and coal tar, which has contaminated the land
and    water       environment      extensively   in      Morbi-Wakaner
Industrial area. The Air pollutant emission from the spray drier
units and combustion of coal tar has drastically polluted the
overall environment of Morbi. The burning issues led to filing of
various complaints regarding the pollution in the city of Morbi
&amp; other parts on the outskirts.
</p>
<p id="p_13">6.2   In response to the complaints, the officials of the Central
pollution Control Board visited few ceramic industries in the
month of July 2017. Based on the report, the Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) in its direction U/s. 18(1)(b) of the Water
(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 dated August
23, 2012, instructed the GPCB to close down all the industries
using coal based gasifier without any prior consent, and to
ensure that the coal gasifiers are dismantled.

<p id="p_14">6.3   A Writ Petition (PIL) No.165 of 2013 came to be filed in
this High Court in July, 2013 by one Shri Babubhai Ramubhai
Saini regarding the acute problems of pollution caused by the
Ceramic &amp; Silicate Industries in and around the town of Morbi.
The petition, in the nature of public interest, was preferred

seeking a writ of mandamus to the GPCB to enforce the
directions and recommendations of the CPCB. This High Court,
in its order dated 25th October, 2013, directed the GPCB to
implement, at the earliest, the recommendations of the CPCB
inspection report (2012) and also the directions issued by the
CPCB under <a href="/doc/728591/" id="a_3">Section 18(1)(b)</a> of the Water Act, 1974 dated 23rd
August, 2012. It appears from the materials on record that in
compliance of the directions dated 23rd August, 2012, the
GPCB requested the CPCB to allow trial run for five different
types of modified coal gasifier technologies. An Expert
Committee was constituted by the Forest &amp; Environment
Department, Government of Gujarat to evaluate the modified
coal gasifier technologies theoretically          and practically.           The
Committee prepared a report titled "Report on coal based
gasifier for theoretical and practical evaluation of technology
proposals for Zero Percentage Pollution Discharge". Based on
the said report and also upon the request of the GPCB, the
CPCB issued modified directions dated 21st June, 2014. In view
of the modified directions issued by the CPCB, this High Court
disposed of the matter vide order dated 23 rd June, 2014,
directing     the       Ceramic   Industries     to   follow       the       new
guidelines/norms.
</p>
<p id="p_15">6.4   The GPCB, thereafter, started issuing consent to establish
(CTE) and amendment in the CCA for the coal gasifier based on
the new guidelines and the short term and medium term
measures suggested in the report of the Expert Committee of
the Government of Gujarat for the up-gradation/modifications
of gasifiers which were already installed, or for new gasifiers.
The said report suggested and recommended long term
measure as establishment of common gasifier system for the

cluster of industries considering the problems faced by the
individual gasifier users.
</p><p id="p_16">6.5     It appears that three types of coal gasifiers (modified
gasifiers) came forward claiming zero liquid discharge. Those
were as under;

<p id="p_17">6.6       It also appears that the order passed by this Court
dated 23rd June, 2014, referred to above, came to be affirmed
by the Supreme Court, reserving the liberty to the original

Public notice has been issued in three vernacular
newspapers for creating awareness. Type G gasifiers
were given trial run permission. 67 units were closed and
show cause notice given to 262 ceramic units. Trial
permission was given for carrying out feasibility study of

that there is a vast difference in the report submitted in
February, 2018 on account of results of SGS Laboratory
which show the level of pollution to be very high. There
are 800 industries in Morbi and Wankaner area and
transportation of 5,000 trucks per day which is
contributing to the pollution of the air where are other
industries such as clay spray driers, paper mills, silicate
industries, stone crushers, roofing tiles, coal screener,
laminate units, frit industries, refractories, etc. working
for 20 hours per day. The said industries are also
contributing to the water and air pollution and not
ceramic industries alone. The Consolidated Consent
Authorization has been given by the GPCB and short term

<p id="p_35">6.1 Examination/Evaluation of Gasifier Technologies
Type 'A': There are 13 type 'A' gasifiers were found
during the inspection by the committee. These gasifiers
were not in operation. Some of them were not in
operation since long, however, some gasifiers were found
with wastewater and tar which shows these gasifiers
were operational in immediate past. Since, this type of
gasifiers are not permitted, GPCB must ensure that all
type 'A' gasifier should be dismantled.
</p>
<p id="p_36">Type 'B': Earlier expert committee (2014) suggested that
type 'B' gasifier can be permitted to operate if the
wastewater generated during gas cleaning/ condensation
is recycled back to the gasifier shell by the use of
evaporator. Accordingly, GPCB granted amended CTE/
CCA for the operation of type 'B' gasifiers. However, this
committee finds that type 'B' gasifier cannot be operated
by recycling condensate wastewater in the gasifier shell
as the condensate wastewater generated is in excess of
the required moisture for shift reaction. This is the
reason, almost all type 'B' gasifier operators illegally
discharge wastewater either through open drain, in low
lying areas, abandoned mines etc. and /or steam release
to atmosphere. During the inspection of industries, it was
found that there are 71 gasifiers that operate evaporator
and feed wastewater steam inside the gasifier shell. This
can only be a temporary phenomenon as complete
wastewater cannot be fed on continuous basis. These
gasifiers can discharge condensate wastewater outside
the premises illegally and it is not possible for GPCB to
keep track of the wastewater generated and its recycle.
An argument put forth is that the evaporator operates
only for a few hour and feed the complete steam inside
the gasifier shell. Such argument does not stand as the
condensate wastewater generation is a continuous
process and even if intermediate tanks of very large
capacity is built, all will get filled at some instance during
the operation of gasifier. Therefore, this committee
recommends that all gasifier of type 'B' must be shut
down immediately, dismantled safely.
</p>
<p id="p_37">Type 'C': Condensate wastewater with indirect cooling
and Tar (Wet ESP) is stated to be recycled into gasifier
shell by heating it at high temperature in the Tar
reformer. The recycling operation is carried out on the
premises that the moisture fed inside the gasifier shell

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                       Page 14 of 80</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                           Downloaded on : Tue Nov 19 20:51:38 IST 2019</span>

will be the stoichiometric requirement of amount of coal
tar recycled. The coal tar generated itself is an emulsion
of water and coal tar due to its collection mechanism
(Wet ESP). The moisture content of coal tar should be
sufficient to take part in the shift reaction and any
additional moisture may not be needed. The condensate
wastewater will be recycled again in the subsequent
condensation and this in turn will accumulate the
wastewater in the gasifier system as happens in the case
of type 'B' gasifier. Thus, after a few days of operation,
type 'C' gasifier will generate and accumulate
condensate wastewater, which does not have economical
treatment option, and therefore its management will
always be major issue. Generation of condensate
wastewater and coal tar is not recommended.
</p>
<p id="p_38">Type 'D': This is hot gasifier and does not allow
condensation of moisture up to kiln. The entire moisture
is fed in the kiln. Since this is a hot gasifier, coal tar does
not get condensed and is fed directly to the kiln. This was
evident from the colour of the flame, which was
yellow/orange. A clean producer gas gives blue flame.
Raw gas cleaning through road metal/aggregates
(kapachi) filter generates large quantity of exposed/used
aggregate filter media. Huge quantum of Filter media
coated with tar and coal dust whose disposal may be
another environmental issue. High molecular weight
(class 5) coal tar gets condensed just before the kiln
burner and gets solidified as soon as its moisture is
evaporated. Solid coal tar cannot be fed from the bottom
of the shell. If solid coal tar is fed from the top, it gets
vaporized and again reappear in the raw synthetic gas
thereby accumulating coal tar in each successive cycles.
Type D' gasifier will have the problem of solid coal tar
and disposal of large quantity of used contaminated
aggregates. Generation of coal tar and contaminated
filter   media     (aggregate)      from   gasifier     is  not
recommended.
</p>
<p id="p_39">Type 'E': is based on down draft and agro based fuel
where no cooling and cleaning of gas is required and
therefore no wastewater and tar generation. Bio-mass
based fuel does not generate heavy hydrocarbon, and
therefore Tar, which is heavy hydrocarbon is not formed.
Steam is not added in the gasifier, instead moisture of
biomass is considered sufficient for H2 formation. Due to

very low amount of moisture feed, wastewater is not
generated. Even if condensate wastewater and coal tar is
generated from gasifiers in small amount in Morbi-
Wankaner Industrial cluster, its cumulative impact on the
ecosystem is very severe as there are very large number
of ceramic industries exists. Management and handling of
wastewater and hazardous waste (coal tar) from all
industries together exceeds the assimilative capacity of
the region and therefore any gasifier generating
condensate wastewater and coal tar should not be
permitted. Instead of further experimenting with older
moving coal bed gasifiers (currently existing in Morbi),
advanced fluidized bad gasifier should be designed along
with all pollution control device for meeting the clean
energy demands in Morbi region.
</p>
<p id="p_40">Till a cleaner technology for synthetic gas generation is
demonstrated, ceramic industries having gasifiers may
opt for PNG. Natural gas grid /pipe connections are
already established in area and most of industries are
having connections.
</p>
<p id="p_41">6.2 Environmental Status of Morbi - Wankaner Area The
general ambience of Morbi -- Wakaner industrial cluster
is smell of half burnt coal, VOC, SO2 and poor visibility
due to dust and smog. The committee visited different
areas along the roads of Morbi - Wankaner and collected
sample of surface and ground water. It was observed that
most of the storm water drains in the industrial area are
carrying condensate wastewater (brown colour) and
vitrified tile polishing wastewater (white colour). All these
storm water drains join some natural drains and finally
meets Kalindri and Bela river in the region. Many low
lying areas along the road and nearby abandoned mines
contain condensate wastewater, which is disposed
illegally. Further travel to inner part of the industrial area
showed the very poor industrial solid waste management
practice. Wherever open space is found along the river,
solid waste, broken tiles, ceramics, polishing sludge etc.
are disposed haphazardly. Overall visual experience of
the industrial area is that Morbi industrial area is highly
polluted and is an economic zone only to create wealth
from mother earth (clay, coal) but belongs to none.
</p>
<p id="p_42">Though the visible water colour suggest that it is
polluted, a scientific approach require its analysis in

laboratory, and therefore, to quantify the level of
pollution samples of air and water were collected from
field and analysed in the laboratory. Water analysis result
suggest that the discharged wastewater is highly
polluted. The ambient air samples collected by the
committee and analysed in CPCB (RD, Vadodara)
laboratory shows very high &amp; alarming level of PM10, and
PM2.5 and SO2 pollution indicating uncontrolled emission
from spray drier, ceramic kiln without any flue gas
treatment. The concentration of PM10, and PM25and SO2
are exceeding many time more than the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) except two
locations for SO2. The concentrations of pollutants are
also more due to high industrial density having almost
same nature of industrial activities in the Morbi area. This
warrants immediate preparation of air action plan and its
implementation including proper /adequate pollution
control technology for spray dryers, tiles polishing units,
restriction &amp; control on haphazard disposal of solid waste
(broken tiles, polishing dust, coal ash), improvement in
road conditions etc.

The pollution control technology primarily demands use
of clean technology for coal gasifier, which will eliminate
condensate wastewater and coal tar generation followed
by scrubbing of dust, SO2 from spray drier and
installation of flue gas treatment (scrubber) for removal
of Sulphur from burning of synthetic gas in ceramic kiln.
The groundwater analysis results shows contamination
(high COD) at some bore wells which needs to be further
investigated through state level ground water board
/authority. Recently, it is informed that brownish color
ground water is observed in bore well.
</p>
<p id="p_43">As per Medium term measures given by Expert
Committee (Govt. of Gujarat) 2014, a study of spray
dryer was to be conducted, from pollution view point,
which shall incorporate survey related to the existing air
pollution control devices, ascertaining the adequacy of
installed system and suggesting addition /alterations to
fulfill the prescribed norms within six months by
environment departments of Engineering /Technical
Institutes and respective Industrial Associations should
bear the cost of the study. However, no action is visible
at site and the status quo of pollution discharge is
maintained.

<p id="p_44">6.3 Industrial visits and compliance aspects Ease of
handling waste leads to its categorization based on
physical state i.e. solid, liquid and gaseous. At Morbi,
ceramic industries are generating and discharging waste
in all the three states. Solid waste are visible and can be
managed if space for its disposal is provided and the
existing solid waste management rules are followed. Coal
tar generated in gasifier is illegally used in combustion
activity thereby causing air pollution as in the entire
Morbi industrial area. While using coal tar in combustion,
air pollution control device are not installed, thereby
releasing pollutant in the atmosphere. There are several
emission points like, spray drier, kiln emission,
evaporator emission etc. Therefore, the issue of air
pollution in Morbi is very serious and alarming. Liquid
waste i.e. mostly condensate wastewater from gasifier
and polishing waste from vitrified tiles are not disposed
after treatment. In fact the condensate wastewater from
gasifier cannot be treated economically and therefore the
technology of gasifier needs to be upgraded so as not to
generate wastewater and tar. Previous committee
(expert committee -2014) has suggested some
modifications in the existing coal gasifiers including
recycling the condensate wastewater through evaporator
to achieve zero liquid discharge. Accordingly, GPCB
provided amended CCA for such gasifiers, which is
presently termed as Type E' gasifier. Another committee
(NGT 2015), recommended for excess wastewater (after
evaporation) to be incinerated which is part of
notification published by GPCB in August 2017, but till
date the industries are not sending excess wastewater to
any common incineration facility for disposal of
wastewater and common incineration facility not
developed. However, it is found that such measures do
not solve the wastewater problem and therefore this
committee recommends to overrule any such provision of
wastewater recycling in the moving bed coal gasifier (up-
draft existing gasifiers) and incineration of excess
wastewater.
</p>
<p id="p_45">In total, 432 industries visited, 411 industries were found
to have coal gasifier and the remaining 21 were using
PNG for operating the ceramic industry. There are 384
Type 'B' gasifiers visited, 69 gasifiers are without CCA &amp;
therefore illegal and 315 with valid CCA. Out of 384 type

'B' gasifier, 130 gasifiers were not operational and 254
gasifiers were operational where 2 does not have
evaporator installed, 96 were not operating evaporator,
and 85 were releasing steam of evaporator in to the
atmosphere (more than 50 % operational evaporator).
</p><p id="p_46">There     are   73    type    'B'   gasifiers   that   have
provision/practicing direct scrubbing of raw synthetic gas
by addition of water pipe line/recirculation line. There are
133 gasifiers that have contaminated cooling water and
32 gasifiers were found to be discharging wastewater
inside/outside the premises. All these actions make them
non-compliant.
</p>
<p id="p_47">71 industries have exhibited recycling of condensate
wastewater in the gasifier shell during the visit of
committee members, however, it is not possible to
continue such practice for long time due to reasons as
elaborated in Chap-2. Therefore, the compliance
condition stipulated by the GPCB based on the earlier
committee's recommendations is not maintainable and
should be cancelled. Regarding management of coal tar
generated from coal gasifier, there is large gap between
coal tar generation and its authorized use as fuel. A very
large quantity of coal tar is illegally used as fuel. By &amp;
large, storage, handling &amp; transportation of coal tar is not
as per HWM Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_48">There are other difficulties /issues by the industries in
handling present coal gasifiers like small scale
operations, local suppliers /manufactures of gasifiers
without proper Material of Construction (MoCs), without
proper operational control, leakages of tar /wastewater,
fugitive emissions /smell from open wastewater /tar tanks
in the area, industries casual approach for operation of
gasifiers, large number of industries /gasifiers in limited
area concentrating pollution /safety risks, enforcement
difficulties i.e. day to day check on illegal operations not
possible with limited manpower and local interferences.
Further, other non-compliances observed during industry
visits which are elaborated in (chapter-5). All type 'B' coal
gasifiers should be shut down immediately and
dismantled, irrespective of whether it is complying with
the consent condition or not. The plant premises should
be cleared of wastewater and tar, else it should be
considered as violation.

<p id="p_49">The summary of industrial visits with observations is
submitted to GPCB. Action should be initiated by GPCB on
industries that are operating illegally in the Industrial
area of Morbi as per orders (dated 24.07.2017 &amp;
14.11.207) of Hon'ble NGT, Pune. Majority of gasifiers
including almost all type-B gasifier with valid CCA visited
by the teams and made observations/conclusions and
further      visits    may      not      influence      the
observations/conclusion in any way as the issues related
to type-B gasifiers are similar in nature. GPCB should
further identify all such gasifiers (with CCA &amp; without
CCA) and shut them down. Initiation by the gasifier
operators on incineration of wastewater or its bio-
chemical treatment should not be considered as a reason
for permitting them to operate it further.
</p>
<p id="p_50">Most of the medium term measures (to be taken up by
Ceramic Industries Association) mentioned in the
recommendations of the expert committee of Govt. of
Gujarat (2014) such as Spray dryer study (adequacy for
spray dryers, suggestions on addition/alterations to meet
norms      etc.),     implementation     of    suggested
additions/alteration to APCD by member industries within
three months, solid waste management, improvement of
roads to improve the ambient air quality etc. by industry
association(s) are yet to be fulfilled. As per the
information provided by the GPCB, five industrial
accidents reported in last two years related to gasifier
and therefore safety aspects needs to be seriously
considered by concerned
department.
</p>
<p id="p_51">Till clean technology gasifier demonstrated, available
PNG may be used to avoid any environmental
issues/damage which are being created due to
mismanagement, illegal disposal of tar and wastewater
generated from existing gasifiers.
</p>
<p id="p_52">New advance fluidized bed clean technology gasifiers
that does not generate condensate wastewater and tar
should be encouraged. Such gasifier should be approved
for its material of fabrication, all temperature and
pressure measuring gadgets, automated monitoring and
control system by Directorate of Industrial Safety &amp;
Health (DISH) for authorized installation in Morbi."

<p id="p_53">19. Thus, as per the above expert study, type A, B, C, D
and E coal gasifiers are not viable. If the ceramic
industries are to be permitted, their option is to adopt
Pipe Natural Gas (PNG). The final conclusion is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_54">"Even if condensate wastewater and coal tar is generated
from gasifiers in small amount in Morbi -- Wankaner
Industrial cluster, its cumulative impact on the ecosystem
is very severe as there are very large number of ceramic
industries exists. Management and handling of
wastewater and hazardous waste (coal tar) from all
industries together exceeds the assimilative capacity of
the region and therefore any gasifier generating
condensate wastewater and coal tar should not be
permitted. Instead of further experimenting with older
moving coal bed gasifiers (currently existing in Morbi),
advanced fluidized bad gasifier should be designed along
with all pollution control device for meeting the clean
energy demands in Morbi region.
</p>
<p id="p_55">Till a cleaner technology for synthetic gas generation is
demonstrated, ceramic industries having gasifiers may
opt for PNG. Natural gas grid /pipe connections are
already established in area and most of industries are
having connections."
</p>
<p id="p_56">20. The CPCB has filed its synopsis on 05.01.2019 with
reference to the said report, inter-alia, stating as follows:
"The Committee (NGT Committee 2017) recommended
for closure/dismantling of type-A &amp; B type of gasifiers.
Type-C, Type-D and Type-E gasifiers were given trial run
permission by GPCB during the visits of the committee.
As there is generation of waste water and coal tar in case
of Type-C and issues of tar recycling, generation &amp;
disposal of huge amount of contaminated/ exhausted
filter (aggregates) media in case of Type-D gasifier, these
gasifiers are not recommended by Committee.
Regarding, Type-E gasifier though, its pollution potential
is negligible, its output performance is inadequate to
generate required heat for long kiln.

wastewater and hazardous waste (coal tar) from all
industries together exceeds the capacity of the region as
evident from monitoring results of water bodies &amp;
ambient air and therefore any gasifier generating
condensate wastewater and coal tar should not be
permitted. Instead of further experimenting with older
moving coal bed gasifiers (currently existing in Morbi),
advanced fluidized bed gasifier should be designed along
with all pollution control devices for meeting the clean

<p id="p_58">Till a cleaner technology for synthetic gas generation is
demonstrated, ceramic industries having gasifier may opt
for PNG. Natural gas grid/pipe connections are already
established in the area and most of the industries are

</p>
<p id="p_59">The ambient air quality of the Morbi-Wankaner ceramic
industrial area was with high and alarming levels of
PM1o, PM2.5, 502. The concentrations of these pollutants
are exceeding many times more than the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Particulate
Matters (PM) emission primarily from spray dryers, use of
coal &amp; tar (illegal) in Hot air generator, and also due to
handling of raw materials such as coal, different types of
clay, poor road condition and vehicular movement. SO2
from spray drier (coal fired Hot air generators), and use
of synthetic gas in ceramic kiln, evaporators. The
groundwater analysis results show contamination (high
COD) at some bore wells which needs to be further
investigated through state level ground water board
/authority. Recently, it is informed that brownish color
ground water is observed in bore well.
</p>
<p id="p_60">As per Medium term measures given by Expert
Committee (Govt. of Gujarat) 2014, a study of spray
dryer was to be conducted, from pollution view point,
which shall incorporate survey related to the existing air
pollution control devices, ascertaining the adequacy of
installed system and suggesting addition /alterations to
fulfil the prescribed norms within six months by
environment departments of Engineering /Technical
Institutes and respective Industrial Associations should
bear the cost of the study. However, no action is visible
at site and the status quo of pollution discharge is
maintained.

</p>
<p id="p_62">A meeting was convened by CPCB on 31.05.2018 to
discuss the pollution matter relating to ceramic industries
using coal gasifiers in Morbi-Wakaner areas of Gujarat
among CPCB &amp; GPCB. In the meeting it was discussed &amp;
recorded that as the Senior Scientists of GPCB and CPCB
were part of the Committee (NGT Committee 2017),
there is no question of disagreeing with any of the
observations/recommendations made by the said
Committee. It implies that GPCB 'has to implement the
recommendation of the said Committee and considering
the gravity of problem in the Morbi-Wakaner. It was
informed by GPCB that consent to the Units is issued with
condition    to   achieve     the   ZLD     as    per   the
recommendations of Committee earlier constituted by
the Gujarat Govt. Strict action against the Units with Type
A gasifier has been initiated leading to closure. Action is
being taken in respect of Type B gasifier that do not meet
the ZLD conditions as per the NGT order dated
14.11.2017. GPCB further informed that they have
carried out fresh survey of industrial Units in compliance
of an order passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat
and submitted the report to the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_63">Considering that (a) the NGT Committee 2017 has
recommended to use for PNG for such time till a cleaner
technology for synthetic gas generation is demonstrated;
</p><p id="p_64">(b) the natural gas grid /pipe connections are already
established in the area; and (c) most of industries are
having connections, GPCB was requested to take steps to
implement the recommendation of using PNG."
</p>
<p id="p_65">21. In view of the above, it is clear that coal gasifiers are
no longer viable. Inspection by GPCB shows high level of
air pollution which is dangerous for health and
environment.       'Sustainable      Development'        and
'Precautionary' principles are to be upheld.

<p id="p_66">22. Purpose of economic development in any region is to
provide opportunities for improved living by removing
poverty    and    unemployment.      While   industrial

development invariably creates more jobs in any region,
such development has to be sustainable and compliant
with the norms of environment. In absence of this
awakening or tendency for monitoring, industrialization
has led to environmental degradation on account of
industrial pollution. It is imperative to ensure that steps
are taken to check such pollution to uphold statutory
norms. Adequate and effective pollution control methods
are necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_67">23. We may also note that as per data compiled by the
CPCB Morbi- Wankaner is one of the polluted industrial
clusters. Vide order dated 13.12.2018 in Original
Application No. 1038/2018, this Tribunal considered the
subject matter of critically polluted industrial clusters and
directed preparation of action plans by the respective
States for remedying the situation.
</p>
<p id="p_68">24. Even though, this area is polluted but not 'critically
polluted', the same may not be covered by the said
order, but the fact remains that there is high amount of
pollution as shown by the latest report of the GPCB
quoted above in para no. 13. PM10 is equal to 552.66
and PM2.5 is equal to 289.61. Stringent measures are,
thus, required in the interest of protection of
environment and public health.
</p>
<p id="p_69">25. Accordingly, we allow the applications and direct the
GPCB to close all coal gasifiers industries and units
operating with the help of coal gasifiers without prejudice
to such units switching over to non-coal gasifiers or PNG
or technology consistent with the above report. The GPCB
must initiate immediate steps for prosecution of the
industries which have operated in violation of law and
recover compensation for causing damage to the
environment and public health. This amount may be
assessed by a Committee with representatives of CPCB,
GPCB and NEERI. The CPCB will be the nodal agency for
coordination and compliance. The Committee may
suggest restoration plan.

Committee. According to Mr. Joshi, as the request of the writ
applicant for such evaluation has not been acceded by the
GPCB and the representation dated 30th July, 2018 (Annexure-
O to the writ application) has also not been answered, the writ
applicants were left with no other option but to come before
this Court with the present petition.
</p>
<p id="p_77">7.2     The submissions of Mr. Joshi can be broadly classified into
following categories;
</p>
<p id="p_78">(I)     Whether a writ of mandamus is maintainable?
</p>
<p id="p_79">(II)    Whether the reliefs prayed for in the writ application were
looked into by the National Green Tribunal and whether the
writ applicants are estopped, in any manner, from claiming the
same relief if at all such reliefs were looked into by the
National Green Tribunal and not granted?.

prefer an appeal, challenging the decision of the National
Green Tribunal?.
</p>
<p id="p_81">(IV)    Whether the prayer for evaluation of the new modified
technology is, in any manner, in conflict with the order of the
National Green Tribunal and whether such prayer could be
allowed without challenging the final order of the National
Green Tribunal?.

respondents that the final order of the National Green Tribunal
bars use of any kind of coal gasifier is correct and whether the
writ applicants have no scope to improve, by research and
development, a coal gasifier having zero discharge?.

<p id="p_83">(VI)   Whether the stance of the respondents that the "Modified
Type D Technology" is in substance "Type D" gasifier" only
and as tar is generated in the modified technology also, it is
not a technology consistent with the recommendations of the
Committee in its report of February, 2018?.
</p>
<p id="p_84">7.3        Mr. Joshi submitted that his client has a legal right to
get his technology inspected or tested through the GPCB, and
the GPCB owes a legal duty to inspect such equipment so that
the manufacturers of the Ceramic tiles and other products (i.e.
the writ applicants of the Special Civil Application No.6757 of
2019 and the Special Civil Application No.6774 of 2019) can
use such equipment, namely, the modified Type D gasifier and
can obtain consent from the GPCB under the Air (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/700405/" id="a_12">Section 17(1)(e)</a>         of the Air Act, one of the functions of the
State Board (i.e., the GPCB) is to inspect "any control
equipment" for the purpose of issuing directions as the Board
may consider it fit to take steps for prevention, control or
abatement of air pollution.          According to the learned senior
counsel, it is one of the functions of the GPCB to inspect the
modified Type D gasifier so as to ascertain whether it controls
air pollution or not.

with the pollution norms. In such circumstances, according to
Mr. Joshi, a writ of mandamus is the only remedy to ensure
that the GPCB performs its function and duty in accordance
with law.
</p>
<p id="p_86">7.5       It is further submitted that the writ applicants have
developed or rather invented the "modified Type D gasifier"
technology as the writ applicants are engaged in the "trade
and business" of manufacturing such equipment.                        The writ
applicants have a fundamental right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_15">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of
the Constitution to carry on such trade or business.                         It is
submitted that under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a> as well as
the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">Water Act</a>, the GPCB is obliged in law to guide or advise
the   State      Government    on    any       matter   relating        to     the
prevention, control, or abatement of air or water pollution. In
such circumstances, the GPCB should be asked to look into the
"modified Type D" gasifier technology.
</p>
<p id="p_87">7.6       Mr. Joshi further submitted that the final order passed
by the National Green Tribunal on the basis of the report of the
Committee is dated 6th March, 2019. The reliefs prayed for in
this petition are with regard to the research and development
undertaken by the writ applicants around July, 2018, i.e., after
the report of the Committee of February, 2018. Thus, there is a
substantial development after the report of the Committee of
February, 2018.         Mr. Joshi submitted that the applications
which were preferred by the writ applicants herein as also by
the manufacturers of the Ceramic goods before the National
Green Tribunal came to be rejected as not maintainable under
<a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_18">Sections 14</a> and <a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_19">15</a> respectively of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_20">National Green Tribunal

remedy now available to the writ applicants is to prefer the
present petition and pray for a writ of mandamus. Mr. Joshi
submitted that the modified Type D gasifier is an improved and
advanced technology and it is consistent with the report of the
Committee of February, 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_88">7.7       Mr. Joshi further submitted that the use of coal gasifier
is not absolutely barred or prohibited by virtue of the final
order of the National Green Tribunal because no such bar or
prohibition, for all times to come, was recommended by the
Committee in its report of February, 2018.             Mr. Joshi further
pointed out that the stance of the GPCB before this Court in
the present litigation is quite contrary to the stance taken by it
before the National Green Tribunal.             It is pointed out that in
view of the advance technology in the Type D gasifier, the
GPCB      issued        amendments     to      the   CTE     (Consent           to
Establishment) in favour of large number of manufacturers of
Ceramic goods including many of the writ applicants of the
Special Civil Application Nos.6757 of 2019 and 6774 of 2019
respectively, permitting them to use the Type D gasifiers. It is
argued that during the spot visit of such units, no pollution
whatsoever was noticed by the officers of the GPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_89">7.8    Mr. Joshi submitted that the modified Type D gasifier is
not in substance. the "Type D gasifier". The technology is
altogether different. Although tar is generated even in the
modified Type D technology, yet the same technology is
consistent with the recommendations of the Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_90">7.9    It is further submitted that if the evaluation of the

violated. The NGT has directed the GPCB to close all the coal
gasifier industries and units without prejudice to three
eventualities; switching over to the technology consistent with
the report of February, 2018 being one of them. Since the
modified Type-D gasifier technology is consistent with the
above report which has laid emphasis on zero discharge by
gasifier technology for synthetic gas generation, the closure
orders deserve to be withdrawn, and the Units operating with
the new technology of modified Type-D gasifiers, which is
consistent with the above report, deserve to be allowed trial
run for evaluating and verifying whether the new technology is
pollution compliant and zero discharge, or not.
</p>
<p id="p_91">7.10 It is also submitted that the PNG and other natural gases
are not only scarce in availability but also very expensive.
Therefore, the Committee has recommended use of coal as a
replacement to PNG, subject of course to zero discharge and
compliance with the pollution norms. At para 2.1 of the report
(running page 444 and also at running page 445, 446 and 447
of the report), the Committee has referred to PNG and CNG
being   scarce         resource   and      synthetic   gas     using        clean
technology being much cheaper and economically viable, while
also referring to the desire expressed by the Hon'ble Prime
Minister for reducing the energy import dependency. Thus, the
use of coal for the synthetic gas generation is recommended
and desired by the Committee also, and therefore the
synthetic gas generation by using coal in the modified Type-D
gasifier, which is a clean technology and also much cheaper
and economically viable, should not only be allowed and
recommended but also encouraged.

operating is ex-facie incorrect, and the statement that all the
units are presently functionals is false. It is pointed out that in
para 10.1 of the affidavit of the GPCB itself (running page 342),
it is stated on oath that there are 566 units having gasifier and
no such unit was found in operation. and that 295 industries
were in operation using the PNG as fuel. It is stated in the

such large scale manufacturers, intend to eliminate the small
and medium scale manufacturers of Morbi and Wankaner area,
because such small and medium scale manufacturers having
less production cost could sell in domestic market and also by
way of export their goods at a cheaper price. The large scale
manufacturers of ceramic goods intend to thwart the healthy
competition posed by the manufacturers like the Petitioners of
the Special Civil Applications Nos.6757 and 6774 of 2019, and
also the research and development oriented company like M/s.

renowned entities located in countries like Germany, Australia,
Russia,   Sweden,         USA    etc.       for       technology    development.
Unfortunately, the State Board, which took a pragmatic view
before the NGT for such research and development oriented
industry and also for ceramic goods manufacturers using
cleaner technology has now taken an unreasonable and
arbitrary stance resulting in elimination of a huge class of
manufacturers in one entire area in the State of Gujarat,
though    such         stance   for     not     evaluating      the      Petitioner's

<p id="p_118">8.11 Ms. Shah submitted that a bare perusal of the aforesaid
paragraphs of the report would indicate that the Expert
Committee consisting of the representatives of the GPCB,
CPCB and NEERI have clearly opined that to curb the menace
of pollution, it is necessary to change the technology and shift
to the fluidized bed gasifiers, which does not generate
condensate waste water and tar and that too after obtaining all
the necessary approvals. It is also emerging from the said
report that the condensate waste water and coal tar which are
invariable generated from the gasifier, cumulatively have a
very serious impact on the eco-system as large number of
ceramic industries exist in and around Morbi.
</p>
<p id="p_119">8.12 Ms. Shah further submitted that the gasifier technology is
of three types, viz. (1) moving bed gasifier, (2) fluidized bed
gasifier and (3) entrained bed gasifier and the writ applicant-
company is manufacturing coal gasifier, and for which they are
seeking direction for evaluation of "modified Type-D gasifier
which is also based on moving bed gasifier technology to
which the committee and the Respondent No. 2 as its

constituent has not found to be compliant with the pollution
norms. It is further submitted that the writ applicant- company
is manufacturing coal gasifier based on the moving bed and
updraft technology where there is a generation of coal tar and
waste water. The same has a serious carcinogenic effect on
the environment and, therefore, the Expert Committee in their
February, 2018 report, opined in unequivocal terms that
instead of further experimenting with the older moving coal
bed gasifiers, the advanced fluidized bed gasifier should be
designed     and       the   New        Advanced       Fluidized      bed       clean
technology      gasifiers        that   do     not    generate       condensate
wastewater and tar waste should be encouraged.
</p>
<p id="p_120">8.13 Ms. Shah also submitted that there is a direct nexus
between the proceedings concluded before the National Green
Tribunal and the present proceedings. From the record, it can
be seen that the writ applicants are seeking relief from this
Court to direct the respondent authorities to examine and
evaluate the modified Type-D gasifier. The same is contrary to
the decision rendered by the National Green Tribunal as the
Tribunal    has        already     considered        all   the    aspects         and
contentions of the parties, including the written submissions of
the writ applicants as well as the report of the committee
which clearly reveals that the coal gasifier which generates
condensate wastewater and coal tar should be immediately
removed and the advanced fluidized based clean technology
gasifiers which do not generate condensate wastewater and
coal tar should be encouraged. Ms. Shah                     further submitted
that when the Tribunal has considered the merits of the
application preferred by the present writ applicants, for the
identical reliefs, this Court may not exercise its extraordinary

<p id="p_121">8.14 Ms. Shah, in the last, submitted that there has been an
intangible positive impact on the environment due to the
change in the technology. The switch over from the moving
bed gasifiers to the PNG has drastically reduced the air
pollution in the area so as to provide ambient air to the public
at large. It is pointed out that due to the implementation of the
order passed by the Tribunal, the consumption of coal has
been reduced and for transporting the same, the vehicular
emission in the area has also substantially reduced.

the NGT as the NGT held the Application of the Petitioner
to be simplicitor non-maintainable. [Pg 20 Pr. 13, Pg. 24
Pr. 2,]. In fact, the Petitioner even goes to the extent of
expressly claiming that the NGT did not decide its
Application on merits. [Pg. 357 Pr. 2]

</p><p id="p_126">(iv) The Application having been held to be non-
maintainable, therefore the Petitioner cannot avail the
remedy of statutory Appeal provided under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_127">(v) The Technology of the Petitioner has been examined
by 3 premier institutes and found to be appropriate.
</p>
<p id="p_128">3.    At. the very outset, it is pertinent to point that in
the said proceedings before the Ld. Tribunal, several
reports were filed by the Statutory Authorities including
reports jointly prepared by GPCB, CPCB and NEERI. The
said reports noted the alarmingly polluted state of Morbi
in all three forms, i.e., Solid, Water and Gaseous [Pg.
320]. The committee also examined various types of
gasification technologies, i.e., Type-A, B, C, D, &amp; E. After
considering the above findings of the committee set up
by it regarding the dire state of environment at Morbi,
the Ld. Tribunal had come to a conclusion that 'Coal
based gasifiers' were no longer viable. [Pg. 325, Pr. 21].
The said finding alongwith the previous paragraph makes
it apparent that coal gasification in its all forms has been
banned.
</p>
<p id="p_129">4.    Consequently, the Ld. Tribunal directed that all
gasifiers operating with coal were to be shut down. [Pg.
326, Pr. 25]. Thus, what the Ld. Tribunal has banned is
the usage of coal in gasifier technology and not the coal
gasification technology as it existed at the time of
passing of the Order dated 06.03.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_130">The said directions are not unprecedented. The Hon'ble
Apex Court in <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_27">M. C. Mehra v. Union of India and Ors</a>.
(1997) 2 SCC 353 (Popularly known as the 'Taj Corridor

state of pollution in and around the Taj Mahal in Agra,
had directed that the immediate stopping of glass

Coke/Coal would have to re-locate in terms of the
directions of the Hon'ble Apex Cottrt. [Pg. 384, Pr. 34].
</p>
<p id="p_131">It is relevant to mention that the Ld. Tribunal, while
passing the directions has expressly noted that the
principles of Sustainable Development and Precautionary
Principle of Environmental Jurisprudence were to be
upheld. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment quoted
above has noted that remediation of damaged
environment is a part of process and sustainable
development as such the polluters are liable to pay the
cost to individual sufferers as well as the cost of
reversing the damaged ecology. It is in light of the said
principle that the Ld. Tribunal has not only banned coal
gasifiers but had also set up a committee to suggest a
restoration plan, the cost of which was to be included in
other costs to be ascertained by the Committee. [Pg. 326
Pr. 25 and Pg. 327 Pr. 27]

</p><p id="p_132">5.    The Ld Tribunal also considered the precautionary
principle under which the steps must be taken to
anticipate, prevent and attack the causes environmental
degradation. Having come to the express conclusion that
coal gasification process causes environmental pollution
and noting the alternative of LNG/CNG gasification
process, the Ld. Tribunal directed the banning of the
polluting coal.
</p>
<p id="p_133">6.    As the direction of the Ld Tribunal are clear,
unequivocal and unambiguous, therefore any purported
improvement in the process by the Petitioners cannot be
considered as the fuel they are using has been banned.
The modification claimed by the Petitioner cannot be a
ground for interfering with the express and unambiguous
direction of the Ld. NGT banning coal.
</p>
<p id="p_134">7.    The above submission gains significance, as even
otherwise, not only were the contention put by the
Petitioner before this Hon'ble Court, in consideration
before the Ld. NGT, the same was rejected by the Ld.
Tribunal. Even as per the Petitioner, it made written as
well as oral submission regarding the development done
by during the period of pendency of the proceedings. [Pg.
12 Pr.19]

</p><p id="p_135">8.      The Ld. Tribunal expressly needs the submission of

the industries that the technology has been modified and
improved and there could be no objection to industries
continuing to operate alter the use of the new
technology. [Pg.311 Pr.2]. The Ld. Tribunal also recorded
the submission of the complainant that the claim of
manufacturer of zero % pollution should not he
considered by the Ld. Tribunal, in light of the highly
polluted and degraded state of environment in Morbi
area as recorded in the committee report of 2018 [Pg.
315 Pr. 11]. Accordingly with the intention of remedying,
the pollution already existing in Morbi town [Pg. 311 .Pr.
1]. It is wrong to allege that the issue was not considered
by the Tribunal. The Ld. Tribunal considered all aspects
including the contention of the Petitioner and banned the
usage of coal as a fuel.
</p>
<p id="p_136">9.    The Petitioner is misrepresentation facts when its
allege that it has been ousted on the ground of
simplicitor maintainability. In fact, after considering all
aspects, the Ld. Tribunal came to express conclusion that
the stand of the industries and manufacturers had 'No
Merit'., [Pg 327 Pt 30.] The lack of merit is clear in the
observations of the Ld. Tribunal with respect to the
degraded environment of Morbi and the obvious pollution
caused by coal gasification.
</p>
<p id="p_137">10. The Petitioner are aware that their claim is despite
and in the teeth of the Order of the Ld NGT. For the said
reason, the Writ as filed originally impugned the Order
dated 06.03.2019. does in fact impugn the action of the
Ld Tribunal. Subsequently, with the intention of playing
subterfuge, the Petitioner withdrew the prayer
challenging the Order of the Ld NGT and sought the
directly contingent relief of consideration of its
modification. Even in its present form, the Petition
impugns the acts of the Ld NGT [Pg. 13 Pr. 21]. Petitioner
thus are clearly want to circumvent the law direction of
the Ld NGT by abusing the Writ jurisdiction of this Honble
Court. The relief prayed for by the Petitioner, in essence,
compel the Respondent authorities to commit what would
be deliberate violation of the Order of the Ld NGT. It is
trite principle of law that a party cannot do indirectly
what it cannot do indirectly:
</p>
<p id="p_138">11. As the Petitioner seeks a relief in the teeth of the Ld
NGT's Order, therefore the same can only be claimed by

filing an Appeal as provided under Section 22 of the NGT
Act. The said Section clearly stipulates that 'any person'
aggrieved by an Order passed by the NGT, can challenge
the same by filing an Appeal before the Honble Supreme
Court. The same would be more applicable in the present
case, where a party has been impleaded by way of an
express Order but denied the benefit as it was found to
be non-meritorious. Thus, the appropriate remedy is for
the Petitioner to challenge the Order of the Ld NGT by
filing an Appeal before the Honble Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_139">12. Assuming but not admitting that it is not clear as to
the whether the claim of the Petitioner was considered or
not and what was the scope of the direction issued by the
Ld NGT, the same can only be clarified by way of the
approaching the Ld NGT again. The extraordinary Writ
jurisdiction cannot be exercised to clarify the Order of the
Ld NGT, when clearly another efficacious remedy is
available to get the same relief.
</p>
<p id="p_140">13. The Petitioner in support of its contention had also
submitted that the decision of the Honble Apex Court in
MG Mehta v UOI &amp; Ors 1999 7 SCC 522. The said decision
came to be passed in an entirely distinguishable and
different circumstances. The permission in the said case
was sought for a work of National Importance i.e.
resurfacing of airport runways [Pg 533 Pr. 11].
Furthermore, the permission to run the Hot Mixer was
sought only for a period on one year. [Pg. 523 Pr. 2]. The
case of the Petitioner in the said case was that it was not
possible to set up and run the Hot Mix plant from
anywhere else as (a) The hot mix need to be maintained
at very high temperature prior to paying it on runway. If
the place of preparation is kept far then it would be not
possible to maintain the temperature. [Pg 523 Seriatim
c], (b) Preparation at a far away place would entail over
100 trucks having to transport the premix, which would
cause traffic jam and be uncertain in light of traffic
restrictions [Pg 523 Seriatim f-h]. Additionally, the same
could also cause a security risk at Airport [Pg 532 Pr. 9].
</p>
<p id="p_141">In 'the present case, the permission is sought for
fulfillment of private interest of the Petitioners. The same
in no manner is related to National Interest or
importance. Furthermore, there is very much a viable
alternative available i.e. usage of gas as a fuel. Hence,

the said judgment cannot be relied upon.
</p>
<p id="p_142">14. The Petitioner have failed to fulfill the requisite for
issuance of Writ of Mandamus. The Petitioner have failed
to substantiate any right to claim, let alone be entitled to
relief as prayed. The Petitioner is the entity which had
allegedly modified the technology and not the user of the
said technology itself. There is no premise basis in law for
the Petitioner to demand the grant of approval by
Respondent authorities. Furthermore, for a Writ of
Mandamus to be issued, there must also be a
corresponding duty on the part of a State or Public
Authority: In the present dispute, the Petitioner have
failed to state the duty on the part of the Respondent
authority to examine and approve any technology,
especially when the said issue has been put to rest by
the Ld NGT. It is submitted that the Respondent authority
are subject to the jurisdiction of the Ld NGT and therefore
bound by its Orders.
</p>
<p id="p_143">15. The Petitioner have not provided as to why do they
want to revert to coal gasification when the same is not
as beneficial as gas. Mere commercial advantage cannot
be basis for reverting to polluting fuel, in the presence of
an option of a cleaner fuel. In fact, the Ld NGT has
specifically directed that compensation to be imposed
should be such that it renders any polluting activity such
as coal gasification, unprofitable. Thus, the spirit of the
Ld NGT's order is to discourage of any polluting activity,
even if otherwise found permissible. It is thus submitted
that advent of Courts and Authorities should always in
favor of the view points which favor the environment the
most, rather than forsaking it.
</p>
<p id="p_144">16. Lastly, the Petitioner have not shown the exact cause
of action on the basis of which the Petitioner has
approached this Honble Court. It is submitted that while
the Petitioner has claimed that its representation have
not been considered by the Respondent Authority, it has
not disclosed any such representation. In case the
Petitioner claims that its development are not within the
scope of the Ld NGT Order, the Petitioner ought to reveal
any representation made by the Petitioner subsequent to
the Order of the Ld NGT which has not been considered
by the Respondent Authority. In the absence of any such
representation, the present Petition is misconceived and

      be dismissed."
</p>
<p id="p_146">10.   Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and having gone through the materials on record, the
only question that falls for our consideration is whether the
writ applicants of the Special Civil Application No.6756 of 2019
have made out any case for issue of writ of mandamus to the
GPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_147">11.   Before we proceed to deal with the rival submissions
canvassed on either side, we would like to first look into the
findings recorded by the Committee in its report of February,
2018. On the issue of alternate coal gasifiers, the findings
recorded by the Committee in its report are as under;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">      "Alternate Coal Gasifiers

      Gas produced by partial heating of coal in the presence
      of water producing H2, CO and light hydrocarbon are
      called producer gas. If the producer composition is
      changed by altering the CO and H2 ratio to suit a
      particular combustion requirement, it will be called
      synthetic gas. The gasifiers in Morbi are producer gas
      generators.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      The gasifiers can be classified based on the technology
      used in the shell. Currently, there are three types of
      technology used worldwide namely packed moving bed,
      fluidized bed and entrained bed gasifiers. In a moving
      bed gasifier, there are two possibilities i.e. updraft and
      downdraft gasifier. In the case of updraft gasifier, air is
      forced inside the gasifier shell from the bottom. where
      lowest coal layer is burned at a temperature of 1100 °C
      and the hot air and steam moves upward through the
      packed coal bed. In the upper layers of packed coal bed.</blockquote>
<p id="p_148">      the temperature gradually falls and reaches about 400 °C
      at the outlet of gasifier. The entire coal bed is packed

with coal of 20 to 50 mm coal, which interacts with hot
air and steam at varying temperature. Producer gas and
tar is formed across the entire depth of coal bed at
different temperatures. At lower layer of the shell having
higher temperature (1000-1100 °C), CO. H2 and light
molecular weight tar (like CH4. C2H2) formation takes
place. As the hot air and steam moves up and encounters
coal at lower temperatures, relatively lesser quantity of
producer gas (CO, H2) and large amount higher chain
hydrocarbons or poly aromatic compounds (like PAH. BaP
etc.) called tar is formed.
</p>
<p id="p_149">AII these organic molecules (tar) are volatile and remain
in gaseous phase at the temperature that is encountered
in the gasifier shell and gets condensed, whenever the
temperature falls below respective boiling point. In type
'B' &amp; 'C' gasifier, the tar is collected in ESP as the
temperature is lowered to such tar condensation levels.
In type 'D' gasifier. the temperature of the producer gas
is maintained high by jacketing the entire gas pipe line,
thereby not letting the tar condensation happen.
However at the burner end, the temperature fails and tar
condensation takes place. By the time hot gas reaches
burner valve from where it is fed to the kiln, the
temperature is usually brought to around 200 °C. Usually
flow control valve at high temperature cannot be
maintained as the seal of the valve (Teflon) may get
damaged.
</p>
<p id="p_150">Another type of packed bed gasifier is downdraft gasifier,
in which the air encounters highest temperature of solid
fuel in the last stage of its journey in the shell. However,
such gasifiers can be operated using bio-mass and
therefore have the limitation of calorific value and can
serve relatively shorter length of kiln. At Morbi, long kiln
(more than 300m) are used.
</p>
<p id="p_151">The other two technological alternatives to the gasifier
operation is the use of fluidized bed and entrained bed.
Both these gasifiers Operate at relatively higher
temperature and therefore generate relatively lesser
amount of lighter tar unlike the updraft gasifier
generating very heavy tar, which are toxic to the
ecosystem if not managed properly. Entrained bed
gasifiers operating at 1200-1400 °C are employed for
generating large quantity of producer gas and are

unlikely to be used by small scale ceramic industries and
therefore not discussed here.
</p>
<p id="p_152">Fluidized bed gasifiers operate in a temperature range of
850-950 °C and the amount of producer generated
corresponds to the needs of ceramic industries of Morbi
and therefore discussed here. In the fluidized bed
gasifier, the coal size is up to 6 mm thereby providing
large surface area of coal for reaction. Fluidized bed
gasifier provides higher retention time for reaction to
take place thereby reducing the formation of coal tar.
Since the temperature is relatively high, the formation of
large molecular weight tar is avoided and only light
molecular weight tar (like CH4, 0%) is formed. which
remains in gaseous phase at temperature encountered in
the entire gas pipe line. The moisture content of coal is
required to be maintained at 20% during coal
preparation. In case the moisture content is low in the
coal, additional pre-defined amount steam can be fed.
Separate moisture feeding as done in packed moving bed
is not required for fluidized bed gasifier.
</p>
<p id="p_153">For the advance fluidized bed gasifiers, additional coal
crushing units will be required, which also requires
appropriate dust pollution control device at coal crushing
units. In fluidized bed gasifier. the gas needs to be
.cleaned of its char, ash, and inert media by using
appropriate particle removal device like cyclone.
</p>
<p id="p_154">The currently installed gasifiers in Morbi area uses steel
for fabrication, which are not actually certified to be used
for high temperature operations. In the case of advanced;
gasifiers, care should be taken to ensure that the
material of fabrication be certified material suitable for
high temperature operations with proper refractory and
fulfills all industrial safety norms. The advanced
technology gasifier would be costly compared to the
currently installed moving bed gasifiers and therefore to
ensure its economy, the option of installing single gasifier
for a cluster of ceramic industry should be considered. In
this case the ceramic industry will be free from the
responsibility of operating, maintaining and pollution
issues of gasifiers. Only the gasifier operator will have
the responsibility of maintaining the gasifier operation
and the ceramic industry will get the clean synthetic gas.

      installing and operating moving bed gasifiers are
      appreciated, however, due to increasing pollution
      problem. they are advised to change the technology and
      shift to fluidized bed gasifier as indigenous entrepreneurs
      will be able to provide economical substitute to PNG,
      which is a scarce resource. Such advanced fluidized bed
      gasifiers be allowed with all regulatory clearances (Risk

</p>
<p id="p_162">The raw gas line is kept heated, thereby avoiding the
possibility of condensate wastewater generation till kiln

<p id="p_164">Tar remains in gaseous form &amp; is utilized in furnace as a

<p id="p_165">Small amount of Tar is generated near kiln end, which
gets solidified on cooling. Solidified Tar is broken and
again fed along with coal in the gasifier, if it remain in

<p id="p_182">Wastewater is generated in water seal/traps. It was
informed that due to high temperature, the wastewater
in seal/traps gets evaporated and therefore there is
always a need to replenish the water seal by adding fresh
water.
</p>
<p id="p_183">There is a likely possibility that synthetic gas may carry
(evaporate) some amount of water while passing through
the water seal. This happens if the synthetic gas remains
unsaturated while passing through water-seal. in this
case. the water level in the water-seal gets reduced over
time.
</p>
<p id="p_184">The data of coal tar generation is not property
maintained by the operators. It is informed that 0.5 to 1.0
kg/burner/day. It is also claimed that approximately 40
kg Tar is generated per day in a gasifier that consumes
12.5 Ton coal daily. This tar cannot be recycled into the
gasifier.
</p>
<p id="p_185">This is a moving bed gasifier formation of coal tar cannot
be avoided.
</p>
<p id="p_186">Since producer gas is maintained hot from gasifier to kiln
burner by insulating the pipeline. tar is not condensed
out, except in small quantum near burner. The producer
gas contains tar, which makes the flame color yellow I
orange.
</p>
<p id="p_187">Disposal of huge amount of exhausted filter media (road
metal/gitti/ black stone i.e. Kapachl) will be an issue.
Used filter media is coated with carbon dust and tar. As
claimed by the supplier &amp; some industries, the used
aggregates use for road construction. Earlier committee
recommended for hot mix plant for making asphalt road,
however, huge quantum and quality of the used
aggregates needs to be ascertained from respective
department /institute. Further, haphazard disposal of
such aggregates once quantum is more cannot be ruled
out. Huge quantum of Filter media coated with tar and
coal dust whose disposal may be another environmental
issue.

      (DISH)

      Based on visual observations and analysis of results of
      water/wastewater from earthen lagoon/ ponds, drains in
      the area, it may be concluded that discharges from
      ceramic industries having gasifier are taking place which
      resulted into contamination of water In earthen
      lagoons/ponds, drains.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">      This also shows that ceramic industries do not practice
      zero discharge condition given by GPCB and illegally
      discharging wastewater which is supposed to be
      evaporated in evaporators. The reasons for the illegal
      discharges may be technical such as improper/non-
      functional evaporators, excessive steam from evaporator
      not required for gasification, direct scrubbing of gases
      instead of indirect cooling/cleaning in gasifier operation
      and economical i.e. to save expenditure incurred during
      operation of evaporators etc.

      Groundwater monitoring shows some contamination due
      to COD concentration at some wells. Regular monitoring
      needs to be carried out to ascertain the things.

      of ambient air quality monitoring results shows the same
      that Particulate Matter (PM10), PM2,5 exceeds the
      NAAQS at all the locations. The concentration of PM in the
      area is more due to spray dryers for manufacturing body
      clay for ceramic tiles, handling of raw material in such
      industries (different clay, materials, coal etc.), road
      conditions in the area, movement of trucks (carrying raw
      material/products) and different vehicles and haphazard
      disposal of solid waste generated from ceramic industries
      (mostly vitrified tiles).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">      The concentration of SO2 is also exceeds the NAAQS at
      five locations. The presence of high concentration of S02
      in the atmosphere confirms that the spray driers use
      lignite, 'coal fines and coal tar generated in the gasifier
      for hot air generation (HAG). Besides spray drier units,
      gasifiers that use synthetic gas for wastewater
      evaporation and in the ceramic units (kiln) emit large
      amount of sulfur as these units do not have flue gas de-
      sulfurization     (scrubber)  system.   The    very   high

few days prior to the visit of the committee members.
Many of them were shut down temporarily till the
committee members complete the inspection and leave
the industrial area. Therefore, only those industries,
which were in operation during the visit of the committee
can be gauged about its compliance issue. If the decision
is taken based on the non-compliance of operating coal
gasifiers, only those gasifiers, which were operational
during the committee's visit will be shut down and non-
operational gasifier will be spared. These gasifiers can
pollute the environment and the purpose of making a
committee and inspection will be defeated.
</p>
<p id="p_195">One of the reason for operating coal gasifiers for clean
gas compared to easily available PNG as stated by the
locals is that the PNG usage can be quantified by
metering device, which can be correlated to the ceramic
product quantity. On the other hand, synthetic coal gas
cannot be quantified as no proper data recorded is
maintained for coal quantity, quality, water consumption,
wastewater generation and coal tar generation etc. Some
of these data are outside the scope of SCADA system.
This helps the manufacturer to hide the product quantity,
thereby evading the excise duty (now GST). However, the
committee cannot comment on any such activity. The
committee did not find even a qualified gasifier operator
at any of the units. No proper data on gasifier operation
was provided by them.
</p>
<p id="p_196">There are 13 type 'A' gasifiers were found during the
inspection by the committee. These gasifiers were not in
operation during the visit. Some of them were not in
operation since long, however. some gasifiers were found
with wastewater and tar which shows these gasifiers

were operational in immediate past. Type 'A' gasifiers
were to be closed down and presence of type 'A' gasifier
is gross violation of the GPCB regulatory norms. GPCB
must ensure that all type 'A' gasifier should be
dismantled.
</p>
<p id="p_197">There are 384 type 'B' gasifiers visited by the committee
including 315 having valid CCA (as per GPCB record-316
gasifier with valid CCA). Out of them 254 were in
operation and 130 were non-operating. There may be
many more type 'B' gasifiers installed in the industrial
area. GPCB may find out such gasifiers. Irrespective of
their compliance status. all type 'B' gasifiers should be
shut down and dismantled. Some gasifiers may claim
that they were operating the gasifiers with full
compliance condition as laid down by CCA and therefore
they should be permitted to be continued. This
committee does not find type 'B' gasifier, a clean
technology and therefore must be shut down.
</p>
<p id="p_198">Gasifier operators stated about the type of their gasifier
and accordingly, 5 nos of type 'C' gasifiers were listed.
However, it was found that only one gasifier at M/s.
Shyam Ceramics permitted under trial run was having tar
reformer-cum-wastewater evaporator. Remaining other
four gasifiers initially with rotary tar reformer-cum-
wastewater     evaporator    has    been    modified    to
evaporators. The tar generated is disposed by having
MoU with sodium Silicate/cement industries as per CCA.
Therefore. these 4 gasifiers are considered to be type 'B'
gasifiers.
</p>
<p id="p_199">As per GPCB records, they have given trial run
permission to 15 type 'D' gasifiers out of which. the
committee has inspected 11 industries. These gasifiers
have started operating for the 3-6 months. GPCB has not
given Consent to establish (CTE) to this type of gasifier.
These gasifier are installed though consent to establish
not issued to them and GPCB has given trial run
permission to all these gasifiers for one month. GPCB
needs to stop their operation.

<p id="p_200">2     Ceramic industries are found to have Type-E
gasifiers but were not in operation for more than 2 years.
These industries were operational with PNG.

management and to full-fill the Zero liquid discharge

reused/recycled back to gasifier. These evaporators are
shell &amp; tube type with flue hot gas generated by burning
syn gas.
</p>
<p id="p_202">However, these evaporators are not properly designed.
There is no control over feeding of steam to gasifier. It is
described in chapter-2, that all the wastewater cannot be
recycled to gasifier through evaporator by converting in
to steam due to various technical/ economical [operation
&amp; maintenance reasons and therefore at some point of
time the wastewater is discharged out or steam release
to atmosphere against consent condition. This consent
condition is not technically as well as practically possible
(observing the wastewater discharge in environment and
steam release to atmosphere). During visits, it was
observed that out of 254 operational gasifiers, 156
evaporators were operational and out of these
operational evaporators 86 evaporators were releasing
steam to atmosphere (Fig 5.6-iii). If all the gasifiers and
their evaporators would have been operational, then
practice of steam release to atmosphere would have
been more. No proper disposal mechanism of the
concentrate generated from the evaporator was
observed.
</p>
<p id="p_203">Almost all the evaporators are provided with pipe for
feeding steam to gasifier, along with vent with butter
valve for bypass/ release of steam to atmosphere. Even if
it is consider as safety provision, then there is no valve
with rupture disc. It is also reported by GPCB officials that
this is their routine practice due to reasons as stated in
earlier Chapter 2.
</p>
<p id="p_204">Wastewater and tar were found to be spread inside and
outside 32 gasifiers premises. During the visits, though
some of the industries were feeding condensate
wastewater steam to gasifier as per the consent
condition and were maintaining zero liquid discharge
(ZLD). These compliances can be only during the
inspection and there is no mechanism to monitor and
control their discharge outside the premises.

<p id="p_220">15.   The final recommendations of the Committee are
as under;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">      "6.1 Examination [Evaluation of Gasifier Technologies

      Type 'A': There are 13 type 'A' gasifiers were found
      during the inspection by the committee. These gasifiers
      were not in Operation. Some of them were not in
      operation since long, however. some gasifiers were found
      with wastewater and tar which shows these gasifiers
      were operational in immediate past. Since, this type of
      gasifiers are not permitted, GPCB must ensure that all
      type 'A' gasifier should be dismantled.</blockquote>
<p id="p_221">      Type 'B': Earlier expert committee (2014) suggested that
      type 'B' gasifier can be permitted to operate if the
      wastewater generated during gas cleaning/condensation
      is recycled back to the gasifier shell by the use of
      evaporator. Accordingly GPCB granted amended CTE/CCA
      for the operation of type 'B' gasifiers. However, this
      committee finds that type 'B' gasifier cannot be operated
      by recycling condensate wastewater in the gasifier shell
      as the condensate wastewater generated is in excess of
      the required moisture for shift reaction. This is the
      reason, almost all type 'B' gasifier operators illegally
      discharge wastewater either through open drain, in low

lying areas, abandoned mines etc. and/or steam release
to atmosphere. During the inspection of industries, it was
found that there are 71 gasifiers that operate evaporator
and feed wastewater steam inside the gasifier shell. This
can only be a temporary phenomenon as complete
wastewater cannot be fed on continuous basis. These
gasifiers can discharge condensate wastewater outside
the premises illegally and it is not possible for GPCB to
keep track of the wastewater generated and its recycle.
An argument put forth is that the evaporator operates
only for a few hour and feed the complete steam inside
the gasifier shell. Such argument does not stand as the
condensate wastewater generation is a continuous
process and even if intermediate tanks of very large
capacity is built, all will get filled at some instance during
the operation of gasifier. Therefore, this committee
recommends that all gasifier of type '8' must be shut
down immediately, dismantled safely.
</p>
<p id="p_222">Type 'C': Condensate wastewater with indirect cooling
and Tar (Wet ESP) is stated to be recycled into gasifier
shell by heating it at high temperature in the Tar
reformer. The recycling operation is carried out on the
premises that the moisture fed inside the gasifier shell
will be the stoichiometric requirement of amount of coal
tar recycled. The coal tar generated itself is an emulsion
of water and coal tar due to its collection mechanism
(Wet ESP). The moisture content of coal tar should be
sufficient to take part in the shift reaction and any
additional moisture may not be needed. The condensate
wastewater will be recycled again in the subsequent
condensation and this in turn will accumulate the
wastewater in the gasifier system as happens in the case
of type 'B' gasifier. Thus, after a few days of operation,
type 'C' gasifier will generate and accumulate
condensate wastewater, which does not have economical
treatment option, and therefore its management will
always be major issue. Generation of condensate
wastewater and coal tar is not recommended.
</p>
<p id="p_223">Type 'D': This is hot gasifier and does not allow
condensation of moisture up to kiln. The entire moisture
is fed in the kiln. Since this is a hot gasifier, coal tar does
not get condensed and is fed directly to the kiln. This was
evident from the colour of the flame, which was
yellow/orange. A clean producer gas gives blue flame.

<p id="p_224">Raw gas cleaning through road metal/aggregates
(kapachi) filter generates large quantity of exposed/used
aggregate filter media. Huge quantum of Filter media
coated with tar and coal dust whose disposal may be
another environmental issue. High molecular weight
(class 5) coal tar gets condensed just before the kiln
burner and gets solidified as soon as its moisture is
evaporated. Solid coal tar cannot be fed from the bottom
of the shell. If solid coal tar is fed from the top, it gets
vaporized and again reappear in the raw synthetic gas
thereby accumulating coal tar in each successive cycles.
Type 'D' gasifier will have the problem of solid coal tar
and disposal of large quantity of used contaminated
aggregates. Generation of coal tar and contaminated
filter  media     (aggregate)     from    gasifier is    not
recommended.
</p>
<p id="p_225">Type 'E': is based on down draft and agro based fuel
where no cooling and cleaning of gas is required and
therefore no wastewater and tar generation. Bio-mass
based fuel does not generate heavy hydrocarbon, and
therefore Tar, which is heavy hydrocarbon is not formed.
Steam is not added in the gasifier, instead moisture of
bio-mass is considered sufficient for H2 formation. Due to
very low amount of moisture feed, wastewater is not
generated.
</p>
<p id="p_226">Even if condensate wastewater and coal tar is generated
from gasifiers in small amount in Morbi Wankaner
Industrial cluster, its cumulative impact on the ecosystem
is very severe as there are very large number of ceramic
industries exists. Management and handling of
wastewater and hazardous waste (coal tar) from all
industries together exceeds the assimilative capacity of
the region and therefore any gasifier generating
condensate wastewater and coal tar should not be
permitted. Instead of further experimenting with older
moving coal bed gasifiers (currently existing in Morbi),
advanced fluidized bad gasifier should be designed along
with all pollution control device for meeting the clean
energy demands in Morbi region.

demonstrated, ceramic industries having gasifiers may
opt for PNG. Natural gas grid/pipe connections are

    having connections."
</p><p id="p_228">ANALYSIS

</p><p id="p_229">16.   Thus, the experts have made themselves abundantly
clear that the use of coal gasifiers of any type should be
discontinued at any cost.        The experts have also made
themselves very clear that the Ceramic Industries                should
switchover to a cleaner technology and should opt for natural
gas, i.e., the PNG. In the report, it has been clearly stated that
the natural gas grid/pipelines are already laid and made
functional in the area and most of the Ceramic Industries have
opted for gas connections.         If that be so, then why an
exception should be carved out for the writ applicants of the
Special Civil Applications Nos.6757 of 2019 and 6774 of 2019
respectively.

<p id="p_230">17.   We fail to understand why are they insisting for coal
gasifiers may be with an advanced technology.                 We take
judicial notice of the fact that Morbi and the surrounding area
was a hell sometime back, and the Ceramic Industries, using
the coal gasifiers, are solely responsible for creating this hell.
As days were passing by, situation was getting more and more
worst.    The situation was so grim that the issue had to be
taken up with the National Green Tribunal and it is only after
the intervention of the National Green Tribunal and passing of
various orders, that steps came to be taken by the GPCB to
restrain the Ceramic Industries from using the coal gasifiers.
The coal gasifier of any type, be it with a better technology, is
not at all advisable. It will lead to further problems. With great
difficulty and with lot of efforts, the situation has been brought
in control. Even, as on date, the air quality is very poor. The
menace of coal gasifiers have not only created air pollution but

has also contaminated the soil to such an extent that the
underground water has also become contaminated.
</p>
<p id="p_231">18.   The writ applicants are talking about unemployment etc.
They have no right to say a word in this regard. The report
indicates that the workers, hailing from poor strata of society,
were found to be working in extremely bad conditions. The
workers were being exposed to most unhygienic conditions.
Even if there is unemployment on account of the closure of the
Ceramic Industries, using coal gasifiers, the same can be
approved because to ask the workers to die working in such
unhygienic conditions would be still worst.

<p id="p_232">19.   The workers are exposed to such an environment that
within a short time they would die of silicosis.

<p id="p_233">20.   We find this litigation, more particularly, the Special Civil
Application No.6756 of 2019 very unique. For the first time,
we have come across a case, in which, a private company,
engaged in the manufacturing of coal gasifier, is asking a Writ
Court boasting about its fine technology to issue a writ of
mandamus to the GPCB to look into the technology of the
Company and then take a decision whether to permit the
installation of the same in the Ceramic Industries. What is the
Company trying to convey?.             Is the Company trying to
advertise its technology by seeking a writ of mandamus?. Is
the GPCB and other statutory authorities duty bound to look
into the technology of the Company, more particularly, when
the same has been looked into by the committee of experts
and the NGT, as noted above. The situation, as on date, is that
at any cost, the coal gasifiers cannot be permitted to be used
in the Ceramic Industries.      The coal gasifier, of which, the

company is talking about,        also has its own shortcomings.
When 60 to 70 percent of the Ceramic Industries have
switched over to natural gas by taking connections from the
Gujarat Gas Company, then why the writ applicants in the
present case are still insisting for the coal gasifier. They are
only interested in their own profits. They are insisting for coal
gasifier because they may not be able to bear the expense of
natural gas. This hardly can be a ground for issue of any writ of
mandamus to the GPCB to look into the technology and take
an appropriate decision whether the same would serve the
purpose or not.
</p>
<p id="p_234">21.   Before an applicant could get a writ of mandamus or an
order in the nature of mandamus, he has to satisfy the court
that the following conditions are fulfilled.

cannot be granted merely for the asking but has to be
obtained where there is no alternative, efficacious and
adequate remedy. It cannot be used as an appeal against the
decision of a court, tribunal or an authority exercising statutory
power. It can only be issued as a last resort where the court is
satisfied that without its aid there would be failure of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_242">24. Mandamus is an action or judicial proceeding of a civil
nature extraordinary in the sense that it can be maintained
only when there is no other adequate remedy, prerogative in
its character to the extent that the issue is discretionary, to
enforce only clear legal rights, and to compel courts to take
jurisdiction or proceed in the exercise of their jurisdiction, or to
compel corporations, public and private, and public boards,
commissions, or officers, to exercise their jurisdiction or
discretion and to perform ministerial duties, which duties result
from    an     office,   trust,   or   station,    and   are     clearly       and
peremptorily enjoined by law as absolute and official (P.R.
Aiyar, Advanced Law Lexicon, (2005), Vol. III P. 2873.).
</p>
<p id="p_243">25.    Mandamus is not a writ of right and is not granted as a
matter of course (ex debito justitiae). Its grant or refusal is at
the discretion of the court. A court may refuse mandamus
unless it is shown that there is a clear legal right of the
applicant or statutory duty of the respondent and there is no
alternative remedy available to the applicant. (<a href="/doc/1702971/" id="a_28">Union of India v.
S.B. Vohra</a>, (2004) 2 SCC 150)

</p><p id="p_244">26. The discretion of the court, however, is not arbitrary and it
must be exercised fairly, reasonably and on sound and well
established legal principles.
</p>

<p id="p_245">27. The court, in the exercise of discretion, must take into
account wide variety of circumstances. It must consider the
facts of the case, the exigency which calls for the exercise of
discretion, the consequences of granting or refusing the writ,
the nature and extent of injury likely to ensue by the grant or
refusal of the writ, etc. In short, courts discretion must be
governed by considerations of public policy, public interest and
public good.
</p>
<p id="p_246">28.   Thus, we are not in agreement with any of the
submissions canvassed by the learned counsel on behalf of the
writ applicants for the reason that mandamus can be enforced
only, if the writ applicant satisfies the Court that there is an
existence of statutory or legal right recognized and protected
by law.
</p>
<p id="p_247">29.   In Wharton's Law Lexicon, the word 'Right' means; (1) is a
legally protected interest (2) is an averment of entitlement
arising out of legal rules (3) right is an interest recognised and
protected by moral or legal rules (4) right, comprehends every
right known to the law.

<p id="p_251">32.   Writ of mandamus cannot be issued merely because a
person is praying for. One must establish the right first and
then he must seek for the prayer to enforce the said right. If
there is failure of duty by the authorities or inaction, one can
approach the Court for mandamus. The said position is well
settled in a series of decisions.

and 12, the Supreme Court held thus,

     "11. The principles on which a writ of mandamus can be
     issued have been stated as under in The Law of
     Extraordinary Legal Remedies by F.G. Ferris and F.G.
     Ferris, Jr.:
</p><p id="p_256">     Note 187.-Mandamus, at common law, is a highly
     prerogative writ, usually issuing out of the highest court
     of general jurisdiction, in the name of the sovereignty,
     directed to any natural person, corporation or inferior
     court within the jurisdiction, requiring them to do some
     particular thing therein specified, and which appertains
     to their office or duty. Generally speaking, it may be said
     that mandamus is a summary writ, issuing from the
     proper court, commanding the official or board to which it
     is addressed to perform some specific legal duty to which
     the party applying for the writ is entitled of legal right to
     have performed.
</p><p id="p_257">     Note 192.-Mandamus is, subject to the exercise of a
     sound judicial discretion, the appropriate remedy to
     enforce a plain, positive, specific and ministerial duty
     presently existing and imposed by law upon officers and
     others who refuse or neglect to perform such duty, when
     there is no other adequate and specific legal remedy and
     without which there would be a failure of justice. The
     chief function of the writ is to compel the performance of
     public duties prescribed by statute, and to keep
     subordinate and inferior bodies and tribunals exercising
     public functions within their jurisdictions. It is not
     necessary, however, that the duty be imposed by statute;
     mandamus lies as well for the enforcement of a common
     law duty.
</p><p id="p_258">     Note 196.-Mandamus is not a writ of right. Its issuance
     unquestionably lies in the sound judicial discretion of the

court, subject always to the well-settled principles which
have been established by the courts. An action in
mandamus is not governed by the principles of ordinary
litigation where the matters alleged on one side and not
denied on the other are taken as true, and judgment
pronounced thereon as of course. While mandamus is
classed as a legal remedy, its issuance is largely
controlled by equitable principles. Before granting the
writ the court may, and should, look to the larger public
interest which may be concerned-an interest which
private litigants are apt to overlook when striving for
private ends. The court should act in view of all the
existing facts, and with due regard to the consequences
which will result. It is in every case a discretion
dependent upon all the surrounding facts and
circumstances. Note 206.- ... The correct rule is that
mandamus will not lie where the duty is clearly
discretionary and the party upon whom the duty rests
has exercised his discretion reasonably and within his
jurisdiction, that is, upon facts sufficient to support his
action. "
</p><p id="p_259">12.   These very principles have been adopted in our
country. <a href="/doc/146451/" id="a_33">In Bihar Eastern Gangetic Fishermen Coop.

decisions in Lekhraj Sathramdas Lalvani v. N.M. Shah, <a href="/doc/1734503/" id="a_34">Rai
Shivendra Bahadur (Dr.) v. Nalanda College</a> and <a href="/doc/1906492/" id="a_35">Umakant
Saran (Dr.) v. State of Bihar</a> this Court observed as
follows in para 15 of the Reports (SCC): (Sipahi Singh
case, SCC pp. 152-53)


"15. ... There is abundant authority in favour of the
proposition that a writ of mandamus can be granted only
in a case where there is a statutory duty imposed upon
the officer concerned and there is a failure on the part of
that officer to discharge the statutory obligation. The
chief function of a writ is to compel performance of public
duties prescribed by statute and to keep subordinate
tribunals and officers exercising public functions within
the limit of their jurisdiction. It follows, therefore, that in
order that mandamus may issue to compel the
authorities to do something, it must be shown that there
is a statute which imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved
party has a legal right under the statute to enforce its
performance.... In the instant case, it has not been shown

      by Respondent 1 that there is any statute or rule having
      the force of law which casts a duty on Respondents 2 to 4
      which they failed to perform. All that is sought to be
      enforced is an obligation flowing from a contract which,
      as already indicated, is also not binding and enforceable.
      Accordingly, we are clearly of the opinion that
      Respondent 1 was not entitled to apply for grant of a writ
      of mandamus under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a> the Constitution and the
      High Court was not competent to issue the same.
      Therefore, in order that a writ of mandamus may be
      issued, there must be a legal right with the party asking
      for the writ to compel the performance of some statutory
      duty cast upon the authorities...."
</p>
<p id="p_260">33.   Mandamus is the most valuable and essential remedy in
Administrative Justice resorted to supply want of some
appropriate ordinary remedy. The functions of the writ court is
to compel the performance of public duty, for which, the
person approaching the writ court should statutorily, has a
clear, specific and unequivocal, constitutional or statutory or
legal right to the relief sought for and the failure on the part of
those who are bound to perform certain duties and functions,
as laid down by the legislature or directions issued for the
purpose of enforcing the provisions of an enactment or of any
delegated or subordinate legislation. There must be a legal
right and corresponding legal duty.

<p id="p_261">34.   In State of Kerala v. A.Lakshmi Kutty, reported in
1986 (4) SCC 632, the Supreme Court held that a Writ of
Mandamus is not a writ of course or a writ of right but is, as a
rule, discretionary. There must be a judicially enforceable right
for the enforcement of which a mandamus will lie. The legal
right to enforce the performance of a duty must be in the
applicant himself. In general, therefore, the Court will only

enforce the performance of statutory duties by public bodies
on application of a person who can show that he has himself a
legal right to insist on such performance. The existence of a
right is the foundation of the jurisdiction of a Court to issue a
writ of Mandamus. The present trend of judicial opinion
appears to be that in the case of non- selection to a post, no
writ of mandamus lies.
</p>
<p id="p_262">35.   When a Writ of Mandamus can be issued, has been
summarised in Corpus Juris Secundum, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">      "Mandamus may issue to compel the person or official in
      whom a discretionary duty is lodged to proceed to
      exercise such discretion, but unless there is peremptory
      statutory direction that the duty shall be performed
      mandamus will not lie to control or review the exercise of
      the discretion of any board, tribunal or officer, when the
      act complained of is either judicial or quasi-judicial unless
      it clearly appears that there has been an abuse of
      discretion on the part of such Court, board, tribunal or
      officer, and in accordance with this rule mandamus may
      not be invoked to compel the matter of discretion to be
      exercised in any particular way. This principle applies
      with full force and effect, however, clearly it may be
      made to appear what the decision ought to be, or even
      though its conclusion be disputable or, however,
      erroneous the conclusion reached may be, and although
      there may be no other method of review or correction
      provided by law. The discretion must be exercised
      according to the established rule where the action
      complained has been arbitrary or capricious, or based on
      personal, selfish or fraudulent motives, or on false
      information, or on total lack of authority to act, or where
      it amounts to an evasion of positive duty, or there has
      been a refusal to consider pertinent evidence, hear the
      parties where so required, or to entertain any proper
      question concerning the exercise of the discretion, or
      where the exercise of the discretion is in a manner
      entirely futile and known by the officer to be so and there
      are other methods which it adopted, would be effective."

a non discretionary legal duty upon the authority against
whom, the relief is sought for and that the person approaching
the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_37">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,

the remedy of a writ of mandamus is not intended to
supersede completely the modes of obtaining relief by an
action in a Civil Court or to deny defence legitimately open in
such actions; (f) the power to issue a writ of mandamus is a
discretionary power. It is sound use of discretion to leave the
party to seek his remedy by the ordinary mode of action in a
Civil Court and to refuse to issue a writ of mandamus; (g)                     a

High Courts do not act as a Court of appeal and examine the
facts for themselves. It is not the function of the Court to
substitute its wisdom and discretion for that of the person to
whom the judgment in the matter in question was entrusted by
law. The Supreme Court does not issue a writ of mandamus
except at the instance of a party whose fundamental rights are
directly and substantially invaded or are in imminent danger of
being so invaded; (i) a writ of mandamus is not issued to settle
private disputes or to enforce private rights. A writ of
