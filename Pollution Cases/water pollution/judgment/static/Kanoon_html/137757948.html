JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR (CHAIRPERSON):


</p><p id="p_3">     By this judgment, we shall dispose of the above 62

appeals/applications, as they raise common questions of law,

based upon somewhat similar facts before the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_4">2.   Thus, in view of above, it is not necessary for us to notice

facts, in any greater detail, of all the appeals/applications.

Suffice would it be to refer to the facts of the Original

Application No. 358(THC)/2013 (S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.

8074/2010) and limited reference of facts in other connected

appeals/applications.
</p>
<p id="p_5">FACTS:
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.   The State of Rajasthan had handed over a piece of land

to the Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment

Corporation Limited (for short the "RIICO") for the purpose of

setting up an industrial area. RIICO planned the land into

plots for leasing out to industrialists for erection/setting

up/establishing industrial units. These industrial premises

allotted by RIICO were to be used for manufacture of

industrial products by the respective units.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                               47</span>
</p><p id="p_7"> 4.   M/s Laxmi Suiting (for short "the applicant") is a

proprietorship concern, carrying on the business of washing

and dying of fabrics at Jodhpur. The RIICO had developed a

Heavy Industrial Area in Jodhpur. M/s Laxmi Suiting applied

for a plot of land in the said Heavy Industrial Area in the year

2004. This was allotted to the applicant and a lease agreement

dated 16th December, 2004 was executed between the

applicant and the RIICO in respect of Plot No.20/5(1) at the

Heavy Industrial Area, Jodhpur. The lease deed was executed

in furtherance to Rule 11 of the      RIICO Disposal of Land

Rules, 1979.

relevant for taking a decision in the present application can be

usefully reproduced at this stage as under:

<p id="p_10">6.   During the process of establishing its Common Effluent

Treatment Plant (for short the "CETP") in the Heavy Industrial

Area, the applicant moved an application for obtaining consent

to establish and operate the same, to the Jodhpur Pradushan

Niwaran Trust (for short the "Trust"). The tentative date of

completion of the project was 15th June, 2008. According to

the applicant, the Trust is a body established by its trustees.

With the sanction and permission from the Government, it

established a CETP and gave permission to the members, like



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                              49</span>
 the applicant, to discharge effluents into the drain that would

be carried to the CETP of the Trust and treated there prior to

further discharge.     According to the applicant, it was an

arrangement, of course, not barred by any statutory provision,

that the industrial units in the RIICO Heavy Industrial Area

were required to discharge their effluents into the drain which

were to be treated at the CETP established by the Trust, for

which purpose the membership of the Trust was given to the

industrial units. Through a common drain, the trade effluents

from the industrial units were carried to the CETP of the

Trust.   All kinds of discharge, whether acidic or alkaline in

nature, were treated at the CETP, thereby minimizing the

chances of polluting the environment.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.   The application of the applicant herein to the Trust

remained pending for a considerable time and ultimately, vide

order dated 8th July, 2008, it was rejected by the Trust. The

relevant part of the said order of the Trust reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     "Your discharge quantity of effluent shown in the
     application is not justified therefore membership is not
     granted."
</blockquote><p id="p_13">8.   Having received the above order, the applicant submitted

a representation dated 5th August, 2008 to the Trust, stating

therein that with the same kind of discharge as that of the

petitioner's   unit,   some   other     units   have    been   given

membership      and    the   impugned    action   was    apparently

discriminatory. Similar letter was also written by the applicant

on 17th February, 2008 and a further request was made to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                  50</span>
 Trust to give membership to the applicant. Despite his meeting

with the Managing Trustee of the Trust, the order dated 8 th

July, 2008 was neither revoked nor modified. According to the

applicant, the reason behind rejecting the application, that the

quantity of effluent shown being not justified, was without any

basis. On 23rd September, 2009, a social worker and an ex-

trustee of UIT, submitted an application before the Trust

seeking certain information about the working of the Trust,

and later on, an application was also filed under the Right to

<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, 2005 for the same. As a result of this

exercise, it was revealed that neither the Trust nor the CETP

was working properly. In terms of the information, it was

revealed that the capacity of the CETP was 20 MLD, out of

which 15 MLD of acidic and 5 MLD of alkaline water could be

treated. Further, 1-1.5 MLD of acidic and 10-12 MLD of

alkaline water is received by the CETP and treated thereupon.

Thus, the total capacity of the CETP having been exhausted,

was not a correct statement. The applicant has also stated

that as per the information received, 127 steel re-rolling

industries are permitted to operate by the Rajasthan Pollution

Control Board (for short the "Board") and are connected to the

CETP. No flow meter etc. are installed in any of the units to

measure the nature and volume of the waste water being

discharged from different units or being received by the CETP

from the units. As many as 138 textile units are also working

at Jodhpur and none of these units have obtained or have


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                              51</span>
 been given consent by the Board to establish and operate in

that area.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">9.     The applicant has also placed documents on record to

show that as back as on 5th August, 2008, the Board, while

dealing with the application for renewal of the consent dated

16th January, 2008 submitted by the Trust, issued a show

cause notice asking the Trust to explain as to why it should

not be ordered to be closed down immediately as well as water

and electricity supply to the CETP be not disconnected

immediately. However, this was not pursued any further and

the CETP is operating till date. It is contended that this is

clear evidence of the fact that CETP is not functioning properly

and to its optimum capacity.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">10. The working of the CETP was inappropriate and was not

in consonance with the provisions of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short the "<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>")

and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules,

1975 (for short the "Water Rules") framed thereunder. There

is no averment in the application of the applicant that it had

ever   applied   for   obtaining   consent   of   the   Board   for

establishment and operation of the unit. It is also clear from

the records that neither such consent was applied for nor was

it ever granted in the case of the applicant.


</p><p id="p_18">11. After the application of the applicant for obtaining

membership was rejected vide order dated 8th July, 2008 after


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                 52</span>
 a lapse of nearly two years, the Board, in exercise of the

powers vested in it under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_4">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act,

directed to close down the industrial unit of the applicant, vide

its order dated 10th August, 2010, and in the event of failure to

comply with the said order, it was stated that, it being a

criminal offence, would be punishable under <a href="/doc/30355/" id="a_5">Section 41(2)</a> of

the Water Act. In this very order, it was stated that the unit

had not obtained NOC from the Trust, the discharge of

polluted trade effluents from the unit was reaching the CETP,

thus, disrupting its functioning and an inspection was

conducted on 9th October, 2010 during which, it was noticed

that the unit was operating without obtaining the consent to

establish and operate from the Board and was discharging

trade effluents in violation of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a>. For these reasons,

the Board had passed the order directing closure of the unit.


</p><p id="p_19">12. The    applicant,   thus,   questions    the   legality   and

correctness of the two orders, namely the order 8th July, 2008

passed by the Trust rejecting the application of the applicant

for membership and the order dated 10th August, 2010 passed

by the Board directing closure of the unit in question.


</p><p id="p_20">13. The applicant also claims that it had moved an

application to the Board on 17th August, 2010 for obtaining its

consent to operate in furtherance to which the unit was

inspected by a team of officers of the Board on 16th November,

2010. The said application has not been finally disposed of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                53</span>
 and as such the consent of the Board would be deemed to

have been granted under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_7">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water Act.


</p><p id="p_21">14. The facts of other cases are somewhat similar, but in

some of the cases, the units had submitted applications for

obtaining consent of the Board, out of which, in some cases,

the consent sought was refused while in other cases, their

applications are still pending determination by the Board.

Still, there are other cases in which the industrial units hold

the membership of the Trust and have applied for obtaining

consent of the Board under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>.

These applications were moved on different dates, for instance

in the case of Original Application No.361 (THC) of 2013, the

application was filed on 30th August, 2010, which is stated to

be still pending with the Board. Still there is another bunch of

cases where the industrial units are operating outside the

earmarked or specified industrial area. Such industries are

located on agricultural land. They have applied for conversion

of the user of the land for purposes other than agricultural i.e.

industrial purpose, which applications are still pending. There

are also certain applicants who have either not applied for or

obtained consent or have applied for but for want of land use

conversion certificate, their applications have not been

disposed of by the Board. In this category, there are

transferred applications No.400-402 and 405 (THC) of 2013.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                               54</span>
</p><p id="p_22"> 15. The Trust or the Board, as the case may be, has passed

somewhat identical orders in most of the cases with the

exception of a few. Majority of the cases where identical orders

have been passed, which we shall deal with them hereinafter

under one head while the others, we will proceed to mention

and discuss separately. The common challenge to the orders

passed by the Trust or the Board against the applicant

concerned, is inter alia but primarily on the following grounds:


</p><p id="p_23">(i)    The action of the Trust or the Board, as the case may be,

is unfounded and arbitrary. It is the case of the applicants

that the CETP of the Trust has the capacity to take further

load of trade effluents for treatment. Thus, the reason given

for revocation is without any basis. There are 29 industries

which have closed down in the meanwhile. The claim of the

applicant should be adjudged against discharge of such

industries. Furthermore, the Trust has increased the capacity

of the existing CETP unit by more than three-fold on the one

hand while they have declined membership to the applicants

on the other.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">(ii)   The Board has passed the impugned orders without

applying the principles of natural justice. The applicants were

neither given any show cause notice nor were heard before

passing of the impugned order.       The Board is required to

comply with the procedure and afford an opportunity to the

applicant, as contemplated under Rule 34 of the Water Rules



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                              55</span>
 before passing orders under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_9">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act.

Non-compliance by the Board with the statutory rules vitiates

the order in its entirety.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">(iii) The   applications     submitted   by   the    applicants     for

obtaining the consent of the Board for operating their units,

having been kept pending for years, would be deemed to have

been granted permission in terms of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_10">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water

Act. Thus, neither any action could be taken nor any

prohibitive direction under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_11">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act could

be issued by the Board. The State Government, the Board and

the Trust are failing to discharge their Constitutional and

statutory obligations in relation to prevention and control of

pollution on the one hand, while on the other, are taking

coercive measures to the extent of depriving the applicants of

the source of their livelihood.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">16. On behalf of the respondents, a stand has been taken

that all the industries/units are operating without obtaining

consent of the Board. The units are discharging trade effluents

into the drain or on the open land, thus causing serious water

or underground water pollution. Reliance has been placed

upon the report of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control

Board, prepared on the basis of the inspection conducted from

8th to 11th November, 2014. According to the Board, out of the

62   applications   herein,    in   22   cases,     the   consent   to

establish/operate has been refused and 10 applications were



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                     56</span>
 pending before the Board.           Further, according to the

respondent, the remaining of the 62 applicants have not even

filed any application for obtaining consent of the Board. The

industries cannot be permitted to continue to cause pollution

and the private interest of these applicants must give in to the

public interest of maintaining proper quality of environment

and preventing the pollution.        Thus, the order directing

closure of these units is fully justified in the facts of the case.

The industries operating in the non-conforming zones are a

more serious threat to environment as they have neither the

consent from the Trust nor from the Board to operate. They

are located in agricultural areas and their textile activities,

thus, expose the environment to a potentially greater damage

and degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">17. The Trust has stated, and in fact reiterated, during the

course of arguments, that the CETP established by the Trust

has a capacity of 20 MLD - 15 MLD for treating alkaline and 5

MLD for treating acidic effluents. Presently, they are treating

11 MLD of alkaline effluents of textile and 3 MLD of acidic

effluents of steel industries, thus operating at a capacity of 14

MLD. The reason for rejecting the consent of the applicants by

the Trust was not the capacity of the CETP but the incorrect

description and disclosure by the industries in relation to the

discharge of effluents. None of these industries have installed

flow meters in their premises. According to the Trust, they are




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                 57</span>
 presently treating only 50% of the effluents while the

remaining 50% goes directly into the river through the drains

as untreated.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">18. The total land that was made available to the Trust was 9

acres and presently the CETP is situated within 5 acres on the

said land. It has laid down conduit pipeline for collecting the

trade effluents of its members, particularly in relation to

textile industries and would be treating the entire effluents

that they receive through this pipeline.       Connection to this

pipeline would be provided only to the members who have

been given consent to discharge effluents into the drain. This

pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of April, 2014.

The CETP is presently operating to its optimum capacity and

the 212 members of the Trust from the textile industry are

discharging nearly 11.851 MLD of trade effluents while the

steel industry is discharging 3.15 MLD. The Trust has plans

to upgrade its CETP but has not been able to do it for a variety

of reasons including financial limitations.


</p><p id="p_34">19. The State of Rajasthan has not put up any specific reply

or advanced any contention. Of course, it was stated, which

the Tribunal must record with appreciation, that in discharge

of its obligations - institutional and statutory - the State

Government had agreed to take such measures and provide

such   assistance   and   resources   to      the   various   bodies

concerned with the prevention and control of pollution to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                  58</span>
 ensure that this entire industrial area and other surrounding

industries do not cause any pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">20. However, the common contention is that the applicants

who have even moved applications for obtaining consent of the

Board are not entitled to derive any benefit under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_12">Section

25(7)</a> of the Act inasmuch as there was inordinate delay in

filing of applications, that too incomplete ones, and they have

been causing pollution for years. Thus, the contentions of the

applicants, according to the respondent, are liable to be

rejected and the applications deserve to be dismissed.


</p><p id="p_37">21. Before we proceed to discuss the merits or otherwise of

the contentions raised by the respective parties before us in

the light of the above factual matrix, we would first refer to the

appeals which need to be dealt with separately for the reasons

recorded below:
</p>
<p id="p_38">
OA No.373 (THC) of 2013 - MANGAL TEXTILES V. STATE OF
RAJASTHAN (DB CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.2710 of 2013)
BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR

</p><p id="p_39">22. This is a case where the petitioner has raised a challenge

to the show cause notices dated 27th December, 2011 and 11th

September, 2012 issued by the Board under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_13">Sections 33A</a> and

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_14">25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_15">26</a> of the Water Act respectively. The applicant was asked

vide the first notice dated 27th December, 2011, to show cause

as to why direction of closure under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_16">Section 33A</a> of the Water

Act be not issued against the industry and through the second

 notice dated 11th September, 2012, as to why the consent

applied for be not refused. The other connected relief was also

prayed for.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">23. No order of closure or refusal to grant consent has been

placed on record, which might have been passed by the Board

in furtherance to the show cause notices afore-referred. It is

obvious that the applicant is neither in possession of the said

premises nor is carrying on any textile industry thereat.

However, after service of these notices, the applicant who

appeared in person before the Tribunal, admitted that he is

not carrying on any business in F-304A and 332A, Industrial

Area, Basni IInd Phase, Jodhpur district, the premises in

question and is not in possession of any part of the said

industrial plot.   He has rented out the premises to different

tenants who are carrying on textile activities in the said

premises in their own name and style and that the firm, M/s

Mangal Textiles, does not exist in the said premises. None of

the stated tenants or occupants are parties to the application

and he is not aware whether their business has been ordered

to be closed by an order passed by the Board. In light of these

facts, which were stated during the course of the hearing and

are undisputed, it is obvious that there is no cause of action

against the applicant, Mangal Textiles, a sole proprietorship

concern, which subsists against it as of now or in fact even at

the time of filing of the application. Since the applicant has




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                             60</span>
 neither any cause of action nor any locus standi and cannot be

said to be aggrieved by the issuance of the show cause notices

afore-referred, we find no reason to entertain this application.

Accordingly, OA No.373 of 2013 is dismissed. We, however,

make it clear that the dismissal of this application would not

affect the rights of the persons who are in possession of the

premises as tenants of the applicant. There shall be no order

as to costs.

</p><p id="p_43">24. This is the application filed by the applicant raising a

challenge to the show cause notice dated 27th December, 2011

passed by the Secretary of the Board, requiring the applicant

to show cause as to why a direction of closure in terms of

challenge is also raised against the order dated 3rd January,

2009 issued by the Trust, rejecting the application for consent

for discharge of the trade effluents into the CETP run by the

Trust. It is also prayed in the application that the electricity,

which was directed to be disconnected, in the said premises

 the High Court in the above mentioned Writ Petition, they

have installed all anti-pollution devices,   carried      out   the

directions issued by the Board and that their industry is

compliant and a non-polluting one.        If that be so, there is

nothing for the Tribunal to examine the merits or demerits of

the challenge raised in the present application. Suffices it to

note that the applicant has prayed to move a fresh application

before the Board and the Trust within two weeks from today.

If such application is filed within the time allowed, the Board

and the Trust shall consider the said application expeditiously

and in any case not later than six weeks from the date of its

filing.   Needless   to   notice   that   consideration of such

application shall be in accordance with law and in terms of

this judgment.

direction, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.


</p><p id="p_48">27. Now we would proceed to discuss the contentions, as

afore-noticed, raised before us. However, we will take the last

contention first. It needs to be noticed that some of the units

had obtained consent from the Trust to discharge trade

effluents into the drain. Some of the industries, which did not

have such a consent, had applied to the Board for obtaining

its consent in terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_18">Section 25</a> of the Water Act. These

applications are pending. The Board has neither granted the

consent nor refused the same. According to the applicants,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                 62</span>
 with the aid of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_19">Section 25(7)</a> supra, they would be deemed to

have been granted the consent unconditionally as the period

of four months has lapsed from the date of submission of their

applications. The applications, in such cases, had been moved

at different times and in the case of Original Application

No.361(THC)/2013, the application was moved on 30th August,

2010, which is stated to be still pending with the Board. Thus,

the argument advanced is that the benefit contemplated under

<a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_20">Section 25(7)</a> supra accrues in favour of the applicants and

they are entitled to operate the industry irrespective of the fact

that they have not been granted consent to operate by the

Board. In order to appreciate the merits of this contention, we

must refer to the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_21">Water Act</a> which

are reproduced below:

stream or well or sewer or on land, without the previous

consent of the Board in terms of <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_25">Section 25(1)</a> supra.

Similarly, no person is entitled to bring into use any new or

altered outlet for discharge of sewage or begin to make any

discharge of sewage without the specific consent of the Board.

Under the scheme of the above provisions, an application has

to be moved to the Board for the purpose of obtaining the

consent. The Board is required to make such inquiries as it

may deem fit.   After following the prescribed procedure, the

Board may grant its consent, subject to such conditions as it

may deem fit and proper, or/and fix the duration during

which such consent shall be operative. The Board may also

refuse the consent for reasons to be recorded in writing. In

application has remained pending for grant or refusal of

consent for a period of four months, it would be deemed to

have been granted unconditional consent on the expiry of the

period of four months. The Section which grants benefit to a

person against the normal course of law has to be construed

strictly. Such a provision must be construed on its plain and

strict reading so as to ensure that such a deeming fiction is

not permitted to be abused and does not frustrate the very

object of the legislation. To take the benefit of the deeming

fiction contemplated under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_28">Section 25(7)</a>, one must satisfy the

following conditions:

the persons who have started their units even without making

an application in terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_31">Section 25</a> supra to the Board

concerned.   The prohibition contained under <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_32">Section 25(1)</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21"> <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_33">67</a></span>
 supra is both for establishment and operation of any unit,

process or CETP. <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_34">Section 25(1)</a> supra has intentionally been

worded by the legislature in very wide terms and no industry

or unit, which is likely to discharge sewage or effluent during

its process, can fall outside the ambit of this Section. The

expression under <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_35">Section 25(1)</a> states that no person shall

establish or take any steps to establish, without the previous

consent of the State Board, any industry, operation or process.

This is indicative of the legislative intent to place complete

embargo not only upon the establishment but also from taking

any step to establish an industry, operation or process, which

is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream or

well or sewer or even on land. The provision of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_36">Section 25(7)</a>

supra itself has to be examined and interpreted in the light of

the legislative scheme contained not only under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_37">Section 25</a> but

other provisions of the Act.

</p><p id="p_69">30. It is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that

while interpreting any provision of a statute, the scheme of the

Act, legislative intent and its inter-relations with other

provisions of the same statute are relevant considerations.

When the question arises as to the meaning of a provision in

the statute, it is not only legitimate but also proper to read

that provision in its context. The 'context' means the statute

as a whole, the previous state of the law, other statutes in

para materia, the general scope of the statute and the mischief




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                              68</span>
 that it was intended to remedy. In the case of <a href="/doc/995861/" id="a_38">R.S. Raghunath

v. State of Karnataka and Anr</a>. [(1992) 1 SCC 335], the

Supreme Court enunciated this principle of interpretation and

stated that the statute must be read in its entirety and in

context with the other relevant provisions.     The intention of

the legislature behind enacting the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_39">Water Act</a> is to prevent and

control water pollution and restoring the wholesomeness of

water for the benefit of the public at large and in the interest

of environment. This legislative intent must be given due

significance.     Dehors such an approach, there is every

likelihood that the object of the Act would be rendered futile or

ineffective.    Thus, while examining the provisions of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_40">Section

25(7)</a> supra, due significance is to be provided to the legislative

intent and the paramount purpose of the Act which is to

prevent and control the pollution and not to provide deemed

consents even where the applicant is a defaulter of law and an

offender. Another aspect of 'deeming fiction' in law is that the

conditions precedent to application of such deeming fiction

must be strictly satisfied. In other words, the conditions

stipulated in terms of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_41">Section 25(7)</a> supra must be satisfied

stricto sensu and then alone the applicant could claim the

benefit accruing under such a provision. The onus lies upon

the applicant to show that he has complied with the stipulated

conditions without demur and variation.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                69</span>
</p><p id="p_70"> 31. As already noticed, the two conditions stipulated under

<a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_42">Section 25(7)</a> supra are (i) the application to the Board should

be complete in all respects and (ii) the period of four months

should have lapsed after making of such application to enable

the applicant to claim such a benefit. In the present case, the

applicants,   admittedly,    have   not   only    established    their

operations but, in fact, have also started their respective

textile units without informing the Board, much less obtaining

the   consent     of   the    Board       for    establishment     or

operationalisation of their respective units.

This was, undoubtedly, a clear violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_43">Section 25</a> of the

Water Act, punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_44">Section 44</a> of the said Act

besides rendering such persons liable for other penal action,

as provided under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_45">Water Act</a>.                The

applicants, thus, are obviously defaulters and offenders under

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_46">Water Act</a> on the one hand while on the

other, are, in fact, causing serious pollution.        Still another

facet of these cases is that even when these applicants moved

to the Board for obtaining the consent, their applications were

not complete in terms of the prescribed form along with the

complete analysis report, despite the fact that all of the units

were operational at that time.        It is on record before the

Tribunal that the officers of the Board had even visited the

respective units and found a number of deficiencies. It was

also noticed that these units were causing serious pollution

and were even discharging trade effluents in excess of the

 prescribed parameters into the drain and the CETP of the

Trust without its consent.
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">32. For instance, the unit of M/s Laxmi Suiting was

inspected by the officers of the Board on 27th September, 2010

and 16th November, 2010 in the presence of the applicant. On

both these inspections, certain deficiencies had been noticed

and the unit in question was found to be a polluting industry.

Vide letter dated 1st December, 2010, the Board had

communicated to the applicant the shortfalls and deficiencies

in the work being carried out by the unit. Similarly, in the

case of other units also, the Board officers had conducted

inspections   and   they     found   certain   deficiencies,   non-

compliances and shortfalls and that they were polluting

industries.   To put it simply, the applicants did not submit

applications complete in all respects to the Board, and they

were found to be polluting industries, offending the provisions

of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_47">Water Act</a>. In exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_48">Section 33A</a>

of the Water Act, the Board had issued closure orders, acting

on the 'precautionary' and the 'preventive' principles so that

these industries would not cause any further pollution. In fact,

the industry should not be permitted to discharge effluents

which are violative of the prescribed parameters. <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_49">Section 25(5)</a>

of the Water Act, by necessary implication and purposive

interpretation forms an exception to the deeming fiction

created under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_50">Section 25(7)</a> supra. The cases which fall under




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                 71</span>
<a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_51">Section 25(5)</a> cannot invoke the provisions of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_52">Section 25(7)</a> as

their operations shall be controlled entirely by the provisions

of <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_53">Section 25(5)</a> of the Act.      <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_54">Section 25(5)</a> takes within its

ambit any industry, operation or process or any treatment and

disposal system or any extension, in addition to a unit, which

has been established without obtaining consent of the Board.

This will also cover such cases where any steps for such

establishment or even any new or altered outlet for the

discharge of sewage have been brought into use, etc.           The

Board may serve a notice on the person who has established

such industry, operation, process or treatment system,

imposing such conditions as the Board might have imposed on

an application for consent in respect of such establishment,

outlet or such discharge. To put it simply, the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_55">Section 25(5)</a> are applicable to a specified category of

industries   or   units   which    have   been   established    or

operationalised without obtaining consent of the Board. These

units would be governed by the conditions stated in its order

of consent by the Board after issuance of notice to them. The

consent, thus, would be such as if the one granted in terms of

<a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_56">Section 25(1)</a> to (7) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_57">Water Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_58">Section 25(5)</a> precedes

<a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_59">Section 25(7)</a> supra. Thus, the cases which are covered under

<a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_60">Section 25(5)</a> cannot be controlled and taken advantage of the

deeming fiction contemplated under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_61">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water

Act. Invocation of <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_62">Section 25(5)</a> can produce two different

kinds of results - one, which can be granted consent in terms


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                72</span>
 of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_63">Section 25</a> itself and the other where such conditional

consent is not granted and the Board, in exercise of its powers

under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_64">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, directs closure of the unit.

The order of closure would necessarily imply refusal of

consent. In either of these events, the consequences would be

rendering <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_65">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water Act uninvocative by such

industries.   The units must be compliant of the law before

claiming the benefit. If they have moved no application

whatsoever and commenced establishment or operation of

their units, then they would lose the very initiation of the

process which can entitle them to the deemed fiction benefit

under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_66">Section 25(7)</a> supra. The provisions of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_67">Section 25(7)</a> are

not intended to legitimise the illegal acts but are themselves

exceptions to the rule of grant or refusal of consent. At this

stage, it can also be appropriately noticed that even the

consent granted under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_68">Section 25</a> of the Water Act is subject

to review or subsequent refusal in terms of <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_69">Section 27(2)</a> of the

Water Act.    The Board, in exercise of its powers under this

provision, can add or modify conditions or even refuse consent

in its order, as it may deem fit, of course upon a notice to the

party   concerned.    Once    these   provisions   are   read   in

conjunction, the scheme of the Act becomes quite apparent

that the legislature never intended to give any benefit to a

person who has not complied with the statutory conditions or

is a pollutant or offender under the provisions of the Water




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                73</span>
 Act. The benefit of law accrues to one who complies with the

law and not the one who offends the same.
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">33. A deeming provision creates a legal fiction.        When a

statute enacts that something shall be deemed to have been

done, which in fact and in truth has not been done, the court

is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purpose and

between what persons the statutory fiction is to be resorted to.

After ascertaining the purpose, full effect must be given to the

statutory fiction and it should be carried out to its logical

conclusion and to that end, it would be proper and even

necessary to assume all those facts on which alone the fiction

can operate. In other words, the facts and requirements of the

fiction must be satisfied. It has, in fact, also been held by

some courts that the word 'deemed' when used in a statute

establishes a conclusive or rebuttal presumption, depending

upon the context.
</p>
<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">34. Another legal principle of construing the legal fiction is

that the law cannot be extended beyond its purpose.          The

Supreme Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_70">Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v.

State of Bihar</a> (AIR 1955 SC 661) stated that the legal fictions

are created only for some definite purpose. A legal fiction is to

be limited to that purpose for which it was created and should

not be extended beyond that legitimate field. This approach

was          reiterated        by          the         Supreme

Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/555124/" id="a_71">Union of India v. Sampat Raj



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                               74</span>
 Dugar</a> (AIR 1992 SC 1417), wherein while dealing with Clause

5(3)(ii) of the Import (Control) Order, held that fiction created

was for the proper implementation of the Import and Export

(Control) Act, 1947 and to hold the licensee responsible for

anything and everything that happens from the time of import

till the goods are cleared through Customs and it was also

held that the fiction cannot be employed to attribute

ownership of imported goods to the importer in a case where

he abandons them i.e. in a situation where the importer does

not pay or receive the documents of title. Reference can also

be made to the case of <a href="/doc/1081906/" id="a_72">Rajkumar Khurana v. State of NCT of

Delhi</a> [(2009) 6 SCC 72].
</p>
<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">35. <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_73">Section 25(7)</a> is intended to provide for the deemed fiction

only where the law is complied with. The obvious reason for

providing the deeming fiction under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_74">Section 25</a> of the Water

Act is to ensure that the Board does not unduly withhold the

application of an industry or a unit which has acted in

accordance with the law and has moved the application for

establishment/operation complete in all respects to the Board.

The intention of the framers of law is to balance the

relationship between the industry and the Board.        It is not

intended to give any undue or unlawful advantage to either of

the two. The Board must not be able to frustrate the

establishment of a project merely by delaying its decision on

the application. It is also not intended to give any right to the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                               75</span>
 industry to start its operation without obtaining consent of the

Board or even making an application for that purpose. On the

principle aforestated, it will not be permissible to stretch the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_75">Section 25</a> of the Water Act to give protection to

the class of persons who are polluters and are even covered

under the specified category contemplated under <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_76">Section 25(5)</a>

supra.
</p>
<p id="p_79">
</p><p id="p_80">36. In view of the above discussion, we are of the considered

view that the applicants are not entitled to the benefit or

advantage of the deeming fiction of law contemplated under

<a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_77">Section 25(7)</a> of the Water Act inter alia but specifically for the

following reasons:
</p>
<p id="p_81">
</p><p id="p_82">(i)     The   applicants   did   not   submit   applications,   as

contemplated under <a href="/doc/1559088/" id="a_78">Section 25(2)</a> of the Water Act, complete

in all respects to the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_83">
</p><p id="p_84">(ii)    Indisputably and squarely, the applicants fall within the

category of <a href="/doc/1209110/" id="a_79">Section 25(5)</a> of the Water Act, which provision is

an exception to the very application of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_80">Section 25(7)</a> of the

Water Act and cannot be claimed as a matter of right.


</p><p id="p_85">(iii)   Issuance of directions under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_81">Section 33A</a> of the Water

Act necessarily implies refusal of consent as contemplated

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_82">Section 25(4)(b)</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">(iv)    The applicants are non-compliant, polluting industries,

offending the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_83">Water Act</a>.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                                76</span>
</p><p id="p_88">      These units have violated the law by discharging trade

effluents in excess of the prescribed parameters. Their

conduct, in fact and in law, is such that would disentitle them

from claiming any advantage in terms of <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_84">Section 25(7)</a> of the

Water Act as they have caused pollution for years together

without consent of the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">37. Now, we may deal with the contentions (i) and (ii)

together. The contentions are that the order of the Board is

unfounded and arbitrary. Further, the order is also violative

of the principles of natural justice. Since there is an apparent

link between these contentions, they can usefully be dealt with

together.   According to the applicants, the impugned orders

have been passed in violation of the principles of natural

justice and without complying with the procedure prescribed

under Rule 34 of the Water Rules. The Board can exercise its

powers and issue directions in terms of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_85">Section 33A</a> of the

Water Act, subject to compliance with the procedure stated

under Rule 34 of the said Rules.

<p id="p_91">
</p><p id="p_92">38. <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_86">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act vests in the Board very wide

powers of serious consequences. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_87">Section 33A</a>

of the Water Act start with a non-obstante clause and is to

have precedence over any other law in force. These powers are

to be exercised subject to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_88">Water Act</a> as

well as the Water Rules. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_89">Section 33A</a> of the

Water Act empower the Board to issue directions in writing to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                              77</span>
 any person, officer or authority. Such directions have to be

issued in exercise of the powers and functions of the Board

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_90">Water Act</a>. The procedure for issuance of such

directions is stated under Rule 34 of the Water Rules. The

person, officer or authority to whom such directions are issued

is duty-bound to comply with such directions.             Varied

directions could be issued by the Board for a variety of

reasons. The variation of the directions issued by the Board

could be for different purposes and could even be to the extent

of directing closure, prohibition of regulation of the industry,

operation or process.     It could also relate to stoppage or

regulation of supply of electricity or water or any other service

to such a unit. Vesting the Board with wide powers under

these provisions, is a clear indication of the intent of the

legislature,   and the object that is sought to be achieved in

relation to the industries, which are causing pollution or

which are a potent threat to the environment.


</p><p id="p_93">39. Rule 34 of the Water Rules provides a road-map of the

steps which are required to be taken by the Board from the

stage of issuance of directions, as comprehended by the

Board, to the stage of their execution. It requires a direction

to be made in writing and the service of the proposed direction

to be made upon the person, officer or authority, and an

opportunity being granted to file objections thereto and then

passing of such final directions and its service upon such




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                               78</span>
 person, officer or authority including the occupier.         This

exercise has to be undertaken by the Board in a time-bound

programme in terms of Rule 34 of the Water Rules.


</p><p id="p_94">40. Rule 34 of the Water Rules in contradistinction to

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_91">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, is a procedural provision to aid

the substantive law contained in <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_92">Section 33A</a>. While <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_93">Section

33A</a> grants power to a Board to give directions, inter alia, in

relation to closure, prohibition, regulation or the like, the said

rule lays down the manner in which the said power is to be

exercised.
</p>
<p id="p_95">
</p><p id="p_96">41. A plain reading of the said rule makes it clear that its

aim and object is, primarily, to bestow upon the "the person,

officer or the authority to whom such direction is given" under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_94">Section 33A</a>, the advantages of the principles of natural

justice, which are also an essential concomitant under general

jurisprudence as well as the law of equity, the absence of

which would     vitiate   any proceeding, unless      specifically

excluded from their application.
</p>
<p id="p_97">
</p><p id="p_98">42. While Rule 34(2) supra specifically lays down that the

direction sought to be made must contain the nature of action

and the time taken to carry out the same against the person,

Rule 34(3) supra is custodian of the maxim audi alteram

partem, a component of the principles of natural justice. This

sub-rule gives to the person to whom such direction is sought

to be issued, an opportunity of being heard, as well as that of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                79</span>
 filing objection, if any, which are to be considered by the

Board under sub-rule 5 of Rule 34, within 45 days of the

receipt of such objections. The same rule under sub-rule 6 of

Rule 34 makes an exception to this rule of audi alteram

partem, however, only when substantiated by reasons, for

which this maxim could not be put in application.


</p><p id="p_99">43.   While on the one hand, sub-rule (3) contemplates a

direction of the Board directly to the person against whom the

direction is sought to be issued, on the other, sub-rule (4)

envisages issuance of a direction through an authority, to the

said person. However, in both the cases, the substantive

requirement of law to adhere to the principles of natural

justice is specifically provided for, i.e. irrespective of the fact

whether the person is being issued a direction directly by the

Board or through an authority, he shall be given time to file

objections, as well as an opportunity of being heard, in

consonance with the principles of natural justice, unless the

case demands otherwise in which case, the Board shall be

duty-bound to give reasons, in writing, for the same.


</p><p id="p_100">44. Recording of reasons is a principle of natural justice and

every judicial order must be supported by reasons recorded in

writing. It ensures transparency and fairness in decision

making. (Secretary and Curator, Victoria Memorial Hall Vs.

natural justice and must be given whenever a decision is

taken   by   an   administrative   body,   like   the   Board,   to

substantiate the rationale behind reaching the same.


</p><p id="p_101">45. As already noticed, compliance with the various sub-

rules of Rule 34 of the Water Rules is required to be made

within the time schedule specified therein.        It is also the

obligation of the Board to consider such objections and

thereupon, confirm, modify or even decide not to issue the

proposed direction. But once such a direction is issued, its

obedience is mandatory by all persons and authorities

concerned.

<p id="p_102">
</p><p id="p_103">46. The adherence to audi alteram partem by the Board is not

free from exception. Rule 34(6) of the Water Rules makes an

exception to the provisions of Rule 34(1) to 34(5) supra.

However, this exception has three essential ingredients - one,

that the Board is to be of the opinion that there is a likelihood

of great injury to the environment; two, it would not be

expedient to provide an opportunity to file objections against

the proposed direction; and three, the Board should record

 reasons in writing as to why the directions be issued without

providing an opportunity to the person, officer or authority.


</p><p id="p_104">47. Natural    justice   means    a   fair   process   excluding

arbitrariness and recording of reasons so as to show

application of mind.     This process, as indicated above, is

provided under Rule 34(1) to (5) of the Water Rules. Normally,

the Board is expected to comply with the requirements of the

principles of natural justice unless the case is one that

squarely falls within the exception clause contained in Rule

34(6) of the Water Rules, and only that too when the

ingredients thereof are satisfied by the Board.


</p><p id="p_105">48.   The principles of natural justice are to be construed

flexibly and not rigidly.   The purpose is to provide a fair

opportunity to the party that is likely to get adversely affected

while passing of such directions. We may make a reference to

a recent judgment of the Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/133209308/" id="a_96">Dhunseri

That being so, the short question that requires the
consideration of this Tribunal is whether the applicant
was entitled to grant of hearing, whether in the facts of
the case, compliance to the principles of natural justice
was        mandatory        before     the      impugned
communication/orders were passed by the respective
respondents. We have no hesitation in answering this
question    in    the   affirmative.     The    impugned
communication and directions have not only ancillary
civil consequences for the applicant but in fact his entire
business which he has been carrying on for the last more
than ten years has to be shut down in all respects. It is
not a mere stopping of an industrial activity but is even
going to affect the families of large number of workmen
who are working in these industries. The impugned
communications/orders are of such serious nature that
compliance to the principle of audi alteram partem
cannot be obviated. We may refer to a recent judgment
of this Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/22952350/" id="a_97">M/s. Sesa Goa vs. State of
Goa and Ors., Application No</a>. 49 of 2012, pronounced on

judgments of the Supreme Court in relation to adherence
to the rule of audi alteram partem, the Tribunal held as
under: -
</p><p id="p_108">"17. It must be noticed that the aim of rules of
natural justice is to secure justice, or to put it
negatively, to prevent miscarriage of justice.
Despite the fact that such rules do not have any
statutory character, their adherence is even
more important for the compliance of the
statutory rules. The violation of the principles of
natural justice has the effect of vitiating the
action, be it administrative or quasi-judicial, in
so far as it affects the rights of a third party.
Flexibility in the process of natural justice is an
inbuilt feature of this doctrine. Absolute rigidity
may not further the cause of justice and
therefore adoption of flexibility is important for
applying these principles.
</p>
<p id="p_109">
</p><p id="p_110">18. A Court or a Tribunal has to examine
whether the principles of natural justice have
been violated or not as a primary consideration,
whenever and wherever such an argument is
raised. Test of prejudice is an additional aspect.

 Normally, violation of principles of natural
justice, like non-grant of hearing, would vitiate
the action unless the theory of 'useless formality'
is pressed into service and is shown to have a
complete applicability to the facts of the case. We
may notice that this theory, though has been
accepted by the Courts, but is rarely applied.



</p><p id="p_111">19. In the case of <a href="/doc/1086058/" id="a_98">Canara Bank v. A.K. Awasthi</a>
(2005) 6 SCC 321, the Supreme Court compared
natural justice to common sense justice. It
emphasized on the compliance with the
principles of natural justice when a quasi-
judicial body embarks upon determination of
disputes between the parties or when an
administrative     action      involving  civil
consequences is in issue. The Court held:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">     "9. The expressions "natural justice" and
     "legal justice" do not present a watertight
     classification. It is the substance of justice
     which is to be secured by both, and
     whenever legal justice fails to achieve this
     solemn purpose, natural justice is called in
     aid of legal justice. Natural justice relieves
     legal justice from unnecessary technicality,
     grammatical        pedantry     or     logical
     prevarication. It supplies the omissions of a
     formulated law. As Lord Buckmaster said,
     no form or procedure should ever be
     permitted to exclude the presentation of a
     litigant's defence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">     10. The adherence to principles of natural
     justice as recognised by all civilised States
     is of supreme importance when a quasi-</blockquote><p id="p_112">
</p><p id="p_113">     judicial body embarks on determining
     disputes between the parties, or any
     administrative    action   involving     civil
     consequences is in issue. These principles
     are well settled. The first and foremost
     principle is what is commonly known as
     audi alteram partem rule. It says that no


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                      84</span>
 one should be condemned unheard. Notice
is the first limb of this principle. It must be
precise and unambiguous. It should
apprise the party determinatively of the
case he has to meet. Time given for the
purpose should be adequate so as to enable
him to make his representation. In the
absence of a notice of the kind and such
reasonable opportunity, the order passed
becomes wholly vitiated. Thus, it is but
essential that a party should be put on
notice of the case before any adverse order
is passed against him. This is one of the
most important principles of natural
justice. It is after all an approved rule of fair
play. The concept has gained significance
and shades with time. When the historic
document was made at Runnymede in
1215, the first statutory recognition of this
principle found its way into the "Magna
Carta". The classic exposition of Sir Edward
Coke of natural justice requires to "vocate,
interrogate      and adjudicate". In         the
celebrated case of Cooper v. Wandsworth
Board of Works the principle was thus
stated: (ER p. 420)



"Even God himself did not pass sentence
upon Adam before he was called upon to
make his defence. 'Adam' (says God), 'where
art thou? Hast thou not eaten of the tree
whereof I commanded thee that thou
shouldest not eat?' " Since then the
principle has been chiselled, honed and
refined, enriching its content. Judicial
treatment has added light and luminosity
to the concept, like polishing of a diamond.



</p><p id="p_114">11. Principles of natural justice are those
rules which have been laid down by the
courts as being the minimum protection of
the rights of the individual against the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                    85</span>
      arbitrary procedure that may be adopted by
     a judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative
     authority while making an order affecting
     those rights. These rules are intended to
     prevent     such    authority   from   doing
     injustice.
</p>
<p id="p_115">
</p><p id="p_116">     12. What is meant by the term "principles
     of natural justice" is not easy to determine.
     Lord Summer (then Hamilton, L.J.) in R. v.
</p><p id="p_117">     Local Govt. Board 3          (KB at p.199)
     described the phrase as sadly lacking in

     Education &amp; Registration of U.K. v.
</p><p id="p_118">     Spackman Lord Wright observed that it was
     not desirable to attempt "to force it into any
     Procrustean bed" and mentioned that one
     essential requirement was that the Tribunal
     should be impartial and have no personal
     interest in the controversy, and further that
     it should give "a full and fair opportunity"
     to every party of being heard."
</p>
<p id="p_119">
</p><p id="p_120">20. The above findings of the Court puts one
matter beyond ambiguity, i.e., the affected party
is entitled to full and fair opportunity, and such
an opportunity, shall, both in fact and in
substance, be granted to ensure that justice is
not only done but also seems to have been done.



</p><p id="p_121">21. In the present case we are concerned with
the application and the various facets of the
maxim audi alteram partem. The Courts have
consistently emphasized that this is a highly
effective rule devised by the Courts to ensure
that a statutory authority arrives at a just
decision and it is calculated to act as a healthy
check on the abuse or misuse of power.
</p>
<p id="p_122">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                      86</span>
</p><p id="p_123"> 22. The doctrine of audi alteram partem has
three basic essentials. Firstly, a person against
whom an order is required to be passed or whose
rights are likely to be affected adversely must be
granted an opportunity of being heard. Secondly,
the authority concerned should provide a fair
and transparent procedure and lastly, the
authority concerned must apply its mind and
dispose of the matter by a reasoned or speaking
order. While referring to this principle in the case
of Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax
Department, works contract and leasing, Kota
vs. Shukla &amp; Bros (2010) 4 SCC 785, the
Supreme Court of India stressed upon the need
for recording reasons and for the authority to act
fairly. The court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     "11. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/400596/" id="a_99">S.N. Mukherjee
     v. Union of India</a> while referring to the
     practice adopted and insistence placed by
     the courts in United States, emphasized the
     importance of recording of reasons for
     decisions by the administrative authorities
     and tribunals. It said "administrative
     process will best be vindicated by clarity in
     its exercise". To enable the courts to
     exercise the power of review in consonance
     with settled principles, the authorities are
     advised of the considerations underlining
     the action under review. This Court with
     approval stated:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">           "11. ... 'the orderly functioning of the
           process of review requires that the
           grounds      upon      which       the
           administrative agency acted be clearly
           disclosed and adequately sustained'."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     12. In exercise of the power of judicial
     review,   the    concept   of   reasoned
     orders/actions has been enforced equally
     by the foreign courts as by the courts in
     India. The administrative authority and
     tribunals are obliged to give reasons,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                       87</span>
 absence whereof could render the order
liable to judicial chastisement. Thus, it will
not be far from an absolute principle of law
that the courts should record reasons for
their conclusions to enable the appellate or
higher courts to exercise their jurisdiction
appropriately and in accordance with law. It
is the reasoning alone, that can enable a
higher or an appellate court to appreciate
the controversy in issue in its correct
perspective and to hold whether the
reasoning recorded by the court whose
order is impugned, is sustainable in law
and whether it has adopted the correct legal
approach. To sub serve the purpose of
justice delivery system, therefore, it is
essential that the courts should record
reasons for their conclusions, whether
disposing of the case at admission stage or
after regular hearing.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_124">13. At the cost of repetition, we may notice,
that this Court has consistently taken the
view that recording of reasons is an
essential feature of dispensation of justice.
A litigant who approaches the court with
any grievance in accordance with law is
entitled to know the reasons for grant or
rejection of his prayer. Reasons are the soul
of orders. Non-recording of reasons could
lead to dual infirmities; firstly, it may cause
prejudice to the affected party and
secondly, more particularly, hamper the
proper administration of justice. These
principles are not only applicable to
administrative or executive actions, but
they apply with equal force and, in fact,
with a greater degree of precision to judicial
pronouncements. A judgment without
reasons causes prejudice to the person
against whom it is pronounced, as that
litigant is unable to know the ground which
weighed with the court in rejecting his
claim and also causes impediments in his
taking adequate and appropriate grounds


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                  88</span>
      before the higher court in the event of
     challenge to that judgment. Now, we may
     refer to certain judgments of this Court as
     well as of the High Courts which have taken
     this view."
</p>
<p id="p_125">24. The recording of reasons by the
administrative and quasi judicial authorities is a
well-accepted norm and its compliance has
stated to be mandatory. Of course, reasons
recorded by such authorities may not be like
judgments of courts, but they should precisely
state the reasons for rejecting or accepting a
claim which would reflect due application of
mind. The Bombay High Court in the case of
Pipe Arts India Pvt. Ltd v. Gangadhar Nathuji
Golmare, 2008 (6) MLJ 280 held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">          "8. The Supreme Court and different
          High Courts have taken the view that
          it is always desirable to record reasons
          in support of the Government actions
          whether administrative or quasi-
          judicial. Even if the statutory rules do
          not impose an obligation upon the
          authorities still it is expected of the
          authorities concerned to act fairly and
          in consonance with basic rule of law.
          These concepts would require that any
          order, particularly, the order which
          can be subject matter of judicial
          review, is reasoned one. Even in the
          case of <a href="/doc/37494799/" id="a_100">Chabungbambohal Singh
          v.Union of India and Ors</a>: 1995(1)

               stated unfit. As the appellant
               was being superseded by one of
               his juniors, we do not think if it
               was enough on the part of the
               Selection Committee to have
               merely stated unfit, and then to

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">9. The requirement of recording
reasons is applicable with greater
rigour to judicial proceedings. Judicial

698, accepting the plea that absence
of examination of reasons by the High
Court on the basis of which the trial

acquittal in favour of all the accused

Court held that the order should
record reasons. Recording of proper

power of judicial review in
adjudging the validity of the
decision. Right to reason is
an indispensable part of a
sound      judicial      system;
</p><p id="p_145">reasons at least sufficient to
indicate an application of
mind to the matter before
Court. Another rationale is
that the affected party can
know why the decision has
gone against him. One of
the salutary requirements of
natural justice is spelling
out reasons for the order
made; in other words, a
speaking-out.                The
"inscrutable face of the
sphinx"        is      ordinarily
incongruous with a judicial
or                quasi-judicial
performance.

</p><p id="p_147"> 17. Following this very view, the
Supreme Court in another very recent
judgment delivered on February, 22,
2008, in the case of <a href="/doc/1826950/" id="a_113">State of Rajasthan
v. Rajendra Prasad Jain Criminal
Appeal No</a>. 360/2008 (Arising out of

</p><p id="p_149">18. Providing of reasons in orders is of
essence in judicial proceedings. Every
litigant who approaches the Court
with a prayer is entitled to know the
reasons for acceptance or rejection of
such request. Either of the parties to
the Us has a right of appeal and,
therefore, it is essential for them to
know the considered; opinion of the
Court to make the remedy of appeal
meaningful. It is the reasoning which
ultimately    culminates    into   final
decision which may be subject to
examination of the appellate or other
higher Courts. It is not only desirable;
</p><p id="p_150">but, in view of the consistent position
of law, mandatory for the Court to
pass orders while recording reasons in
support thereof, however, brief they
may be. Brevity in reasoning cannot
be understood in legal parlance as
absence of; reasons. While no
reasoning in support of judicial orders
is impermissible, the brief reasoning
would suffice to meet the ends of
justice at least at the interlocutory
stages and would render the remedy of
appeal purposeful and meaningful. It
is    a  settled    cannon    of   legal
jurisprudence that the Courts are
vested with discretionary powers but
such powers are to be exercised



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                           94</span>
 judiciously,     equitably   and      in
consonance with the settled principles
of law. Whether or not, such judicial
discretion has been exercised in
accordance with the accepted norms,
can only be reflected by the reasons
recorded in the order impugned before
the higher Court. Often it is said that
absence of reasoning may ipso facto
indicate whimsical exercise of judicial
discretion. Patricia Wald, Chief Justice
of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in
the Article, Black robed Bureaucracy
or Collegiality under Challenge, (42
MD.L. REV. 766, 782 (1983), observed
as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">     My own guiding principle is that
     virtually every appellate decision
     requires some statement of
     reasons. The discipline of writing
     even     a   few   sentences    or
     paragraphs explaining the basis
     for the judgment insures a level
     of thought and scrutiny by the
     Court that a bare signal of
     affirmance, dismissal, or reversal
     does not.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_151">19. The Court cannot lose sight of the
fact that a losing litigant has a cause
to plead and a right to challenge the
order if it is adverse to him. Opinion of
the Court alone can explain the cause
which led to passing of the final order.
</p><p id="p_152">Whether an argument was rejected
validly or otherwise, reasoning of the
order alone can show. To evaluate the
submissions is obligation of the Court
and to know the reasons for rejection
of its contention is a legitimate
expectation on the part of the litigant.
</p><p id="p_153">Another facet of providing reasoning is
to give it a value of precedent which
can help in reduction of frivolous



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                            95</span>
 litigation. Paul D. Carrington, Daniel J
Meador and Maurice Rosenburg,
Justice on Appeal 10 (West 1976),
observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">     When reasons are announced
     and can be weighed, the public
     can have assurance that the
     correcting process is working.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">     Announcing reasons can also
     provide public understanding of
     how the numerous decisions of
     the system are integrated. In a
     busy Court, the reasons are an
     essential demonstration that the
     Court did in fact fix its mind on
     the case at hand. An unreasoned
     decision has very little claim to
     acceptance by the defeated party,
     and is difficult or impossible to
     accept as an act reflecting
     systematic application of legal
     principles.     Moreover,     the
     necessity of stating reasons not
     infrequently changes the results
     by forcing the judges to come to
     grips with nettlesome facts or
     issues    which    their   normal
     instincts would otherwise cause
     them to avoid.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_154">20. The reasoning in the opinion of the
Court, thus, can effectively be
analysed or scrutinized by the
Appellate Court. The reasons indicated
by the Court could be accepted by the
Appellate Court without presuming
what weighed with the Court while
coming to the impugned decision. The
cause of expeditious and effective
disposal would be furthered by such
an approach. A right of appeal could
be created by a special statute or
under the provisions of the Code
governing the procedure. In either of

 them, absence of reasoning may have
the effect of negating the purpose or
right of appeal and, thus, may not
achieve the ends of justice.

<p id="p_155">21. It will be useful to refer words of
Justice Roslyn Atkinson, Supreme
Court of Queensland, at AIJA
Conference at Brisbane on September
13, 2002 in relation to Judgment
Writing.    Describing      that   some
judgment could be complex, in
distinction to routine judgments,
where one requires deeper thoughts,
and the other could be disposed of
easily but in either cases, reasons they
must have. While speaking about
purpose of the judgment, he said,

The first matter to consider is the
purpose of the judgment. To my mind
there are four purposes for any
judgment that is written:
</p>
<p id="p_156">(1) to clarify your own thoughts;
</p><p id="p_157">(2) to explain your decision to the
parties;
</p><p id="p_158">(3) to communicate the reasons for the
decision to the public; and
(4) to provide reasons for an appeal
Court to consider.
</p>
<p id="p_159">
</p><p id="p_160">22. Clarity of thought leads to proper
reasoning and proper reasoning is the
foundation of a just and fair decision.
</p><p id="p_161">In Alexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd.
</p><p id="p_162">v. Crabtree 1974 ICR 120, the Court
went to the extent of observing that
"Failure to give reasons amounts to
denial of justice". Reasons are really
linchpin to administration of justice.
</p><p id="p_163">They are link between the mind of the
decision taker and the controversy in
question. To justify our conclusion,
reasons are essential. Absence of
reasoning would render the judicial

                  order liable to interference by the
                 higher Court. Reasons is the soul of
                 the decision and its absence would
                 render the order open to judicial
                 chastism."
</p>
<p id="p_164">49. Another Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in the

case of <a href="/doc/129840776/" id="a_114">S.N. Mukherjee vs. Union of India</a> (1990) 4 SCC 594,

after referring to the English law and the      judgments of the

Supreme Court, stated that the failure to give reasons

amounts to denial of justice. The Court held that even if it is

not the requirement of rules, but at least, the record should

disclose reasons. The Court noticed that omnipresence and

omniscience of the principles of natural justice act as

deterrence to arrive at arbitrary decisions in flagrant infraction

of fair play. Further, the Court held that the importance of the

doctrine of natural justice is evident from the fact that with the

development of law it has been treated as an ingredient of

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_115">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. 'Natural Justice' means

a fair process. A fair process essentially must exclude

arbitrariness and exclusion of arbitrariness would ensure

equality and equal treatment before law.



</p><p id="p_165">50. The above-stated principles clearly show that adherence

to the principles of natural justice is mandatory unless

application of such principles is excluded by specific language.

Rule 34 of the Water Rules makes application of the principles

of   natural   justice   mandatory   for   invocation   of   powers

conferred under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_116">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. Rule 34 is not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                                 98</span>
 absolute in its application and it carves out an exception

under the proviso to sub-rule (4) of Rule 34. The violation of

the principles of natural justice, more so where it is

specifically provided under the statute, would result in

vitiation of the impugned actions.          Prejudice is one of the

aspects which the Tribunal would consider while dealing with

the plea of violation of natural justice.


</p><p id="p_166">51. It is also contended, on behalf of the Board, that if no

consent has been granted by the Board to a unit to operate or

if granted but withdrawn and the unit is operating without its

consent and even if it has moved an application for obtaining a

fresh consent of the Board, then it cannot be heard to

complain that the procedure prescribed under Rule 34 of the

Water Rules has been violated while passing any direction

under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_117">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. There appears to be some

substance in this contention. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_118">Section 33A</a> of

the Water Act are to operate despite anything contained in any

other law but subject to the provisions of the Act.


</p><p id="p_167">52. It is not only the requirement of the powers and

functions of the Board under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_119">Water Act</a> but also its

statutory and the Constitutional obligations to ensure that

pollution is controlled as well as prevented. They must ensure

that the industries which are unauthorisedly and illegally

existing and causing pollution, must be stopped in the interest

of the environment and the issuance of such direction for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                 99</span>
 closure of the unit would squarely fall within the ambit of

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_120">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_168">
</p><p id="p_169">53. The directions contemplated under this Section are to be

issued by the Board in exercise of its powers and performance

of its functions under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_121">Water Act</a>.        Under both these

conditions, the emphasis is upon the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_122">Water

Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_123">Section 25</a> of the Act puts a complete prohibition on any

person to establish or operate any unit, treatment or disposal

system without the previous consent of the Board. No person

has the right to carry on any industrial or business activity

without first obtaining the consent of the Board. The consent

of the Board is a condition precedent and not subsequent to

operation of the industry unless in the case of those which are

specifically saved under the proviso to <a href="/doc/398146/" id="a_124">Section 25(1)</a> of the

Water Act, that too for a period of three months from the date

of commencement of the Act i.e. from 23rd March, 1974. The

industry   which   commences     its   operations   and   causes

pollution for years together, cannot be heard to complain that

the provisions of Rule 34 of the Water Rules were not complied

with stricto sensu before passing a direction under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_125">Section 33A</a>

of the Water Act. As already noticed, we still find that there is

substantial compliance to the spirit of Rule 34 of the Water

Rules inasmuch as some of the units were inspected, some

were even issued show cause notices and the directions for




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                              100</span>
 closure had been passed in terms of the provisions under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_126">Section 33A</a> supra.
</p>
<p id="p_170">
</p><p id="p_171">54. Where the Board proposes to issue any direction for

stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity or water or any

other service to the industry, it is required to endorse to the

occupier of industry, operation or process, and objections, if

any, filed by the occupier, with an officer designated, shall be

dealt with in accordance with the procedure prescribed.


</p><p id="p_172">55. At the relevant time, when the impugned directions were

issued, they suffered from the defect of non-compliance and

violation of the principle of audi alteram partem, as specifically

built in Rule 34 of the Water Rules. The directions issued by

the Board under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_127">Section 33A</a> of the Act were never given effect

to.   They remained unimplemented.          When the applicants

approached the High Court, the effect of these directions was

stayed. At that time, all the applicants were running their

units and they were not closed in furtherance to the impugned

directions. In that sense, the applicants have not suffered any

prejudice.
</p>
<p id="p_173">
</p><p id="p_174">56. Certainly, the applicants, while taking advantage of such

non-compliance, cannot be permitted to continue to pollute

the environment indiscriminately. They are expected to carry

on their industrial and commercial activities subject to the law

in force.    They are required to discharge the trade effluents

strictly    in   accordance   with   the   specified   parameters.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                               101</span>
 Admittedly, all these units had started their operations

without obtaining the consent of the Board, which was the

statutory obligation of the applicants. The unit owners cannot

be permitted to take advantage of their own wrong and

violation of their statutory obligations to comply with the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_128">Section 25</a> of the Water Act.


</p><p id="p_175">57. In any case, their grievance of not having been provided

with an opportunity of being heard by the Board loses its

significance now because we have heard every applicant at

length. Upon hearing them, it becomes evident that all these

applicants had started their operations without obtaining

consent of the Board and were polluting the environment;

some of them did not even apply for the consent and their

operations are environmentally prejudicial. They did not have

the consent even from the Trust for discharging their effluents

into the CETP.       Post-action is not uncommon in law,

particularly when non-compliance with the principles of

natural justice, has not caused any prejudice to the affected

party. Having heard the applicants at length and perused the

records, we are of the considered view that even as of today,

no prejudice has been caused to the applicants, much less an

irretrievable injury or prejudice.
</p>
<p id="p_176">
</p><p id="p_177">58. Keeping in view the principle of sustainable development,

the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the time

for which these industries have been in operation, we do not



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                            102</span>
 propose to direct their closure forthwith but would issue

appropriate directions to enable them to operate while

ensuring that there is no pollution. It would be necessary for

us to examine the effect and impact of the impugned

directions with reference to the violation of the principles of

natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_178">
</p><p id="p_179">59. In the present case, some of the applicants have been

served with a notice before passing of the directions under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_129">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_180">
</p><p id="p_181">60. In the case of O.A. No.367 of 2013, the notice to show

cause as to why a direction for closure be not issued, was

served by the Board on 27th September, 2010. The order

directing closure of the unit under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_130">Section 33A</a> of the Water

Act was made on 27th August, 2012. The applicant had made

an application for obtaining consent of the Board in the

meanwhile which was also declined and the consent to operate

was refused vide order dated 13th August, 2012.       In other

words, this unit was given a reasonable opportunity before the

direction under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_131">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act was issued. This

unit was even inspected by a team of the officers of the Board

on 27th September, 2011 and was found to be a polluting

industry, which ultimately led to refusal of the consent.

Further, this unit claims that it had established its own

pollution treatment CETP as well as reverse osmosis system

and is no longer a polluting industry. It is the claim of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                            103</span>
 unit that after installation of the said anti-pollution devices, it

had applied for obtaining the consent of the Board, which

application is pending and has not been finally disposed of by

the Board.    Still, in some other cases, notices have been

issued to the applicants before passing of the direction for

closure under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_132">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act.         Indisputably,

there are cases where the Board has issued directions under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_133">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act without strictly complying with

the procedure prescribed under Rule 34 of the Water Rules.


</p><p id="p_182">61. In those cases, there is violation of the principles of

natural justice as well as the prescribed procedure. To that

extent, the orders issued against the applicants would be

liable to be set aside. But this aspect need not be deliberated

upon by us at any greater length for the reason that the High

Court, vide its order dated 9th September, 2010, had passed

an interim stay of the orders passed by the Board under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_134">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act. In other words, all these units

have been carrying on their activities under the protection of

the order of the Court.    The Board had filed an application

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_135">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, praying for

vacation of the stay order, which remained pending and has

been listed before the Tribunal along with these applications.


</p><p id="p_183">62. Thus, the impugned orders would, in fact, be liable to be

set aside for want of compliance with the mandatory principles

of natural justice, as contemplated under Rule 34 of the Water



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                                                104</span>
 Rules wherever a reasonable opportunity has not been granted

including the cases where such opportunity has been granted

and show cause notices were served upon the applicants and

still   there   has    been    some    non-compliance      with   other

procedural aspects. Even if the orders passed by the Board

under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_136">Section 33A</a> of the Act are set aside, still the

consequences as of today would remain unchanged, as the

applicants      have   no     right   to   pollute   the   environment

indiscriminately to the disadvantage of the public at large. Its

proper regulation in accordance with law thus becomes the

most significant aspect of these cases, which we shall shortly

deal with.
</p>
<p id="p_184">
</p><p id="p_185">63. Commonly raised by the applicants in most of these

applications is to the order passed by the Trust declining

membership/permission to the applicants to discharge their

trade effluents into the drain of the Trust, leading to its CETP

in that industrial area.        The challenge is that the order is

entirely arbitrary and without any proper reasons.                 The

impugned orders of the Trust are somewhat similarly worded.

It is stated that:
</p>
<p id="p_186">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">        "Your discharge quantity of effluent shown in the
        application is not justified therefore membership is not
        granted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_187">64. According to the applicants, this order, besides being

vague, is arbitrary and states no reasons. The reason stated in

the impugned order does not show that the authorities have


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                                    105</span>
 applied their mind and passed the order in accordance with

law. Further, it is contended that a large number of industries

have been shut in the meanwhile. The calculations made by

the Trust are not proper and, in fact, are contrary to the

contents of their own website and the information received by

the applicants through the process of <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_137">RTI Act</a> from the Trust

itself.   The CETP is functioning much below its optimum

capacity, which is 20 MLD, as afore-noticed.        On the one

hand, the Trust is declining membership/consent to discharge

the trade effluents of the applicants, while on the other, it has

increased the capacity of the existing CETP by three folds.

The submission on behalf of the Trust, on the contrary, is that

the order might not have been worded rightly but what the

Trust intended to inform the applicants was that their

applications did not give true disclosure of the effluents that

they were going to discharge into the drain and the same was

misleading. The permission was declined not on the basis of

the capacity of the CETP primarily, but for the misleading

statements made by the applicants.        However, it was also

contended that the Trust would be willing and ready to do the

needful to provide membership/permission to the units to

discharge their trade effluents into the drain of the CETP once

the pipeline is completed and with the aid of the other

respondents, the capacity of the existing CETP is increased or

an additional CETP is established.
</p>
<p id="p_188">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                                              106</span>
</p><p id="p_189"> 65. To demonstrate arbitrariness in the action of the

respondents in different cases that form part of the present

bunch, it is stated on behalf of the applicants that they had

written to the Board, that for the existing 12 tables, consent

had been granted by the Trust. However, 4 tables out of the

said 12 were purchased by the applicants who then applied for

the consent.   However, the consent for such 12 tables was

declined for running their textile industries.


</p><p id="p_190">66. To eliminate or repel the ground of arbitrariness from an

administrative order, it is necessary that it should be shown

that the order in question was the result of a fair play. Fair

play in action requires that the procedure adopted must be

just and reasonable and that the power has not been exercised

other than the ones contemplated under law. The other cases

of arbitrariness are where a particular mode is prescribed for

doing an act and there is no impediment in adopting the

procedure, the deviation to act in a different manner which

does not disclose any discernible reasonable principle, shall be

labeled as arbitrary. It has also been held by the courts that

while the discretion to change the policy in exercise of the

executive power, when not trammelled by any statute or rule

is wide enough, what is imperative and implicit in terms of

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_138">Article 14</a> is that a change in policy must be made fairly and

of the Trust that the CETP was not working to its optimum

capacity. This is a matter of serious concern. The inefficient

working of the CETP, which has the capacity of 20 MLD and

there being so much of pressure for discharge of trade

effluents leading to the CETP, would necessarily require the

Trust and even for the State Government to ensure that the

CETP works to its optimum capacity and not by 5 MLD short.

The CETP has the capacity to deal with more trade effluents

than what it is presently treating. As of now, 50% of the trade

effluents are being put into the river untreated. This is a

matter of serious concern for all the authorities and the State

Government. This is leading to polluting the river continuously

and indiscriminately.

     right to a wholesome, clean and decent environment.
     The Constitution of India, in terms of <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_146">Article 48A</a>,
     mandates that the State is under a Constitutional
     obligation to protect and improve the environment and to
     safeguard the forest and wild life in the country. By 42nd
     Amendment to the Constitution, the Parliament, with an
     object of sensitizing the citizens of their duty,
     incorporated <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_147">Article 51A</a> in the Constitution, inter alia,
     requiring a citizen to protect and improve the natural
     environment including the forests, lakes, rivers and wild
     life and to have a compassion for living creatures. The
     legislative intent and spirit under Articles 48A and 51A(g)
     of the Constitution find their place in the definition of
     'environment' under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_148">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
     1986 (for short the 'Act of 1986'). The legislature enacted
     various laws like the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_149">Control of
     Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_150">Control of

     1972, the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_151">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>, 1980, the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_152">Indian
     Forest Act</a>, 1927 and the <a href="/doc/548841/" id="a_153">Biological Diversity Act</a>, 2002
     and other legislations with the primary object of giving
     wide dimensions to the laws relating to protection and
     improvement of environment. It is true that Part III of the
     Constitution relating to Fundamental Rights does not
     specifically devote any Article to the Environment or
     protection thereof per se. However, with the development
     of law and pronouncement of judgments by the Supreme
     Court of India, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_154">Article 21</a> of the Constitution has been
     expanded to take within its ambit the right to a clean and

 environment are not enemies. Right to a clean and
decent environment has been held to be a fundamental
right, coupled with an obligation on the part of the State
and the citizens.
</p><p id="p_203">13. The legal history of our country shows that
Supreme Court entered into one of its most creative
periods during 1980 onwards. It specifically expanded
the fundamental right enshrined in Part III of the
Constitution. In the process, the boundaries of
fundamental right to life and personal liberty guaranteed
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_155">Article 21</a> were expanded to include environmental
protection. The Supreme Court strengthened <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_156">Article 21</a>
in two ways. First it required laws affecting personal
liberty to also pass the tests of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_157">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_158">Article 19</a>
of the Constitution, thereby ensuring that the procedure
depriving a person of his or her personal liberty be
reasonable, fair and just. Second, the court recognized
several unarticulated liberties that were implied by
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_159">Article 21.</a> It is by this second method that the Supreme
Court interpreted the right to life and personal liberty to
include the right to a wholesome environment.
("Environmental Law and Policy in India" 2nd Edition, by
Shyam Divan &amp; Armin Rosencranz, Oxford University
Press). This principle was initially explained by the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/181685796/" id="a_160">Rural Litigation and Entitlement
Kendra, Dehradun v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (AIR 1988 SC
2187). Even at the stage of interim order, the Supreme
Court articulated the fundamental right to a healthful
environment. <a href="/doc/27930439/" id="a_161">In Virender Gaur v. State of Haryana</a> [1995
(2) SCC 577], explaining upon this concept, the Supreme
Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">          "<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_162">Article 21</a> protects the right to life as a
          fundamental right. Enjoyment of life...
          including [the right to live] with human
          dignity encompasses within its ambit, the
          protection       and     preservation      of
          environment, ecological balance free from
          pollution of air and water, sanitation,
          without which life cannot be enjoyed. Any
          contra acts or actions would cause
          environmental pollution. Environmental,
          ecological, air, water pollution, etc. should
          be regarded as amounting to violation of
          <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_163">Article 21.</a> Therefore, hygienic environment
          is an integral facet of right to healthy life
          and it would be impossible to live with
          human dignity without a human and

           only to ensure and safeguard proper
          environment but also an imperative duty
          to take adequate measures to promote,
          protect and improve both the man-made
          and the natural environment."
</blockquote><p id="p_204">14. The Supreme Court then took the view that the
factors governing the quality of life have been included in
the expression "life" contained in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_164">Article 21</a> by reason of
creative interpretation of the said provision by the Court.
It said that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_165">Article 21</a> does not only refer to the necessity
to comply with procedural requirements, but also
substantive rights of a citizen. It aims at preventive
measures as well as payment of compensation in case
human rights of a citizen are violated. The provisions of
law were to be susceptible or vulnerable to challenge
even on the ground of unreasonableness. To examine the
legislative impact of environmental laws, it would be
necessary to ascertain the object which the legislature
seeks to achieve and the intent of the legislature. Where
the statute ex facie points out degradation of the
environment and change of user envisaged by the
Constitution, e.g. existing open space to be used for
commercial purposes, it may be necessary to invoke the
'precautionary principle' and ensure protection of
environment. ("Environmental and Pollution Laws in
India", 2nd Edition, 2010 by Justice T.S. Doabia, Volume
I, LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa Nagpur).
</p><p id="p_205">15. The Courts have consistently taken the view that
right to life includes the right to a decent environment.
The right to a clean environment is a guaranteed
fundamental right. The Courts could even impose
exemplary damages against the polluter. Proper and
healthy environment enables people to enjoy a quality of
life which is the essence of the right guaranteed under
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_166">Article 21.</a> The right to have congenial environment for
human existence is the right to life. The State has a duty
in that behalf and to shed its extravagant unbridled
sovereign power and to forge in its policy to maintain
ecological balance and hygienic environment. Though
Government has power to give directions, that power
should be used only to effectuate and further the goals of
the approved scheme, zonal plans, etc. If without
degrading the environment or minimizing adverse effects
thereupon by applying stringent safeguards, it is not
possible to carry on development activity applying the
principle of sustainable development, in that eventuality,
development has to go on because one cannot lose sight
of the need for development of industries, irrigation
resources, power projects, etc. including the need to
improve the employment opportunities and the

 generation of revenue. So a balance has to be struck.

edition, LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa Nagpur)."


</p><p id="p_206">     We may also refer to another judgment of the

Tribunal in the case of Kehar Singh v. State of Haryana

[All India NGT Reporter 2013 (1) Part 7] where, after

referring to various judgments of the Supreme Court of

India, the Tribunal held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_207">
"27. The word 'environment' is an expression of broad
spectrum which inculcates in its sweep both hygienic
atmosphere and ecological balance. The right to life with
human dignity encompasses within its ambit the
preservation of environment, ecological balance free from
air and water pollution. It also includes maintaining
proper sanitation without which it may not be possible to
enjoy life. The conduct or actions, which would cause
environmental pollution and disturb the ecological
balance should be regarded as violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_167">Article 21</a> of
the Constitution of India.         Therefore, promoting
environmental protection implies maintenance of
environment as a whole comprising the man-made and
the natural environment. It is, therefore, not only the
duty of the State but also the duty of every citizen to
maintain hygienic environment.        Thus, there is a
constitutional imperative on the State Governments and
the municipalities to take adequate measures to
promote, protect and improve both the man-made and
the natural environment (Refer: <a href="/doc/27930439/" id="a_168">Virender Gaur vs. State
of Haryana</a> (1995) 2 SCC 577)."
</p><p id="p_208">"32. While dealing with a social welfare legislation, the
provisions and the words therein are to be given a liberal
and expanded meaning. Of course, liberal construction
does not mean that the words shall be forced out of their
natural meaning but they should receive a fair and
reasonable interpretation so as to attain the object for
which the instrument is designed and the purpose for
which it is applied. Both the object and purpose in
relation to its application are thus, relevant
considerations for interpretation. The Courts have also
permitted departure from the rule of literal construction
so as to avoid the statute becoming meaningless or futile.
In the case of <a href="/doc/27215/" id="a_169">Surjit Singh v. Union of India</a> (1991) 2 SCC

      87 and Sarajul Sunni Board v. Union of India AIR 1959
     SC 198, the Supreme Court has also held that it is not
     allowable to read words in a statute which are not there,
     but where the alternative allows, either by supplying
     words which appear to have been accidentally omitted or
     by adopting a construction which deprives certain
     existing words of all meaning, it is permissible to supply
     the words. It is also a settled cannon that in case of a
     social or beneficial legislation, the Courts or Tribunals
     are to adopt a liberal or purposive construction as
     opposed to the rule of literal construction."
</p><p id="p_209">72. The Constitutional and statutory obligations of the

stakeholders including the public at large have been clearly

mandated where <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_170">Article 51A(g)</a> of the Constitution places upon

every citizen an obligation to protect and improve the natural

environment, including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life and

to have compassion for the living creatures.                 Under its

Directive   Principles,    <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_171">Article    48-A</a>   require   the   State   to

endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to

safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. On the clear

understanding     of      these      Constitutional    and   statutory

provisions, it cannot be doubted that every industry, every

individual and particularly the State and its instrumentalities

are expected to maintain and endeavour for a cleaner,

wholesome and decent environment. 'Environment' is a term

of wide connotation and takes in its ambit everything relating

to nature. The definition of environment in the Environmental

(Protection) Act of 1986 has been very widely defined and

substantiates such approach.

the extent and area of water pollution resulting from the

 consent of the Board. The CETP of the Trust is performing

much below its optimum capacity.            This reflects mal-

functioning of the CETP. There is a dire need for providing

and/or expanding the industrial area to accommodate a large

number of industries in existence as well as the ones which

are likely to come up in the near future and, thus, will cause

further environmental pollution.        During the course of

inspection, it has come on record that nearly 37.2 MLD is the

trade and other effluent-discharge into the drain, leading to

the CETP. The CETP is incapable of treating this load of trade

effluent even if it was operating at its optimum capacity, which

is stated to be 20 MLD.      As the situation exists presently,

pollution is inevitable.   This current extent of pollution will

increase with the passage of time and would become an

unsolvable issue by the authorities concerned including the

State Government. Neither the State Government of Rajasthan

nor the RIICO can sit back and see the level of water pollution

increasing day by day.     However, the ground reality is that

there has been planning alone without any action for years

now.     Thus, the authorities concerned have failed in

preventing and controlling the pollution. With the passage of

time, the pollution level has increased manifold.          It is

undisputed that even the underground water in these years

has become red and unfit for human consumption.             The

availability of water is scarce.   Whatever water is available,

needs to be protected from pollution, whether in streams or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                                             120</span>
 ground   water.     Unless    all   the   stakeholders   i.e.   the

Government, the Industrial Corporation (RIICO), the Trust, the

industrial units and even the public at large work in tandem

and co-operate with one another in order to achieve the object

of pollution-free environment in this industrial area and the

surrounding areas, it will never be an achievable object.


</p><p id="p_233">81. At this stage, we may appropriately notice a fact that has

come on record that lastly, the industrial area that was

declared or established by the Government was in the year

1984 whereafter there has been no material expansion or

development of any industrial area. The CETP of the Trust is

located on 9 acres of land.     It has 212 members from the

textile industry who are discharging 11.851 MLD effluents

while the steel industries 3.15 MLD of effluents. This shows

that there is ample scope for expansion of the CETP as well as

establishment of a new CETP. The Trust needs to upgrade its

CETP, the management of which is vested in the Trust itself

though the CETP belongs to RIICO, who is the owner of the

industrial estate. Thus, it is important that all these bodies

including the State Government take planned actions and

within a specified time limit to ensure control of the

aggressively increasing trend of the pollution.


</p><p id="p_234">82. It has also come on record and was admitted during the

course of the hearing that the Trust has already started laying

down a separate pipeline for the purpose of collecting the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                                                121</span>
 trade effluents discharged by its members.      This pipeline is

expected to be completed positively by April, 2014.         Upon

completion of this pipeline, the Trust would be able to collect

and treat a higher quantity of trade effluents. Some of the

members of the Trust are not just violating the prescribed

parameters while discharging their trade effluents but are

discharging the effluents three times in excess of the limit

prescribed for them. This is due to the poor management and

failure of the Trust and the RIICO to provide appropriate

checks and balances for control of pollution.


</p><p id="p_235">83. A concerted effort by all the stakeholders has to be taken

in order to ensure effective control and prevention of pollution

while permitting development without irretrievably damaging

the environment. The principle of sustainable development

and the precautionary principle have to be applied by the

Tribunal to the facts and circumstances of the present case.

The Tribunal has to adopt an approach which will resolve the

serious problem of water and environmental pollution caused

by these industries, which has been persisting now for years

in this industrial estate. Each stakeholder needs to act in a

specific direction and provide financial and other aid so as to

ensure that there is no adverse effect on the common objective

of a pollution-free environment in the areas in question.
