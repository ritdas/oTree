                               ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1"> (PER : HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. BHASKAR BHATTACHARYA)


     The Public Interest Litigation along with two other

connected Special Civil Applications have been taken up today

for the purpose of further consideration of the dispute involved

therein.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and after

going through the materials on record, we find that our order

dated 25th October 2013 was meant for implementation of the

directions contained in the letter dated 23rd August 2012,

which was annexed as Annexure-'A' to the Writ Petition (PIL),

and according to the affidavit affirmed by the CPCB, it appears

that the directions contained therein were, in fact, in terms of

<a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_1">Section 18</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     On overall consideration of the above Act, it appears that

in the matter of fixation of policy, the Central Government and

the State Government have also vital role to play along with

the CPCB and the GPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     It appears that principles adopted by the CPCB can be

modified or altered by the Central Government, and at the

same time, such policy adopted by the GPCB can be altered by

the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     In    such       circumstances,    we     are   of   the     view   that

adjudication of the dispute involved herein as prayed for by the

petitioners of the two Special Civil Applications cannot be

effectively made unless we make the Central Government and

the State Government as party to these proceedings. We,

accordingly, direct the petitioner of the three proceedings to

join the State Government and the Central Government as

party to the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     Let notice be issued upon the State of Gujarat and the

Union of India, returnable on 29th January 2014.



</p><p id="p_12">     We do not propose to vary our earlier order dated 25 th

October 2013 at this stage so long the appropriate authority

under the above Act agrees to change the existing policy

based on which the licence was granted, on a pre-condition

that the concerned industry must use LNG.



</p><p id="p_13">       Let the matters appear on 29th January 2014.



       The petitioners are at liberty to serve, in addition to the

notice, the advance copy of the applications upon the

Government Pleader and the Assistant Solicitor General of

India, Gujarat High Court, Ahmedabad.



</p><p id="p_14">       We make it clear that pendency of these Applications will

not stand in the way of the CPCB and the GPCB, in making

efforts for resolving the dispute jointly.
