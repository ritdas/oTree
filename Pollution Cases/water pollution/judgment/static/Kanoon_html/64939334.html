           providing services such as food, fiber and raw materials.            They play
           important roles in storm and flood control, in supply of clean water,
           alongwith other educational and recreational benefits. Despite these benefits,
           wetlands are the first target of human interference and are among the most
           threatened of all natural resources. Around 50% of the earth's wetlands
           are estimated to already have disappeared worldwide over the last
           hundred years through conversion to industrial, agricultural and
           residential purposes. Even in current scenario, when the ecosystem
           services provided by wetlands are better understood - degradation and
           conversion of wetlands continues.

           base of these natural resources as the pre-requisite for management and
           conservation planning, National Wetland Inventory and Assessment

           systematic destruction of wetlands. We have seen photographs which are
           tendered by the petitioners which also clearly demonstrate that apart from
           destruction of wetlands, the land is reclaimed and illegal reclamation is
           being carried out by certain persons. As of today, no permanent machinery
           is set up by the State Government for the purpose of stopping destruction of
           wetlands. We are, therefore, of the opinion that it would be necessary to
           impose total ban on destruction and reclamation of wetlands which are
           described in the Atlas prepared by the Central Government. permission
           should be granted for destruction Hereinafter no and reclamation of
           wetlands and prompt action including lodging of FIR/complaint be taken.

Affidavit in Writ Petition No.303 of 2018 stating that in Parabhani, Nandurbar and

Nagpur Districts, there are no wetlands, Mr. Zaman Ali, Advocate appearing for the

Petitioner in PIL No.87 of 2013 referred to the district wise break up prepared by the

Petitioner as per the National Wetland Atlas for Maharashtra and pointed out that :

</p><p id="p_22">           (i) Nandurbar District has a total of 735 Wetlands (Item No.1, Chart at
Annexure - A);
</p><p id="p_23">           (ii) Nagpur District has a total of 1054 Wetlands (Item No.9, Chart at
Annexure - A);
</p><p id="p_24">           (iii) Parbhani District has a total of 276 Wetlands (Item No.17, Chart at
Annexure - A);
</p><p id="p_25">Advocate Mr. Zaman Ali submitted that therefore, a stark difference is prima facie

observed between the data submitted by the Under Secretary, Environment

Department and the available scientific data on number of wetlands identified in

Maharashtra by premier scientific agencies (SAC and MRSAC). He submitted that in

view of the above, it is highly misleading and incorrect for the Under Secretary,

Environment Department to submit on oath that there are no wetlands in Nandurbar,

Nagpur and Parbhani Districts.
