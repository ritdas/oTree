Sambuddha Chakrabarti, J.:
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     The petitioner who is an employee of the West Bengal

Pollution Control Board (the Board, for short) was promoted by an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>




order, dated February 27, 2013 to the post of Environmental

Engineer. He says that his service conditions are guided by the

West Bengal Pollution Control Board Employees' Service Regulation,

2009 which was framed in exercise of the powers conferred by

<a href="/doc/1662929/" id="a_1">Section 12</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974 (the Act, for short). In fact, the Board itself is a statutory body

constituted under <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_3">Section 4</a> of the Act. The promotion of the

petitioner was sanctioned by the department of Environment,

Government of West Bengal. His promotion was discussed and

deliberated at the 156th meeting of the Board and in the 157th

meeting of the Board held on September 30, 2013 the minutes of

the previous meeting were confirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     The Board published a draft gradation list for the post of the

Environmental Engineer and invited objections. By a subsequent

memorandum, dated November 8, 2013, the gradation list was

circulated as the final gradation list of the Environmental Engineers

as on November 4, 2013 in which the name of the petitioner

appeared at serial number 19. At present he is eligible for

promotion to the next higher post of Senior Environmental

Engineer.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span><p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">       The   petitioner   alleges    that   he   was    served   with     a

memorandum, dated December 12, 2017 issued by the Member

Secretary of the Board by which he was reverted to the feeder post

of Environmental Engineer with effect from February 27, 2013.

Such    exercise   had    been      undertaken   on    the   basis   of   a

memorandum, dated September 20, 2017 issued by the respondent

no. 1, on the ground that the promotion granted in favour of the

petitioner was based on an alleged erroneous procedure. The

petitioner made a representation on December 18, 2017 the fate of

which he remains still uninformed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">       It has been the case of the petitioner that while granting

promotion his eligibility and other incidental issues were considered

and examined by the selection committee in terms of Regulation 33

of the Service Regulations, 2009 and a conscious decision was

taken upon application of mind which will be evident from the

resolutions of the Board meetings mentioned above. His right to

hold the post of Environmental Engineer attained finality upon

publication of the gradation list. Consequently, the order of

reversion is bad and has the effect of setting aside the final

gradation list without there being any challenge to it.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>
</p><p id="p_10">      The   petitioner   has    variously   assailed   the   impugned

memorandum, dated December 12, 2017 as issued by an authority

lacking competence to do so, being perverse and arbitrary and that

the same amounts to punishment by reduction in rank without

holding any disciplinary proceeding against him. He has also

assailed the impugned memo being barred by principle of estoppel

as he had been reverted about five years after he was promoted.



</p><p id="p_11">      The petitioner has inter alia prayed for a declaration that the

impugned memorandum, dated December 12, 2017 and the

memorandum, dated September 20, 2017 are bad in law and

unsustainable, a writ in the nature of certiorari commanding the

respondents to produce the records of the case so that conscionable

justice may be done by quashing the impugned memoranda, a writ

in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents to

withdraw, revoke and rescind the memorandum, dated December

12, 2017 and to allow the petitioner to continue in the post of the

Environmental Engineer with the consequential benefits attached to

the post and for other ancillary reliefs.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      5</span><p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      On behalf of the respondents nos. 2 and 3 the senior law

officer   affirmed    an    affidavit-in-opposition.       The      answering

respondents    have      contended       that   on   the    basis     of   the

recommendation of the selection committee the petitioner was

promoted to the post of Environmental Engineer from Assistant

Environmental Engineer. Subsequently, Smt Bithika Goswami and

Sri Samit Dutta, two Assistant Environmental Engineers made

several complaints to the Chairman and Member Secretary of the

Board alleging that the promotional order in favour of the petitioner

had deprived them of their due promotion. Similarly, Smt

Dipanjana Moulik, a Senior Environmental Officer, Government of

West Bengal, who was in deputation in the said department made a

complaint to the Chairman alleging her supersession by some of the

officers of the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">      The Environment Department, Government of West Bengal by

an order dated May 6, 2015 directed the Board to examine the

issues raised by Smt. Dipanjana Maulik. The officer on special duty

of the Board submitted a report on June 5, 2015 to the effect that

on examination of records it had been found that Smt. Dipanjana

Maulik had been denied promotion in view of an erroneous method
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   6</span>




adopted by the selection committee ignoring the relevant seniority of

the officers and ranked them based on their Annual Confidential

Report (ACR, for short) ratings. This was not in conformity with the

State of West Bengal promotional norms which the Board accepted

to follow.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">      The Member Secretary of the Board by an order, dated

November 16, 2016 constituted a three-member committee to

suggest the necessary action to be taken.       The said committee

submitted a report in which it was found that the selection

committee did not follow the State Government norms while

ranking the Environmental Engineers for promotion, ignored their

relevant seniority and ranked them based on their ACR ratings.



</p><p id="p_18">      The report was subsequently referred to the Principal

Secretary of the concerned department of the Government of West

Bengal with a note that in order to redress the grievance of Smt.

Dipanjana Maulik the Board would have to modify its order, dated

February 27, 2013 and the Environmental Engineers promoted by

order, dated February, 27, 2013 would have to be reverted to the

feeder post. Since the other complaints have also been received, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   7</span>




Board constituted a committee to enquire into the complaints. As

the matter related to promotion and had financial implications the

department of Environment was requested to give their opinion in

the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">     This time another three-member committee was constituted to

ascertain the veracity of the complaints made by other engineers

and scientists and the report submitted by this committee was in

the same line with the one submitted by the previous committee.

The committee proposed to cancel or modify the earlier orders. The

report of the committee was again forwarded to the Principal

Secretary of the concerned department who by a letter, dated

September 20, 2017 informed the Member Secretary of the Board

that the matter had been examined by the department and it was

inter alia found that selection had been done erroneously and

flouting government norms and the Board's own service regulations.

The opinion of the department was communicated that the Board

should cancel the earlier promotion based on erroneous procedure.

After this the Member Secretary of the Board issued the impugned

order, dated December 12, 2017.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8</span><p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">     It has been the stand of the respondents that by a

memorandum, dated January 29, 1986 the Deputy Secretary,

Government of West Bengal informed the Member Secretary of the

Board that the employees of the Board would be guided by the

provisions laid down in the West Bengal Service Rules. At present

the Employee's Service Regulations, 2009 is in force. The Board is

bound to accept all the directives and instructions of the State

Government under the Act and since its inception it had carried out

the same without reservation or modification. Even the pay scales

cannot be prescribed by the Board without the approval of the State

Government.    Since Smt. Dipanjana Maulik, an employee of the

Board was in deputation in the department of Environment,

involvement of the department was inevitable. Since it had financial

implication the opinion of the department was sought for. The

respondents have specifically mentioned that before seeking any

opinion from the department of Environment it was decided to

modify/cancel the order, dated February 27, 2013.      The order of

promotion was rightly cancelled and the impugned orders do not

suffer from any impropriety or infirmity.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    9</span><p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">      The answering respondents have further contended that no

legally protected right of the petitioner which can be judicially

enforced has been infringed. They have prayed for dismissal of the

writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">      The respondent nos. 2 and 3 have also filed a supplementary

affidavit-in-opposition seeking to bring on record certain facts

which were not mentioned inadvertently in the earlier affidavit. By

this affidavit, the respondents contended that Regulation 33(1) of

the Service Regulations of the Employees of the Board says that all

cases of promotion shall be considered by the appointing authority

on the basis of seniority-cum-merit after due consideration of the

relevant criteria as mentioned in the affidavit. In case of category A

employees the ACR and in case of categories B, C and D employees

annual performance report shall be considered.        In the case of

seniority-cum-merit the seniors in the feeder grade are selected

subject to their suitability.   In that case a benchmark for merit

should be prescribed and then making promotions according to the

seniority out of the candidates achieving the requisite benchmark.

In the present case the settled procedure was not followed. In the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    10</span>




gradation list several senior officers were ignored for promotion in

spite of their eligibility.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">      In the affidavit-in-reply the petitioner has largely reiterated his

stand in the writ petition. He has denied the allegations contained

in various sub-paragraphs of paragraph 6 of the affidavit-in-

opposition. He has particularly mentioned that he had not been

informed of any complaint being made by anyone alleging

supersession. Smt. Dipanjana Maulik alleged that she had been

superseded in view of the promotional order, dated February 27,

2013 for the post of Senior Environmental Engineer and not for the

post of Environmental Engineer.         The officer-on-special-duty gave

his findings behind the back of the concerned employees who were

not served with any notice before he came to a finding that the

procedure adopted by the Member Secretary while granting

promotion on February 27, 2013 was not in conformity with the

State Government's promotional norms which the Board was

expected to follow. The petitioner has reiterated that the Principal

Secretary, department of Environment, is not the employer and has

no power and jurisdiction to redress the grievance of Smt.

Dipanjana Maulik.        The Board has no authority to seek opinion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   11</span>




from the Principal Secretary for modification of the order, dated

February 27, 2013 and to revert the promotees to the feeder posts.

The Committee constituted to enquire into the complaints violated

the principles of natural justice. More than two years after the date

of promotion complaints were lodged and the Board passed the

order of reversion about 5 years after the date of promotion.



</p><p id="p_29">     The petitioner has repeated that since the Board has its own

service rules, the Government norms are not applicable with regard

to his promotion. It was solely on the direction of the department of

Environment that the petitioner had been demoted. The Board did

not take any independent decision and acted on the dictation or

direction of the State Government. Prior to coming to the finding

that the selection committee had ignored the relative seniority of the

candidates and ranked them based on their ACR ratings or the

earlier promotional order was required to be cancelled no notice was

given to the petitioner and the whole thing was sent to the Principal

Secretary behind his back. The State Government cannot dictate

the Board to cancel the order of promotion passed about 5 years

before and to revert the petitioner to the post of the Assistant

Environmental Engineer.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                      12</span><p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">        So   far   as   the   supplementary      affidavit-in-opposition   is

concerned Mr. Ghosh, the learned Advocate for the petitioner,

considering the contents of the same did not wish to file any

rejoinder.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">        The primary challenge of the petitioner is the order issued by

the Member Secretary of the Board cancelling the promotion given

to the petitioner by order, dated February 27, 2013. The petitioner

was reverted to the feeder post with effect from the date of

promotion. Apart from the said order he has also assailed the

memo, dated September 20, 2017 containing the direction of the

department of Environment, Government of West Bengal, as

pursuant to the same the order of reversion was passed by the

Board.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">        The first document has been amended to the writ petition and

the second has been disclosed by the respondent nos. 2 and 3 in

their    affidavit-in-opposition.   We    take     the   second-mentioned

document first as it is chronologically earlier than the first-

mentioned one.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   13</span><p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">     By a communication, dated September 20, 2017 the Principal

Secretary,   Environment    department,     informed    the   Member

Secretary of the Board that the three-member committee found that

the selection did not follow the State Government's norms while

ranking the holders of the feeder post for promotion. The

department's opinion was that the Board should cancel the earlier

promotion    based   on   erroneous    procedures   after   conducting

selection process afresh considering the Service Rule of the State of

Government as well as the Board. Till new promotions are decided

no one might be reverted to an inferior post.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">     The petitioner has assailed the memo, dated December 12,

2017 as passed at the dictate the state government which in the

present case was palpably impermissible. The Board being a

statutory body must enjoy a certain degree of autonomy which

cannot be compromised in any manner whatsoever.



</p><p id="p_40">     The petitioner has further challenged the impugned decision

of the Board as violative of principle of natural justice as before

passing the final order of reversion no hearing was given to him.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  14</span>
</p><p id="p_41">     To the first point, Mr. Basu, the learned Senior Counsel for

the Board, submitted that the decision had been taken by the

Board before the state government had communicated its decision.

That apart, Mr. Basu submitted that since the government is the

funding authority it has a complete control over the Board and that

is why the matter was referred to them.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">     The first submission of Mr. Basu is factually incorrect. The

Board itself has admitted in the affidavit that after receiving the

report of the three-member committee the Member Secretary of the

Board referred the matter to the Principal Secretary of the

concerned department requesting him to give his opinion in the

matter. To this the Principal Secretary expressed his opinion by a

letter, dated September 20, 2017 and the memorandum of the

Board, dated December 12, 2017 makes reference to the opinion

expressed by the Principal Secretary of the concerned department

as the direction of the Government. Thus, even if there was a

finding of a committee, the decision of the Board was taken only

after receiving the opinion of the Principal Secretary, department of

Environment, which was treated by the Board as a directive.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                   15</span>
</p><p id="p_44">        The effort to justify the action of the Board has been made

with reference to the alleged impropriety of the previous selection

committee in not adhering to the norms of promotion and for

violating the principle followed in the case of seniority-cum-merit

rule. From this, Mr. Basu tried to establish that since the earlier

selection committee committed the mistake no purpose would have

been served by giving the petitioner an opportunity of hearing.



</p><p id="p_45">     In support of his contention, Mr. Basu relied on the case of <a href="/doc/965502/" id="a_4">A.

Janardhana vs. Union of India and Others</a>, reported in AIR 1983 SC

769, <a href="/doc/560061/" id="a_5">State of Punjab vs. Jagdip Singh and Others</a>, reported in AIR

1964 SC 521 and <a href="/doc/1765789/" id="a_6">Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and Others vs. Jharna

Sarkar and Others</a>, reported in 2004 (2) CHN 606. These three are

primarily judgments on service jurisprudence laying down different

principles of law pertaining to that particular branch. For example,

A. Janardhana (supra) reiterates the principle that any rule of

seniority has to satisfy the test of equality of opportunity in public

service. In the absence of any other valid rule for determining inter

se seniority of members belonging to the same service the rule of

continuous officiation or the length of service etc. would be valid.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                     16</span>
</p><p id="p_46">         In State of Punjab (supra) the Supreme Court inter alia decided

that where a Government servant has no right to a post or to a

particular status he will not in law be deemed to have been validly

appointed. Since these persons could not be confirmed to their post

they could not be regarded as holding that status. They were merely

officiating to those posts. The ratio in the case of Indian Oil

Corporation Ltd. and Others (supra) is that if a person enjoys a

benefit de hors his right conferred by statute or by agreement he

cannot claim continuation of the same and the other party is

entitled to rectify such mistake or the wrong.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">         There judgments lay down very well-settled principles service

law which, however, have no application to the facts of the present

case. The petitioner has not challenged the breach of any service

rule for determination of seniority or the injustice done to him in

not considering his length of service or whether he has any right to

hold the post and to any declaration to that effect or he can claim

any continuation to the post he had been promoted, so on and so

forth.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  17</span><p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">     These could have been valid considerations had the petitioner

been reverted to the feeder post after complying with the rule of law

and the principles of natural justice. Then the point of challenge

would have been very different and the respondents might have

some degree of justification in relying on them judgments in

support of the action taken by them.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">     The petitioner did not raise any issue on the points which

have been addressed by Mr. Basu seeking to establish the reasons

for the decision taken by the respondents to revert the petitioner to

the original post. The petitioner had no occasion to make any

allegation of the sort in makebelief response to which Mr. Basu

made his submissions. To the extent indicated above, the

submission of Mr. Basu must be held to have been made in

vacuum.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">     The effort of Mr. Basu to justify the action of the respondents

to an unpleaded and extraneous challenge seems to establish that

in the facts of the case compliance with the principles of natural

justice would not have served any purpose. To that effect he relied

on the judgment in the case of Escorts Farms Ltd., previously known
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                    18</span>




as <a href="/doc/59186/" id="a_7">M/s. Escorts Farms (Ramgarh) Ltd. vs. Commissioner, Kumaum

Division, Noinital, U.P. and Others</a>, reported in (2004) 4 SCC 281 for

a proposition that rules of natural justice are to be followed for

doing substantial justice and not for completing a mere ritual of

hearing without possibility of any change in decision of the case on

merits.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">      To the same effort is the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1629868/" id="a_8">Dharampal

Satyapal Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise, Gauhati

and Others</a>, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 519 which has been relied on

by Mr. Basu for a proposition that when a fair hearing would make

no difference no legal duty to provide a hearing arises. Every

violation of a facet of natural justice may not lead to the conclusion

that the impugned order is always null and void.



</p><p id="p_57">      Undoubtedly, these are well carved-out exceptions, recognized

for the last half-a-century or thereabout, to the principle of natural

justice. It is true that in some cases courts felt that the action of the

respondents could still be held even if it was not preceded by an

opportunity of hearing. It was in this genre of cases that courts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   19</span>




have held that hearing would make no difference justifying -

remanding the matter to the respondents for a fresh decision.



</p><p id="p_58">     But such an exception can be resorted to by courts when the

facts are indisputable and the failure to comply with the principles

of natural justice cause no prejudice to the party complaining.

These are the cases where the facts speak for themselves and the

conclusion based on that must be inflexibly far too obvious to admit

of any doubt. It is only in these cases that the courts have held that

natural justice cannot be stretched to an absurd point of empty

formality.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">     This, however, has to be decided by the courts upon an

adjudication of the lis between the parties. It is the court which has

to come to this conclusion after considering the effects of failure to

comply with the principle of natural justice. Form the facts of a

given case the court will have to draw this conclusion. For example,

in the case of Escorts Farms Ltd. (Supra) the Supreme Court found

that the transfer was effected contrary to the terms of government

grant and were impermissible. Upon such a finding the Supreme
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                   20</span>




Court held that remanding the case would be of no legal

consequence.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">       In Dharampal Satyapal Limited (Supra) the appellant attached

the recovery orders passed by the respondents without a show-

cause notice under <a href="/doc/85233116/" id="a_9">Section 11A</a> of the Excise Act. On facts the

Supreme Court held that there was a requirement of issuing show-

cause notice before passing the order of recovery, irrespective of the

fact whether <a href="/doc/546828/" id="a_10">Section 11A</a> of the Act was attracted in that case or

not.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">       That apart, it is not understood why Mr. Basu relied on this

judgment which, if read carefully, is bound to go against the

contention of the respondents. The Supreme Court laid down that

an administrative authority cannot dispense with the requirement

of issuing notice by itself deciding that no prejudice would be

caused to the person against whom an action is contemplated. It is

not permissible for the authority to skip over the compliance of the

principles of natural justice on the ground that even if hearing

would have been provided it would have served no useful purpose.

That has to be considered at a later stage and cannot be presumed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                   21</span>




by the authority. The Supreme Court relied on the case of Board of

High School and Intermediate Education Vs. Chitra Srivastava,

reported in AIR 1970 SC 1039 where the Supreme Court held

whether a duty arises in a particular case to issue a show-cause

notice before inflicting a penalty does not depend on the authority's

satisfaction that the person to be penalized has no defence, but on

the nature of the order proposed to be passed.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">     Judged from that perspective reliance on a part of Dharampal

Satyapal Limited (Supra) is a self-defeating exercise. In a properly

instituted case where the court is called upon to decide on the

merits of the case coupled with a lack of notice of hearing, the court

can conclude that in a given situation non-compliance with the

principles of natural justice would not have an adverse effect on the

fact of the case. This is a prerogative of the court and not of the

administration. Otherwise, there would be a constant effort on the

part of the administration to come up with the plea of empty

formality to cover up their laches and in the process foreboding

consequential doom to the settled requirements of law. As

mentioned earlier, the introduction of the self-imposed justification

or the alleged violation of law five years before by the Board itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                     22</span>




was not in response to any challenge to that effect by the petitioner.

The scope of the dispute raised by the petitioner was very different

and did not call for any explanation how the principle of seniority-

cum-merit    had   been     allegedly    violated   by   the   Board.   The

respondents were not required to make any submission on issues

not pleaded and then claim that their act was so aboveboard and

unimpeachable that compliance with the principles of natural

justice was not required.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">     After the publication of the final gradation list, the petitioner

had acquired a right to hold a post. That could never be unsettled

by the Board more than five and a half years after a date of

promotion without giving him an opportunity of being heard. The

entire exercise by the Board was taken behind the back of the

petitioner and that by itself constitute sufficient grounds for setting

aside the order of the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_69">
</p><p id="p_70">     A bare reading of the order, dated December 12, 2017 carries

an impression that the department of Environment, by its letter,

dated September 20, 2017 had directed the Board to cancel the

promotions given by the order, dated February 27, 2013 which was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                   23</span>




allegedly based on erroneous procedure. In pursuance of the said

direction, the promotion orders were treated as cancelled and the

petitioner was reverted to his feeder post.
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">     One thing stands out quite clearly that the Principal

Secretary, department of Environment gave his opinion which was

accepted by the Board as the direction. The Board never

communicated to the petitioner that the Principal Secretary had

conveyed his opinion as the opinion was treated as a direction and

the same was followed unhesitatingly.
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">     As mentioned earlier for Mr. Basu this all but natural as the

State Government was the funding agency, the Court cannot buy

such view as the accepted norm to be expected of a statutory body

like the Board. The government is the funding authority of umpteen

number of statutory bodies which does not mean that the

government has the ultimate control over their internal affairs. A

very unusual statement has been made in the affidavit-in-

opposition by the respondent nos. 2 and 3 that the Board is bound

to accept all the directives and instructions in verbatim of the

government under the Act and since the very inception the Board
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                   24</span>




had carried out the same without any reservation. The other reason

cited for obeying the opinion of the Principal Secretary is that

alteration in the gradation list involved financial implication and,

therefore, the opinion of the government became necessary.



</p><p id="p_75">     It is one thing to say that the Board is required to follow the

policies of the government under the Act and it is another thing to

entirely act on the opinion of the State Government treating the

same as a direction in respect of a matter falling within the internal

administration of the Board. The Board is a statutory body and,

therefore, it derives its powers and functions from the Act and not

from the individual opinion of the Principal Secretary of any

department.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">     The law has always recognized a very fundamental difference

between a subordinate official and an independent statutory body.

While a subordinate official is bound to carry out the directives of a

superior officer such is not the position with an independent body

constituted under an Act. In its internal functioning it is entirely

independent of the government and should not feel bound by its

directives merely because funds are provided by the government.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                   25</span>




It's time that the autonomy of a statutory body irrespective of

whether it is funded by the government or not, should be

highlighted. The mere fact that the Government funds a statutory

body does not give it any right to be the final arbiter in respect of

the internal matters of a statutory body. The manner in which the

Board treated an opinion as a direction goes a long way to show

how and to what extent it had abdicated its authority in favour of

the government. This has given a significant space to the petitioner

to complain that the order of the Board has been passed the dictate

of the government. This seems to have been admitted by the

Member Secretary himself.
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">     The power is to be exercised by the very authority upon whom

it has been conferred by the statute. When a statutory authority

exercises the powers vested in it by an Act under the dictate from a

different authority, the authority must be held to have totally failed

to exercise the power which was not only vested in it but which

was, in fact, was its duty to exercise. An authority is always

required to act according to its own discretion and to take a

decision of its own. The moment it feels that some external

authority has directed it to do certain thing and, therefore, it has to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                    26</span>




be done, it is not the decision of the statutory body but of an

external authority. Such an act is always vitiated by non-

application of mind. This makes the administration vulnerable to

any criticism.
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><p id="p_81">      In the case of Anirudhsinghji Karansinji Jadeja Vs. State of

Gujarat, reported in AIR 1995 SC 2390, the Supreme Court

observed that the discretion exercised under the direction of some

higher authority is a failure to exercise discretion all together.



</p><p id="p_82">      Whether a certain number of officials should be promoted or

not is a decision to be taken by the Board itself consistent with its

requirement and the recommendation of the selection committee. If

there was any mistake committed by the Board at any stage earlier

and if the Board wanted to rectify the same the decision has to be

taken by the Board itself in accordance with law. This principle has

been explained by the Supreme Court in the case of State of Uttar

Pradesh Vs. Maharaja Dharmander Prosad Singh, reported in AIR

1989 SC 997 that an authority cannot permit its decision to be

influenced by the dictates of others as this would amount to

abdication and surrender of its discretion. It would then not be the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                   27</span>




authority's discretion that is exercised, but someone else's. The

Supreme Court was unambiguous in striking down such a decision

when it held that such an interference by a person or body

extraneous to the power would plainly be contrary to the nature of

the power conferred on the authority.
</p>
<p id="p_83">
</p><p id="p_84">     When under the relevant Act under which the Board has been

constituted contains no provision for acting under the dictates of

the government, the Member Secretary of the Board had no reason

to feel himself bound by the opinion expressed by the Principal

Secretary treating the same as a direction. That is a situation when

an external authority takes a decision and communicates it to

another authority which feels itself bound by it. An independent

application of mind is missing. In the case of Chandrika Jha Vs.

State of Bihar, reported in AIR 1984 SC 322, the Supreme Court

held when a discretionary power is vested in a designated official it

is he alone who must exercise the power according to his own

judgment and discretion and none else. In that case, the Supreme

Court set aside the order of the Registrar of co-operative societies as

the order was passed and dictated by the Chief Minister.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                    28</span>
</p><p id="p_85">     Reference may also be made to the case of Joint Action

Committee of Air Line Pilots' Association of India (ALPAI) and Others

Vs. Director General of Civil Aviation and Others, reported in 2011 (5)

SCC 435 where the Supreme Court had held that in a democratic

set up persons occupying key positions are not supposed to

mortgage their discretion, volition and decision making authority

and be prepared to give away to carry out commands having no

sanctity in law. Thus, if any decision is taken by a statutory

authority at the behest or on suggestion of a person who has no

statutory role to play the same would be patently illegal.



</p><p id="p_86">     This has exactly happened in the present case. The Board

sought for opinion which in the first place was not necessary as the

Board was the ultimate authority to take decision in its internal

matters.   When    the   opinion   was   communicated        the   Board

interpreted it to be a direction and thought itself to be completely

bound by it without even considering that in matters of internal

administration it has to survive or perish on its own decision which

is in tune with the cherished concept of the autonomy. The Member

Secretary had no occasion to apply his mind once he felt himself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                      29</span>




bound by direction of the Principal Secretary of the government

rendering the order liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">         For the reasons stated above, the Court considers the order,

dated December 12, 2017 to be not sustainable in law and it is set

aside. However, the communication, dated December 20, 2017 is

not set aside as it is in the nature of an opinion. The Board is

directed to restore the petitioner to the promotional post within two

weeks. The financial benefit of the post which the petitioner would

have enjoyed but for the order impugned should also be restored to

him within a period of four weeks.
