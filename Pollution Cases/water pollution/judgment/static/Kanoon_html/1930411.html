</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The prayer in the writ petition is to issue a direction to the

first and second respondents to take necessary and effective

action to close down the illegal Brick Kiln conducted by the 5th

respondent. Case of the petitioner is as follows:

</p><p id="p_2">      5th respondent is conducting a wire cut brick manufacturing

unit without obtaining consent from the Pollution Control Board

and without licence from the 4th respondent Panchayat.             The

same is being conducted without following any standards

prescribed under the statutes and it is causing severe pollution in

the locality.   This is being conducted close to the residential

building of the petitioner.     It is stated that the brick kiln is not

covered on the side.       The respondent is dumping mud in the

properties and processing the same in open space. Complaints

were made. The third respondent Pollution Control Board issued

show cause to the 5th respondent vide Ext.P1. The 4th respondent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC No.2981/07                     2</span>

Panchayat issued notice to the 5th respondent to obtain no

objection certificate from the Pollution Control Board and till

receipt of such certificate to stop functioning of the unit. But the

5th respondent neglected to act in the matter. Vide Ext.P3, the

4th respondent issued a request to the 2nd respondent - Sub

Inspector to take urgent steps to stop the functioning of the unit.

4th respondent issued Ext.P4 show cause. But action could not be

taken. Again on 30/10/06, 4th respondent issued Ext.P5 notice

restraining the functioning of the Unit. But still, 5th respondent is

continuing illegal operations and no action is being taken.

Petitioner filed Ext.P6.    Petitioner has taken a ground among

other grounds that 5th respondent is conducting the unit without

proper consent from the Pollution Control Board, under the Water

Prevention and Pollution control Act, apart from, ofcourse under

the Air Pollution and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control Pollution Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.   This court appointed an Advocate Commissioner. In

the report submitted by the Commissioner, it is interalia stated

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            " Whether the fifth respondent's unit is causing

       pollution in the locality?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC No.2981/07                    3</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            Only two sides of the pug mill are seen

      enclosed. the sound emanating from the pug mill is

      bearable. No compound wall is provided. Clay is

      being piled on the western road side. The kiln is not

      fully enclosed as directed by the pollution Control

      Board. There are traces of smoke and soot on the

      wall on the western side.      The eastern side was

      partially enclosed by using G.I.sheets. The kiln is

      causing pollution since it is not fully enclosed."</blockquote><p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.    The Pollution Control Board in the meantime granted

consent to the 5th respondent to operate the unit vide

proceedings dated 07-10-2006 subject to the conditions. Still,

later the Pollution Control Board has filed a report through

Environmental Engineer. Therein, it is interalia stated that even

after providing control measures, complaints have been existing

against nuisance due to air and noise pollution.         There is

reference to an inspection.    There is also reference to certain

control measures being taken by the 5th respondent. It is stated

that the unit was further inspected on 24/05/2007 with kiln fired

to assess the impact of pollution caused by the unit. During the

inspection, it is observed that the petitioner and the nearby

residents are still   experiencing nuisance due to smoke and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WPC No.2981/07                    4</span>

typical smell from the unit as the dispersing facility provided

( Exhaust fan) is not sufficient to prevent the spreading of smoke

to nearby residential area. The last two paragraphs in the report

are also highly relevant which is extracted hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            " Though the unit has provided all normal control

      measures, the problem still exits and it is due to the

      proximity of residences and prevailing wind direction

      in that area.     Further control measures cannot be

      introduced in such small brick units.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            Considering the proximity of residences and

      prevailing wind direction, shifting of the unit to a less

      populated area is the only permanent solution for the

      problem. Being an existing unit, they may be directed

      to shift the unit to a less populated area in a phased

      manner."</blockquote><p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     4.    Additional counter affidavit is filed apparently keeping

in mind the report filed by the environmental engineer by the 5th

respondent Therein it is interalia pointed out that the persons

who reside in close vicinity of the unit have not experienced any

effects of pollution and have no objection in the functioning of the

unit. There is reference to the consent granted to operate the

unit. It is also stated that he has spent considerable money for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WPC No.2981/07                   5</span>

putting up remedial measures. It is further stated that as far as

the commission report is concerned, the only violation is in

condition 7 which requires that the burning of the bricks should

be done only in a fully enclosed room. Reliance is placed on the

report of the Pollution Control Board to negative the finding

rendered by the Advocate Commissioner. There is also reference

to the loan taken from State Bank of Travancore for putting up

the unit. It is stated that the repayment of the loan is not still

over. It is also stated that in case of any suggestion from the

third respondent, the 5th respondent will certainly provide the

more powerful exhaust fan. It is also stated that the report is

malafide as it is given by a relative of the petitioner. It is also

stated that infact the brick kiln is in operation only for 10 days

during a year and also that 5th respondent has provided all the

requisite pollution control measures and that petitioner resides

more than 90 metres from the unit. It is also contended by the

5th respondent that the unit has been functioning for the last

nearly 30 years.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     5.    I heard learned counsel for the parties. It is clear that

the 5th respondent has obtained a consent to operate the brick

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WPC No.2981/07                    6</span>

kiln.  No doubt, the consent is seen obtained from Pollution

Control Board.     One of the contentions raised by the learned

counsel for the petitioner of course is that there is no consent

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>. But then, I must note the contention of the

Pollution Control Board that 5th respondent has been granted

consent to operate under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Air Pollution Control Act</a> and there

is only pollution from sound and air.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

consent to operate granted by the Pollution Control Board is bad

as it was given without hearing the petitioner. I am not prepared

to ignore the consent issued by the Pollution Control Board

merely for the reason that petitioner was not heard. Petitioner

has not cared to challenge the same in a manner known to law

either before this court or before the appellate forum. As long as

it remain unchallenged, I must proceed on the basis that there is

consent to operate granted by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_10">      7.    However, the very same Pollution Control Board has

through its environmental engineer filed its report as directed by

this court, the crucial portions of which I have already mentioned

in my judgment.       Whatever that be, the fact remains that,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WPC No.2981/07                   7</span>

undoubtedly, the Engineer has stated that even after providing all

normal pollution control measures, there is pollution. It is also

stated by the Pollution Control Board that the unit is situated in a

residential area. The learned counsel on behalf of the Pollution

Control Board fairly concedes after getting instructions that

though it is stated in the report that the unit may have to be

shifted to a less populated area, it is submitted that there is no

power vested in the Pollution Control Board to order shifting of

the unit . However, it is submitted that what can be done under

law is to issue closure notice to see that the closure notice is

implemented. It is submitted that shifting is only a suggestion

made by the concerned authority having regard to the pollution

persisting in the area.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     8.    5th respondent has a case that 5th respondent had

licence originally from the Panchayat. The case of the 5th

respondent is that after obtaining the consent, the 5th respondent

has moved the Panchayat seeking permission and since no order

is passed either granting licence or rejecting the same, the 5th

respondent must be treated as in possession of a deemed licence.

Case of the petitioner is that in the teeth of the direction in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">WPC No.2981/07                    8</span>

233(a) it is not open to the 5th respondent to contend that he is

possessing a deemed licence. In the nature of the direction that

I propose to pass, I do not think it necessary to decide this issue

as of now. The writ petition shall stand disposed of as follows:

</p><p id="p_12">       There will be a direction to the 4th respondent Panchayat to

consider whether the 5th respondent is functioning lawfully and if

it is found that 5th respondent is functioning without the support

of the deemed licence as contended by the 5th respondent,

effective and prompt steps will be taken by the 4th respondent to

see that the 5th respondent does not function. A decision in this

regard shall be taken by the 4th respondent within a period of

three weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

As far as the prayer seeking to close down sought against the

third respondent is concerned, as thing stands, the third

respondent has issued consent to operate which is valid till

31-12-2008. As long as it stands, it may not be open for me to

direct the third respondent to order closure as such. In the light

of the report submitted to this court, it will be open to the third

respondent to take effective and prompt steps invoking all the

powers it has under law to see that the pollution which is referred

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WPC No.2981/07                   9</span>

to in the report is brought to an end.
