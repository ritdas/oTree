 JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR (CHAIRPERSON):
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">1.   This is an application filed by the applicant-appellant under

<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_1">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 read with <a href="/doc/86312185/" id="a_2">Section 14(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_3">16</a>

of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (for short 'the NGT Act')

for condonation of delay in filing the present appeal. The applicant

claims to be an 'aggrieved person' within the meaning of the NGT

Act and challenges the grant of Environment Clearance (for short

'the EC') by the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (for short 'the

MoEF') in terms of its order dated 15th February, 2011 to establish

and operate a coal-based thermal power plant of the capacity of

1000 megawatt at Village Naraj-Marthapur in District Cuttack,

State of Orissa.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">2.   The Government of Orissa issued a notification on 20th June,

2003, to include the revenue Village of Naraj-Marthapur, Nuagaon,

Mundali and Talagada under the Naraj-Marthapur-Mundali Gram

Panchayat    of    Cuttack,   Sadar   Tahasil   under   the   Cuttack

Development Authority area for the purposes of its urbanization.

The Government also issued a notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the

Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for establishment of an industrial area

in the general public interest in these villages.   However, in the

notification it was not mentioned that the land would be required

for setting up of the said thermal power plant. The Government of

Orissa signed a Memorandum of Understanding with M/s. Tata

Power Company Ltd. on 26th September, 2006 to set up the said




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                    3</span>
 thermal power plant with an estimated expenditure of Rs.4,348

crores with a time schedule of 42 months.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">3.   The applicant claims to be owner in respect of plot no. 928

and 929 under Khata No.327/9 of an area of 0.190 acres and

0.0330 acres in Mouza Talagada under Cuttack Sadar Tahasil. The

acquisition was assailed by the applicant by filing a writ petition

being Writ Petition No. 6327/2009 before the High Court of Orissa

challenging the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_5">Section 4</a> of the Land Acquisition

Act as well as raising the issue with regard to adverse impacts of

establishment of coal based thermal power plant on environment

and otherwise. According to the applicant, this plant was bound to

result in environmental pollution, pollution of the rivers because of

discharge of mercury and it would adversely affect the ecology of the

District Cuttack and its various parts. The Member Secretary of the

State Pollution Control Board had issued an advertisement on 26 th

March, 2009 in the newspaper fixing the date and venue of public

hearing in regard to the project on 29th May, 2009 at the Red Cross

Conference Hall, Collectorate, Cuttack at 11.00 a.m. The applicant

along with one social activist, Mr. Prafulla Kumar Samantaray, had

filed objection before the Member Secretary.         Not only this,

according to the applicant, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest

(Wildlife) and the Chief Wildlife Warden, Orissa had also raised

objection in respect of approval of the site specific Wildlife

Conservation Plan of M/s. Tata Power Company Ltd. These facts

were also noticed in the EIA report. The Pollution Control Board

also granted consent in terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of The Water

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    4</span>
 (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> of The

Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981           vide   its

memorandum dated 26th March, 2010 in favour of the company to

establish the coal based thermal power plant. It is the allegation of

the applicant that both the above-mentioned impugned orders had

been passed during the pendency of the said order dated 29 th May,

2009 passed by the High Court of Orissa in CM No. 5927/2009 in

Writ Petition No. 6327/2009 and the said writ petition is stated to

be pending before that High Court, even as of today. As such the

applicant has substantive interest and is an aggrieved person in

relation to the orders impugned in the present appeal, i.e. the order

of consent granted by State Pollution Control Board dated 26 th

March, 2010 and EC dated 15th February, 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">5.   During the course of hearing of the aforementioned writ

petition, the counsel appearing for the respondents informed the

applicant on 4th April, 2012, that the acquisition proceedings had

already been completed and also the fact that the EC had been

granted by the MoEF vide its order dated 15th February, 2011. This

is how the applicant avers that he came to know about the factum

of grant of EC and he filed the present appeal before the Tribunal

on 28th May, 2011.     He, thus, prays for condonation of 23 days

delay in filing the present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
While opposing the application for condonation of delay on behalf of

the respondent-company, it is stated that they had put the EC

order on their website on 1st March, 2011 and had published the

EC order in the Indian Express on 21st February, 2011 and the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                     5</span>
 Odisha Bhaskar on 20th February, 2011. Thus, according to it the

limitation, at best, could start from 20th February, 2011 and the

present appeal having been filed on 28th May, 2011 is even beyond

the period of 90 days as prescribed under Section 16 of the NGT

Act. Thus, as per its submission this Tribunal has no jurisdiction

to condone the delay and, in any case, no case has been made out

by the applicant for condonation of delay.        The application,

therefore, is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">6.   On behalf of the MoEF, it is contended that they had put the

EC order on its website on 23rd February, 2011. Once the matter

was put up on the website it was expected of the applicant to be

aware of the said fact and the order, in any case, would be deemed

to have been communicated to the applicant on that date. Thus,

the appeal at best, could be filed by 22nd March, 2011 and/or

within 60 days thereafter but the present appeal having been filed

on 28th May, 2011 is beyond 90 days and the delay in filing the

appeal cannot and should not be condoned by this Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_14">7.   In order to determine whether the application is or is not

barred by time, the primary factors that require determination are

as to when the order was 'communicated' to the person; and if he,

has shown sufficient cause for condoning the delay in filing the

appeal within the 60 days period after the expiry of the prescribed

period of limitation of 30 days.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">8.   Corollary to such discussion would be the issue as to when

the limitation would start running or the date from which such


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                  6</span>
 period of limitation is to be reckoned. All these questions need not

detain us any longer as they squarely stand answered by a Five-

Member Bench of this Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/189583188/" id="a_10">Save Mon Region

Federation &amp; Anr. v. Union of India and Ors</a>. [2013(1) All India NGT

Reporter Page 1]. Following the principles stated therein, it is clear

that communication of order is initiated by transmitting the order

into the public domain by means which are accessible to the public

at large without hindrance. That will be the date from which the

period of limitation shall be reckoned as contemplated under

Section 16 of the NGT Act. Various stakeholders are expected to

comply with different sets of obligations post the passing of an order

of EC in accordance with the provisions of the Environment

(Protection)   Rules,   1986   and   the   Environmental   Clearance

Regulations/Notification of 2006. It is only when the stakeholders,

particularly the MoEF and the project proponent have discharged

their obligations completely in all respects that the period of

limitation shall commence. If different stakeholders at different

intervals have completely discharged their obligations including

putting the order of EC in the public domain at different times, then

the earliest of them would be the relevant date.


</p><p id="p_17">9.   In terms of law stated by the Tribunal in <a href="/doc/189583188/" id="a_11">Save Mon Region

Federation &amp; Anr. v. Union of India and Ors</a>. supra, MoEF was

expected to upload on its website the order of EC within seven days

from the date of passing of that order. Such uploaded order should

be instantly accessible and downloadable by any person free of any

impediment. Further, it was required to put the order in public

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                     7</span>
 domain by placing it on its notice board in its premises including

the premises of its regional offices. Such notice board was also

required to be available to the public at large, without any

hindrance.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">10. In the present case, it has been stated on behalf of the MoEF

that the EC order was passed on 15th February, 2011 and was put

up on its website on 23rd February, 2011. It is not stated whether

the said order was put on the notice board in its office/regional

offices. As such the MoEF has not completely discharged its

obligation in accordance with law in a way that would trigger the

period of limitation from a particular date.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">11. The project proponent claims that it had put the order of EC

on its website on 1st March, 2011 and that it had further published

the intimation of EC order in the Indian Express and the Odisha

Bhaskar on 21st February, 2011 and 20th February, 2011

respectively. On this premise, it is submitted that the period of

limitation shall commence running from 20th/21st February, 2011

and thus the appeal is barred being beyond 90 days, and therefore,

the delay cannot be condoned by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">12. At this stage, we may first notice what are the obligations of a

project proponent under the relevant provisions of law. In a more

recent judgment of the Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/94910251/" id="a_12">Medha Patkar and

Ors. v. Ministry of Environment and Forests and Ors. (Appeal No</a>.1 of

2013), decided on 11th July, 2013, a Bench of the Tribunal held as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_24">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                   8</span>
 "12. From the above dictum, it is clear that a communication
would mean putting it in public domain and completing the
acts as are contemplated in the EIA Notification of 2006, read
with conditions of the EC and the provisions of the Act. In
terms of the scheme of the notification and law, there are three
stakeholders in the process of grant of environmental
clearance :
</p>
<p id="p_25">  (a) Project Proponent
</p><p id="p_26">  (b) Ministry of Environment and Forests, and
</p><p id="p_27">  (c) Other agencies which are required to fulfill their
      obligations to make the communication complete in
      terms of the provisions of the Act and the notification
      concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_28">13. The MoEF shall discharge its onus and complete its acts to
ensure communication of the environmental clearance so as to
trigger the period of limitation. The MoEF upon granting of the
environmental clearance must upload the same on its website
within seven days of such order, which would remain
uploaded for at least 90 days, as well as put it on its notice
board of the Principal as well as the Regional Office for a
period of at least 30 days. It should be accessible to the public
at large without impediments (Refer: <a href="/doc/189583188/" id="a_13">Save Mon Region
Federation &amp; Anr v. UOI &amp; Ors</a>.).
</p>
<p id="p_29">14. The project proponent, upon receipt of the environmental
clearance, should upload it permanently on its website. In
addition thereto, the project proponent should publish it in
two local newspapers having circulation where the project is
located and one of which being in vernacular language. In
such publication, the project proponent should refer to the
factum of environmental clearance along with the stipulated
conditions and safeguards. The project proponent then also
has to submit a copy of the EC to the heads of the local
authorities, panchayats and local bodies of the district. It will
also give to the departments of the State a copy of the
environmental clearance.
</p><p id="p_30">15. Then the Government agencies and local bodies are
expected to display the order of environmental clearance for a
period of 30 days on its website or display on notice board, as
the case may be. This is the function allocated to the
Government departments and the local bodies under the
provisions of the notification of 2006. Complete performance of
its obligations imposed on it by the order of environmental
clearance would constitute a communication to an aggrieved
person under the Act. In other words, if one set of the above
events is completed by any of the stakeholders, the limitation
period shall trigger. If they happen on different times and after
interval, the one earliest in point of time shall reckon the
period of limitation. Communication shall be complete in law
upon fulfilment of complete set of obligations by any of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                9</span>
      stakeholders. Once the period of limitation is prescribed under
     the provisions of the Act, then it has to be enforced with all its
     rigour. Commencement of limitation and its reckoning cannot
     be frustrated by communication to any one of the
     stakeholders. Such an approach would be opposed to the
     basic principle of limitation."
</p><p id="p_31">13. In light of the above, let us now consider whether the

stakeholder has fulfilled completely and entirely its obligations as

required      under        law       (Environmental         Clearance

Regulations/Notification of 2006, and the judgment of the Tribunal

in Save Mon Region Federation case supra).
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">14. We have perused the publication of order of EC effected by the

applicant in the two newspapers. The law requires the project

proponent not only to give intimation in regard to factum of passing

an order of EC but also to publish the stipulated conditions and

safeguards stated in such order. This admittedly has not been done

by the project proponent. The project proponent admittedly did not

give copies of the EC to the heads of the local authorities,

panchayats and municipal bodies of the district to display on their

respective notice boards and thus, could not ensure that it reaches

the common man of the area where the project is proposed to be

established. These are the apparent breaches of its obligations

committed by the project proponent. The project proponent merely

put the EC order on its website on 1st March, 2011. Firstly, there is

no justification for placing it on the website after a lapse of more

than 2 weeks, and secondly, the period of limitation cannot run

from 1st March, 2011 as other co-related obligations had not been

discharged by the project proponent even on that date.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                     10</span>
</p><p id="p_34"> 15. Once there is no compliance of the statutory obligations, then

neither the MoEF nor the project proponent can raise any objection

with regard to the limitation successfully.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">16. The applicant has put forward a version which is supported by

an affidavit filed by him stating that he came to know about the

passing of the impugned order only on 4th April, 2011 during a

hearing in the Writ Petition filed by the applicant, being WP No.

6327/2009. Having come to know of the same on 4 th April, 2011,

he filed an appeal before the Tribunal on 28th May, 2011 and hence

there is only a delay of 23 days in filing the appeal. This delay is

neither intentional nor the applicant can be said to have slept over

his right as he obtained a copy of the impugned order thereafter.

Having obtained the orders, the appeal was prepared and filed

before the Tribunal without any undue delay. According to the

applicant, it took him some more time in collecting necessary

papers including the objections etc. filed during the proceedings

before the EAC and during the public hearing. There is nothing on

record to factually controvert the averments of the applicant that he

came to know of passing of the EC order during the proceedings

pending before the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">17. One cannot overlook another fact that if the averments made

by the applicant in the appeal are found to be correct, then it would

be a serious and substantial question relating to environment and

the same would require a proper examination.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                   11</span>
</p><p id="p_40"> 18. The major challenge of the applicant is to the EIA proceedings

and the report. It is contended that the thermal plant of this

magnitude is bound to pose environmental implications and would

cause both water and air pollution problems. Even the notification

under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_14">Section 4</a> of the Land Acquisition Act covers Reserve Forest

and social forestry area without taking any approval from the

Central Government and the State Government. The plant in

question will be consuming 6 million tons of coal per annum. It will

be generating 5238 tons of fly ash per day and 1310 tons of bottom

ash per day. In addition to intense heat, this plant will be releasing

3380 tons of flue gases per hour which include 19.45% of carbon

dioxide. All these obnoxious gases will add to the green house effect

resulting in further increase in temperature and build up of heat

with adverse impact on the flora and fauna of the area and on the

precious wildlife habitat in the locality. It will affect the vegetation

in the area resulting in drying up of water sources along with noise

pollution and consequent biotic pressure which will put immense

stress on both wildlife and its habitat in the neighbouring Chandka

Wildlife Sanctuary and Nandankanan Wildlife Sanctuary. These are

the dimensions of environmental impact as stated by the applicant,

which may ultimately require due examination by this Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_41">19. According to the applicant, the proceedings have been held

and orders were passed and given effect to without obtaining leave

of the High Court of Orissa in violation of its stay order dated 29th

May, 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_42">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                      12</span>
</p><p id="p_43"> 20. The applicant has been able to show sufficient cause for 23

days' delay in filing the present appeal. It is correct that the

Tribunal will not have jurisdiction to condone the delay where the

appeal is filed beyond the prescribed period of 30+60 days in terms

of Section 16 of the NGT Act. In the present case, however there is

no delay in excess of 90 days. In fact, both the respondents have

failed to discharge their obligations in accordance with law. They

failed to put the EC order in the public domain and ensure that any

aggrieved person is able to access such order in accordance with

the prescribed procedure and law. In fact, both MoEF and the

project proponent are at fault and cannot be permitted to take

advantage of their own wrong.
</p>
<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">21. The respondents have failed to discharge their composite

obligations comprehensively.    Thus, in the present case, it is not

possible in law to define a date when the order would actually or

deemed to be communicated to the applicant. The communication

of the order being incomplete in law, the limitation cannot be

reckoned from any of the dates stated by any of the respondents.

While construing the law of limitation, this Tribunal must take a

pragmatic view balancing the rights of the parties to the lis. The

objection of limitation when renders a petition barred by time, it

takes away the right of one and protects the right of the other. One

who raises an objection of limitation, onus lies on him to show that

the requirements of law, triggering the period of limitation, have

been satisfied.
