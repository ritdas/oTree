<p id="p_1">      The petitioners herein seek pre-arrest bail under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section

438</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the apprehension of

arrest in connection with Crime No.465/2016 of the

Perinthalmanna Police Station, registered under <a href="/doc/734195/" id="a_2">Sections 269</a>

IPC, 120(e) of the Kerala Police Act, and under <a href="/doc/726894/" id="a_3">Section 24(1)</a>

read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">Section 43</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short, 'the Act'). The offence alleged

under <a href="/doc/340671/" id="a_6">Section 24(1)</a> of the Act is non-bailable.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. The prosecution allegation is that on 03.06.2016 the

petitioners dumped toilet waste at the side of the public road

at Eravimangalam. Depositing any poisonous, or noxious, or

polluting matter in any stream, or well, or on land is made

punishable under the said section by way of an amendment

brought in 1988. The exact nature of the allegations, as to

whether the allegations will definitely come under this section,

will have to be probed into by the learned Magistrate having

jurisdiction.   In the nature of the allegations, I feel it

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">B.A.Nos.5347 of 2016                  2</span>



appropriate to direct the petitioners to surrender before the

investigating        officer  for   necessary   interrogation.   Their

interrogation for the collection of materials concerning the

nature of the substances, the different instances where such

materials were deposited by the petitioners, the role and

complicity of each of the accused, etc., is felt necessary. After

such interrogation, appropriate orders on the request for bail

can be passed by the learned Magistrate. If detention of the

petitioners in custody is not required in the particular facts

and circumstances, the petitioners can be granted bail on

appropriate conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          In the result, this petition is disposed of as follows:

</p><p id="p_4">        a)     The   petitioners shall    surrender   before   the

        investigating officer, between 9 am and 10 am on any

        day within seven days from this date for necessary

        interrogation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        b) After interrogation, the investigating officer will

        produce the petitioners before the learned Magistrate

        having jurisdiction, before 4 pm on the same day.

</p><p id="p_6">        c)    In case application for regular bail is filed, the

        same shall be judiciously considered and decided by
