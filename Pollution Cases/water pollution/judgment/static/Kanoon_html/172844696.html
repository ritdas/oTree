 that they have acted vigilantly and the Appeal is preferred

within the timeframe, though there is delay of 7days caused

due to certain justifiable grounds, and as such, they seek

condonation of delay. The Appellants are hereafter referred

to as "Applicants". They filed Appeal No.77 of 2013, being

aggrieved by the order of Environment Clearance (EC) dated

20th February, 2013, passed by the State Environment

Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). The SEIAA, granted

EC to the Respondent No.1 (M/s Arihant Realtors) for

construction project of the Respondent No.7, Pandit (SRA)

Co-operative Housing Society Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.       Briefly stated, the background facts of the case are

that there was proposal of "Pandit (SRA) CHS Ltd",

Residential cum Commercial Project, under the Slum

Rehabilitation                   Authority's   Development   Scheme.   The

housing project was to be undertaken on plot bearing CTS

No.4/6(pt), 4/7(pt), 7,7/1 to 3, 9(pt), 9/1 to 4, 10(pt) of

village Mulund (w) Mumbai. The total plot area is 7159.40

sq mtr(FSI: 19573.59 M.Sq. + Non FSI: 19868.5 M.Sq ). It is

not, however, necessary to give all the details of the Project.

It would suffice to state that the Project was duly

considered by the SEIAA, in accordance with the MoEF

Notification dated 14th September, 2006, on basis of

Application, conditional EC was granted on 20-2-2013,

submitted by the Project Proponent i.e. the Respondent

No.1. The Applicants objected to the proposed Project on

 various grounds. The Applicants claim to be the members of

"Pandit           (SRA)          Co-operative    Housing      Society,   where

redevelopment is proposed to be carried out. They allege

that the Project Proponent commenced the Project activities

even before the EC was granted. One of them by name Shri.

Vinod Padiyar, issued a Notice dated 11th February, 2013,

under <a href="/doc/125409775/" id="a_3">Section 19(b)</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986, for filing of a criminal complaint of which a copy was

given to the Director (Environment). He received reply from

the Deputy Director, Dr. B.N.Patil, vide communication

dated 10th April, 2013 that the Project Proponent was called

upon to send a copy of the EC. The development project is

sought to be illegally carried out on the plot, which is

declared            as       'Slum    Area'     under   the    provisions   of

Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and

Redevelopment) Act, 1971 and the project property is

declared as slum on private land under Section 4(1) of the

Maharashtra Slum Areas (I.C.R) Act, 1971. The Project

Proponent completed the construction work of Wings 'B' 'C'

'D' Buildings, as per LOI, without obtaining prior EC and

committed various lapses. The Applicants have given

elaborate account of illegality and lapses committed by the

Project Proponent in the Memorandum of their Appeal.

</p><p id="p_3">3.          By filing reply affidavit, Respondent No.1 (Project

Proponent- Arihant Realtors), resisted the Appeal on various

grounds. Amongst those grounds, one of the ground put


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                             7</span>
(J) Misc.Appln. No.607 of 2013
 forth by the Project Proponent, is that the Appeal is barred

by limitation. The Project Proponent (Respondent No.1),

pointed out that the EC was granted on 20th February, 2013

and        its     knowledge          was     immediately   gained   by   the

Appellants/Applicants, because that was put on the website

of the Environment department. It is further contended that

the Respondent No.1, issued advertisement in the local

Newspapers, as per the procedure laid down in the MoEF

Notification dated 14th September, 2006, on 30th and 31st

May, 2013. According to the Respondent No.1, since the

Appeal is filed in July, 2013, it is beyond the prescribed

period of limitation, and as such, is liable to be dismissed

on that ground itself. The Respondent No.1, urged to decide

the issue of limitation as a preliminary issue and dismiss

the Appeal, since it is barred by limitation. The Respondent

No.1, submitted that the Appeal cannot be entertained,

because this Tribunal has no power to entertain the same,

beyond the period of Ninety (90) days, because even after

including expansion period of sixty (60) days, the outer limit

will end on 21st May, 2013.

<p id="p_4">4.          Above detailed reply affidavit was filed by the

Respondent               No.1    on    16th    September,    2013.   In   the

meanwhile, present Misc Application No.607 of 2013, was

filed by the Applicants for condonation of delay.

(J) Misc.Appln. No.607 of 2013
 19(b) of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, they had received

reply from the Director, Environment Department that the

copy of EC was called for from the Project Proponent and as

such, they laboured under impression that till that date the

EC was not granted. They had no knowledge of the EC till

1st April, 2013, in view of the communication issued by the

Director, Environment Department, Maharashtra. They

submitted that on 22nd April, 2013, their premises were

demolished by the Competent Authority under police

protection. They filed a complaint dated 22nd April, 2013,

with the office of Deputy Collector (ER) Mumbai, alleging

that the premises were illegally demolished. They visited the

office of SRA on 30th April, 2013. They were provided with

copy of the EC letter dated 20th February, 2013, during

such visit and were told that further details were available

on the website of the Environment Department. Thus, for

the first time, they came to know about the grant of

impugned EC on 30th April, 2013. They approached the

Counsel in Mumbai for filing of the Appeal without any

delay. The Counsel prepared a draft of the Appeal and sent

it to the National Green Tribunal (PB) New Delhi on 20 th

May, 2013. The Registry of the NGT, informed that the

Memorandum of Appeal was required to be filed, in

accordance with the format as per the National Green

Tribunal (Practices and Procedure) Rules, 2011. Thereafter,

the Applicants approached the Counsel in Delhi and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                            9</span>
(J) Misc.Appln. No.607 of 2013
 arranged for filing appeal in the proper format. They have

come out with a case that there is no intentional delay.

They further submitted that they are likely to suffer if the

delay is not condoned and that they were kept in dark

about the grant of EC. Consequently, they urged for

condonation of marginal delay of seven (7) days in filing of

the Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.        We have heard Learned Counsel for the contesting

parties. We have perused the material placed on record. The

fact that the SEIAA, issued a letter dated 20th February,

2013, granting the EC for the development project is

conspicuous. The real question is whether the concerned

stakeholders were given due information regarding grant of

the EC? If so, when the communication was made to them.

The next question is as to whether the Applicants have

made out a case to show sufficient cause for the purpose of

condonation of delay, as required under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_5">Section 5</a> of the

Limitation Act, read with proviso appended to <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_6">Section 16</a> of

the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010?
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.       Before we proceed to consider merits of the rival

contentions, it would be appropriate to reproduce some of

the conditions stated in the EC, which the Project

Proponent was required to comply with.

was under obligation to comply with aforesaid conditions.

The Project Proponent himself has come out with a case

that the Newspaper publication was made on 30th and 31st

May, 2013. So, according to the Project Proponent, the

knowledge could be imputed to the stakeholders, in respect

of impugned EC, on 30th or least 31st May, 2013. Here, it

may be noted that the Applicants presented the Appeal

before the National Green Tribunal (PB), New Delhi, for the

first time on 7th June, 2013. The Appeal bears stamp of

NGT (PB) New Delhi bearing DY No.192 of 2013, dated 7 th

June, 2013, though it does not bear the signature of

Receiving Officer. If we accept the fact that the presentation

of Appeal was, in fact, made on 7th June, 2013, then it will

have to be said that the Appeal was filed within period of

ninety (90) days from date of communication of the EC.

scrutiny of the Appeal was made by the Office of NGT (PB)

New Delhi, on 19th July, 2013, and thereafter, it was placed

before the Principal Bench for admission on 22nd July,

2013. It appears that since First Order of the Assistant

shows that scrutiny of the Appeal was made on 19th

July,2013, the objection has been raised by the Project

Proponent, that the Appeal is barred by limitation. As a

 matter of fact, the Order dated 19th July, 2013, only shows

that preliminary scrutiny of the Appeal was made on 19th

July, 2013. We do not, however, think it proper to out

rightly dislodge the office endorsement of the NGT (PB) New

Delhi, which shows that entry was made vide DY No.192 of

2013, dated 7th June, 2013. In this context, it is pertinent

to note that the Applicants have categorically stated on

affirmation in the affidavit (paragraph 7) as shown below:

made in the Application for condonation of delay, has not

been traversed by the Project Proponent. Needless to say, it

will have to be accepted that the Appeal was, in fact, filed

on 7th June, 2013, in the office of the NGT (PB) at New

Delhi. According to the Applicants, for the first time on 30 th

April, 2013, they received information that the EC was

issued on 20th February, 2013. The Project Proponent has

not pointed out as to when the EC was put in public

domain by the State Environment Department. The Project

Proponent has not given any sufficient explanation as to

why there was no immediate action taken for publication of

Notices in the Newspapers. It appears that the Newspaper

publication was made in English daily Newspaper of 30th

Respondent Nos.2 to 5, by Shri.A.M.Pimparkar. His affidavit

shows that he is the Scientist-I, working in Environment

was placed on the website of the Ministry w.e.f. 13th March,

2013. The affidavit further shows that SEIAA, placed the EC

on the website on 13th March, 2013, along with concerned

Agenda recommendations of the SEAC and the SEIAA

believe that the EC was not granted till 1st April, 2013. The

Director                (Environment)   could     have      plainly

informedApplicant VInod Padiyar that the EC was issued

Bench of this Tribunal, headed by the Hon'ble Chairperson,

has reiterated the legal position in paragraphs 20 and 21

thereof.         We        deem   it   proper   to   reproduce   both   the

paragraphs as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">               "20.    The applicant has been able to show
                   sufficient cause for 23 days' delay in filing the
                   present appeal. It is correct that the Tribunal
                   will not have jurisdiction to condone the delay
                   where the appeal is filed beyond the period of
                   30+60 days in terms of Section 16 of the NGT
                   Act. In the present case, however, there is no
                   delay in excess of 90 days. In fact, both the
                   respondents have failed to discharge their
                   obligations in according with law. They failed
                   to put the EC order in the public domain and
                   ensure that nay aggrieved person is able to
                   access such order in accordance with the
                   prescribed procedure and law. In fact, both
                   the MoEF and the project proponent are at
                   fault and cannot be permitted to take
                   advantage of their own wrong.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">               21.     The respondents have failed to discharge
                   their composite obligations comprehensively.
                   Thus, in the present case, it is not possible in
                   law to define a date when the order would
                   actually or deemed to be communicated to the
                   applicant. The communication of the order
                   being incomplete in law, the limitation cannot
                   be reckoned from any of the dates stated by
                   any of the respondents. While construing the
                   law of limitation, this Tribunal must take a
                   pragmatic view balancing the rights of the
                   parties to the list. The objection of limitation
                   when renders a petition, barred by time, it
                   takes away the right of one and protects the
                   right of other. One who raises an objection of
                   limitation, onus lies on him to show that the
                   requirements of law, triggering the period of
                   limitation have been satisfied. "

 to make the EC legal and valid. The Applicants have placed

on record the copies of the communications issued by the

MPCB, which show that Show-cause Notices have been

issued to the Project Proponent, as regards commencement

of the construction, without obtaining prior Consent from

the MPCB. It is, of course, not necessary to consider

whether the Project Proponent gave adequate reply and

such proceedings have been closed, or are still pending. It

would          be      suffice          to   say   that   the   Applicants      have

demonstrated that they were unable to get due information

about         the       EC       till    the   publication      appeared   in    the

Newspapers. Secondly, even though we assume that the

limitation period triggered from the date of placement of the

EC letter on the website of the Environment Ministry, then

also further developments can be considered as 'sufficient

cause' for condonation of the delay, which has occurred

after initial period of thirty (30) days, in as much as, the

Appeal filed on 7th June, 2013, is well within ninety (90)

days period from that date, when the EC was put on the

website of the Environment Ministry. Needless to say, the

objection raised by the Project Proponent, is liable to be

rejected. The Application, therefore, succeeds and will have

to be allowed. We accept the explanation of the Applicant
