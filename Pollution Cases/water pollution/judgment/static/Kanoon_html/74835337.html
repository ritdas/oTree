JUSTICE DR. P. JYOTHIMANI (JUDICIAL MEMBER):
</p>
<p id="p_8"> 1. The Appellant in the present appeal was the original complainant before

    the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) and the Respondent

    No. 3 before the Appellate Authority. He has filed the present appeal before

    this Tribunal against the order of the Appellate Authority dated 20.12.2013

    under <a href="/doc/157385935/" id="a_1">Section 31-B</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>

    1981 and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Section 35-B</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution)

    Act</a> 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_9"> 2. The Impugned order of the Appellate Authority was passed in the appeal

    filed by respondent no. 1, the project proponent, under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_5">Section 28</a> of the

    Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_7">Section 31</a> of the

    Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981. By such appeal he

    challenged the order of the HSPCB dated 31.03.2013, in and by which the

    State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) has refused to grant consent to

    operate the unit of the respondent no. 1 for the year 2013 and 2014 under

    both the above said Acts, on the ground that the unit has not complied

    with the siting parameters stipulated in the Haryana State notification

    dated 18.12.1997. This was pointed out by the Joint Inspection Report of

    the Regional Officer, Gurgaon (South), Executive Engineer (Public Health)

    and Tehsildar, Pataudi dated 18.03.2013. The said order of the SPCB was

    reversed by the Appellate Authority on appeal filed by the project

    proponent, thereby granting consent to operate for both unit I and unit II

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      2</span>
    of the stone crushing units of the respondent no. 1 in the area of V. Mau

   Tehsil, Pataudi situated in Killa No. 9/15 and 10/2-11 respectively.

</p><p id="p_10">3. The short facts which are relevant and lead to the filing of the present

   appeal are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_11">
    The respondent no. 1 is stated to have established two (2) units of stone

    crushing as small scale unit no. I and II in the area of V. Mau Tehsil

    Pataudi, after obtaining provisional No Objection Certificate (NOC)/

    Consent to Establish dated 20.05.2002 and 8.07.2009 respectively from

    the SPCB as unit I and II. The appellant along with two (2) others have

    opposed the said NOC dated 20.05.2002 issued for unit I by filing C.W.P.

    No. 10333 of 2012 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The High

    Court in the order dated 28.08.2012, having found that the appellant has

    filed the said petition without making any proper representation or

    complaint against the NOC, and has straight away approached the High

    Court, has permitted the appellant to withdraw the said Writ Petition with

    liberty to approach the SPCB by making a detailed representation within

    15 days from the date of receipt of the copy of the order and directing the

    SPCB to consider the same and pass orders within 3 months thereafter

    by providing an opportunity of hearing to the parties. It is stated that

    consequently when the appellant approached the Board, it sought a spot

    inspection report under the direction of Deputy Commissioner, Gurgaon

    and a report was filed by team of officers consisting of Regional Officer,

    Gurgaon (South), Executive Engineer (Public Health) Pataudi and

    Tehsildar, Pataudi dated 18.03.2013. In the said report it is stated that

    while in respect of all other criteria, the units are conforming to the same,

    there was no conformation relating to the aerial distance from outer

    periphery of revenue Phirni of village Dharapur to the highest node of the

    conveyor belt of crushers in respect of both the units of respondent no. 1

    which was stated to be 975.36 mts while the requirement as per the

    notification of the Government is 1-0 km. Apart from that, the distance


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     3</span>
     of the source of approved water supply of 20kl capacity in village

    Dharapur to the crusher units of the respondent no. 1 is 980 mts while

    the requirement as per the notification is 1-5 km. They were indicated as

    item no. 7 and 11 in the spot inspection report as the only deficiencies.

    It was based on the said report, the SPCB has passed order dated

    31.03.2013 as stated above refusing to grant consent to operate for the

    year 2013-2014.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">4. Challenging the said order, an appeal was filed by respondent no. 1, the

   project proponent, before the Appellate Authority. It was contended that

   the siting criteria are in accordance with the notification of the

   Government and that there was an approved water supply scheme for

   more than 20 kl capacity in village Dharapur directly from the pumping

   stations through closed pipeline having 7.5 hp motors each without any

   water storage reservoir or tank at a distance of 1045 mts and 1205 mts

   respectively from the two crushing units. Its further case was that the

   inspection report dated 18.03.2013 which states in handwriting about

   Patwari's report, based on which the finding is stated to have been given

   does not disclose the said report, eventhough such report of the Patwari

   was not called for to prepare the inspection report and the team ought to

   have physically inspected. The respondent no. 1 has also relied upon a

   note of Tehsildar Pataudi, prepared subsequently namely on 27.05.2013

   wherein it is stated that the said Tehsildar Pataudi has appointed a Local

   Commissioner who was himself a retired Tehsildar and who measured the

   aerial distance on 21.05.2013 in the presence of Panches of Dharapur and

   it was found that the distance from West Phirni to Killa No. 9/15 was 3331

   feet (1015.54 mts) and to killa No. 28/20 as 3630 feet (1106.7 mts) from

   North West of Phirni and therefore they are within the required

   parameters.
</p>
<p id="p_14">5. It was also the case of the respondent no. 1 before the Appellate Authority

   that by a subsequent inspection report dated 25.10.2013 submitted to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    4</span>
    Chairman of the SPCB, it was found that the siting parameters as well as

   the water supplied distance was within the limit prescribed in the

   notification and therefore, the refusal order dated 31.03.2013 issued by

   the SPCB based on the inspection report dated 18.03.2013 is not in

   accordance with law. That apart it was contended that the refusal order

   came to be passed without any notice or giving opportunity to the project

   proponent.
</p>
<p id="p_15">6. Per Contra, it was the contention of the appellant who was impleaded as a

   party during the pendency of the appeal before the Appellate Authority,

   that the distance of the unit from water pump station is less than 1500

   mts and aerial distance from the Phirni is 975.36 mts as found in the

   report dated 18.03.2013 and therefore the project proponent has not

   complied with the notification regarding the siting criteria. The SPCB,

   however, in its reply has submitted before the Appellate Authority that as

   per its letter dated 6.06.2013, a new report from the Local Commissioner

   appointed by Tehsildar Pataudi, show that the distance of village periphery

   from the highest node of the stone crusher situated in Killa No. 9/15 was

   1150.28 mts which is more than the requirement of the notification dated

   18.12.1997.
</p>
<p id="p_16">7. The learned Appellate Authority after going through the records and

   hearing the argument of the parties, has allowed the appeal filed by

   respondent no. 1, setting aside the refusal order issued by the SPCB dated

   31.03.2013. For arriving at such conclusion in the impugned order, the

   learned Appellate Authority has relied upon the subsequent reports dated

   9.04.2013, 23.05.2013 and 27.05.2013. The learned Appellate Authority

   has also considered another report sent by SDO (C), Pataudi, to the

   Deputy Commissioner, Gurgaon dated 25.10.2013, on a measurement

   taken as per the representation made by the appellant in accordance with

   the direction of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.           The said

   measurement was conducted by the surveyor of HUDA, in the presence of

   the appellant as well as the project proponent apart from the officials of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    5</span>
    the Board wherein it was found that from the highest node of conveyor

   belt having a height of 32 feet up to South Eastern corner of village

   Dharapur, the distance was found to be 1011.45 mts, which is well within

   the siting criteria laid down by the notification. The learned Appellate

   Authority took note of the contentious issues that there have been two

   different reports, one the spot inspection report dated 31.03.2013 and the

   other report taken subsequently which of course show that respondent

   no. 1, project proponent complies with the requirements of the

   notification. The learned Appellate Authority has chosen to follow the later

   reports dated 27.05.2013 and 25.10.2013 while holding that the said spot

   inspection report dated 31.03.2013 is very much questionable as the

   distance was not measured by the team of officers but simply mentions

   the report of Patwari who was admittedly not present and his report was

   also not appended. It has also been found that the distance of the crusher

   unit I of respondent no. 1 has been verified after due measurement by use

   of sophisticated survey instrument wherein it was found that the distance

   was 1011.45 mts and the same is comparable with the distance criteria

   found by the Local Commissioner as 1015.55 mts, and the variation

   between the two are very negligible. Accordingly the learned Appellate

   Authority has held that the finding in serial no. 7 of the spot inspection

   report dated 18.03.2013 is unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_17">8. In so far as it relates to the finding of the spot inspection report dated

   18.03.2013 in respect of serial no. 11, about the distance between the unit

   and the water supply, the Appellate Authority has taken note of the

   undisputable fact as found in the affidavit filed by the officials of SPCB

   before the Hon'ble High Court dated 14.05.2013 that the water supply is

   through pipeline without any open reservoir and therefore, there is no

   possibility for any water contamination. It was ultimately held that even

   in respect of the serial no. 11, of the spot inspection report dated

   18.03.2013 the finding is not sustainable and ultimately the Appellate

   Authority has set aside the refusal order of the SPCB dated 31.03.2013

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     6</span>
    and consequently held that unit no. I and II of the respondent no. 1 are

   deemed to be granted consent.
</p>
<p id="p_18">9. It is against the said findings of the learned Appellate Authority, the

   appellant has filed the above said appeal, contending inter-alia, that the

   authorised report of the spot inspection dated 18.03.2013 is clearly

   against the project proponent and the same cannot be ignored since it was

   prepared based on the Patwari's report who is Government Official. He

   would further submit that the reliance based by the learned Appellate

   Authority on the subsequent reports are not sustainable not only because

   those were unauthorized, but even those reports, especially the reports

   dated 9.04.2013 and 23.05.2013 show that in respect of the wind breaking

   walls of both the units, they are not in conformity with the notification.

   The report dated 9.04.2013 also shows that separate energy metre for

   water supply pumped for sprinklers relating to unit no. I has been

   installed and the consumption of water shows only 2400 units from the

   inception of the unit in 2002 which cannot be believed. He further submits

   that the respondent no. 1 has been running the unit in violation of the

   notification dated 18.12.1997 and that the required number of trees have

   not been planted, that the subsequent reports dated 27.05.2013 and

   25.10.2013 have not taken the proper aerial measurements to the effect

   that the conveyor belts were not placed in a manner that it was away from

   the nearest village Ababi, outer periphery of the village Phirni and

   therefore, the same cannot be technically correct; that by virtue of the

   subsequent notification of the Government dated 28.02.2007, the village

   Mau has been declared as a "controlled area" and therefore the project

   proponent ought to have obtained change of land user certificate, and that

   the Appellate Authority has not considered all the issues in their proper

   perspective, apart from many other grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_19">10. Respondent no. 1 the project proponent, in the reply, while denying all the

   allegations raised by the appellant, by way of preliminary objection, has

   stated that unit no. I which was established in 2002 and unit no. II

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                     7</span>
 established in 2009 have obtained the Consent to Establish and the

Committee of the SPCB found that the siting parameters for the

installation of stone crusher were in accordance with notification issued

by the Government; that even in the year 2003 the appellant has

approached the High Court by filing Civil Writ Petition no. 17433 of 2003

on the same ground of non- compliance of siting parameters and that was

dismissed on 15.12.2004 and ultimately a Special Leave Petition filed

before the Hon'ble Apex Court against the Judgment of the High Court

also came to be dismissed on 9.11.2010; that the units have been

obtaining Consent to Operate regularly in all years including the year 2012

and 2013; that the appellant has again approached the High Court by

filing C.W.P. No. 10333 of 2012 challenging the NOC issued in 2002 for

unit I, which was permitted to be withdrawn by the High Court with liberty

to the appellant to approach the SPCB by filing detailed representation

relating to the objections raised against the NOC within a period of 15

days of the receipt of the order and thereafter the SPCB to consider and

pass speaking orders within a period of 3 months providing opportunity

of hearing to the parties, by the order dated 28.08.2012. However, without

giving any opportunity to the project proponent the SPCB has abruptly

refused to give consent in the order dated 31.03.2013; that the refusal was

purely based on the spot inspection report dated 18.03.2013 which only

relies upon a Patwari's report and not actually on physically verifying the

stone crusher especially when such Patwari report itself has not been

furnished; that there cannot be the same distance between two Killa No's

in respect of unit I and II and that itself makes the spot inspection report

dated 18.03.2013 as invalid; that the water supply is based through direct

pumping without any storage or reservoir         facility and there are two

different stations having pumping capacity of 7.5 hp, in panchayat land

of village Dharapur and it is a tube well based water supply through

pipelines without any overhead tank operation, reservoir and open water

supply; that it is because of the persistent malafide efforts of the appellant,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   8</span>
    the running of both the units eventhough are in conformity with all

   standards under air quality and water quality without causing any

   pollution, is sought to be interfered with.     Therefore, it is the case of

   respondent no. 1 project proponent that the order of the SPCB in refusing

   to grant Consent to Operate in spite of the meticulous compliance of all

   pollution norms in conformity with the notification dated 18.12.1997 is

   unsustainable and therefore, the finding of the learned Appellate Authority

   is perfectly in accordance with law and need not be interfered with.

</p><p id="p_20">11. The SPCB in its reply has specifically stated that in respect of the units

   the water supplied in the sprinklers system is through pipeline connected

   to a water tank. It is also admitted in the reply that as per the notification

   dated 18.12.1997, the latest verification of siting parameters of the

   distance of stone crushers by SDM Pataudi received by the Deputy

   Commissioner, Gurgaon in the letter dated 30.10.2013, the minimum

   distance in the highest node of the stone crusher at Killa No. 9/15 of

   village Mau Tehsil Pataudi District Gurgaon, from outer Phirni of village

   Dharapur is 1011.45 mts.
</p>
<p id="p_21">12. It is the contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the appellant Mr.

   Manoj Swarup before us, that while the spot inspection report dated

   18.03.2013 received at the instance by the SPCB and another report dated

   9.04.2013 ought to have been treated as statutory reports, and therefore

   rejecting the said reports by the Appellate Authority is not correct. He

   would also submit that strangely the Appellate Authority has relied upon

   the other two reports which are submitted later, dated 27.05.2013 and

   25.10.2013 and prepared at the instance of the project proponent which

   speak only about the distance criteria and therefore, the decision of the

   learned Appellate Authority in the impugned order is liable to be set aside.

   According to him, there is no valid and acceptable reason for reversing the

   findings of the SPCB. He would also submit that the further statutory

   report dated 9.04.2013 makes it clear that in respect of wind breaking

   walls on all the three sides, the area are short of requirement as per the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      9</span>
    notification and that aspect has not been considered by the learned

   Appellate Authority. Further, as per the said report, the plantation is also

   not in accordance with notification. He has also made strenuous efforts

   to contend that apart from item no. 7 and 11 of the spot inspection report

   dated 18.03.2013, the other requirements which are stated to have been

   complied as per the said report are not really complied with. To be precise,

   according to him, while the statement made in the spot inspection report

   dated 18.03.2013 regarding item no. 7 and 11 are correct, the findings of

   report in respect of the other criteria are incorrect and have not been

   complied with, by the project proponent.
</p>
<p id="p_22">13. In respect of the reports relied upon by the learned Appellate Authority

   dated 27.05.2013 and 25.10.2013 apart from stating that they are the

   private reports which cannot be relied upon, it is the submission of the

   learned counsel for appellant that the units have been operating without

   Consent to Operate even though NOC has been obtained in the year 2002

   for unit no. I. It is his submission that while under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> of the Air

   (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981, the project proponent must

   have obtained previous consent for the year 2012-2013, the order dated

   16.08.2012 cannot be treated as an order of Consent to Operate since it

   contains various conditions. He would also submit that by virtue of the

   notification dated 28.02.2007 the area wherein units are situated are

   covered as "controlled area" and therefore, there is a change of land user

   and in that view of the matter also the units are not entitled to operate

   and this aspect has not been considered by the Appellate Authority. It is

   also his submission that even in respect of the report dated 25.10.2013,

   the aerial measurement has not been taken properly. The measurement

   which has been taken at point no. 4 cannot be said to be accurate unless

   it is taken in point no. 1 or 3 which is the nearest point to the village.

   Therefore, according to him even the unauthorised report dated

   25.10.2013 is not accurate.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    10</span>
</p><p id="p_24"> 14. By way of reply, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the project

   proponent, respondent no. 1, Mr. Mahabir Singh would contend that the

   entire appeal is devoid of merit and liable to be dismissed on the ground

   that the conduct of the appellant is purely malafide and the appeal is a

   culmination of the total private enimity which appellant has developed

   against respondent no. 1 who is the purchaser of the property wherein

   units are situated, in the year 1980 from the other cosharers of the

   appellant.   He also submitted that immediately after 1980 when the

   property was purchased, the appellant has filed a suit for pre-emption in

   the year 1981 which came to be dismissed and the appeal filed against

   such decree also dismissed apart from the second appeal which was

   dismissed by the High Court in 1997. It is his submission that thereafter

   in the year 2000, respondent no. 1 has taken steps for obtaining consent

   and in fact, on 20.05.2002 a provisional NOC was granted. The said NOC

   was revoked according to the learned Senior Counsel on 10.12.2002 at the

   instance of the appellant on the ground that the establishment of the unit

   will damage crops. He would also submit that the SPCB, on 25.06.2003

   has constituted a Committee to ascertain about the said allegation and

   based on the Committees report the SPCB, on 30.07.2003 has revoked the

   withdrawal order of NOC. It is his contention that thereafter, the appellant

   has approached the High Court by filing a Public Interest Litigation in

   C.W.P. No. 14733 of 2003 and that came to be dismissed on 15.12.2004

   against which the appellant has approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court

   and the Civil Appeal no. 1019 of 2007 was also dismissed on 9.11.2010

   however, making it clear that if there are any other issue which survive,

   liberty was granted as per the right available in law.

</p><p id="p_25">15. In the meantime, the project proponent has applied for expansion of its

   project in 2009 and permission was granted by the District Level

   Clearance Committee in the meeting held on 26.03.2008 and ultimately

   by an order dated 8.07.2009 the SPCB has issued NOC/Consent to

   Establish in respect of Unit no. II and according to the learned Senior

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    11</span>
    Counsel, the appellant has never challenged the said NOC in respect of

   unit II. It is on the basis of certain information obtained under Right to

   <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_11">Information Act</a>, the appellant again moved the Hon'ble High Court by

   filing C.W.P. 10333 of 2012 challenging the NOC granted on 20.05.2002

   which was disposed of by the Hon'ble High Court on 28.08.2012

   permitting the appellant to make representation to SPCB who shall pass

   orders within 3 months after providing opportunity to the parties.

   Pursuant to the same the appellant has submitted the certificate copy of

   the order passed by the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.08.2012 to the SPCB

   along with his letter dated 18.09.2012. According to the learned Senior

   Counsel, even in the representation dated 18.09.2012 enclosing the order

   of the Hon'ble High Court, it was pertaining to the NOC dated 20.05.2002

   in respect of unit no. I and there was no representation at all. He would

   also submit that in so far as it relates to the spot inspection report dated

   18.03.2013 there is some inclusion in pen which states "as per Patwari

   Report". In the absence of such report one cannot come to a conclusion

   that the spot inspection report has got any legal validity and there was no

   physical spot inspection at all.       It was in those circumstances the

   subsequent reports filed dated 27.05.2013 and 25.10.2013 based on

   physical inspection conducted by authorities was relied upon by the

   learned Appellate Authority, which cannot be said to be improper or illegal.

   According to him, the above said reports are not unauthorised but they

   were made at the instance of the SPCB and the responsible officers of the

   Board and other officers including the appellant have participated. It is

   his further submission that when units no. I and II are situated in different

   Khasra numbers it cannot be said that both are of same distance. In that

   way also the spot inspection report dated 18.03.2013 which was the basis

   for refusal to grant permission is unreliable and the learned Appellate

   Authority has correctly refused to rely upon the same.

</p><p id="p_26">16. The learned Senior Counsel would submit that even under the said spot

   inspection report dated 18.03.2013 it pertains to only 2 deficiencies which

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                     12</span>
    were the reasons for refusal to grant permission and therefore, it is not

   open to the appellant to traverse beyond the said grounds especially while

   challenging the order of the Appellate Authority.    He would submit that

   the measurement taken as per the report dated 25.10.2013 is with a

   scientific mechanism and therefore, the decision of the learned Appellate

   Authority in relying upon the same is the most proper one and there is

   nothing improper or illegal and no question relating to the environmental

   issue arise for consideration in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_27">17. The learned Senior Counsel would finally submit that this being a case of

   blackmailing attitude by the appellant continuously and successfully

   preventing the project proponent for years together, the appellant should

   be dealt with strictly with an exemplary cost.         To substantiate his

   contention that Public Interest Litigation are not meant for settling private

   disputes, he would rely upon various decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme

   Court reported in, (2014) 1 SCC 161, (2011) 5SCC 484, (2007) 14 SCC

   281, (2006) 6 SCC 180, (2005) 5 SCC 136 and (2005) 1 SCC 590.

</p><p id="p_28">18. Having heard learned Counsel appearing for the appellant as well as the

   learned Senior Counsel appearing for the project proponent apart from the

   Counsel appearing for the SPCB in detail and perused the impugned order

   of the learned Appellate Authority, pondered over the entire records we

   have given our anxious thought to the issue involved in this case, namely,

   as to whether the impugned order of the Appellate Authority assailed in

   this appeal is sustainable in law or liable to be interfered with ?

</p><p id="p_29">19. As stated above, this statutory appeal has been filed by respondent no. 1

   before the Appellate Authority, against the order passed under the Water

   (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and Air (Prevention and

   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981. It is not in dispute that respondent no. 1

   herein who is the project proponent has started his stone crushing unit in

   Village Mau Tehsil, Pataudi District Gurgaon, Haryana in Killa No. 9/15

   for which the HSPCB has given its provisional NOC/ Consent to Establish

   on 20.05.2002. The NOC granted shows that the unit will obtain consent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                     13</span>
    from the Board and that will ensure to comply with all the provisions

   contained in the notification of the Government dated 18.12.1997.

</p><p id="p_30">20. It is pertinent to note at the outset, that the Government of Haryana, by

   virtue of the powers conferred on it, under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_14">Section 5</a> of the Environment

   (Protection) Act 1986 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_15">Environment (Protection) Rules Act</a> 1986 and

   various Government orders passed from time to time, has issued a

   notification dated 18.12.1997 containing various directions and guidelines

   for stone crushing units to be established in the State which relate to

   siting criteria norms, identification of zones and availability of sites and

   procedure for establishment and operation in the identified zones etc.

   While Schedule I of the notification contains norms for siting of stone

   crushers, Schedule II contains directions regarding emission norms and

   Pollution Control measures which are required to be adhered to.

</p><p id="p_31">21. The said NOC granted for unit I which is the principal unit of respondent

   no.1 dated 20.05.2002 came to be revoked by the SPCB on 10.12.2002 on

   the ground that it affects crops of the nearby villagers in respect of which

   complaint stated to have been received in the District Grievance Committee

   meeting held on 17.10.2002. It is seen that by a consequent order of the

   SPCB dated 11.02.2013 the unit was ordered to be closed, disconnecting

   electricity supply.   Thereafter it appears that on a representation from

   project proponent to the effect that the complaint has been made by some

   of the disgruntled villagers due to their personal animosity and 80 acres

   of land surrounding the stone crusher belong to the family of the project

   proponent and that all the SPCB measures have been complied with by

   the unit, and at the instance of the SPCB, the Deputy Commissioner,

   Gurgaon has constituted a Committee on 30.06.2003 consisting of the

   Regional Officer, Haryana SPCB, Gurgaon, Tehsildar Pataudi, Gurgaon

   and the BDO, Gurgaon. The Committee is stated to have made inspection

   of the unit of the project proponent on 25.07.2003 and submitted a report

   stating that the unit adheres to all the siting parameters as per the

   notification of the Government dated 18.12.1997and if proper devices are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                    14</span>
    installed by the project proponent and duly monitored by the SPCB,

   damages to the crops can be avoided. It is seen that it was based on the

   said finding of the Committee, the Deputy Commissioner, Gurgaon in his

   communication dated 30.07.2003 has requested the Regional Officer

   SPCB, Gurgaon that there is no hindrance in allowing respondent no. 1

   unit to run on experimental basis for a period of 6 months. It is stated by

   respondent no. 1 in the affidavit that thereafter the unit has been granted

   Consent to Operate regularly from the Board from time to time. Even

   though this is not seriously in dispute, on record it is seen that the HSPCB

   has given its consent on 22.11.2006 in no HSPCB/ Air consent

   /2006/2798 for the period from 1.04.2006 to 31.03.2007.           Again the

   consent was renewed under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a> for the period 1.04.2007 to

   31.03.2008. Likewise for the period from 1.04.2008 to 31.03.2009 the

   Board has given consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a> in the order dated 30.07.2008.

   This has continued from 2009 onwards in so far as it relates to unit no. I,

   which is the principal unit started by the project proponent in 2002.

</p><p id="p_32">22. It was in the year 2009, respondent no. 1 has applied for expansion of its

   unit in the same location in Killa No. 10/2-11 as unit no. II. The District

   Level Clearance Committee of the SPCB in the meeting held on 23.06.2008

   has decided to grant NOC in respect of the said unit II.

   Accordingly, the Regional Officer of SPCB in the order dated 8.07.2009 has

   granted Consent to Establish in respect of unit no. II and in respect of unit

   no. I Consent to Operate had been continued as stated above.

</p><p id="p_33">23. In the meantime, there are certain undisputed litigations initiated by the

   appellant before the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana.           The

   appellant along with others has filed C.W.P. No. 17433 of 2003,

   challenging the communication of the Deputy Commissioner, Gurgaon to

   the Regional Officer SPCB dated 30.07.2003 and the consequential order

   of the SPCB dated 20.08.2003 suspending the earlier order of closure

   thereby permitting the unit no. I of the project proponent to operate and

   also for a direction to close down this stone crusher unit, contending that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                     15</span>
    the statutory and mandatory parameters for installation of the unit to

   prevent pollution has not been adhered to. The said writ petition was filed

   as a Public Interest Litigation. A reference was also made about the NOC

   granted to the unit by the Board on 20.05.2002. In that Writ Petition the

   State of Haryana has specifically stated that as per the notification of the

   Government dated 18.12.1997 the minimum distance required from the

   village Abadi for installation of crusher unit as fixed in Schedule I of the

   notification as 1 km to be measured as the crow flies from the highest node

   of the crusher conveyor belt to the outer periphery of the Lal Dora and as

   per the latest report of the revenue authorities was complied and in fact

   the distance in respect of the unit no. I of the project proponent was about

   1680 mts which is more than the required distance. It is seen in the

   elaborate Judgment of the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana

   dated 15.12.2004 that the appellant and other writ petitioners have not

   come to the Court with clean hands and the appellant and his father has

   filed a suit for pre-emption in respect of the land in which respondent no.

   1 unit is situated having purchased by its partners from the family

   members of the appellant and the said suit was dismissed and the second

   appeal filed against the said judgment was pending. In addition to that it

   is seen that the Hon'ble High Court by an order dated 4.05.2004 has

   directed the State Government to appraise the factual position regarding

   the houses as well as the distance from the stone crusher unit.

</p><p id="p_34">24. The Judgment shows that the Regional Officer of the Board, Gurgaon in

   the affidavit dated 13.03.2004 has clearly stated not only that the

   residential houses are not part of village Abadi but that the stone crusher

   of respondent no. 1 meets all the siting parameters as per the notification

   dated 18.12.1997. In respect of the distance of 1 km from the revenue

   Phirni of the village the Hon'ble High Court has ultimately concluded in

   the Judgment rendered in the above Writ Petition as follows :

      "13. It has not been disputed before us that so far as validity of the

           siting parameters, as incorporated in the above mentioned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                      16</span>
            notification dated 18.12.1997 (Annexure R-1(1), including the

           requirement of distance of one kilometre from the revenue

           phirni of the village to the crusher unit, is concerned, has

           already been upheld by a Division Bench of this Court in C.W.P.

           No. 19010 of 1995 (Fatia Mohammed and others V. State of

           Haryana &amp; others). The controversy, thus, stands scaled down

           to the limited issue as to how the distance of one kilometre,

           referred to above, is required to be measured".
</p>
<p id="p_35">25. Then while concluding about the measurement of one kilometre and as to

   how the same is to be effected reading in conjunction with the note

   appended to Schedule I, the Hon'ble High Court has in catagoric term held

   as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_36">      "15. In the light of the guiding principles laid down by this Court in

           Ishwar Singh's case (supra) and on a minute reading of the

           Schedule- I of the Government notification, we are satisfied that

           what is being contended on behalf of the respondents is legally

           and factually correct.   It would be seen from Schedule I that

           minimum distances of different lengths are prescribed for

           different categories of locations. In the case of distance from

           the "nearest town abadi", it is 1-5 kilometres. The distance

           required from the "nearest tourist complex" is again 1-5

           kilometres whereas from a "forest land" it is 1-0 kilometre. The

           distance required from the metropolitan city is 5-0 kilometres

           whereas from a District Headquarter, it should be 3 kilometres.

           It cannot be disputed that Note 1 below Schedule I is a key to

           facilitate the measurement process in relation to any of the

           items listed in Schedule I. Note 1 is not meant for item 7 alone

           which pertains to measurement of distance from the "nearest

           village abadi". Though the language of Note 1 appears to be not

           happily worded, however, it has to be interpreted- firstly, to

           achieve the object of Schedule I and secondly in a manner that

           there is no inconformity between Schedule I and the Note 1

           appended thereto. If the interpretation sought to be given by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                      17</span>
         the Petitioners is taken to its logical end, namely, requirement

        of measurement of the distance from the "nearest village abadi"

        only, in our view, there was no necessity of appending Note 1

        below Schedule I. Note 1 intends to supplement the vacuum, if

        any, in various clauses of Schedule I. It is with this primary

        object that an alternative mode is also provided in the Note-1

        that wherever there is no revenue phirni or lal dora, then the

        distance of village Abadi be measured from the periphery of the

        feature concerned. In a village where there exists a revenue

        phirni and/or Lal Dora, the distance of one kilometre in terms

        of Item No. 7 has to be measured from such revenue phirni or

        the Lal Dora as the case may be".
</p>
<p id="p_37">Ultimately while dismissing the Writ Petition filed by the appellant and

others the High Court has made a significant remark which is as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    "17. It cannot be overlooked that while pollution-free environment is

        a component of right to life and liberty enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_18">Article 21</a>

        of our Constitution which is an extremely important and

        sacrosanct fundamental right, the installation and running of

        industrial units, subject to their fulfilling all the conditions of

        environmental laws, is equally important for the overall growth

        of the nation. The Courts, therefore, are required to keep both

        the aspects in view to strike a balance between such competing

        claims. In the facts and circumstances of this case and keeping

        in view the observations made above, we are of the view that the

        interpretation and/or understanding of Schedule I read with

        Note 1 thereto of the Notification dated 18.12.1997 (Annexure

        R-1/1) as made by the Respondents is neither arbitrary nor

        absurd. It also does not defeat the object for which the siting

        parameters have been laid down".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">
</blockquote><p id="p_38">   18. We, thus, find no merit in this Petition which is accordingly

        dismissed but without making any order as to costs".




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                    18</span>
</p><p id="p_39">  26. Having not satisfied with such catagoric and unimpeachable finding by

    the Hon'ble High Court, the appellant has approached the Hon'ble Apex

    Court in Civil Appeal No. 1019/297 and the Hon'ble Apex Court while

    finding no merit in the appeal and dismissing the same has passed the

    following order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           "The High Court after elaborate consideration of the matter found

             that the Unit established by the Respondent no. 5 is not located

             within the prohibited distance as provided for in Schedule I read

             with Note 1 of the notification dated 18th December, 1997 issued

             by the State Government of Haryana. We are not inclined to

             interfere with the finding of the fact so arrived at by the High

             Court that the houses where the appellants claim to be residing

             do not fall within the Abadi Deh of the village.

             It is needless to observe that this was the only question raised

             and considered by the High Court. We make it clear that if there

             are any other issues that survive and require consideration, the

             appellants are at liberty to avail such remedy as may be

             available to them in law in which event, the matter shall be

             considered on its own merits uninfluenced by the dismissal of

             this appeal.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">
</blockquote><p id="p_40">27. It is seen that respondent no. 1 project proponent has obtained Consent

    to Operate in respect of its unit II for the year 2012-2013 from the SPCB

    subject to various conditions, both general as well as special as

    contained in the order dated 16.08.2012.             Incidentally, the distance

    criteria in respect of the units on fact have attained finality by the catagoric

    finding of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">28. The appellant has filed another Writ Petition in C.W.P. No. 10333 of 2012

    in the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh to quash

    the NOC granted in respect of the unit no. I of respondent no.1 project

    proponent dated 20.05.2002 stated supra for operation of stone crusher.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                        19</span>
       It has to be noted that the appellant has chosen to file the said Writ

      Petition in 2012 challenging the NOC granted on 20.05.2002, after lapse

      of 10 years, apparently after exhausting all other remedies as stated above.

      However, taking note of the fact that the appellant has approached the

      Hon'ble High Court without making any representation against the NOC

      dated 20.05.2002, the Hon'ble High Court has permitted the appellant to

      withdraw the Writ Petition, however, with liberty to approach the SPCB to

      make a detailed representation within 15 days from the date of the receipt

      of the certified copy of the order and directed the SPCB to consider and

      decide the same in accordance with law by a speaking order within 3

      months, after providing opportunity of hearing to the parties. The order

      of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.08.2012 states as follows:

      forwarded a copy of the Judgment dated 28.08.2012 requesting the SPCB

      to consider and take necessary action. It appears that thereafter based on

      the spot inspection stated to have been conducted at the instance of the

      SPCB, by the Executive Engineer (Public Health), Regional Officer Gurgaon

      (South), and Tehsildar Pataudi, the SPCB has passed the order of refusal

       and in respect of the siting criteria regarding water supply while as

      per notification, requirement is 1-5 km it is narrowly short as 980

      mts even as per the spot inspection report dated 18.03.2013.

      These were the only two reasons for the SPCB to pass the orders of

      refusal to consent.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">32. Learned Appellate Authority has opined that the said spot inspection report

      dated 18.03.2013 is very much questionable as the distance was not

      measured by a team of officers while it simply mentions about the report

      of Patwari who was not present and whose report has not been appended.

      Therefore, it was held that the report cannot be held to be a local

      commissioner report personally prepared after due verification by the

      Tehsildar in the presence of Village Sarpanch and Lamberdar.


</p><p id="p_50">33.   The contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the appellant is that

      this spot inspection report dated 18.03.2013 is only the authorized report

      at the instance of the SPCB and therefore, any other subsequent reports

      cannot be taken into consideration is to be tested in the light of the

      contents of the spot inspection report dated 18.03.2013 itself.         On a

      reference to the spot inspection report dated 18.03.2013, we are able to

      find that even in respect of item no. 7, which is one of the reasons for the

      SPCB to refuse to grant consent, the distance of outer periphery of revenue

      Phirni village to the highest node of the conveyor belt of the project

      proponent village is stated to be 975.36 mts while the remaining portion

      "as per Patwari report" is inserted in handwriting without containing any

      initial or signature of any authorized person. Therefore, it is incumbent

      on the part of SPCB which has relied upon the said spot inspection report

      dated 18.03.2013 to produce the Patwari report which is stated to have

      been the basis on which the distance in respect of item no. 7 was arrived

      at by the committee under spot inspection report or the spot inspection

      report itself should have annexed the Patwari's report in all fairness. Even

      otherwise, if the three (3) of the above said officers even at the instance of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                        22</span>
       the SPCB have arrived at such conclusion in respect of serial no. 7

      enumerated above only based on Patwari report, it is apparent that the

      officers who have given the inspection report have not themselves verified

      the distance.   In such circumstances the necessary conclusion in the

      normal circumstances could be only not base reliance on such truncated

      and doubtful report as correctly found by the learned Appellate Authority.

      Therefore, we see no reason to take any different view from that of the

      learned Appellate Authority under the impugned order in this regard.


</p><p id="p_51">34.   Therefore, the learned Appellate Authority was left with no other option

      than relying upon the subsequent reports. The subsequent report dated

      27.05.2013 stated to be prepared at the instance of the project proponent

      was based on an inspection conducted by Naib Tehsildar "Retired" Shri

      Naresh Chander who is stated to have conducted spot inspection on

      21.05.2013 in the presence of Sarpanch Dharapur, Shri Moti Ram,

      Lamberdar and Others and another report stated to have been sent by

      SDO "C Pataudi" to Deputy Commissioner Gurgaon Vide letter dated

      25.10.2013. The learned Appellate Authority has relied upon the latest

      report dated 25.10.2013 signed by SDO "C Pataudi" who has in clear terms

      stated the he has reached the spot as per the letter of the Deputy

      Commissioner, Gurgaon dated 11.07.2013. The Patwari of the area along

      with the revenue record and land measurement equipments, the

      Supervisor of Patwari of the Area and Naib Tehsildar, Pataudi along with

      Shri Deepak Kumar, Surveyor, HUDA Contactor of Rewari were present.

      That apart the report says that Shri Vijay Singh, the appellant as well as

      Shri Rohtash Yadav on behalf of project proponent and Shri Moti Ram,

      headman of village Mau and others were present. In the report he has

      clearly stated that in their presence the Theodolite Survey Machine was

      fixed on the spot at North Eastern corner of rectangle No. 9/15 and

      distance of South Eastern corner and the boundary village Dharapur was

      got measured by machine by surveyor Deepak from the node point of grid


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                       23</span>
      conveyor which is 32 feet height and the distance has been shown to be

     1011.44 mts.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">35. The said report dated 25.10.2013 further states in catagoric terms that the

     same is in accordance with a representation made by the appellant as per

     the direction of the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana at

     Chandigarh in C.W.P. No. 10333 of 2012. Therefore, it is clear that on the

     representation sent by the appellant on 18.09.2012 the said spot

     inspection has been conducted and as contended by the learned Counsel

     appearing for the appellant, it can never be treated as an unauthorised

     report. Therefore, the finding given by the learned Appellate Authority in

     the impugned order stating that the aerial distance relating to item No. 7,

     in the spot inspection report dated 25.10.2013 is beyond the required

     distance criteria mentioned by the Government of Haryana in its

     notification dated 18.12.1997 cannot be said to be either perverse or

     illegal.   Much is spoken about the way in which the mechanical

     measurement was taken by the Theodolite Survey Machine on the manner

     of fixing the boundary. When once the authority competent to deal with

     the sophisticated instrument has made measurement especially in the

     presence of the appellant as well as respondent no. 1 project proponent

     and has come to a conclusion on spot specified verification, it is not for

     this Tribunal to find fault with the topographical survey and substitute its

     own view. Even otherwise whether the point of measurement to be fixed

     at no. 4, 3, 2 or 1 for that matter, in our considered view is not going to

     change the distance factor as such especially when the required distance

     is 1 km as per the notification of the Government and the finding by the

     Authority competent is that more than the required distance is available.

     Even otherwise, the unreliable report dated 18.03.2013 itself shows the

     deficient distance is marginal.   In any event, we are certain that the spot

     inspection report dated 18.03.2013 not supported by Patwari report

     cannot be relied upon. In such view of the matter, reliance based on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                       24</span>
       report dated 25.10.2013 by the learned Appellate Authority has to be

      accepted and there is nothing for this Tribunal to interfere with its

      findings.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">36.   Even so far as it relates to the report dated 27.05.2013, relied upon by the

      learned Appellate Authority, it is not as if such inspection, stated to have

      been conducted on 21.05.2013, was conducted by an incompetent person.

      It appears that at the direction of the Tehsildar, Pataudi who has

      appointed a Local Commissioner who happened to be a retired Tehsildar

      of Jamalpur has conducted spot inspection. In his proceedings of spot

      inspection he has stated that the appellant and others were present on the

      spot. He has made demarcation of land by measuring with the chain with

      the help of flag poles by putting up flag pole on the Southern corner of the

      Eastern side of the uncultivable land of village Dharapur which came to

      60 chains and 6 Karam and in the same way he has carried out

      measurement for the North Western corner of rectangle no. 28/20 which

      is adjoining the corner of the uncultivable land that is from the boundary

      of 28/20 from the North Western corner of village Dharapur up to the

      conveyors highest node point of crusher installed in village Mau. There is

      nothing on record to show that the appellant has objected to such method

      of measurement on the spot.
</p>
<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">37.   It is significant to note at this stage that in fact, the learned Appellate

      Authority has compared the reports of the two commission reports and

      found that between the two reports which are alleged to be unauthorised

      by the appellant there is very negligible variation of 0.4 per cent. In such

      view of the matter, we have no hesitation to hold that the finding of the

      learned Appellate Authority regarding item no. 7 of the spot inspection

      report dated 18.03.2013 is neither perverse nor illegal and there is

      absolute no reason for this Tribunal to interfere with the order of the

      learned Appellate Authority in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                        25</span>
</p><p id="p_59"> 38.   In so far as it relates the observation in serial no. 11 of the report dated

      18.03.2013 which relates to the approved water supply of 20 kl capacity

      and distance, it has been found that undisputedly the water supply

      scheme is a piped supply without any open reservoir and water tank and

      therefore, there is no chance of water getting contaminated or polluted by

      fine stone particulate matter generated from crushers during crushing

      operations of the units. In fact the learned Appellate Authority has relied

      upon an affidavit dated 14.05.2013 filed by the Regional Officer of the

      HSPCB Gurgaon Region, South in C.W.P. No. 19634 of 2010 in the Hon'ble

      High Court of Punjab and Haryana stating that the tube well based water

      supply was not affected by the operation of the crushing unit. When such

      undisputed fact is before us, the reliance placed on the said serial no. 11

      of the spot inspection report dated 18.03.2013 by the HSPCB to refuse to

      grant consent is absolutely unsustainable as correctly held by the learned

      Appellate Authority.      Incidentally we have to refer about an obvious

      typographical error in the notification issued by the Haryana Government,

      dated 18.12.1997. In the Schedule I while stating about the norms for

      siting, the distance is stated, for example as 1-5, 1-0 etc. It must be

      obviously 1.5, 1.0 etc.


</p><p id="p_60">39. The historic events which are narrated above show in no uncertain terms,

      and makes one to necessarily conclude that the appellant has taken every

      opportunity to question the conduct of respondent no.1 project proponent

      at every stage taking advantage of certain observations made by the

      Hon'ble Judicial forum. Even though we are conscious that the appellant

      is not disentitled to take such action, we have no hesitation to come to a

      conclusion that the steps taken by the appellant has not been with bona

      fide intention. That apart there is no question of any environmental issue

      affecting the larger public interest that has been raised in this appeal. The

      appellant having taken shelter under spot inspection report dated

      18.03.2013 which is not only truncated but also bald in our view has in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                        26</span>
       fact taken many other steps which are seen in the records filed by the

      appellant himself, that he has raised different sort of issues at different

      times and sought compliance regarding the units of respondent no. 1 on

      different grounds subsequent to the spot inspection report dated

      18.03.2013, other than those two grounds mentioned in serial no. 7 and

</p><p id="p_61">      11. He has started raising issue about the wind breaking walls, plantation

      of trees, metalled road etc. which were not the subject matter of the spot

      inspection report dated 18.03.2013 and made the officers of the Board to

      conduct inspection frequently and invited various reports at various times

      to make his grievance against respondent no. 1 alive for the reasons best

      known to him.     When once it is admitted that Theodolite method of

      measurement is the most accurate method and both the units of

      respondent no. 1 were functioning with necessary compliance, the

      conduct of the appellant shows that he has carefully made the entire issue

      alive against respondent no. 1 from time immemorial under one pretext or

      the other which in our view cannot be termed better than the abuse of

      process of law. It is also informed to this Tribunal that the appellant has

      even filed a contempt application against respondent no. 1 and other

      official respondents for not considering his representation of the year 2012

      based on an order passed in a Writ Petition dated 20.08.2012 in respect

      of the NOC granted 10 years before, namely 20.05.2002 and that contempt

      application came to be dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court on

      10.07.2013. These are all the reasons which in our view are sufficient to

      hold that the appellant has not come to the Court with clean hands.


</p><p id="p_62">40.   Looking into any angle we see no reason to interfere with the impugned

      order of the learned Appellate Authority and accordingly, we dismiss the

      appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">41.   In so far as it relates to the conduct of a party in not approaching the

      Judicial forum with clean hands, the Hon'ble Apex Court in numerous

      cases has heavily come down against such conduct by imposing exemplary


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                       27</span>
 cost. While decrying the abuse of Public Interest Litigation concept against

the very public interest the same was held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in

Central Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha VS Dhobei Sahoo and Ors

reported in (2014)1 SCC 161. The Hon'ble Apex Court to support its view

that Public Interest Litigation cannot be entertained if they are filed in

confrontational mode, relied upon observation of Bhagwati J. in the

Judgment reported in (1984) 3 SCC 161 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "25. As advised at present, we may refer to certain authorities

        in the field in this regard. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of

        thus: (SCC p. 183, para 9)

           "9...When the Court entertains public interest litigation, it

           does not do so in a cavilling spirit or in a confrontational

           mood or with a view to tilting at executive authority or

           observance of social and economic rescue programmes,

           legislative as well as executive, framed for the benefit of the

           have-nots and the handicapped and to protect them

           against violation of their basic human rights, which is also

           the constitutional obligation of the executive. The Court is

                 (Ashok Kumar Pandey case, SCC p. 358, para 16)"

                 Thereafter, giving a note of caution, the Court stated:

(SCC p. 357)


  "12. Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be

  used with great care and circumspection and the judiciary

  has to be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful

  veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested

  interest and/or publicity-seeking is not lurking. It is to be

  used as an effective weapon in the armoury of law for

  delivering social justice to citizens. The attractive brand

  name of public interest litigation should not be used for

  suspicious products of mischief. It should be aimed at

  redressal of genuine public wrong or public injury and not

  publicity oriented or founded on personal vendetta. As

  indicated above, the Court must be careful to see that a

  body of persons or a member of the public, who

  approaches the Court is acting bona fide and not for

  personal gain or private motive or political motivation or

  other oblique consideration. The Court must not allow its

  process to be abused for oblique considerations. Some

  persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of

  meddling with judicial process either by force of habit or

  from improper motives. Often they are actuated by a desire

                 to win notoriety or cheap popularity. The petitions of such

                busybodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection at the

              unscrupulous litigants to disguise personal or individual

              grievances as public interest litigations. The facts placed on

              record in the present proceeding would clearly indicate that the

              appellant has not come to the Court with clean hands. He has

              failed to establish his credentials for moving the writ petition as

              public interest litigation. In our opinion, the High Court has

              failed to examine the matter, in its correct perspective. The writ

              petition was undoubtedly moved by motives other than what

              was stated in the writ petition. A perusal of the affidavit in

              support of the writ petition would clearly show that the writ

</p><p id="p_72">              Public interest litigation which has now come to occupy an

              important field in the administration of law should not be

 'publicity interest litigation' or 'private interest litigation' or

'politics interest litigation' or the latest trend 'paise income

litigation'. . . If not properly regulated and abuse averted, it

becomes also a tool in unscrupulous hands to release vendetta

and wreak vengeance, as well. There must be real and genuine

public interest involved in the litigation and not merely an

adventure of a knight errant borne out of wishful thinking. It

cannot also be invoked by a person or a body of persons to

further his or their personal causes or satisfy his or their

personal grudge and enmity. The courts of justice should not

be allowed to be polluted by unscrupulous litigants by resorting

to the extraordinary jurisdiction. A person acting bona fide and

having sufficient interest in the proceeding of public interest

litigation will alone have a locus standi and can approach the

court to wipe out violation of fundamental rights and genuine

infraction of statutory provisions, but not for personal gain or

private profit or political motive or any oblique consideration.

These aspects were highlighted by this Court in <a href="/doc/1830927/" id="a_25">Janata Dal v.

H.S. Chowdhary</a> and <a href="/doc/162922005/" id="a_26">Kazi Lhendup Dorji v. CBI</a>. A writ petitioner

who comes to the court for relief in public interest must come

not only with clean hands like any other writ petitioner but also

with a clean heart, clean mind and clean objective. (<a href="/doc/265836/" id="a_27">See Ramjas

Foundation v. Union of India</a> and <a href="/doc/1149747/" id="a_28">K.R. Srinivas v. R.M.

Premchand</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">6. It is necessary to take note of the meaning of the expression

'public interest litigation'. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, Vol. 4

(4th Edn.), 'public interest' is defined thus:
</p>
<p id="p_75">  'Public interest - (1) A matter of public or general interest

  "does not mean that which is interesting as gratifying

  curiosity or a love of information or amusement; but that

  in which a class of the community have a pecuniary

  interest, or some interest by which their legal rights or

  liabilities are affected".'


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                32</span>
</p><p id="p_76"> 7. In Black's Law Dictionary (6th Edn.) 'public interest' is defined

as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_77">
  'Public interest - Something in which the public, the

  community at large, has some pecuniary interest, or some

  interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are

  affected. It does not mean anything so narrow as mere

  curiosity, or as the interests of the particular localities,

  which may be affected by the matters in question. Interest

  shared by citizens generally in affairs of local, State or

  national Government.'


</p><p id="p_78">8. In Janata Dal case this Court considered the scope of public

interest litigation. In para 53 of the said judgment, after

considering what is public interest, the Court has laid down as

follows: (SCC p. 331)

  '53. The expression "litigation" means a legal action

  including all proceedings therein, initiated in a court of law

  with the purpose of enforcing a right or seeking a remedy.

  Therefore, lexically the expression "PIL" means a legal

  action initiated in a court of law for the enforcement of

  public interest or general interest in which the public or a

  class of the community have pecuniary interest or some

  interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are

  affected.'

</p><p id="p_79">9. In paras 60, 61 and 62 of the said judgment, it was pointed

out as follows: (SCC p. 334)

  '62. Be that as it may, it is needless to emphasise that the

  requirement of locus standi of a party to a litigation is

  mandatory; because the legal capacity of the party to any

  litigation whether in private or public action in relation to

  any specific remedy sought for has to be primarily

  ascertained at the threshold.'

</p><p id="p_80">10. In para 98 of the said judgment, it has further been pointed

out as follows: (SCC pp. 345-46)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                            33</span>
   '98. While this Court has laid down a chain of notable

  decisions with all emphasis at their command about the

  importance and significance of this newly developed

  doctrine of PIL, it has also hastened to sound a red alert

  and a note of severe warning that courts should not allow

  its process to be abused by a mere busybody or a

  meddlesome interloper or wayfarer or officious intervener

  without any interest or concern except for personal gain or

  private profit or other oblique consideration.'

</p><p id="p_81">11. In subsequent paras of the said judgment, it was observed

as follows: (SCC p. 348, para 109)


  '109. It is thus clear that only a person acting bona fide

  and having sufficient interest in the proceeding of PIL will

  alone have a locus standi and can approach the court to

  wipe out the tears of the poor and needy, suffering from

  violation of their fundamental rights, but not a person for

  personal gain or private profit or political motive or any

  oblique consideration.         Similarly, a vexatious petition

  under the colour of PIL brought before the court for

  vindicating any personal grievance, deserves rejection at

  the threshold.'


</p><p id="p_82">12. It is depressing to note that on account of such trumpery

proceedings initiated before the courts, innumerable days are

wasted, which time otherwise could have been spent for the

disposal of cases of the genuine litigants. Though we spare no

efforts in fostering and developing the laudable concept of PIL

and extending our long arm of sympathy to the poor, the

ignorant, the oppressed and the needy whose fundamental

rights are infringed and violated and whose grievances go

unnoticed, unrepresented and unheard; yet we cannot avoid

but express out opinion that while genuine litigants with

legitimate   grievances   relating    to   civil   matters   involving

properties worth hundreds of millions of rupees and criminal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                            34</span>
 cases in which persons sentenced to death facing gallows under

untold agony and persons sentenced to life imprisonment and

kept in incarceration for long years, persons suffering from

undue delay in service matters- government or private, persons

awaiting the disposal of cases wherein huge amounts of public

revenue or unauthorised collection of tax amounts are locked

up, detenu expecting their release from the detention orders,

etc. are all standing in a long serpentine queue for years with

the fond hope of getting into the courts and having their

grievances redressed, the busybodies, meddlesome interlopers,

wayfarers or officious interveners having absolutely no public

interest except for personal gain or private profit either of

themselves or as a proxy of others or for any other extraneous

motivation or for glare of publicity, break the queue muffing

their faces by wearing the mask of public interest litigation and

get into the courts by filing vexatious and frivolous petitions and

thus criminally waste the valuable time of the courts and as a

result of which the queue standing outside the doors of the

courts never moves, which piquant situation creates frustration

in the minds of the genuine litigants and resultantly they lose

faith in the administration of our judicial system.


</p><p id="p_83">13. Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used

with great care and circumspection and the judiciary has to be

extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public

interest an ugly private malice, vested interest and/or publicity-

seeking is not lurking. It is to be used as an effective weapon in

the armoury of law for delivering social justice to the citizens.

The attractive brand name of public interest litigation should

not be used for suspicious products of mischief. It should be

aimed at redressal of genuine public wrong or public injury and

not publicity-oriented or founded on personal vendetta.         As

indicated above, the court must be careful to see that a body of

persons or member of public, who approaches the court is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                            35</span>
 acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or

political motivation or other oblique considerations. The court

must not allow its process to be abused for oblique

considerations by masked phantoms who monitor at times from

behind.   Some persons with vested interest indulge in the

pastime of meddling with judicial process either by force of habit

or from improper motives, and try to bargain for a good deal as

well to enrich themselves. Often they are actuated by a desire

to win notoriety or cheap popularity.     The petitions of such

busybodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection at the

threshold, and in appropriate cases with exemplary costs.


</p><p id="p_84">14. The Council for Public Interest Law set up by the Ford

Foundation in USA defined 'public interest litigation' in its

report of Public Interest Law, USA, 1976 as follows:

</p><p id="p_85">    'Public interest law is the name that has recently been

given to efforts providing legal representation to previously

unrepresented groups and interests. Such efforts have been

undertaken in the recognition that ordinary marketplace for

legal services fails to provide such services to significant

segments of the population and to significant interests. Such

groups and interests include the proper environmentalists,

consumers, racial and ethnic minorities and others.'

</p><p id="p_86">15. The court has to be satisfied about (a) the credentials of the

applicant; (b) the prima facie correctness or nature of

information given by him; (c) the information being not vague

and indefinite.   The information should show gravity and

seriousness involved. The court has to strike a balance between

two conflicting interests: (i) nobody should be allowed to indulge

in wild and reckless allegations besmirching the character of

others; and (ii) avoidance of public mischief and to avoid

mischievous petitions seeking to assail, for oblique motives,

justifiable executive actions. In such case, however, the court

cannot afford to be liberal. It has to be extremely careful to see


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                           36</span>
 that under the guise of redressing a public grievance, it does not

encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the

executive and the legislature. The court has to act ruthlessly

while dealing with imposters and busybodies or meddlesome

interlopers impersonating as public- spirited holy men. They

masquerade as crusaders of justice. They pretend to act in the

name of pro bono public, though they have no interest of the

public or even of their own to protect.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">16. The courts must do justice by promotion of good faith and

prevent law from crafty invasions. The courts must maintain

the social balance by interfering where necessary for the sake of

justice and refuse to interfere where it is against the social

interest and public good. (<a href="/doc/1957056/" id="a_29">See State of Maharashtra v. Prabhu</a>

and <a href="/doc/1697343/" id="a_30">A.P. State Financial Corpn. V. GAR Re- Rolling Mills</a>.) No

litigant has a right to unlimited draught on the court time and

public money in order to get his affairs settled in the manner as

he wishes. Easy access to justice should not be misused as a

licence to file misconceived and frivolous petitions. (<a href="/doc/455188/" id="a_31">See Buddhi

Kota Subbarao (Dr.) v. K. Parasaran</a>.) Today people rush to the

courts to file cases in profusion under this attractive name of

public interest. They must inspire confidence in the courts and

among the public.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">17. As noted supra, a time has come to weed out the petitions,

which though titled as public interest litigations are in essence

something else. It is shocking to note that the courts are flooded

with a large number of so-called public interest litigations where

only a minuscule percentage can legitimately be called as public

interest litigation.   Though the parameters of public interest

litigation have been indicated by this Court in a large number

of cases, yet unmindful of the real intentions and objectives, the

courts are entertaining such petitions and wasting valuable

judicial time which, as noted above, could be otherwise utilised

for disposal of genuine case. It is also noticed that the petitions

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                            37</span>
               are based on newspaper reports without any attempt to verify

              their authenticity. As observed by this Court in several cases,

              newspaper reports do not constitute evidence. A petition based

              on     unconfirmed      news   reports,   without   verifying   their

              authenticity should not normally be entertained.          As noted

              above, such petitions do not provide any basis for verifying the

              correctness of statements made and information given in the

              petition. It would be desirable for the courts to filter out the

              frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs as aforestated

              so that the message goes in the right direction that petitions

              filed with oblique motive do not have the approval of the courts.


</p><p id="p_91">              18. <a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_32">In S.P. Gupta v. Union of India</a> it was emphatically pointed

              out that the relaxation of the rule of locus standi in the field of

              PIL does not give any right to a busybody or meddlesome

              interloper to approach the court under the guise of a public

              interest litigant. He has also left the following note of caution:

              (SCC p. 219, para 24)

                   '24. But we must be careful to see that the member of the

                   public, who approaches the court in cases of this kind, is

                   acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private profit or

                   political motivation or other oblique consideration. The court

                   must not allow its process to be abused by politicians and

                   others to delay legitimate administrative action or to gain a

                   political objective.'

</p><p id="p_92">              19. <a href="/doc/596084/" id="a_33">In State of H.P. v. Parent</a> of a Student of Medical College it

              has been said that the public interest litigation is a weapon

              which has to be used with great care and circumspection.


</p><p id="p_93">              20. These aspects have been highlighted in <a href="/doc/1107385/" id="a_34">Ashok Kumar

              Pandey v. State of W.B</a>. and <a href="/doc/1471968/" id="a_35">B. Singh (Dr.) v. Union of India</a> and

              <a href="/doc/1529115/" id="a_36">Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware v. State of Maharashtra</a>."


</p><p id="p_94">44.   Hon'ble Justice Arijit Pasayat along with Hon'ble Justice S.H. Kapadia

      (Former Chief Justice of India), in his inimitable style has made it clear

       that a litigant has no right to take away the Courts time and public money

      to get his score settled in the manner he wishes. That was in Gurpal Singh

      VS State of Punjab and Ors. reported in (2005) 5 SCC 136 which is as

      follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">

      almost a black spot on the noble profession of law and black day for the

      black/ robed professional, if the allegations are found to be true, the

      learned Judges in <a href="/doc/1529115/" id="a_40">Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware v. State of Maharashtra and

      Ors</a>. reported in (2005) 1 SCC 590 have distinguished the Public Interest

      the observations made above in various cases.
</p>
<p id="p_96">
</p><p id="p_97">46.    The above referred cases are not only well instructive on the concept of

      Public Interest Litigation which is often abused and misused but throws

      light in the legal parlour that by permitting such fake litigations, the

      genuine litigants are side-lined virtually for want of time.

      observation to be used as a guideline in future in respect of stone crushing

      Consent to Operate is given to any stone crusher, a condition should be

      stipulated that the unit will implement the pollution control measures as

      suggested    in   the   Comprehensive      Industry    Document      (Series

      COINDS/78/2007-08) brought out by the Central Pollution Control Board

      adverse impact on environment are to be taken note of, therefore we direct

      all the State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees

      of the Union Territories to strictly ensure while granting Consents to stone

      crushers that the pollution control measures and environmental
