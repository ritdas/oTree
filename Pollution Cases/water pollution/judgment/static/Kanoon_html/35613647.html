                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      In the normal course, this Court would have relegated the

petitioner to the remedy of appeal under clause (c) of <a href="/doc/156852187/" id="a_1">Section 33B</a>

of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for

short 'the said Act of 1974').       However, the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioner, on instructions, states that the

petitioner is confining the prayer in the petition only to one

direction regarding disposal of the representation dated 23rd

September 2019 (Annexure-L). His contention is that in similar

matters, the direction issued under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_3">Section 33A</a> of the said Act of

1974 has been modified by the Karnataka State Pollution Control

Board.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.     In view of the limited prayer, we dispose of the

petition by passing the following order:
