                          “8. There is a great purpose behind these
                          provisions. It is common knowledge that any
                          litigation in a Civil Court will not reach its logical
                          conclusion within a year or two. It takes several
                          years. These are enactments which are intended to
                          ensure the pollution free water and pollution free
                          air and pollution free environment, to the humanity
                          and the people at large in India. It is common
                          knowledge that every day, pollution of water, air
                          and environment is increasing in such measure that
                          if the volume and speed of this is not prevented or
                          abated and controlled, it may prove to be fatal to
                          the humanity within a short period. Therefore,
                          keeping in view this catastrophe which may occur, if
                          it is neglected, these enactments have been passed
                          and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court has been
                          taken away, as otherwise, the very purpose of the
                          Act would be defeated, if the Board and the
                          authority were to litigate bore the Civil Courts,
                          which will taken nearly a decade to come to a
                          logical end and after a decade, probably, the
                          pollution might assume such an alarming
                          proportion that it may even go beyond our capacity
                          to control and consequently the very objective of
                          the law would be defeated these final aspects of life
                          and serious consequences the presiding officers of
                          the Civil Courts shall bear in mind and make a little
                          effort to know and acquaint themselves with the
                          aims and objects of the enactments and provisions
                          contained therein before they embark upon
                          entertaining the suits ignoring the specific
                          prohibition contained in the aforesaid enactments.
                          Inspite of this, if the Civil Courts go on
                          entertaining the suits and granting interim
                          orders preventing the Boards and the
                          authority to perform their functions and
                          discharge their duties in exercise of their
                          powers under the Act, the same will prove to
                          be fatal to the people and defeat the aims and
                          objects of the Act. Therefore, with a view to
                          ensure that the Civil Courts do not embark
                          upon such expedition, we have considered it
                          necessary to issue a direction to the Civil

                              accordingly. We also further direct that such of the
                              suits which have been entertained by the Civil
                              Courts in respect of the matter falling under these
                              enactments, shall be taken up within a fortnight
                              from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and
                              disposed of the same in the light of the aforesaid
                              directions and in the light of the observation
                              contained in this order and bar of the jurisdiction
                              contained in the aforesaid three enactments.”
</p><p id="p_18">                            11.The reasoning given in the above passage seems to

                      indicate that the jurisdiction of the civil court is ousted even though

                      under <a href="/doc/106204869/" id="a_14">Section 9</a> the jurisdiction of the civil Court stands ousted only

                      where cognizance of suit is either expressly or impliedly barred.

<p id="p_19">                            12.If the ratio from the above decision is to be accepted, it

                      would offend the very fundamental principle viz, “ubi jus ibi

                      remedium” ie. where there is a right there is a remedy, unless

                      there is really an alternative remedy under these enactments.

                      SCC 54 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 27] wherein it was observed that

                      “nuisance is an inconvenience which materially interferes with the

                      ordinary physical comfort of human existence. It is not capable of

                      precise definition. To bring in application of Section 133 of the

                      Code, there must be imminent danger to the property and

                      consequential   nuisance   to   the       public.   The   nuisance   is   the

                      concomitant act resulting in danger to the life or property due to

                      likely collapse, etc. The object and purpose behind Section 133 of

                      the Code is essentially to prevent public nuisance and involves a

                      sense of urgency in the sense that if the Magistrate fails to take

                      recourse immediately, irreparable danger would be done to the

                      public. It applies to a condition of the nuisance at the time when the

                      order is passed and it is not intended to apply to future likelihood or

                      what may happen at some later point of time. It does not deal with

                      all potential nuisances and on the other hand applies when the

                      confusion between <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">Section 133</a> and Section 144 of the Code. While
