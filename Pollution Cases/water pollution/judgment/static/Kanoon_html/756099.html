		 Heard Mr.T.Lajapathi Roy, learned counsel appearing for the
Petitioner, Mr.R.Janakiramalu, learned Special Government Pleader for
Respondents 1 and 3, Mr. R.Ramanlal, learned counsel appearing for Second
Respondent and Mr. Santhosh Kumar, learned counsel for Fifth Respondent. 	
</p><p id="p_2">	2. The Petitioner has preferred this petition pro bono publico complaining
that respondents 4 to 7 are dumping their granite waste into irrigation tanks in
Periyar Vaigai River Basin and thereby blocking the free flow of water to the
next tanks; that they are exploiting public tanks as a dumping yard and are
creating an environmental hazard and are causing hardship to the irrigation
facilities of the agriculturists as well as the inland fishing rights of the
villagers, and prays for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus to direct respondents 1
to 3 to take effective steps to preserve the tanks and water sources under the
Periyar Vaigai Irrigation Scheme and remove the dumped granite and other waste
materials from the Irrigation tanks under the Periyar Vaigai Irrigation Scheme
in Madurai District and restore its utility within the time stipulated by this
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">		3. The Third Respondent District Collector, Madurai has filed a
Counter Affidavit dated 04.07.2007, to the effect that the water bodies under
reference have not received adequate water to sustain agricultural operations or
fish culture and the entire ayacut area of Sirumanickam Kanmai of Keelavalavu
Village had been sold by the concerned pattadars to the granite entrepreneurs
for extracting granite blocks for more than 25 years. In the absence of enough
water in the water bodies, the fish culture cannot be carried out. According to
the District Collector, the granite lessees are dumping the granite rock waste
in the patta lands separately for future use of the Government. Few quarry
contractors have dumped the granite rock waste in the peripheral non water
spread high level portions of the water bodies after obtaining necessary
permission from P.W.D authorities so as to protect the bunds of the water bodies
and to prevent cutting of the bunds by the anti social elements. It is explained
that the granite rock waste dumped around the periphery of the water bodies act
as a permanent barrier for the water bodies. The Collector has stated that the
granite waste are also used for forming the roads, repairing and strengthening
the existing roads in public interest and that the quarry operators   neither
produce nor discharge any hazardous or chemical effluents from the quarries and
therefore, there is no question of depletion and contamination of ground water
due to quarrying operations. Due to paucity of water in the area, as the water
from Periyar Vaigai River Basin does not reach out to the area, it is submitted
that the fish culture is not a thriving business for the common public in the
area at any point of time. The Collector has also stated that the Government has
taken all necessary steps to protect the ecologically fragile area and strict
measures have been taken to reduce the risk of hazard to the community while
granting the quarry leases in a manner that would pose the least risk of danger
to the community and for maximizing the safety requirements while conducting
quarrying operations. The basic environment viz., Air, Water and Soil have not
been disturbed and there is no public health hazard in the area due to quarrying
operations. It is also stated that the Government has taken all necessary
precautions while granting lease / licence to utilise the granite potential
available in the area, in public interest, so as to provide employment to the
local people and to realise revenue to Government without any hindrance to the
public and to protect the rights of persons conferred under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India as well as to protect and to improve the natural
environment including forest, lakes, river and wildlife as contemplated under
<a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_3">Article 51-A(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_4">		4. We have given our careful consideration to the submissions of
both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_5">		5.  Undoubtedly, there are  Constitutional mandates under Articles
14, 21 of the fundamental rights, 47, 48A of the directive principles of State
Policy and 51A(g) of the Fundamental Duty, to protect and improve the
environment.  That apart, there are plenty of post-independence legislations on
the subject but more relevant enactments for our purpose are: the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a>), the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>) and the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment Act</a>). <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">The Water Act</a> provides
for the constitution of the Central Pollution Control Board by the Central
Government and the constitution of the State Pollution Control Boards by various
State Governments in the country. The Boards function under the control of the
Governments concerned. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">The Water Act</a> prohibits the use of streams and wells for
disposal of polluting matters. It also provides for restrictions on outlets and
discharge of effluents without obtaining consent from the Board. Prosecution and
penalties have been provided which include sentence of imprisonment. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">The Air Act</a>
provides that the Central Pollution Control Board and the State Pollution
Control Boards constituted under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a> shall also perform the powers and
functions under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a>. The main function of the Boards, under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a>,
is to improve the quality of the air and to prevent, control and abate air
pollution in the country.
</p>
<p id="p_6">		6.1. Before proceeding further, we feel it apt to make a reference
to the concept of Sustainable Development.
</p>
<p id="p_7">		6.2.  <a href="/doc/1934103/" id="a_16">In Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum v. Union of India</a> (AIR 1996
SC 2715) a three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court referred to the "precautionary
principle" in environmental matters. Kuldip Singh,J. after referring to the
principles evolved in various international conferences and to the concept of
"Sustainable Development", stated that the precautionary principle, the
polluter-pays principle and the special concept of onus of proof have now
emerged and govern the law in our country too, as is clear from Articles 47, 48-
A and 51-A(g) of our Constitution and that, in fact, in the various
environmental statutes, such as the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">Water Act</a>, 1974 and other statutes,
including the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_18">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, these concepts are already
implied. These principles have now become part of our law.  Thus, it was held
that "The Precautionary Principle" and "The Polluter Pays Principle" are
essential features of "Sustainable Development".
</p>
<p id="p_8">		6.3.  The "Precautionary Principle" - in the context of the
municipal law - means:
</p><p id="p_9">(i) Environmental measures - by the State Government and the statutory
authorities - must anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental
degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_10">(ii) Where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage, lack of
scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to
prevent environmental degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(iii) The "onus of proof" is on the actor or the developer/industrialist to show
that his action is environmentally benign.
</p>
<p id="p_12">		6.4.  "The Polluter Pays Principle" has been held to be a sound
principle by the Apex Court in Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1818014/" id="a_19">Enviro-Legal Action v. Union
of India</a>, 1996 (3) SCC 212. The Court observed:
</p><p id="p_13">"... we are of the opinion that any principle evolved in this behalf should be
simple, practical and suited to the conditions obtaining  this country".  The
Apex Court observed that "... once the activity carried on is hazardous or
inherently dangerous, the person carrying on such activity is liable to make
good the loss caused to any other person by his activity irrespective of the
fact whether he took reasonable care while carrying on his activity. The rule is
premised upon the very nature of the activity carried on".
...
</p><p id="p_14">"Consequently the polluting industries are absolutely liable to compensate for
the harm caused by them to villagers in the affected area, to the soil and to
the underground water and hence, they are bound to take all necessary measures
to remove sludge and other pollutants lying in the affected areas. The 'Polluter
Pays Principle' as interpreted by this Court means that the absolute liability
for harm to the environment extends not only to compensate the victims of
pollution but also the cost of restoring the environmental degradation.
Remediation of the damaged environment is part of the process of 'Sustainable
Development' and as such the polluter is liable to pay the cost to the
individual sufferers as well as the cost of reversing the damaged ecology. The
Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle have been accepted as
part of the law of the land. <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_20">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees
protection of life and personal liberty. "
</p>
<p id="p_15">		6.5. For Sustainable Development, the onus of proof lies on the
developer, who is on the actor or the developer / industrialist to show that his
action is environmentally benign.
</p>
<p id="p_16">		 7.1. Now, turning to the other side of the coin of "Sustainable
Development", we must never overlook the basic aim of our country, viz., to make
India into a powerful model industrial country.
</p>
<p id="p_17">		7.2. Industrialization alone can generate the wealth required for
taking care of the people, as is the mandate of the Directive Principles of our
Constitution.  No body can dispute the need for protecting the environment, as
everyone is entitled to pure air and water. Greenery should be protected to
ensure pure air. Trees and  forest have to be protected for ensuring regular
rainfall and preventing soil erosion.  Wild life has to be protected for
maintaining ecological balance.
</p>
<p id="p_18">		7.3. But, there should not be a tug-of-war between industrialization
and environment protection.  Industrialization should certainly ensure a good
environment.  Thus, without compromising any harm to the environment, the
industrialization should also grow, otherwise, we would not be in a position
meet the economic challenges particularly in the context of globalization.
</p>
<p id="p_19">		8.1. Industrialization, particularly Granite Industry is of vital
importance to the country, as it generates foreign exchange and employment
avenues. But, at the same time, undoubtedly, such industrialists have no right
to destroy the ecology, degrade the environment and pose any health hazard.
Hence, such Industrialisation can be permitted to continue and expand only when
such Industries tackle by themselves the problems of pollution created by them.
</p>
<p id="p_20">		8.2. It is a settled law that the balance between environmental
protection and developmental activities could only be maintained by strictly
following the principle of "Sustainable Development". This is a development
strategy that caters to the needs of the present without negotiating the ability
of upcoming generations to satisfy their needs. The strict observance of
Sustainable Development will put us on a path that ensures development while
protecting the environment, a path that works for all peoples and for all
generations. It is a guarantee to the present and a bequeath to the future. All
environment-related developmental activities should benefit more people while
maintaining the environmental balance. This could be ensured only by strict
adherence to Sustainable Development without which life of the coming
generations will be in jeopardy.  The adherence to Sustainable Development
principle is a sine qua non for the maintenance of the symbiotic balance between
the rights to environment and development. Right to environment is a fundamental
right. On the other hand, right to development is also one. Here the right to
Sustainable Development cannot be singled out. Therefore, the concept of
Sustainable Development is to be treated as an integral part of life under
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Article 21.</a> Weighty concepts like intergenerational equity, public trust
doctrine and precautionary principle, which have been declared as inseparable
ingredients of our environmental jurisprudence, could only be nurtured by
ensuring Sustainable Development.  To ensure Sustainable Development is one of
the goals of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_22">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and this is quite necessary
to guarantee the right to life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_23">Article 21.</a> <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">If the Act</a> is not armed with
the powers to ensure Sustainable Development, it will become a barren shell. In
other words, Sustainable Development is one of the means to achieve the object
and purpose of the Act as well as the protection of life under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_25">Article 21.</a>
Acknowledgment of this principle will breathe new life into our environmental
jurisprudence and constitutional resolve. Sustainable Development could be
achieved only by strict compliance with the directions under the Act. The object
and purpose of the Act: "to provide for the protection and improvement of
environment" could only be achieved by ensuring strict compliance with its
directions. The authorities concerned by exercising their powers under the Act
will have to ensure the acquiescence of Sustainable Development. Therefore, the
directions or conditions put forward by the Act need to be strictly complied
with. Thus the power under the Act cannot be treated as a power simpliciter, but
it is a power coupled with duty. It is the duty of the State to make sure the
fulfilment of conditions or direction under the Act. Without strict compliance,
right to environment under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_26">Article 21</a> could not be guaranteed and the purpose of
the Act will also be defeated. The commitment to the conditions thereof is an
obligation both under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_27">Article 21</a> and under the Act [vide <a href="/doc/1875824/" id="a_28">N.D.Jayal v. Union of
India</a>, (2004) 9 SCC 362].
</p>
<p id="p_21">		9. When our country is emerging as one of the major power in the
global arena, a duty is cast on the State to maintain the environmental
protection to protect and maintain the environmental elements such as Air, Water
and Soil and also for the economic development of the country by
Industrialisation.  While the right to life is legitimate expectation as the
same is protected under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, the
right for Industrialisation conferred under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_29">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution
of India to generate more wealth and get more foreign exchange is also equally
to be taken care of for the socio-economic welfare of the community.
Industrialisation should also grow    without causing any harm to the
environment, otherwise, we would not be in a position to meet the economic
challenges particularly in the context of globalisation.
</p>
<p id="p_22">		10. For Sustainable Development, it is thus the duty of the
authorities, particularly, in the instant case Respondents 1 to 3 to strictly
adopt and adhere to all precautionary measures for fulfillment of the essential
features both in maintaining the environmental conditions and developing the
Industrialisation. The Government and the Statutory Authority therefore must
anticipate, prevent and attack causes of environmental degradation. The
Government is also shouldered with the responsibility to monitor environmental
protection equipment / measure for protection of eco-friendly environment and to
ensure socio-economic growth for a  Sustainable Development in the locality.
</p>
<p id="p_23">		11. It is under such circumstances, judicious conscience requires
the Court to direct the Government and the Executive viz., Respondents 1 to 3 to
effectively oversee the Sustainable Development for the growth of the
Industrialisation, in the instant case granite mining operations, without giving
room for any environmental hazard, which would cause loss to the irrigation
facility of the locality of the people and also local rights such as inland
fishery etc., if exists.
</p>
<p id="p_24">		12. While the petitioner has implored against the alleged dumping of
granite waste in Periyar Vaigai River Basin, the Collector in his Counter
Affidavit has stated that the quarry operators are dumping waste in the
peripheral non water spread high level portions of the water bodies after
obtaining necessary permission from the Public Works Department, so as to
protect the bunds of the water bodies and to prevent cutting of the bunds by the
anti social elements and that the quarry operators neither produce nor discharge
any hazardous or chemical effluents from  the quarries or where they dump the
granite wastes in their private lands and therefore, there is no question of
depletion and contamination of ground water due to quarrying operations.   On
the other hand, it is acknowledged that the granite lessees are only rendering
their help to the common public to redress their grievances relating to the
drinking water and road facilities problems. However, a public duty is cast on
the District Collector to ensure that neither the quarry operations nor dumping
of the granite wastes cause any environmental hazard.
</p>
<p id="p_25">		13.1.  It is further acknowledged that the quarry operators were
permitted by the Public Works Department to dump the waste in the peripheral non
water spread high level portions of the water bodies so as to protect the bunds
of the water bodies and to prevent cutting of the bunds by the anti social
elements. The District Collector is obligated to oversee that such quarry
operators do not exploit such permission.
</p>
<p id="p_26">		13.2. The proposal of the Executive that the granite waste would be
used for forming the roads in the patta lands, repairing and strengthening the
existing roads in the public interest is of course convincing. However, we add
that such proposal is required to be implemented effectively by entering into
appropriate agreement with the quarry operators.
</p>
<p id="p_27">		14. In the circumstances of the case, suffice it to direct
Respondents 1 to 3 to make periodical inspections of the granite quarrying areas
and ensure Sustainable Development and to give necessary direction from time to
time to the quarry operators to maintain an eco-friendly environment and to
ensure socio-economic growth for a Sustainable Development in the locality,
protecting the rights conferred under Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the
Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_28">		15. With the above observations and directions, this writ petition
is disposed of. No costs. Consequently, the connected M.P(MD)Nos.1 and 2 of 2007
are closed.
