 directions   issued   by   this   Court   in   the   judgment   and   order   dated   2 nd 

 April 2013 and in particular the action plan incorporated in Clause 15 

 thereof. In fact, the order of which modification is sought by this Review 

 Petition notes that repeatedly extension of time was granted to the said 

 Corporation.  The said order notes that time limit provided by the MSW 

 Rules to set up disposal and processing facility in the City of Mumbai 

 expired 12 years prior to the date of the said order.



</p><p id="p_58"> 5.                Civil   Application   No.221   of   2013   was   filed   by   the   said 

 Corporation   for   seeking   extension   of   time   to   comply   with   the   order 

 dated 2nd April 2013. We may note here that in the said order, this Court 

 by relying upon the affidavit filed by the said Corporation on 2 nd March 

 2015 accepted that as of that date, in the City of Mumbai, there was a 

 daily generation of 9,400 Metric Ton (MT) of municipal solid waste and 

 approximately 1,000 MT of construction waste.  The affidavit notes that 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">::: Uploaded on - 05/06/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2017 01:30:09 :::</span>

 the   generation   of   municipal   solid   waste   is   likely   to   touch   10,000   to 

 11,500 MT per day.  The admitted position recorded in the said order is 

 that there is only one proper processing facility in the City situated at 

 Kanjur which has the processing capacity of only 3,000 MT of municipal 

 solid waste per day.  What is recorded in the said order on the basis of 

 the admitted position is that there was a daily generation of 9,400  MT 

 of municipal solid waste in the City and for processing this quantity, 

 there was only one proper facility which has capacity of nearly 3,000 

 MT of solid waste per day.  Thus, quantity of 6,400 MT of solid waste 

 per day was being dumped illegally.  Several assurances were given by 

 the said Corporation by filing an affidavit dated 10 th February 2016 of 

 Shri Ajoy Mehta, the Municipal Commissioner. The assurances are noted 

 in Paragraph 11 of the said order.  One of the assurances noted in the 

 said order was that an additional site will be allotted at Mulund near 

 Airoli Bridge which is an area of 32.77 Hectares. It is recorded therein 

 that the process of demarcation thereof will be completed by the month 

 of April 2016 and thereafter, a compound wall will be constructed.  The 

 assurance given was that by the end of the year 2019, the first phase of 

 waste to energy processing will commence thereon which will take care 

 of the quantity of 2,000 MT per day.  It is also noted that another site is 

 allotted   by   the   State   Government   at   Village   Karvale   Khurd,   Taluka 

 Ambarnath,   District   Thane.     The   order   records   that   the   process   of 

 removal of encroachment on the said site was going on.

                           indicates   that   the   State   Government   is   more

                           the   real   estate   industry.     At  this   stage,   we   must

                           comparison  cannot be made between  the  city of

                            judgment and order of this  Court dated 2nd April 
                            2013 in near future. In fact, during last few years, 
                            the   State   Government   has   amended   DCR 
                            providing   for   grant   of   more   and   more   FSI.   The 
                            State   Government   is   encouraging   unsustainable 
                            growth. Thus, there is a gross breach on the part 
                            of   the   Municipal   Corporation   of   the   statutory 
                            provisions of the MSW Rules. Moreover, there is a 
                            gross breach of the order passed by this Court on 
                            2nd  April 2013 in the PIL. As observed earlier, in
                                                                                          
                            fact, this is a fit case where this Court ought to 
                            have   rejected   the   Application   for   grant   of 
                            extension  of time and initiated penal action under

                           thereby   violating   their   fundamental   rights   under

<p id="p_63">                  24       The consequences of the failure   to abide by the 
                           MSW   Rules   are   writ   large   on   record.  We   have 
                           already made extensive reference in this order to 
                           the   recent   incidents   of   huge   fire   at   Deonar 
                           dumping ground. In the affidavit filed on record 
                           by   Shri   Rajkumar   Sharma   on   behalf   of   the 
                           intervenors, the disastrous   effects of the fire on 
                           the people living in the proximity of the Deonar 
                           site   have   been   brought   on   record.   The   fire 
                           increased   the   pollution   in   the   entire   city   to   an 
                           alarming   level.   Local   residents   were   affected   by 
                           respiratory   deceases.   The   local   Schools   were 
                           required   to   be   kept   closed   for   few   days.   The 
                           learned   senior   counsel   representing   the 
                           intervenors pointed out that even on Saturday, 27th 
                           February   2016   there   was     a   fire   on   the   Deonar 
                           dumping   ground.       The   learned   senior   counsel 
                           further   pointed   out   the   earlier   orders   passed   by 
                           this   Court   and   the   proceedings   of   the   Advisory 
                           Committee   constituted   under   the   orders   of   this 
                           Court in another Writ Petition.   What is recorded 
                           in   the   minutes   of   the   meeting   of   the   Advisory 
                           Committee   appointed   by   this   Court,   which   was 
                           held     way   back   on   3rd  May   2011,   is   very 
                           disturbing.   The   earlier   contractors   who   were 
                           appointed   by   the   Municipal   Corporation   i.e. 
                           M/s.Tatva   Global   Environment   (Deonar)   Limited 
                           pointed out in the meeting that the entire area of 
                           Deonar   dumping   ground   has   been   divided   into 
                           various   zones   by   the     anti-social   elements 
                           operating inside the dumping ground.  It is further 
                           pointed   out   that   the   Closed-Circuit   Television 
                           Cameras (for short "CCTV cameras") installed at 
                           the   site   are   not   working.       There   is   no   police 
                           protection around said site and there are breaches 
                           in the compound wall. We have already observed 
                           in   the   earlier   part   of   this   order   that   the   fire   at 
                           Deonar   dumping   ground   has   posed   a   major 
                           danger   to   the   health   of   the   citizens.   The   Air 
                           Quality Index figures placed on record show that

 and maintenance of the site at Deonar.   The modification/vacation of 

 the directions issued in terms of Clauses (a) and (c) above have been 

 sought by this Review Petition.

<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72"> 10.               We   may   note   here   that   in   this   Review   Petition,   the   said 

 Corporation has filed an affidavit of Shri Siraj Ahmed Abdul Khalique 

 Ansari. If the affidavit is carefully perused, it appears to be an admitted 

 position that it will be impossible for the said Corporation to comply 

 with the directions contained in the order dated 2 nd  April 2013 within 

 the extended time.  The stand taken in Paragraph 15 thereof is that the 

 municipal solid waste  generation  as on the  date of filing of the said 

 affidavit   (i.e.   17th  April   2017)   is   8,600   MT   per   day   which   does   not 

 include the construction waste.  Even if we proceed on the footing that 

 the said statement is correct, then the  only conclusion  which can be 

 drawn is that the quantity of 5,600 MT of solid waste per day is being 

 illegally dumped in the sense that there is only one developed site in 

 the City at Kanjur which has processing capacity of 3,000 MT per day. 

 Interestingly, in the said affidavit, it is now disclosed that as far as the 

 additional   site   at   Mulund   near   Airoli   Bridge   is   concerned,   the   State

 Government could not hand over the possession of the said site as there 

 is   an   ongoing   dispute   between   the   State   Government   and   Salt 

 Commissioner   of   Union   of   India   about   the   title.     Thus,   even 

 demarcation of the said site is not completed.     As regards the site at 

 Village Karavale, near Taloja, what is stated is that a joint measurement 

 of the site is still in progress.  It also records that a part of the land is 

 encroached   upon.   It   is   stated   that   it   is   only   after   removing 

 encroachments   and   after   acquisition   of   private   land   admeasuring   14 

 Hectares   that   necessary   proposal   for   setting   up   facility   of   processing 

 municipal solid waste including construction and demolition material 

 will be processed.

<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74"> 11.               In the said affidavit, the said Corporation has relied upon 

 the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 (for short 

 "the  MSW Rules of 2016") which came into force on 8 th  April 2016. 

 Without even making an Application for seeking extension of time or 

 modification of the order dated 2nd April 2013, there is a vague prayer 

 made in the affidavit-in-reply that a permission be granted to the said 

 Corporation to implement the MSW Rules of 2016.

 with other connected PILs/WPs (PIL No.217 of 2009) which is virtually 

 a   consent   order,   continues   to   operate   and   there   is   a   gross   breach 

 committed by the said Corporation of the directions contained therein. 

 Though technically, the time to comply with the directions has already 

 been extended till 30th June 2017, as noted earlier, the affidavit filed by 

 the said Corporation indicates that compliance will not be made within 

 the time extended by this Court.

</p><p id="p_77"> 13.               The   present   Review   Petition   is   filed   by   the   Maharashtra 

 Chamber of Housing Industry.  The learned senior counsel appearing for 

 the Review Petitioner relied upon the Construction &amp; Demolition and 

 De-silting   Waste   (Management   and   Disposal)   Rules,   2006   (for   short 

 "the   C&amp;D   Disposal   Rules").     He   relied   upon   the   copies   of   various 

 Intimations   of   Disapproval   (IOD)   granted   by   the   said   Corporation 

 showing that the Construction and Demolition Waste (for short "C&amp;D 

 Waste") is not being dumped at Deonar or any other site but is being 

 dumped   at   the   sites   specifically   mentioned   by   the   said   Corporation 

 while   granting   development   permissions.   He   submitted   that   the 

 attention   of   this   Bench   was   not   invited   to   the   provisions   of   C&amp;D 

 Disposal Rules when the order sought to be reviewed was passed.  He 

 also   invited   our   attention   to   the   Construction   and   Demolition   Waste 

 Management Rules, 2016. He submitted that the order dated 2 nd  April 

 2013 has been essentially passed for enforcing the performance of the

 obligation   of   various   Planning   Authorities   under   the   MSW   Rules   of 

 2000.  He invited our attention to the MSW Rules of 2016 which were 

 brought into force on 8th April 2016.  He pointed out that now the MSW 

 Rules are no more in force.   Inviting our attention to Rule 22 which 

 contains time frame for implementation of the MSW Rules of 2016, he 

 urged that the time frame provided therein has not yet expired.   He 

 would, therefore, submit that the very basis of the order sought to be 

 modified does not survive as the MSW Rules of 2000 can no longer be 

 implemented.  He urged that there is no basis for the conclusion drawn 

 by this Court that new construction which may be carried out in the 

 City   will   increase   population   density   and   will   result   into   increase   of 

 generation of solid waste.  He urged that if the constraint imposed on 

 new construction is not removed, the slum dwellers and poor people in 

 the City will not be in a position to acquire the premises in the buildings 

 constructed by the members of the Petitioner.  He submitted that now it 

 is no longer necessary to comply with the provisions of the MSW Rules 

 of 2000.   Lastly, he urged that the order sought to be modified was 

 passed without notice to the persons likely to be affected by the said 

 order.   He urged that C&amp;D waste is not being illegally dumped.   It is 

 being dumped at the sites mentioned in the Development Permissions 

 granted by the said Corporation.

</p><p id="p_80"> 14.               The learned counsel appearing for the Intervenors opposed 

 the prayer made in this Review Petition.  By relying upon the said MSW 

 Rules of 2016, he urged that any omission as regards the compliance 

 with   the   MSW   Rules   of   2000   is   not   saved   by   the   new   Rules   and, 

 therefore,   compliance   with   the   MSW   Rules   of   2000   will   have   to   be 

 made.   The learned senior counsel appearing for the said Corporation 

 invited our attention to the affidavit to which we have already made a 

 reference.  He pointed out the steps taken by the said Corporation for 

 implementation of the orders of this Court. 



</p><p id="p_81"> 15.               We have carefully considered the submissions.  Even if we 

 assume for the sake of argument that the C&amp;D Disposal Rules are being 

 implemented, the same will take care of C&amp;D waste which according to 

 the   stand   taken   by   the   said   Corporation   in   its   affidavit   filed   on   2 nd 

 March   2015   is   approximately   1,000   MT.     As   per   that   affidavit,   the 

 generation of solid waste other than construction waste was 9,400 MT 

 per day.  The stand taken in the affidavit dated 17 th April 2017 to which 

 we   have   made   a   reference   is   that   the   generation   of   municipal   solid 

 waste is approximately 8,600 MT per day.  As we have noted earlier, in 

 terms of the order of this Court and in terms of the MSW Rules, there is 

 only one facility which could take care of quantity of 3,000 MT per day. 

 Therefore,   even   assuming   that   C&amp;D   Disposal   Rules   are   being

 implemented,   quantity   of   5,600   MT   of   Municipal   Solid   Waste 

 (excluding C&amp;D waste) is being illegally dumped every day in the City. 



</p><p id="p_82"> 16.               In Paragraph 24 of our order dated 26 th  &amp; 29th  February 

 2016 to which we have already made a reference, we have noted the 

 consequences of the failure to abide by the order of this Court passed 

 on 2nd April 2013 which is the consent order.  Right to live in a pollution 

 free environment is guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of 

 India. Obviously, one of the objects of passing the order dated 2 nd April 

 2013 was to protect and enforce the said right of citizens.  Even going 

 by the stand taken by the said Corporation, the scenario which emerges 

 today is that the quantity of at least 5,600 MT of solid waste per day is 

 being   illegally   dumped   in   the   City   presumably   at   Deonar   site   which 

 does not comply with the requirements set out in the order of this Court 

 dated 2nd  April 2013 and municipal solid waste as well as the MSW 

 Rules of 2000.
</p>
<p id="p_83">
</p><p id="p_84"> 17.               Therefore, the argument based on C&amp;D Disposal Rules does 

 not   impress   us   at   all   and   the   same   is   not   a   ground   to   modify   the 

 directions issued in the order of this Court. 



</p><p id="p_85"> 18.               Now, we turn to the MSW Rules of 2016 which have been 

 brought into force on 8th  April 2016.   In Civil Application No.221 of 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">::: Uploaded on - 05/06/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2017 01:30:09 :::</span>

 2013, this Court was concerned with the issue of extension for grant of 

 time to comply with the order dated 2nd April 2013.  One of the main 

 basis of the said order is the complete failure of the said Corporation to 

 implement the said directions.   Going by the stand taken by the said 

 Corporation, there is no possibility of the said Corporation completing 

 the implementation of the said directions in near future.  Going back to 

 Clause   15   of   the   minutes   of   the   order,   the   time   frame   provided   for 

 setting up of municipal solid waste processing facility has expired long 

 back.    The  time  frame fixed for  closure  of existing dumping sites as 

 required by the MSW Rules of 2000 has also expired long back.   The 

 argument of the Review Petitioner which represents the builders and 

 developers seems to be that in view of the applicability of MSW Rules of 

 2016, it is not necessary for the said Corporation to comply with the 

 order   of   this   Court   dated   2nd  April   2013   which   has   attained   finality. 

 This argument cannot be accepted.  None of the parties have moved this 

 Court for modification of the order dated 2 nd  April 2013.   Therefore, 

 only on the  basis of the applicability of the MSW Rules of 2016, no 

 modification can be made with the order of this Court.  The directions 

 issued under the order dated 2nd April 2013 have been issued to ensure 

 that the major cities in the State are free from pollution. 



</p><p id="p_86"> 19.               Another   argument   was   that   even   if   the   members   of   the 

 Review Petitioner are permitted to proceed ahead with the construction

 of new buildings, there is no data available to show that it will increase 

 the generation of municipal solid waste per day.   We must note here 

 that the observations made in the order are based on the judicial notice 

 taken by this Court of several factors.  In any case, the said Corporation 

 has not  come  forward to  place  the  data  on  record  to show that the 

 conclusion   drawn   in   the   said   order   is   incorrect   and   that   even   if 

 construction of large number of new buildings is permitted, it will not 

 result into increase in generation of municipal solid waste.   In fact, in 

 the   order   of   this   Court   which   is   sought   to   be   reviewed,   this   Court 

 directed thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">                   "(b)     The   State   Government   and/or   the   Municipal 
                   Corporation shall undertake a scientific assessment of 
                   impact on the generation of the municipal solid waste 
                   including construction waste in the city by construction 
                   of new buildings and new development projects.   The 
                   study shall include the assessment of the impact of the

                   of at least 10 years."

<p id="p_88"> Till today, no such study has been made. Without any such study being 

 made, it is not possible to accept the argument of the Review Petitioner.


</p><p id="p_89"> 20.               An   interesting   feature   of   the   stand   taken   by   the   said 

 Corporation must be noted here.  The said Corporation by relying upon 

 the   Draft   Plan   prepared   by   the   Mumbai   Metropolitan   Regional 

 Development Authority (MMRDA) has come out with a case that the 

 population of the City of Mumbai is likely to increase by 2021 but is

 likely to decrease by the year 2031.  The paragraph 15 of the affidavit 

 reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">                   "15. In the earlier Affidavit filed by MCGM, it has been 
                   stated   on   behalf   of   the   MCGM   that   there   is 
                   approximately 9400 M.T generation of Municipal Solid 
                   Waste per day.   However, gradually with time, due to 
                   decentralization,   segregation   of   dry   waste   and   wet 
                   waste, reduction of debris material mixed with MSW by 
                   way of debris on call system, the MSW generation as on 
                   today is approximately 8600 M.T per day.   Hence the 
                   generation of MSW which is required to be processed in 
                   dumping ground has gradually on the contrary reduced. 
                   The   reduction   of   MSW   is   due   to   the   reasons   stated 
                   hereinabove   which   includes   zonal   collection   and 
                   transport system, steps taken to increase house to house 
                   collection, steps taken to increase segregation at source, 
                   promotion of public awareness for segregation &amp; public 
                   littering and weight management system."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_90"> 21.               Thus,   even   going   by   the   stand   taken   by   the   said 

 Corporation, till the year 2021, the population of the City will grow and 

 there will be only a marginal decrease by 2031.  In fact, it was for the 

 said Corporation to place the data on record which will show that even 

 if   new   construction   activities   in   the   City   are   undertaken,   it   will   not 

 result into generation of more municipal solid waste. 



</p><p id="p_91"> 22.               Very   interesting   argument   was   canvassed   by   the   learned 

 senior counsel appearing for the Review Petitioner.  The argument was 

 that  the  slum  dwellers and  the  poor  people  residing in   the  City  can 

 easily acquire premises in the buildings which may be constructed by 

 the developers and builders in the City of Mumbai and that residential 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">::: Uploaded on - 05/06/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2017 01:30:09 :::</span>

 accommodation in new buildings in the distant suburbs of Mumbai will 

 be available at the cost of approximately Rs.2 lakhs.   We do not think 

 that   any   reasons   are   required   to   be   recorded   for   rejecting   this 

 submission outright.  A judicial notice will have to be taken of the fact 

 that even a single room structure in a slum in a distant suburb in the 

 City may not be available on ownership basis at the said cost. 



</p><p id="p_92"> 23.               Another issue which was canvassed was that there was no 

 notice given to the owners, builders and developers.   This Court was 

 dealing with the Application made by the said Corporation for grant of 

 extension of time.  This Application was adjourned from time to time by 

 passing   ad-interim   orders   of   extension.     It   is   not   possible   for   us   to 

 accept that the members of the Review Petitioner or at least some of 

 them were not aware of the provisions of the MSW Rules of 2000 and 

 the   order   dated   2nd  April   2013.     The   conditions   have   been   imposed 

 while   considering   the   prayer   of   the   said   Corporation   for   grant   of 

 extension of time.   Therefore, there was no occasion to give notice to 

 the developers, builders or owners in the City of Mumbai.  We may note 

 here   that   the   members   of   the   Review   Petitioner   are   builders   and 

 developers. They never came forward to take up the issue of compliance 

 of the MSW Rules of 2000 or orders of this Court.

 which is recorded in the order of which a review is sought in Paragraph

 Secretary   of   the   State   Government   that   the   real   estate   industry   will 

 suffer   if   restrictions   are   imposed   on   the   development.   The   learned 

 counsel appearing for the said Corporation pointed out that nearly 80% 

 to 85% development proposals received by the said Corporation are in 

 respect   of   the   redevelopment   projects.   There   is   no   restriction   or 

 embargo   imposed   by   the   order   of   this   Court   on   permitting   the   re-

 development   projects.   The   building   permissions   which   were   already 

 granted remain unaffected by our order.   Clause (i)(a) of the directions 

 contained in our order dated 2nd April 2013 reads thus:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                  "(a)  The development permissions/IOD shall not 
                  be   granted   by   either   the   said   Municipal 
                  Corporation   or   the   State   Government   on   the 
                  Applications/proposals   submitted   from   1st  March 
                  2016   for   construction   of   new   buildings   for 
                  residential   or   commercial   use   including   Malls, 
                  Hotels and Restaurants. Such Applications shall be 
                  processed,   but   the   IOD   and/or   commencement 
                  certificate  shall not be issued.  It is obvious that in 
                  view of this restraint, no once can take advantage 
                  of deeming provisions in the DCR and MRTP Act. </blockquote><p id="p_95">
</p><p id="p_96">                  Needless to state that this condition will not apply 
                  to   all   the   redevelopment   projects   covered   by   the 
                  clauses (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10) of the DCR 
                  No.33.     This   condition   will   not   apply   to   the 
                  buildings   proposed   to   be   constructed   for   the 
                  hospitals or educational institutions.  The condition 
                  shall not apply for consideration of the proposals 
                  for repairs/reconstruction of the existing buildings
