ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	present appeal under <a href="/doc/1856707/" id="a_1">section 378(4)</a> of the Code of Criminal
	Procedure, 1973, is directed against the judgment and order dated
	14th
	August 2007 passed by the Sessions Judge, Panchmahal at Godhra, in
	Criminal Appeal No.08 of 2007, whereby the learned Judge has set
	aside the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 30th
	March 2007 passed by the learned Judicial
	Magistrate First Class (Joint Court), in Criminal Case No.1437 of
	1993, and acquitted the respondents from the charges levelled
	against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The
	brief facts of the prosecution case is that the respondent No.1 is
	limited Company and respondent Nos.2 to 4 are the Directors of the
	respondent No.1 Company and managing day-to-day affairs of the
	respondent No.1 Company. It is the case of the prosecution that
	without obtaining necessary permission from the Board, the
	respondent No.1 Company discharging 1450 liter polluted water and
	thus the respondents have breached the Consent. It is the case of
	the prosecution that the respondents-accused have breached the
	conditions on which permission was given to the respondents-accused
	to discharge the polluted water and thereby they have violated the
	provisions of <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_2">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_3">25</a> punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_5">44</a>
	and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_6">47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
	It is also the case of the prosecution that when on 02nd
	February 1993 Officials of the Board visited the respondent No.1 as
	per <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_8">Section 23</a> of the Act, it was come to the notice that
	respondents have breached the conditions of the Consent. Therefore,
	notice as per <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> of the Act was issued and sample was
	collected and send the same for analysis to the Board Analyst. On
	examination, it was found that the respondents-accused have breached
	the conditions on which permission was given to the
	respondents-accused to discharge the polluted water and thereby they
	have violated the provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_10">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_11">25</a> punishable under
	<a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_12">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_13">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_14">47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of
	Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. Thereafter, after obtaining necessary
	sanction, complaint has been filed against the respondents-accused.
</p>
<p id="p_3">Thereafter
	the trial was conducted before the learned Magistrate. To prove the
	case of the prosecution, prosecution has examined witnesses and also
	relied upon the documentary evidence. After considering the oral as
	well as documentary evidence, the learned Magistrate by his judgment
	and order dated 30th
	March 2007 held the respondents-accused guilty for violation
	of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_16">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_17">25</a> read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_18">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_19">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_20">47</a> of the Water
	(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and ordered to
	undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and also
	imposed fine of Rs.01,000/- under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_22">Section 43</a> of the Act. The learned
	Magistrate also ordered the respondents-accused to undergo simple
	imprisonment for a period of six months and also imposed fine of
	Rs.01,000/- under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_23">Section 44</a> of the Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">Being
	aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said judgment and order dated
	30th March 2007, the respondents-accused had
	preferred the Criminal Appeal before the Sessions Court. The said
	Appeal was heard by the learned Sessions Judge, Panchmahal at
	Godhra. After hearing the parties, the learned Judge by his judgment
	and order dated 14th August 2007 set aside the judgment
	and order dated 30th March 2007 passed by the learned
	Additional Judicial Magistrate First Class (Joint Court), Halol, in
	Criminal Case No.1437 of 1993 and acquitted the respondents-accused
	from the charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Being
	aggrieved and dissatisfied with the said judgment and order dated
	14th
	August 2007 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Panchmahal at
	Godhra, Gujarat Pollution Control Board through his Assistant Law
	Officer, has preferred the present Criminal Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">I
	have heard Mr.Rituraj Meena, learned counsel for the appellant and
	Mr.Bhavik Shah, learned counsel for Mr.N.V. Gandhi, learned counsel
	for the respondent Nos.2 and 3.  I have also gone through the papers
	produced before me and the judgment and order passed by the Courts
	below.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Mr.Meena
	has taken me through the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the
	documentary evidence and submitted that from the above evidence it
	is established that the prosecution has successfully proved its case
	beyond reasonable doubt. He has contended that the trial Court has
	rightly held the respondents-accused guilty for the offences
	alleged against them and, therefore, the Sessions Court, in Appeal,
	should not have interfered with the said findings of the trial
	Court. He has contended that the learned Sessions Judge has
	committed grave error in disbelieving and discarding the evidence of
	witnesses. He, therefore, contended that the judgment and order
	passed by the learned Sessions Judge setting aside the judgment of
	the trial Court by acquitting the respondents-accused from the
	charges levelled against them, is without appreciating the facts and
	evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_8">It
	is a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the Appellate
	Court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give fresh
	reasonings when the Appellate Court is in agreement with the reasons
	assigned by the trial court acquitting the accused.  In the instant
	case, this Court is in full agreement with the reasons given and
	findings recorded by the trial Court while acquitting the
	respondents-accused and adopting the said reasons and for the
	reasons aforesaid, in my view, the impugned judgment is just, legal
	and proper and requires no interference by this Court at this stage.
	Hence, this appeal requires to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">Even
	in a recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_24">State
	of Goa V. Sanjay Thakran &amp; Anr. Reported</a> in (2007)3 SCC 75,
	the Court has reiterated the powers of the High Court in such cases.
</p>
<p id="p_10">Similar
	principle has been laid down by the Apex Court in the cases of State
	of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Ram Veer Singh &amp; Ors, reported in 2007 AIR
	SCW 5553 and
	in Girja
	Prasad (Dead) by LRs Vs. state of MP, reported in 2007 AIR SCW 5589.
	Thus, the powers
	which this Court may exercise against an order of acquittal are well
	settled.
</p>
<p id="p_11">It
	is also a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the
	appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give
	fresh reasonings, when the reasons assigned by the Court below are
	found to be just and proper. Such principle is laid down by the Apex
	Court in the case of State
	of Karnataka Vs. Hemareddy, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417.
</p>
<p id="p_12">Thus,
	in case the appellate court agrees with the reasons and the opinion
	given by the lower court, then the discussion of evidence is not
	necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_13">I
	have gone through the judgment and order passed by the trial court
	as well as of the Sessions Court. I have also perused the oral as
	well as documentary evidence led before the courts below and also
	considered the submissions made by learned advocate for the
	appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_14">s
	  

The
	Sessions court has, after appreciating the oral as well as
	documentary evidence, has found that prosecution has failed to
	follow provisions of <a href="/doc/657776/" id="a_25">Section 49(1)(a)</a> of the Act. The learned Judge
	has observed that present complainant has no power to file a
	complaint. Even as per the order at Exhibit 54 clearly reveals that
	Chairman of the Board was authorised to file a complaint and he
	cannot sub-delegate his powers. Thus, the complaint filed by the
	Assistant Law Officer is without any authority given to him. It is
	also observed by the learned Judge that prosecution has failed to
	prove that respondent Nos.2 and 3 are managing day-to-day affairs of
	the respondent No.1 Company. The respondent Nos.2 and 3 are residing
	at Mumbai and they are only Directors of the Company and not
	managing day-to-day affairs of the Company. Even prosecution has not
	followed the proper procedure in collecting the sample. The learned
	Sessions Judge has also relied upon the decisions rendered by this
	Court and Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and acquitted the
	respondents-accused.
</p>
<p id="p_15">Thus,
	the appellant could not bring home the charges against the
	respondents-accused in the present appeal. The prosecution has
	miserably failed to prove the case against the respondents-accused.
	 Thus, from the evidence itself it is established that the
	prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_16">Mr.Meena,
	learned counsel for the appellant, is not in a position to show any
	evidence to take a contrary view in the matter or that the approach
	of the Sessions Court is vitiated by some manifest illegality or
	that the decision is perverse or that the trial court has ignored
	the material evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_17">In
	above view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that the
	Sessions Court was completely justified in setting aside the
	judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial Court and
	acquitting the respondents-accused of the charges leveled
	against them. I find that the findings recorded by the Sessions
	Court are absolutely just and proper and in recording the said
	findings, no illegality or infirmity has been committed by it.
</p>
<p id="p_18">I
	am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
	conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the
	Sessions Court and hence find no reasons to interfere with the same.
	Hence the appeal is hereby dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">In
	view of above, present appeal is dismissed. The judgment and order
	dated 14th
	August 2007 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Panchmahal at
	Godhra, in Criminal Appeal No.08 of 2007, acquitting
	the respondents-accused of the charges levelled against them, by
	setting aside the judgment
	and order of conviction dated 30th
	March 2007 passed by the learned Additional Judicial Magistrate
	First Class, in Criminal Case No.1437 of 1993
	holding the respondents-accused guilty of the charges levelled
	against them, is hereby confirmed.  Bail bond, if any, shall stands
	cancelled. Record &amp; Proceedings be sent back to the trial Court,
	forthwith.
