ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	present appeal, under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
	1973, is directed against the judgment and order of acquittal dated
	24.04.1998 passed by the learned  Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
	Ahmedabad, in Criminal  Case No. 1552 of 1991, whereby the learned
	Magistrate has acquitted the respondents - accused from the
	charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">The
	brief facts of the prosecution case is that the respondent No. 1 is
	the company and respondents No.2  to 8 are the Partners of the said
	respondent No.1 - Company. It is alleged that the said company
	is engaged in doing the business of processing and finishing of
	synthetic cloths and discharging the effluent water in river
	Sabarmati and has not constructed the plant for purifying the said
	water prepared without purifying the same. It is alleged that on
	9.5.1981 the authorized Officers of the Board have visited the
	factory of respondent No.1 for inspection, after issuing the notice.
	They have taken the sample water from the said company in presence
	of factory in-charge. It is alleged that after sealing the sample
	the same was sent to the Board Analyst for analysis. It is alleged
	that the Analyst submitted the Report, the copy of which was also
	sent to the company on 18.6.1991 by registered Post and as per the
	said Report it was found that the accused have committed the breach
	of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_2">Section 24</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">25</a> of the Water Act and, therefore, they are
	responsible for the offences under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_5">44</a> read with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_6">Section
	47</a> of the Water Act. Thereafter, after obtaining sanction complaint
	has been filed against the respondents - accused. Thereafter,
	the trial was conducted against the respondents - accused. The
	trial Court examined the witnesses and also considered
	the documentary evidence led before it and after considering the
	documentary as well as oral evidence has acquitted the respondents -
	accused from the charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_3">It
	was contended by learned Advocate Mr. Sunil Mehta for the appellant
	that  the judgment and order of the learned Magistrate is not
	proper, legal and it is erroneous. He has also contended that the
	learned Magistrate has not considered the evidence of the witnesses.
	He has contended that the Board Officers have followed the rules
	prescribed by law and the Officer of the Board have also followed
	the procedure of taking the sample. The sample was seized and sealed
	properly. Yet, the learned Magistrate has not considered the
	evidence of prosecution. Therefore, the order impugned in this
	appeal passed by the learned Magistrate requires to be quashed and
	set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Learned
	Advocate, appearing for the respondents - original accused, 
	have supported the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the
	trial Court and contended that the trial Court has rightly acquitted
	the respondents - accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">It
	is a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the Appellate
	Court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give fresh
	reasonings when the Appellate Court is in agreement with the reasons
	assigned by the trial court acquitting the accused.  In the instant
	case, this Court is in full agreement with the reasons given and
	findings recorded by the trial Court while acquitting the
	respondents- accused and adopting the said reasons and for the
	reasons aforesaid, in my view, the impugned judgment is just, legal
	and proper and requires no interference by this Court at this stage.
	From the perusal of record it appears that the prosecution has not
	followed Rules framed by the Board, which is mandatory and,
	therefore, there is no question to entertain this Appeal. Hence,
	this appeal requires to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Even
	in a recent decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/585040/" id="a_7">State
	of Goa V. Sanjay Thakran &amp; Anr. Reported</a> in (2007)3 SCC 75,
	the Court has reiterated the powers of the High Court in such cases.
	In para 16 of the said decision the Court has observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_7">"16.
</p><p id="p_8">	From the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that while exercising
	the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal the Court of
	appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal
	unless the approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest
	illegality and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by
	any reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be
	characterized as perverse. Merely because two views are possible,
	the Court of appeal would not take the view which would upset the
	judgment delivered by the Court below. However, the appellate court
	has a power to review the evidence if it is of the view that the
	conclusion arrived at by the Court below is perverse and the Court
	has committed a manifest error of law and ignored the material
	evidence on record. A duty is cast upon the appellate court, in such
	circumstances, to re-appreciate the evidence to arrive to a just
	decision on the basis of material placed on record to find out
	whether any of the accused is connected with the commission of the
	crime he is charged with."
</p>
<p id="p_9">Similar
	principle has been laid down by the Apex Court in the cases of State
	of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Ram Veer Singh &amp; Ors, reported in 2007 AIR
	SCW 5553 and
	in Girja
	Prasad (Dead) by LRs Vs. state of MP, reported in 2007 AIR SCW 5589.
	Thus, the powers which this Court may exercise against an order of
	acquittal are well settled.
</p>
<p id="p_10">It
	is also a settled legal position that in acquittal appeal, the
	appellate court is not required to re-write the judgment or to give
	fresh reasonings, when the reasons assigned by the Court below are
	found to be just and proper. Such principle is laid down by the Apex
	Court in the case of State
	of Karnataka Vs. Hemareddy, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417,
	wherein,
	it is held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_11">"...
</p><p id="p_12">This court
has observed in Girija Nandini Devi V.
</p><p id="p_13">Bigendra Nandini Chaudhary (1967)1 SCR 93:
(AIR 1967 SC 1124) that
it is not the duty of the appellate court
when it agrees with the view of the trial court on the evidence
to repeat the narration of the evidence or to
reiterate the reasons given by the trial court expression
of general agreement with the reasons given by the Court the decision
of which is under appeal, will ordinarily suffice."
</p>
<p id="p_14">Thus,
	in case the appellate court agrees with the reasons and the opinion
	given by the lower court, then the discussion of evidence is not
	necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_15">I
	have gone through the judgment and order passed by the trial court.
	I have also perused the oral as well as documentary evidence led by
	the trial court and also considered the submissions made by learned
	Advocates for the parties. The trial Court has found that while
	taking the sample panchnama was not prepared in presence of any
	independent witness. The trial Court has also found that there is
	clear braech of provision of Rule 27. The trial Court has also
	clearly observed that the Board Officers have not followed the
	mandatory provisions of the Act and the Rules while collecting the
	sample.  The trial Court has clearly found that the  prosecution has
	failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Even in the
	present appeal, nothing is produced or pointed out to rebut the
	conclusion of the trial Court. Thus, from the evidence itself it is
	established that the prosecution has not proved its case beyond
	reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_16">Mr
	Sunil Mehta learned Advocate  for the appellant is not in a position
	to show any evidence to take a contrary view of the matter or that
	the approach of the trial court is vitiated by some manifest
	illegality or that the decision is perverse or that the trial court
	has ignored the material evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_17">In
	the above view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that
	the trial court was completely justified in acquitting the
	respondent of the charges leveled against him.
</p>
<p id="p_18">I
	find that the findings recorded by the trial court are absolutely
	just and proper and in recording the said findings, no illegality or
	infirmity has been committed by it.
</p>
<p id="p_19">I
	am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
	conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the
	court below and hence find no reasons to interfere with the same.
	Hence the appeal is hereby dismissed. R &amp; P to be sent back to
	the trial Court, forthwith. Bail bond, if any, stands cancelled.
