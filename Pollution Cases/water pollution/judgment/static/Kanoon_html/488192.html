ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre>
<p id="p_1">The
	present acquittal Appeal has been filed by the appellant ? 
	Assistant Law Officer under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal
	Procedure, against the Judgment and order 13th January,
	1998, rendered in Criminal Case No. 2238 of 1991, by the learned
	Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Valsad, whereby the learned
	Magistrate has acquitted all the accused from the offences charged
	against them.
</p>
<p id="p_2">It
	is the case of the appellant ?  original complainant that as
	Assistant Law officer in Gujarat Pollution Control Board he was
	authorized to prosecute the persons who commit the breach of the
	provision of <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention of Control of
	Pollution) Act, 1974 (for short ?Sthe Water Act??). The respondent
	No.1 is a limited company and the respondents No.2 to 6 are the
	Directors  of the said respondent No.1 ?  Company. The respondent
	No.1 company was running the industry of Sodium Hydro, Zinc
	Hydrokside, Liquid Sulfur, etc. and for that purpose the company is
	using castic Soda, Sulfur, Soda Ash, etc. as raw-material and for
	that purpose they were using the water and discharging about 45,000
	ltrs. water and the respondents were discharging the said polluted
	water out side in open place without purification. The respondents
	have obtained permission from the Gujarat Water Pollution Control
	Board (for short ?SGPCB??). However, the GPCB has vide order dated
	25.5.1989 has rejected the application dated 5.4.1989 made by the
	respondent No.1 for getting the consult. The Officer of the Board
	has visited the company premises of respondent No.1 on 14.12.1990
	and issued the notice getting sample. The sample was taken in
	presence of Supervisor of the company and the same was sent to the
	Analyst. After examining the Analyst found that  the respondents are
	discharging the effluent/polluted water and thereby they have
	committed the offence punishable under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>. Thereupon the
	complainant filed Complaint under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_4">Sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">25</a> read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_6">Sections
	43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_7">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_8">47</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">The
	learned JMFC framed the charge Ex.82 against the accused. Thereafter
	the evidence was led and after hearing the parties the learned
	Magistrate came to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to
	establish its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted all the
	accused from the charges levelled against them.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Being
	aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said Judgment and order dated
	13.1.1998 rendered by the learned JMFC, Kadi, in Criminal Case No.
	2238 of 1991, the appellant has preferred this Appeal, in the
	capacity of the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Heard
	learned APP Ms. Mita Panchal for the State and learned Senior
	Advocate Mr. M.B. Gandhi on behalf of the respondents ?  original
	accused.
</p>
<p id="p_6">It
	is contended by learned APP that the Judgment and order of the trial
	Court is against the provision of law; the trial Court has not
	properly considered the evidence led by the prosecution and looking
	to the provisions of law itself it is established that the
	prosecution has proved the whole ingredients of the evidence against
	the present respondents. Learned APP has also read the oral as well
	as the documentary evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">On
	behalf of the respondents ?  accused learned Senior Advocate Mr.
	Gandhi has contended that the matter is very old. He has also
	contended that from the evidence itself it appears that the
	prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and
	has failed to prove the allegation made against the present
	respondents. He has also contended that the prosecution has not
	produced any iota of evidence to connect present respondents in the
	said offence. He has also read the Report of the Expert and
	contended that the trial Court has considered all the relevant
	aspects of the matter as well as documentary and oral evidence and
	after considering all the aspects of the matter the trial Court has
	acquitted all the accused.  Lastly, he contended that the learned
	Magistrate has assigned cogent reason and after fully appreciating
	the evidence the learned Magistrate has rightly acquitted the
	accused from the offences charged against them.
</p>
<p id="p_8">I
	have gone through the Judgment and order passed by the learned
	Magistrate. I have also perused the oral as well as documentary
	evidence led before the trial Court and also considered the
	submissions made by the learned Counsel for the respective parties.
	From the evidence itself it is established that the prosecution has
	not proved its prima facie case beyond reasonable doubt. When the
	prosecution has failed to establish its case against the accused
	then the accused are entitled to get the benefit of doubt and there
	is no reason to interfere with the reasons assigned by the learned
	Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_9">It
	is settled legal position that in acquittal Appeal the appellate
	Court is not required to re-write the Judgment or to give fresh
	reasonings when the reasons assigned by the trial Court acquitting
	the accused. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of STATE OF
	KARNATAKA v/s. HEMAREDDY, reported in AIR 1981 SC 1417,
	has observed that when the Appellate Court agrees with the reasons
	and the opinion given by the lower Court then the re-discussion of
	evidence is not necessary. In the instant case, this Court is in
	full agreement with the reasons given and findings recorded by the
	trial Court while acquitting the respondents ?  accused and
	adopting the said reasons and for the reasons aforesaid, in my view,
	the impugned Judgment is just, legal and proper and requires no
	interference by this Court at this stage. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">In
	view of above discussion, I see no reason to interfere with the
	findings arrived at by the trial Court. Hence, this Appeal requires
	to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">In
	the result, the Appeal is hereby dismissed. The impugned Judgment
	and order dated 13.1.1998 passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Valsad, in
	Criminal Case No. 2238 of 1991 acquitting the respondents ? 
	accused, is hereby confirmed. Bail bonds, if any, shall stands
	cancelled.
