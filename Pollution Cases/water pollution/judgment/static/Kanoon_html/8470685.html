</p><p id="p_7">    i) Brief reasons for the just decision of the case:
</p>
<p id="p_8">Succinctly stated, the facts of the prosecution case are that the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in 'Maili Yamuna' case has directed to stop the polluting industries
from operating in the NCT of Delhi. Accordingly, all the water polluting units
located in industrial and non-conforming areas of Delhi were directed through
public notices in Newspapers on 15/16th September, 1999 and 14th October, 1999
to put up individual effluent treatment plant for treating their effluent prior to
discharging it on or before 1st November, 1999 so as to meet the prescribed
standard of Central Pollution Control Board. On 02.03.2000, the Vigilance Squad
constituted by the Govt., of NCT of Delhi and the team of Environment Engineers
of Delhi Pollution Control Committee found discharge of untreated effluents in the
factories of the accused persons and therefore, sealed their factories. On
16.04.2000, the then SDM received a telephonic call that the above stated factories
which had been sealed on the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
have started functioning illegally. Therefore, the present FIR bearing no.85/2000
was registered against the accused persons and the investigation was carried out.
</p>
<p id="p_9">After completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was filed before the court.
Consequently, the accused persons were summoned to face the trial and

<a href="/doc/924837/" id="a_6">State vs. Ved Prakash &amp; Anr</a>

the copies of documents, relied upon by the prosecution, were supplied to them as
per the norms.
</p><p id="p_10">Thereafter, the charge u/sec 188/284 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> and sec. 41 Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 was framed against the accused persons to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p><p id="p_11">However, during the course of trial, accused-Sunder Singh expired therefore
proceedings against him were dropped as 'abated'.
With a view to connect the accused Ved Prakash with the crime, the prosecution
has examined as many as three witnesses.
</p><p id="p_12">PW1/ASI Sunita Kumari was the duty officer who recorded the formal FIR
bearing no. 85/2000/Ex. PW1/A.
</p><p id="p_13">PW2/Head Constable Brij Pal has proved the DD Entry No. 28A dated 15.04.2000
as Ex.PW2/A.
</p><p id="p_14">PW3/Constable Vinod Kumar had accompanied the IO during the investigation.
He took the rukka to the Police Station and got the FIR registered against the
accused persons. After registration of the FIR, he came back at the spot and
handed over the original rukka and the FIR to the IO. Thereafter, IO arrested the
accused persons and conducted the personal search vide personal search memo
Ex.PW3/A and Ex.PW3/B respectively.
</p><p id="p_15">However, the ld. Counsel for the accused Ved Prakash, in the midst of the
prosecution evidence, has moved an application on behalf of the accused to plead
guilty.
</p><p id="p_16">It is no more res-integra that an accused can plead guilty at any stage of trial and in
this regard reference may be made to the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in the case of State of Maharashtra etc vs. Sukhdeo Singh and

 State vs. Ved Prakash &amp; Anr

 Anr 1992 AIR 2100=1992 SCR (3) 480.
</p><p id="p_17"> I have explained the consequences of pleading guilty and the allegations leveled by
 the prosecution in vernacular to the accused, however, the accused has reiterated
 his plea of guilt and has stated that he is pleading guilty without any force,
 pressure or undue influence and that he has understood the allegations.
 I am of the considered view that the accused has understood the nature of the
 allegations levelled against him and that plea of guilt is made voluntarily without
 any pressure or undue influence after understanding the allegations, hence the
 same is accepted. Accordingly, the accused Ved Prakash, in view of the
 statements recorded separately, is held guilty and convicted for the offence
 charged with. Let the convict be heard on the quantum of sentence.

Present: Ld. APP for the State.

<p id="p_20">            Convict in person with Counsel Shri Rajender Kumar.
</p>
<p id="p_21">ORDER ON SENTENCE

Ld. Counsel for the convict has submitted that a lenient view may be taken in the
matter of sentence as he is the first time offender; is repenting for his act; has
already suffered much agony on account of protracted trial and Damocles' Sword
has been hanging on his head for about fourteen years.
</p>
<p id="p_22">Per contra, it is submitted by the ld. APP for the State that considering the nature
and gravity of the offence, which he had committed, he does not deserve any
leniency or sympathy from the court.
</p>
<p id="p_23">I have heard the arguments and perused the file very carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_24">While I agree that water pollution is a serious offence which must be visited with
exemplary punishment. But in the instant case, the offence was committed in the
year 2000 i.e., more than fourteen years ago and the convict is repenting for his
act. Further, there is nothing on record to suggest that he is a previous convict and
has committed any other offence whatsoever. Therefore, keeping in view the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FIR No. 85/2000                                                         Page No. 5 of 6</span>

totality of the facts and circumstances in his favour, coupled with the reasons
aforementioned, this court has no hesitation to conclude that the convict deserves
leniency in the matter of sentence. The ends of justice would be met if he
sentenced as under:
