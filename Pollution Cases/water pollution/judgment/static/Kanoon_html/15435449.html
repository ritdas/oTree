<p id="p_6">           2.       An objection has been raised by the Respondent No. 2 i.e. Chhattisgarh State

           Power Distribution Co. Ltd that they have only complied with the direction which has

           been issued to them to disconnect the electricity under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_1">Section 37</a> of the Air

           (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/1330791/" id="a_3">Section 41</a> of the Water

           (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.

</p><p id="p_7">           3.       It is further submitted that if the main order of the Pollution Control Board has

           not been put to challenge, then this petition is not maintainable.

</p><p id="p_8">           4.       Perusal of the petition shows that no challenge has been made to the order by

           Chhattisgarh Environment Protection Board. Under the circumstances when no relief

           was claimed, the Electricity Board has only complied with the direction of the

           Environmental Board which is the main order. Therefore, no substantial relief can be

           granted.
</p>
<p id="p_9">           5.       The petitioner shall be at liberty to challenge the order passed by the

           Chhattisgarh Environment Protection Board, if so advised and take appropriate steps

           available to him under the Act of 1981 or Act of 1974.

</p><p id="p_10">           6.       With such observations, the petition stands disposed of.
