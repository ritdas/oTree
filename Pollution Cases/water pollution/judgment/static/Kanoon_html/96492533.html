submits that true it is that by virtue of death of the

respondent, material part of cause of action has come to an

end for all practical purposes however for the sake of

name, properitor firm remains in existence against whom

action can be continued.

submits that entire partnership as such has also come to an

end and nothing is surviving on behalf of the partnership

also on the scene of occurrence.

this court, nothing survives in the matter against the
