                      health hazardous to the public. There is no separate provision made in any

                      the second respondent, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Chennai, has

                      not issued any licence to any hospital or any individual to treat Bio-Medical

                      Waste, it is obvious that Bio-Medical Waste are treated against the

                      provisions, causing serious threat to the environment and health of the

                      public at large. In view of non-usage of authorised persons, who have

                      licence to treat soiled linens, there is so much of health hazards.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                      Unauthorised washing of these linens/clothes is exposed to danger, as

                      washing is done in public water bodies and that the water gets

                      contaminated with the untreated Bio-Medical Waste. The water so

                      contaminated can very well categorised as chemical liquid waste and all

                      these contamination stand in contravention of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>, but also

                      invites health hazards to humans.

                      not well informed of the impact of washing soiled linen, whereas all the

                      hospitals are well informed and educated with respect to the impact of

                      treating the soiled linen. The hospitals are not caring about the impacts, for

                      the simple reason of the cost cutting factors alone. It is also a matter of

                      concern, as water is also mixed with the drainage and effluents which

                      contain toxicants, pathogens, and is at the risk of causing numerous health

                      hazards to humans. The impact of the effluent from washing of soiled linen

                      would contain Bio-Medical Waste and pose a direct threat to life of people

                      at large. Since the rules framed, which according to the petitioner, are not

                      implemented, the present writ petition is filed.
