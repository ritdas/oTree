ORAL
ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.	Draft
amendment granted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.	This
petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
for quashing the Criminal Case No. 4531 of 1992 is filed by the
applicants on the ground that ingredients as required under <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_2">Section
47</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 are
not satisfied and further private complainant who happened to be an
officer of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board has not averred about
the manner and method of involvement of the applicants who are
Directors of the Company in day to day business.  Besides, the
applicant No.1 is aged 80 years, applicant No. 2 is aged 85 years,
applicant No.3 is aged 77 years, applicant No.4 is aged 71 years and
applicant No.5 is aged 55 years.  At such an advance stage of their
life they may not be subjected to criminal prosecution particularly,
when the trial has not progressed so far and only one witness is
examined and that witness has also deposed to the extent of no
liability of the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.	Mr.
</p><p id="p_4">Nitin Amin, learned advocate for the applicants has placed reliance
on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/832836/" id="a_4">National Small
Industries Corporation Limited v. Harmeet Singh Paintal &amp; Anr</a>.
[(2010) 3 SCC 330], <a href="/doc/672341/" id="a_5">Saroj Kumar Poddar v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>)
[(2007) 3 SCC 693], <a href="/doc/14901187/" id="a_6">Central Bak of India v. Asian Global Limited and
Ors</a>. [(2010) 11 SCC 203] and <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_7">K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. Vora</a> [(2009) 10 SCC
48] all arising out of proceedings undertaken under
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_8">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> and provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Section 138</a> read with
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_10">Section 141</a> of the above Act and submitted that the applicants being
Director and against them sufficient averments are not made as
required under the section namely <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_11">Section 47</a> of the Act, and that the
trial has taken inordinate time, it amounts nothing but abuse of
process of law and proceedings made as prayed in this petition be
quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.	Upon
hearing learned advocate for the applicants, I am not persuaded by
any of the submissions of learned advocate for the applicants on the
ground that the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974
is enacted with an object to provide for the prevention and control
of water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness
of water, for the establishment, with a view to carrying out the
purposes aforesaid, of Boards for the prevention and control of water
pollution, for conferring on an assigning to such Boards powers and
functions relating thereto and for matters connected therewith. 
Thus, provisions made for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution
and maintaining and restoring of wholesomeness of pure water/ natural
reserve as object and reasons of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.	The
said act however defines provisions pertaining to pollution in
definition clause 2(e) which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_7">"2(3)
"pollution" means such contamination of water or such
alternation of the physical, chemical or biological properties of
water or such discharge of any sewage or trade effluent or of any
other liquid, gaseous or solid substance into water (whether directly
or indirectly) as may, or is likely to, create a nuisance or render
such water harmful or injurious to public health or safety, or to
domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural or other legitimate
uses, or to the life and health of animals or plants or of aquatic
organisms;"
</p>
<p id="p_8">	It
further defines stream and trade effluent in <a href="/doc/49437879/" id="a_13">Sections 2(f)</a> and <a href="/doc/116131139/" id="a_14">2(k)</a>
as under:
</p>
<p id="p_9">"2(j)
"stream" includes-
</p>
<p id="p_10">river;
</p>
<p id="p_11">water
	course(whether flowing or for the time being dry);
</p>
<p id="p_12">inland
	water (whether natural or artificial);
</p>
<p id="p_13">sub-terranean
	waters;
</p>
<p id="p_14">sea
	or tidal waters to such extent or, as the case may be, to such point
	as the State Government may, by notification in the Official
	Gazette, specify in this behalf;"
</p>
<p id="p_15">2(k)
"trade effluent" includes any liquid, gaseous or solid
substance which is discharged from any premises used for carrying on
any [industry, operation or process, or treatment and disposal
system] other than domestic sewage."
</p>
<p id="p_16">6.	In
the backdrop of above definition about pollution, stream and trade
effluent, the complainant alleged breach of <a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_15">Section 24</a>  pertaining to
"Prohibition on use of stream or well for disposal of polluting
matter" and <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_16">Section 25</a> pertains to "restrictions on new
outlets and new discharges" which has vide coverage and
empowers the competent authority to enter and inspect the plant, the
factory premises and to take action envisaged under the Act.  If
<a href="/doc/185025414/" id="a_17">Section 47</a> pertaining to offence by Companies is seen it reads as
under:
</p>
<p id="p_17">" 47.
</p><p id="p_18">Offences by Companies.- (1) Where an offence under this Act
has been committed by a company, every person who at the time the
offence was committed was in charge of, and was responsible to the
company for the conduct of, the business of the company, as well as
the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be
liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	Provided
that nothing contained in this sub-section shall render any such
person liable to any punishment provided in this Act if he proves
that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he
exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such
offence.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">	(2)</span>
<p id="p_20">Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where an
offence under this Act has been committed by a company and it is
proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or
connivance of, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any
director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such
director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to
be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against
and punished accordingly."
</p>
<p id="p_21">7.	Provisio
to <a href="/doc/113448045/" id="a_18">section 47(1)</a> casts a duty upon the accused to prove his case
before the competent Court that the offence was committed without his
knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the
commission of such offence.  The cases recorded by learned advocate
for the applicants are all arising out of provisions of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_19">Negotiable
Instruments Act</a> and so far as the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1617659/" id="a_20">Santosh
De v. Archna Guha &amp; Ors</a>. [1994 CRI. L.J. 1975] is
concerned it was a case of public servant alleged to have possessed
disproportionate assets to tune of Rs.2,00,000/- and the trial had
taken inordinate delay of 14 years.  In the above circumstances, the
Apex Court held that powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_21">Section 482</a> of the Code can be
exercised.  So far as decision relied on in the case of <a href="/doc/1373066/" id="a_22">Jagdish
Chandra v. State of Rajasthan</a> [1999 CRI.L.J. 1090], <a href="/doc/1003822/" id="a_23">Herald Stephen
Benson v. State of M.P</a>. [1988 CRI.L.J. 1008] and <a href="/doc/996002/" id="a_24">Kanak Mal v. State
of Rajasthan</a> [1999 CRI.L.J. 1091] have no doubt persuasive
value but have no binding force.
</p>
<p id="p_22">8.	That,
there is nothing on the record which would go to show that the
hearing of the case was adjourned under what circumstances and
whether the accused if required to remain present and answer summons
issued by the Court below.  It is also not the case of the applicants
that they were non-executive or nominated Directors of the Company
and prima facie, reading of the complaint as a whole would disclose
that the applicants were responsible for administration and control
of the affairs of the Company and the discharge of effluents due to
manufacturing of sulphur and such chemicals were causing pollution as
defined under the Act.  Since prima facie the case of the complainant
is based on the breach of the order passed by the Gujarat Pollution
Control Board and also under <a href="/doc/1141392/" id="a_25">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1339273/" id="a_26">25</a> of the Act, at this
stage I am not inclined to interfere with the proceedings pending
before the Court of learned Magistrate and interest of justice will
be served if the trial Court is directed to hear the case as
expeditiously as possible.
</p>
<p id="p_23">9.	Considering
the above facts and circumstances and provisio of <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_27">Section 47(1)</a> of
the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_28">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and further
the arguments canvassed by learned advocate for the applicants are in
realm of defence that can be taken care by the concerned Court while
trying the case and with a direction to the Court of learned J.M.F.C
to dispose of the case within three months of the receipt of writ,
order or direction.  Order accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_24">10.
	Having no merit, this petition is dismissed with no order as to
costs.
