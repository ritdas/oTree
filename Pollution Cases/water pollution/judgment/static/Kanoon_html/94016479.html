</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             Case of complainant namely Delhi Pollution Control
             Committee (in short "DPCC") in brief is that on

              complainant and area SDM washing of screens used
             for printing was going on and the untreated trade
             effluent of the same was discharged in violation of
             <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_8">Section 24</a> of the Water Act and accused were doing
             the aforesaid acts without consent of board as

             discharging the trade effluent directly/indirectly
             permitting the polluting matter to enter into
             stream/sewer or on land without installing Effluent
             Treatment Plant (ETP)
</blockquote><p id="p_3">3.       Challenge to the impugned judgment by Ld. Counsel for the
petitioner was on the ground that no sample of water was lifted and
analyzed because the unit in question was not a water discharging unit. It
was pointed out that after two months of the petitioner's conviction, the
respondent had allowed the petitioner to function from the premises in
question. It was pointed out that SPAN Consultant Pvt. Ltd. of the
respondent had given the report of 12th May, 2000 to the effect that the
petitioner's units is not a water polluting unit. So, it was submitted that
the conviction and sentence awarded to the petitioner deserves to be set
aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.       On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondent supported the
impugned judgment and submitted that the petitioner was running a
textile printing industry. It was submitted that certificate of 12th May,
2000 (Annexure P-7) is of no avail as the inspection was done in the
instant case on 21st February 2000. It was further submitted that petitioner
was found to be using water for washing screens. It was next submitted
that non-lifting of the samples is not fatal to the prosecution because use

 of the water for screen printing and its discharge into a sewage is
established from the evidence of CW-1, CW-2 and CW-3. Attention of
this Court has been drawn to paragraph No. 26 of the impugned order
which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "26.      CW-1, CW-2 and CW-3 were member of the
           vigilance squad who inspected the unit of appellant
           (M/s Anupam Prints) on 21st February, 2000. They all
           deposed regarding inspection report of said unit which
           is Ex.CW-1/4. The appellant has admitted the factum of
           inspection of his unit i.e. M/s Anupam Prints. All the
           three complainant witnesses have categorically
           deposed that during the inspection, they found that said
           unit was engaged in activity of textile printing without
           mandatory consent under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a> and without
           installing an ETP for treating the effluent and same
           was discharging the untreated effluent. In this regard,
           CW-1 has deposed that accused are running unit
           without obtaining mandatory consent under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water
           Act</a> and without installation of effluent treatment plant
           for treating the effluent and discharging untreated
           effluent. CW-2 has deposed that unit was engaged in
           the water activity of textile printing without obtaining
           mandatory consent under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a> and
           without installing an ETP to treat the waste water
           generated by the unit, thereby causing water pollution
           contravening the provisions of the said Acts apart from
           the orders of Hon'ble Supreme Court. CW-3 has
           deposed that unit was operating without effluent
           treatment plant and untreated trade effluent was being
           discharged. And when and wherever, they were given
           suggestion in their respective cross-examination by the
           learned counsel for appellant that unit was dry and
           thinner was being used therein and it was not
           discharging, they denied the said suggestions. The
           inspection report (Ex.CW-1/4) is having signature of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CRL.REV.P. 510/2018                                                   Page 3 of 6</span>
            son of appellant namely Anil Bidhuri (DW-1) and one
           Dev Vrat Mishra. All the three complainant witnesses'
           specifically deposed that Dev Vrat Mishra is
           representative/employee of the appellant. DW-1 who is
           the son of the accused, had admitted his signature on
           inspection report Ex.CW-1/4 and on sealing order
           Ex.CW-1/5. It is clearly mentioned in said inspection
           report that "no ETP installed to treat the trade
           effluent. washing of screen used for printing ongoing of
           without an ETP". In column of "whether water
           polluting or non-polluting as per inspection" of said
           inspection report, "water polluting" phrase/word is
           clearly mentioned. CW-3 has denied the suggestion
           that in the inspection report words "water polluting"
           and "going on" were wrongly mentioned. It is clearly
           found mentioned in the testimony of all the three
           complainant witnesses and inspection report (Ex.CW-
           1/4) that unit was engaged/running and discharging
           untreated effluent or said unit was water polluting or
           washing of screens used for printing going on without
           ETP. In respect of source of water in or around the
           unit different stand/defence has been taken by
           appellant. In his statement under Section 313 of the
           Code, appellant has stated that only source of water
           was from DJB supply which used to come in very
           limited quantity that too for domestic purposes.
           Whereas, son of appellant namely Anil Bidhuri (DW-1)
           testified in his cross-examination that there was no
           drainage system in his house and there was no tank in
           the unit; that there is no toilet also in his house and
           unit and people used to go outside for the same; that
           the water for the drinking purpose was to be brought
           from outside in cane; that there was no source of water
           supply in the premises where the unit was situated
           however, there was a hand pump outside the premises
           from where used to be brought in. Hence, as per
           appellant, source of water in unit was from DJB supply

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CRL.REV.P. 510/2018                                                   Page 4 of 6</span>
            whereas his witness (DW-1) testified that there was no
           source of water supply in the premises where the unit
           was situated however, there was a hand pump outside
           the premises. In case of M/s Sri Durga Glass Works
           (supra), Hon'ble Allahabad High Court observed that
           no industry can exist without water. The judgment
           relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant
           i.e., M/s N.P.N. Nachiammal Achi is not applicable in
           the present case because in para number 9 of the
           complainant, the specific place of discharge is
           mentioned. It is stated in said para that by discharging
           the untreated effluent from his industrial unit into a
           drain sewer causing a severe pollution."
</blockquote><p id="p_5">5.     Learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon Supreme Court's
decision in Gujarat Pollution Control Board Vs. NICOSULF Industries &amp;
Exports (P) Ltd. (2009) 2 SCC 171, where samples were not lifted from a
unit which had permission to run the unit and the acquittal under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_16">Section
24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_17">25</a> of The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974
was upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     Counsel for the respondent submits that the petitioner's unit was
running without consent whereas in Gujarat Pollution Control Board
(supra), the unit was running with consent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     After having heard learned counsel for the parties and on scrutiny
of the impugned judgment and the evidence on record, I find that non-
lifting of samples of water for analysis is not fatal to the case of the
respondent as it is evident from the Inspection Report of 21 st February,
2000 that no effluent treatment plant was installed by petitioner to treat
the effluent.     Since petitioner was engaged in the activity of textile

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CRL.REV.P. 510/2018                                                   Page 5 of 6</span>
 printing, without any mandatory consent under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water Act</a>, therefore,
reliance placed upon Supreme Court's decision in Gujarat Pollution
Control Board (supra), is of no avail as in the said decision, the
mandatory consent was obtained.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     In the face of evidence of CW-1, CW-2 and CW-3, who were
members of the vigilance squad of the inspection team, I find that the
conviction and the sentence awarded to petitioner cannot be faulted with.
Reliance placed by petitioner's counsel upon certificate of 12th May,
2000 (Annexure P-7) is of no assistance to the case of petitioner as the
inspection in question was done on 21st February, 2000. De-sealing of
petitioner's premises later on cannot be a ground to upset the conviction
and the sentence awarded to petitioner as the conduct of petition has to be
seen on the date of the inspection and the subsequent conduct cannot be
taken into consideration. A bare perusal of the impugned order reveals
that the trial court has meticulously examined and analyzed the evidence
led and has thereafter rightly concluded that petitioner is guilty of the
offences with which he has been charged. The sentence awarded to
appellant also appears to be just and adequate.

<p id="p_9">9.     Finding no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order, this
petition is accordingly dismissed while vacating the interim order of 29 th
May, 2018.
