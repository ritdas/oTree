                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Convicted   accused    is   in   revision   against   the

judgment and Criminal Appeal in 48/2005 on the file of

Sessions Judge, Bangalore Rural rejecting it and affirming

conviction of the petitioner for the offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_1">Section 44</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 as recorded by the Trial Court in

C.C.No.2154/2002.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2. Heard Mr.Mylaraiah, learned counsel for the

petitioner and Mr.D.Nagaraj, learned counsel for the

respondent and perused the records in supplementation.


</p><p id="p_4">     3. A perusal of the records reveals, Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board through its Deputy Environment

Officer A.Udaykumar initiated prosecution of the petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>



through a complaint under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_3">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C., On

material allegations that the petitioner, a proprietary

concern in the name of Mamatha Mosaic Tiles is owned by

Y.B.Basavarajappa and is engaged in manufacturing of

mosaic tiles using raw materials such as cement, jelly

powder in its manufacturing unit at Site No.34 carved out

of Sy.Nos.7 &amp; 8 of Hessaraghatta Main Road near Saptagiri

Engineering      College,   Chikkasandra,     Bangalore   Rural

District.   It has commenced such manufacturing activity

without obtaining prior consent of the Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board (for short 'the Board').            The

complainant-Board received complaint that the unit is

engaged     in   such   manufacture   using    stone   polishing

machines, which emits foul pollutants and noise during the

entire day and some times the production continues in the

night creating noise pollution like clattering and running of

the moulding machines, grinding machines and disturbs

the peace and tranquility in the neighborhood. The noise

pollution so generated, according to the complainant, was

above 125dB(a).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span><p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      4.    It also alleged that it received the complaint

that the factory/manufacturing unit is an area of just

140x40 sq.ft. with dwelling unit taking away 40x20sq.ft.

and grossly insufficient space for such Unit.


</p><p id="p_7">      5.   In   para   No.3   of    the   complaint    the   Board

mentioned, it had called upon the accused who is the

proprietor of the Unit on 17.6.2002 to show cause as to

why action should not be initiated for contravening the

provision of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> of the Act. Despite it, the accused

failed to stop such obnoxious activity and continued to

generate waste in the manufacturing process, which he

dumped on the road side in the residential area causing

dust pollution in the entire surrounding.


</p><p id="p_8">      6. In para No.4 it averred because of such activity

the Board by its notice dated 3.9.2002 issued direction

under Section 33 A r/w Rule 34 of the Water Rules

proposing to issue directions for closing of the unit and

also called upon it to stop its activity forthwith. It alleged

that the accused-firm failed to comply with the demand

necessitating   the    spot   inspection    by   its   officers   on

1.10.2002. The inspection confirmed the allegations in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>



complaint it had received and was factually correct and as

the defaulting unit failed to show cause against the

proposed directions, it sought for action.


</p><p id="p_9">      7.   The     learned     jurisdictional   Magistrate   took

cognizance and summoned the accused to answer the

charge in which he pleaded not guilty.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      8.   In    the   trial   that   ensued    the   complainant

examined its officer who was the signatory to the

complainant as PW1 and introduced in evidence, eight

documents.       Two witnesses Sudhakar and Nithyananda

Kullor were examined in support of evidence of Uday

Kumar (PW1). When confronted with incriminating aspects

appearing in evidence as required under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_5">Section 313</a> of the

Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused put up the

defence of denial simplicitor without leading evidence in

defence.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      9. Analysing the evidence so brought on record, the

learned    Trial   Judge       opined    prosecution     evidence

outweighed the defence and convicted him for the offence

under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">Section 44</a> of the Act for violating <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_7">Section 25</a> of the

Act but acquitted the petitioner for the offence under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>
<a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_8">Section 43</a> of the Act. Assailing it he was in appeal before

the learned Sessions Judge in Crl.A.No.48/2005 reiterating

plea of innocence and also contending that it had applied

for grant of consent to the Board through its application on

18.11.2002 and as the Board had not accepted or rejected

the application within a period of four weeks, it was

deemed consent.      The Appellate Judge found no favour

with any of these grounds and rejected the appeal

confirming the conviction.   Assailing both the judgments

he is in revision.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">      10. Sri.Mylaraiah, learned counsel would submit the

unit run by the accused has not caused any pollution or

nuisance to the residences in the area nor it has

contravened any of the provisions of the Act. He would

submit the learned Trial Judge rightly acquitted the

petitioner of charge for the offence under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_9">Section 43</a> of the

Act but erred seriously in convicting him for the offence

under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_10">Section 44</a> of the Act. Such conviction, according to

him, is unsustainable as the Board had failed to consider

that an application seeking prior consent was filed within

the statutory period of four weeks.      Therefore, it is a

deemed consent and when such deemed permission is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>



available to the petitioner-accused under <a href="/doc/768748/" id="a_11">Section 25(7)</a> of

the Act; the prosecution is void ab initio.     Regarding the

evidence on record he would submit it is concoction, as

there was no physical inspection.             There was no

ascertainment of true facts; there was no dispassionate

consideration   of   his   plea   for   grant    of   consent.

Alternatively, the learned counsel would submit that there

is no statement in the complaint or in the evidence that

the petitioner-accused had violated the terms of license

issued under <a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_12">Section 33</a> (A) of the Act and hence, the

prosecution was impacted. Lastly, would submit soon after

rejection of the request for grant of prior consent by order

dated 21.12.2002 of the Board, the petitioner accused has

stopped manufacturing activity and has abandoned the

unit. He thus, seeks acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">       11. In negation of these grounds Mr.D.Nagaraj,

learned counsel for the respondent-Board would submit

the accused has been charged not for violating the

proposed directions issued under <a href="/doc/1048400/" id="a_13">Section 33</a> (A) of the Act,

but has been prosecuted for running the Unit without prior

consent of the Board as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1046852/" id="a_14">Section 25</a> of the

Act.    Therefore, there is no gain in saying that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               8</span>



petitioner has stopped activity and thus has immunity from

the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">       12. Contentions of both the sides has received my

consideration and on examination of the material on record

it could be seen the petitioner has been running the unit

much prior to the month of November, 2002.               The

inspection report of 27.5.2002 would show the Unit of the

petitioner was inspected by the officials of the Board,

competent to do so and they found the Unit was running,

but despite demand the petitioner failed to produce prior

consent. Thus, it is evident as per the complaint received

by the Court, the Unit was running as on 27.5.2002 and in

subsequent inspection done by its officers on 1.10.2002, it

was found to be in functional creating noise pollution as

also   polluting   the   environment   by   expelling   waste

generated in the manufacturing unit out in the streets

along side the roads creating hazardous situation for the

neighbours.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">       13. The learned counsel for the respondent-Board

was right in contending even assuming that the petitioner

accused had submitted an application on 18.11.2002 for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9</span>



prior consent of the Board to run the unit, it had not

stopped its activity.    The application was rejected by the

Board on 21.12.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">      14. I am satisfied even if the accused had submitted

such a request for prior consent it was only on 18.11.2002

whereas the prosecution is for a period earlier to it on the

ground that he had not obtained prior consent.          The

rejection of application on 21.12.2002 is affirmation of the

fact that the Unit was running and without prior consent,

as on that date.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">      15. The contention of the petitioner that deemed

consent is available to him may be for a period subsequent

to November, 2002. But for preceding period in the years

earlier, running of Unit is certainly in contravention of

<a href="/doc/1046852/" id="a_15">Section 25</a> of the Act, which constitutes an offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/790467/" id="a_16">Section 44</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">      16. The learned Trial Judge has examined the

material evidence on record with reference to documents

to conclude the petitioner was guilty of the offence under

<a href="/doc/695200/" id="a_17">Section 45</a> of the Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              10</span><p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">      17. As referred to in the para supra, I have heard

Mr.Mylaraiah, learned counsel at length and Mr.D.Nagaraj,

learned counsel for respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">      18. Nothing emerges from the arguments of the

defence nor the defence could salvage anything from the

testimony of the prosecution witness that the charge

raised against it has not been proved beyond reasonable

doubt.   As the charge rests totally on the ground that it

has not obtained prior consent, the accused had a burden

to establish he had obtained prior consent of the Board.

The fact that subsequently application was filed for prior

consent on 18.11.2002 would show the period preceding

2002, he had not applied for such prior consent, which

omission falls within the mischief of <a href="/doc/1046852/" id="a_18">Section 25</a> of the Act

and he has no escape as he becomes punishable under

<a href="/doc/790467/" id="a_19">Section 44</a> of the Act. Thus, the Trial Court was right in

convicting him and Appellate Court was also justified in

affirming the conviction.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">      19. I find the grounds urged in the petition do not

merit interference of the concurrent finding recorded by

the Trial Court and the petition must fail.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             11</span>
</p><p id="p_34">         20. Now coming to the quantum of punishment, as

could be seen from the provisions of the Act the

punishment prescribed under <a href="/doc/790467/" id="a_20">Section 44</a> of the Act is

imposing imprisonment for a term, which shall not be less

than one year and six months but which may be extended

up to six years and with fine.   As minimum sentence is

already prescribed we have no discretion.   Consequently,

sentence of imprisonment of one year and six months

imposed by the Trial Court is affirmed as also order

regarding fine with a default sentence. Revision therefore,

fails.
