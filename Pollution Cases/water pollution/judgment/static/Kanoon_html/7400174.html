</pre><p id="p_1">                              (14/03/2019)


       The applicants have filed this petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a>

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashing of

criminal complaint filed by the respondent for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">Sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_4">47</a> of Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as

'the Act of 1974').     Learned trial Court i.e. learned J.M.F.C.,

Raisen     registered     a    case    being    Criminal     Case

No.1400509/2016 against the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The facts giving rise to this petition, in short, are that

applicant No.1 is a company in the name and style of M/s Kanti

Beverages Pvt. Ltd. incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_6">Companies Act</a>,

1956. The factory is situated at Plot No.16-B, New Industrial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>



Area-2, Mandideep, Raisen (M.P.) and applicant No.2 is the

Managing Director of that company.        Respondent filed a

complaint against the applicants for the offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_7">Sections 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_8">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_9">47</a> of the Act of 1974 alleging

therein that on 16/03/2016 authorised officer of the

respondent inspected exuding untreated industrial effluent

discharging outside the factory. After being taken a sample,

the same was sent to the Analyst who, after examination,

reported that the water was polluted. In that way, exuding

untreated industrial effluent coming from the factory of the

company was found polluted, that was the violation of

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_10">Section 25</a> and punishable under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_11">Sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_12">47</a> of the

Act of 1974. The respondent filed a complaint under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">Section

200</a> of Cr.P.C. against the applicants before the JMFC,

Raisen.    Learned JMFC vide order dated 09/08/2016

registered the complaint and issued notice to the applicants

for their appearance before the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    Applicant No.2 appeared before the trial Court on

24/01/2017 in person and was enlarged on bail, the case was

fixed for appearance of applicant No.1 arrayed as a company.

Later on, this case was posted for evidence before the charge.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>



On 29/07/2011 applicants filed an application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Section

245(2)</a> of Cr.P.C. and another application under <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_15">Section 21</a> of

the Act of 1974.        Learned trial Court after hearing both

interlocutory applications vide order dated 20/11/2017

dismissed both the applications.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    Being aggrieved by that dismissal order, the applicants

have filed this petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_16">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. on the

ground that the order dated 09/08/2017 passed by the trial

Court is cryptic, caviler and contrary to law. In terms of

articles of association, the Board vide resolution dated

04/08/2014 appointed Mr. Pancholi to act as Factory Manager

and he was authorized to oversee every aspect of production

process and was also authorized to represent the company in

any    case/prosecution/proceedings          concerning    factory

operation    and   Mr.     Pancholi    was    authorized   to   be

tried/heard/proceeded.     Respondent No.2 is the Managing

Director of the company who resides in Indore, had no role in

the day-today affairs of the company. It is further contended

that the company obtained consent order from the Madhya

Pradesh     Pollution    Control   Board     with   reference   to

discharging exuding untreated industrial effluent into the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>



natural water courses under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_17">Sections 25</a> and

<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_18">26</a> of the Act of 1974, therefore, the applicants have not

violated any provision of the Act of 1974.      It is further

contended that the respondent has not complied with the

procedure laid down in <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_19">Section 21</a> of the Act of 1974. The

sample was not divided into two parts which is contrary to

the provisions of sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_20">Section 21</a> of the Act of

1974. One part of the sample was not given to the company's

representatives. Before taking the sample, no notice has been

provided to the company's employees.       Respondent No.2

adopted arbitrary and illegal procedure while taking the

sample, therefore, prays to quash the complaint filed against

the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.    Learned senior counsel for the respondent submits that

applicant No.2, being a Managing Director, is authorized to

look after all the affairs of the factory. His duty was to

supervise whether exuding untreated industrial effluent was

not discharging into the natural water. Before taking sample,

notice has already been given to the employee of the

company who was present during sampling and not

demanded one part of the sample, therefore, on that account,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>



Officers of the respondent had not filled the water in two

parts and divided the same into two parts. Had they raised

objection of demanding of one part, the sample would have

been taken into two parts. This petition has been filed on the

wrong facts, hence, prays for dismissal of the petition.

</p><p id="p_6">6.    Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the

record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.    The applicants have filed this petition on the ground

that applicant No.2 is not liable to be impleaded as an

accused in the complaint because the company has passed a

resolution to that effect that Shri Mukesh Pancholi (Factory

Manager) has been appointed as the person responsible for

day-today affairs of the case including Government

Department and functionaries that's why he is only the man

who is to be impleaded as an accused not applicant No.2 who

is residing at Indore and not looking after the day-today

affairs of the factory.   Secondly, on the ground that the

officers of the respondent have not adopted legal procedure

for taking the sample.      Thirdly, the applicants obtained

consent order from the M.P. Pollution Control Board with

reference of discharging exuding untreated industrial effluent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 6</span>



into natural water courses under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_21">Sections 25</a>

and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_22">26</a> of the Act of 1974 and the respondent also issued

environmental    clearance   certificate   vide     letter   dated

28/09/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    Now considered the first point raised by learned

counsel for the applicants. Applicant No.2, being Managing

Director, was not looking after the day-today affairs of the

factory and Mr. Mukesh Pancholi has been appointed to look

after and responsible for the day-today affairs of the factory

vide resolution dated 04/08/2014 passed by the Board of

Directors of the company in terms of articles of association

and he was authorized to oversee every aspect of the

production process. Copy of that resolution has been filed

along with this petition as Annexure-A/2.         This resolution

was communicated to the Officers of the respondent-Board

vide letter dated 5th August, 2014. When this letter has been

communicated to the officers of the respondent why

respondent arrayed applicant No.2 as an accused. Learned

senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has

submitted that Managing Director comes under the definition

of "every person" who is looking after the affairs of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                7</span>



company as well as the factory where from it was alleged that

exuding untreated industrial effluent coming from out the

factory was found polluted.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.    Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted copy

of order dated 20/06/2016 passed in M.Cr.C. No.13107/2015

(Manu Anand Managing Director Vs. Madhya Pradesh

Pollution Control Board) by the Gwalior Bench of this Court.

Perused the order passed by the Gwalior Bench of this Court.

Gwalior Bench of this Court while deciding the aforesaid

case, has referred the judgments passed by Hon'ble the Apex

Court in the cases of Pepsi India Holdings (P) Ltd Vs. Food

Inspector and another, (2011) 1 SCC 176 (Para-50),

Girdhari Lal Gupta Vs. D.H. Mehta and another, AIR

1971 SC 2162 (para-6) and Puja Ravinder Devidasani Vs.

State of Maharashtra and another, AIR 2015 SC 675

(paras-18, 19 and 20). In the said case, the petitioner was

Managing Director of the Factory. The Board of Directors of

the company passed a resolution and authorized Mr. Jai

Kumar Nair as Factory Manager to look after the day-today

work of the factory and made responsible for any other civil

and criminal proceeding, therefore, the Gwalior Bench of this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8</span>



Court after discussing the matter at length concluded that if

there is a resolution passed by the Board of Directors of the

company authorizing any person to look after the affairs of

the factory, Managing Director of the company, as per

complaint made by the complainant, neither falls within the

terms "every person" mentioned in <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_23">Section 47(1)</a> nor can be

made an accused under <a href="/doc/55287/" id="a_24">Section 47(2)</a> of the Act of 1974 in

absence of allegation of consent, connivance or neglect. The

facts of that case are identical to the facts of the present case.

</p><p id="p_10">10.    In the present case, vide resolution dated 4 th August,

2014 it was resolved that pursuant to the provisions of the

Companies act, 2013 and in terms of Articles of Association

of the Company, the Board of Directors appointed Mr.

Mukesh Pancholi to act as Factory Manager and he was

authorized by the board to oversee every aspect of the

production process and also authorized him to represent the

company in any prosecution/proceedings.             He may be

tried/heard/proceeded with and also authorized to sign and

file   pleadings,     appeals,     cross-objections,      petition,

applications, affidavit or other documents as may be deemed

necessary or proper for the proceedings.          This resolution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  9</span>



which is filed with this petition shows that the Managing

Director is not covered under the notification of "every

person" as defined under <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_25">Section 47(1)</a> of the Act of 1974

because he is residing at Indore not looking after day-today

affairs of the factory as per the resolution passed by the Board

of Directors of the Company and this resolution has already

been communicated to the respondent vide letter dated 5 th

August, 2014.     There is a receiving with seal put on

Annexure-A/2 which shows that respondent was well within

the knowledge before filing the complaint that Mr. Mukesh

Pancholi is responsible for day-today affairs of the factory.

This Court is of the view that applicant No.2-Vishal Parasram

Puriya has wrongly been arrayed as accused No.2.

</p><p id="p_11">11.   Now considered the second and third points which are

raised by learned counsel for the applicants. These objections

are pertaining to process of sampling and mode of sampling.

Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that the

officers of the respondent have not taken a proper sample as

per law and the applicant No.1-company is having consent

order issued by the Pollution Board. This Court is of the

view that these objections are pertaining to evidence which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   10</span>



are to be produced or lead before the trial Court during trial.

Applicant No.1 would be having opportunity to lead the

evidence on that point or cross-examine of the witness

produced by the respondent who prepared samples as alleged

not adopted the process of sampling properly.            For that

reasons. These issues are in gestation stage, this Court is not

inclined to invoke the inherent powers envisaged under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_26">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. on these issues.
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.   Consequently, the petition is partly allowed.           The

impugned order passed in Criminal Case No.1400509/2016

so far as it relates to applicant No.2 is concerned, the same is

hereby quashed. The criminal proceeding so far it relates to

applicant No.2-Vishal Parasram Puriya is concerned, the

same is hereby quashed and the respondent is free to initiate

proceedings and arrayed the person who is responsible for

day-today affairs appointed by the Board of Directors of the

Company i.e. Mukesh Pancholi.          Learned counsel for the

parties submit that respondent has moved an application for

arraying Mukesh Pancholi as an accused in the complaint

before the trial Court. If that is the position, the trial Court is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                          11</span>



free to proceed in accordance with law. There shall be no

order as to cost.
