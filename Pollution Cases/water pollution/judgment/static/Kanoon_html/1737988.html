             Dated this the 16th day of December, 2009

                                   ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.57/2009 on the file of

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chalakkudy taken cognizance

for the offence under <a href="/doc/1273321/" id="a_1">Section 291</a> of the Indian Penal Code and

<a href="/doc/898393/" id="a_2">Section 24(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_3">Section 43</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1974) on Annexure-IV final report. The

petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_5">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure to quash the proceedings contending that in view of

compliance of the conditions provided in Annexure-III order

continuation of the prosecution is abuse of process of the court.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and learned

Public Prosecutor were heard.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. The argument of the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioner is that Annexure-IV communication sent by the

Environmental Engineer of Kerala State Pollution Control Board to

the Sub Inspector of Police, who is investigating the case,

establishes that the sample examined at the laboratory establish

that it is not a hazardous waste as provided under the Central

Government Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling)Rule

1989, as it is within the limit and the said waste could be used for

filling up the earth and in such circumstances, the continuation of

the proceedings is only an abuse of prosecution.

</p><p id="p_4">       4. Learned counsel also argued that by Annexure-III order

passed by the learned Magistrate while granting interim custody

of the vehicle it was directed by the learned Magistrate that

petitioner shall deposit the waste material in accordance with the

directions of the Pollution Control Board already issued, in the

presence of the village/panchayat authorities and produce a

certificate by the village/panchayat authorities to that effect

within three days and petitioner has complied with the direction

as well.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5. The learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that the

Engineer who issued Annexure-IV letter is one of the witnesses to

be examined as per the final report in the case and Annexure-IV

shows that even though percentage found in the sample is within

the limit as provided under the Central Government Hazardous

Waste (Management and Handling)Rule 1989, if it is flown into

the water or enters     underground, it would cause pollution of

water and in such circumstances, it cannot be said that no offence

is attracted.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       6. On hearing the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor, I do not find that

based on Annexure-III order or Annexure-IV communication the

final report is to be quashed or the cognizance

taken to be set aside.       When the offence was committed,

subsequent removal of the waste pursuant to Annexure-III order

will not enable the petitioner to get the final report quashed.

Petitioner is at liberty to raise all the contentions before the

learned Magistrate at the time of trial.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Petition is dismissed.
