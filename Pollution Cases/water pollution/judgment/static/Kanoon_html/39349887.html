:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">   [Order of the Court was made by T.S.SIVAGNANAM, J.]  


        Heard Mr.D.Srinivasaragavan, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, Mr.M.Govindan, learned Special Government Pleader for the
respondents 1 and 2 and Mrs.Srimathi, learned Standing Counsel for
respondents 3 and 4.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.This petition has been filed by the petitioner for issuance of
Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the order passed by the first respondent
dated 02.06.2017, and the consequential proceedings also dated 02.06.2017 and 
to direct the respondents 1 and 2 consider the petitioner's application for
consent to operate the unit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.The impugned order in this Writ Petition has been passed under
<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_2">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. As
against such order, the petitioner has an effective and efficacious remedy of
filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal. The petitioner has moved
this Court, as the National Green Tribunal is closed for Summer Vacation and
there is no Vacation Sitting. Therefore, the matter was listed before us for
maintainability and being satisfied that the petitioner could not move the
National Green Tribunal, we permitted the Writ Petition to be entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The petitioner was granted consent to establish a Bleaching Unit vide
order dated 12.08.2011. To enable the petitioner to commence operation they
are required to obtain an order of consent to operate from the respondent
Board. According to the respondent Board, when the District Environmental
Engineer made an inspection of the Unit on 03.04.2017, it was found that the
Unit was in operation without obtaining an order of consent to operate and
they had not fulfilled various parameters, which ultimately lead to passing
the impugned order of closure. According to the petitioner, the inspection
was conducted by the District Environmental Engineer behind the back of the
petitioner and the petitioner was not operating the Unit and they have
fulfilled all the conditions. It is submitted that a representation dated
13.04.2017, requesting for issuance of consent to operate, stating that they
have fully complied with all the conditions stipulated in the order giving
consent to establish the unit is pending consideration of the respondent
Board. If the petitioner has not been granted an order to operate the Unit,
obviously the petitioner cannot commence production and if that had been done
it is illegal. In any event, the petitioner's case is that  they have
fulfilled all the conditions and if an inspection is conducted in their
presence the authority would be in a position to assess the state of affairs
and pass appropriate orders.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.Thus, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not
propose to set aside the impugned order, but, would direct the respondent
Board to appoint the Joint Chief Environmental Engineer of the respondent
Board having jurisdiction over the area to  inspect the petitioner's Unit
after giving notice to the petitioner. For the purpose of inspection, as
electricity would be required, the  respondents 3 and 4 are directed to grant
temporary electricity supply for the purpose of inspection alone and after
completing the inspection, the supply shall be disconnected and thereafter
appropriate orders will be passed by the competent authority on merits and in
accordance with law. The above direction shall be complied with, within a
period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.With the above directions, this Writ Petition is disposed of. No
costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
