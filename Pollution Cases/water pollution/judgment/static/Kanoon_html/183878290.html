</pre><p id="p_1">        The petitioners are arrayed as accused Nos.1 to 3 and came forward to
file this Original Petition praying for quashing of the private complaint in
C.C.No.51 of 2011 on the file of the Court of the Judicial Magistrate No.II,
Kulithalai, instituted by the respondent/private complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.The said complaint has been filed seeking prosecution of the
petitioners under <a href="/doc/1418504/" id="a_2">Section 49(1)(b)</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/15165819/" id="a_4">Section 43(1)(b)</a> of the Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.It is the case of the respondent/private complainant that the first
respondent has established a Company in Sivayam South Village in Survey 
No.1210/3, for separating garment mineral and it is categorised as a red
category and without getting any clearance from the Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board, as to the Air and Water Pollution, has commenced operation and
therefore, sought for prosecution of the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has drawn the
attention of this Court to <a href="/doc/12624070/" id="a_6">Section 25</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as well as to <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> of the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and would submit that the respondent/private
complainant has no locus standi to file the complaint for the reasons that
the applications have been submitted seeking clearance under the said Act and
would submit that applications given have not been disposed and under Sub-
Section 7 of Section 25 of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981, there is a deeming provision and would further add that subsequent to
the filing of the quash petition, the mining of the garments has been banned
and the petitioners not even commenced operations and hence, prays for
quashment of the same. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.Though the respondent/private complainant has been served with notice
and his name has also been printed in the cause-list, there is no
representation on his behalf.
</p><p id="p_6">        6.In the light of Sub-Section 7 of Section 25 of the Air (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, there is a deeming provision and it is
the specific stand of the petitioners that the application has been submitted
and though they are entitled to commence operation, on account of the deeming
provision, they have not commenced the mining operation due to law and order
and as such they have not even commenced the mining operation.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.In the light of the same, this Court is of the considered view that
the continuance of the prosecution in C.C.No.51 of 2011 on the file of the
Court of the Judicial Magistrate No.II, Kulithalai, would result in
miscarriage of justice and no useful purpose would also be served to continue
the trial of the said case.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        8.In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the
proceedings in C.C.No.51 of 2011 on the file of the Court of the Judicial
Magistrate No.II, Kulithalai are quashed. Consequently, connected
Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
