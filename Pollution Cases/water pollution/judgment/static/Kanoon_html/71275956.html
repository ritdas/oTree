<p id="p_2">2.                 Rajkot      Municipal       Corporation     (Respondent

No.3), admittedly, received authorization from the GPCB

(Respondent No.1), under the Municipal Solid Waste

(Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 (for short, "MSW

Rules") on 31-12-2003, for setting up and operating of

waste processing/disposal facility at Survey No.222/P,

Village Nakravadi, (District Rajkot) on 30 Acres of land.

There is no dispute about the fact that in pursuance to

the      Authorization              received   from   the   GPCB,    Rajkot

Municipal Corporation (For short, "RMC") entered into

contract with M/s Hanjer Biotech Energies Pvt Ltd, (For

short "HBEPL") on 20th June, 2003. For this purpose,

HBEPL entered into MoU for technological support with

the Technical Consultancy, called EPTDC and ESSPL for

the purpose of erecting and commissioning of the waste

conservation plant and adequate service facility to treat

the waste material. Under the agreement, the HBEPL,

was duty bound to maintain Municipal solid waste site in

hygienic manner as required under the MSW Rules.

</p><p id="p_3">3.                 The Applicants have come out with a case that

the RMC and the State of Gujarat, later on, granted

various concessions for the treatment of Municipal solid

waste on the grazing lands used by the villagers of

Nakravadi. Some parts of the said lands are adversely

 affected by the dispersion of the MSW, resulting into

degradation                  of   environment.     As    a    result   of

mismanagement of the Project, several hundreds of rural

population is facing problems due to contamination of

groundwater, degradation of quality of the farm lands and

adverse impact of the ill-treated or untreated dispersion

of the MSW in the nearby area. The landfill site has been

poorly maintained by the HBEPL. Therefore, GPCB issued

various show-cause Notices to RMC and HBEPL, but that

was of no avail. The Applicants allege that further 86

Acres of land is being allotted to the Project for landfill

site       and,          therefore,    it   will   add   to   intolerable

contamination of the air and water due to improper

management of the MSW site. They have submitted that

it is essential to close down the landfill site and restitute

the land in question. The Applicants have further alleged

that selection of MSW site is against the Rules. They

pointed out that during visits of landfill site, several

irregularities were noticed, but no serious action was

taken against HBEPL. Consequently, they filed the

present Application. The Applicants sought closure of

Rajkot MSW disposal (MSW) and landfill management

site, situated at village Nakravadi, assessment of damage

caused to livestock, health, village common lands and

sources of water etc., and direction against polluters to

 pay the compensation for such losses. They also sought

restitution of the land in question to its original position.

</p><p id="p_4">4.                 By filing its reply affidavit, the Respondent

No.1, i.e. GPCB submitted that necessary action was

taken against RMC, as and when complaints were

received in the context of violations of the MSW Rules.

According to GPCB, (Respondent No.1) RMC is not

imposing required restrictions upon HBEPL, because of

fear that if any harsh conditions are imposed or some

monetary restrictions are imposed, the contract may be

rescinded, which will result into environmental pollution.

It is contended that the officers of GPCB took prompt

actions from time to time. RMC was directed to segregate

biomedical               waste   and   waste   generated   from   the

Slaughterhouse for disposal as per the MSW Rules, 2000.

The RMC was further directed to prevent pollution arising

on account of dumping of the MSW at the site and to

prevent indiscriminate dumping as well as open burning

of the MSW. By Notice dated 7.2.2005, RMC was called

upon to show cause as to why action be not taken for

various lapses, particularly, due to non-observance of

conditions like the fact that fencing was not provided at

the landfill site, no facilities were provided at the site and

the landfill site was not developed. GPCB also gave details

of various Notices served on RMC and HBEPL. GPCB

averred that residual wastes such as plastic/polythene


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                    5</span>
(J) Appln. No. 131 of 2013
 bags wastes were found flying around the Unit, proper

fencing was not provided and residual waste generated

after processing was dumped within the premises. It was

found that RMC has failed to ensure the compliances and

to ensure adequate air pollution control by insisting

HBEPL to install Air Pollution Control Equipments at the

landfill site. The conveyor belts were not duly covered.

The MSW was not being properly stored. Thus, GPCB,

supports             the     case    of   the   Applicants   as   regards

mismanagement of the MSW site and disposal of such

waste material by RMC and HBEPL (Respondent Nos.3

and 4).
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.                 According to CPCB (Respondent No.2), it has

no role to play in the matter. By filing his reply affidavit,

Director of the CPCB, asserted that since Authorization

was issued by GPCB to RMC, it is not necessary to give

any response and CPCB has no responsibility to exercise

control           over       the    Municipal    affairs   pertaining   to

observance of the MSW Rules, 2000. According to CPCB,

in view of the Rule-6, of the MSW Rules, 2000, GPCB, is

responsible for monitoring compliances of the standards

regarding groundwater, ambient air, leachate and the

composite quality, including incinerator standards as

specified in the Schedule II, III and V. For such reasons,

the CPCB, declined to resist the Application or give any

comments.

(J) Appln. No. 131 of 2013
</p><p id="p_7"> 6.                 By filing its reply affidavit, RMC resisted the

Application on various grounds. The first objection raised

by RMC, is that the Application is barred by limitation,

because the MSW is being disposed of at the land allotted

by the State Government since 2002 and 2004. The

Applicants              have   filed   the   Application    without    any

foundation and after more than five (5) years period of the

commencement of the activity of the MSW disposal. RMC

denied the allegations that disposal of the MSW at the

site, is resulting into any harm to the environment. It is

alleged that the site for carrying out disposal of the MSW

is at least 800-100 mts away from the corridor of five (5)

villages in the nearby area including village Nakravadi. It

is contended that RMC identified the site in question after

conducting               Environment        Impact   Assessment       (EIA),

through the National Productivity Council, a Central

Government Agency. It is further submitted that the

waste          disposal        facilities    have    been   set   up     as

recommended by the said Agency. The MSW plant was

commissioned in the year 2005, by the contractor i.e.

HBEPL, in accordance with the terms of the contract

dated 20th June 2003. Thereafter, on 29th February,

2008, RMC entered into another contract with HBEPL, for

setting up landfill site for disposal of the MSW that

remained after recycling in the processing plant. Though

the said processing plant was to be set up within eight (8)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                           7</span>
(J) Appln. No. 131 of 2013
 months from the date of the agreement, HBEPL could not

complete the work within given time frame. With the

result, the contract was terminated and RMC, had

forfeited the security deposit of Rs.30,00,000/- , as well

as had black listed HBEPL. Aggrieved by such adverse

action, HBEPL, filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of

Gujarat. The High Court granted stay against the order of

black listing. Thereafter, private negotiations were held

between the parties and the proposal to set up the

contemplated work within a reasonable time was agreed

upon by the parties and was accepted by RMC, as per its

resolution. It is alleged that HBEPL, has erected one

landfill Cell with the capacity of 80000 MT of waste reject

for      disposal            of   waste    which     remained     even    after

processing in the processing plant. The second Cell is

under process of completion and will be of capacity of

2,00,000 MT of waste reject. Thereafter, there will be no

possibility of running off the waste water from the landfill

area into any stream, river, lake, pond, or contamination

of      groundwater.              Further,        RMC   alleges    that    the

Application is filed                 due     to    vested   interest of the

Applicants. It is denied that there is need to close down

the plant dealing with the MSW disposal management. It

is alleged that both the sites made available for MSW

disposal are adjoining to each other and they are not

abutting to any agricultural field. The contention of RMC,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                              8</span>
(J) Appln. No. 131 of 2013
 is that the plant is carrying out processing of about 400-

450 MT of MSW every day and if such processing plant is

closed down, it would not be only dangerous to the

environment, but would also result into spreading of

epidemic diseases. It is denied that the site selection is

not in accordance with the MSW Rules. According to

RMC, the Gas control system will have to be installed

only upon closure of the landfill cell and cannot be

installed at the present when landfill area is under

operation. The contention of RMC is that the remaining

landfill site would be fully developed within 8-12 months

and thereafter no waste would be left open at the site.

Under the circumstances, RMC (Respondent No.3) sought

dismissal of the Application.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.                 By filing separate reply affidavit, HBEPL,

(Respondent No.4) resisted the Application. The Response

of HBEPL, is similar to that of RMC. It is averred that any

indulgence as per prayers made by the Applicants would

result in spilling of the MSW which generates at the rate

of about 400-450 MT every day. It is further averred that

HBEPL is disposing off the MSW in an environmental

friendly manner in keeping with the MSW (Management

and Handling) Rules, 2000, since the year 2005. HBEPL

further submitted that the landfill site has been so

designed and constructed that there is no likelihood of

water slippage from the area into any stream, river, lake,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                            9</span>

 pond or contamination of groundwater. According to

HBEPL, with the help of upgraded technology, major

portion of the MSW is recycled and the minor portion of

the waste is being disposed off in landfill Cells, yet some

of the MSW which includes debris of old houses and

ashes cannot be recycled in the plant and, therefore,

further up gradation is under way. It is denied that the

MSW Rules are being violated and the environment is

being adversely affected due to mismanagement of landfill

site or non-compliance of the MSW (M &amp; H) Rules 2000. It

is submitted further that HBEPL is in process of erecting

second cell with the capacity of 2,00,000 MT of waste

reject, which is likely to be completed within next 8 to 12

months. The Gas control system will be installed upon

the closure of the landfill Cells. Further contention of

HBEPL is that green belt has been duly provided and

show-cause                   Notices   issued   by   GPCB   are   wholly

misconceived. On these premises, HBEPL (Respondent

No.4) sought dismissal of the Application.

We have also perused the written submissions filed on

behalf of the Applicants. The real contesting parties are

 environmental degradation caused due to non-observance

of the MSW Rules. Let it be noted that the main prayer of

the Applicants is that RMC solid waste disposal (MSW)

and the landfill management site should be directed to be

closed.          Consequential    reliefs    of   compensation     and

restoration of the land are also sought.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.                 Before we proceed to deal with the Application,

let it be noted that the contesting Respondents have

raised          objection    regarding      maintainability   of   the

Application on the ground that it is barred by limitation.

According to the Applicants, after the complaint dated

17.12.2012, made by the Applicant No.1, no action was

taken by GPCB, (Respondent No.1) and as such, it gave

rise to the cause of action. It is stated that the date of

such inaction as per letter dated 24.12.2012, received

from GPCB, has triggered the limitation. Thus, according

to the Applicants, the Application is within period of

limitation as prescribed under Section 14(3), as well as

<a href="/doc/129625484/" id="a_1">Section 15(4)</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

We cannot be oblivious of the fact that main prayer of the

Applicants is for closure of the plant dealing with the

MSW disposal. As stated earlier, contract work was

allotted by RMC to HBEPL in or about 2005. The plant

was made functional in 2005. There is no dispute about

the fact that the work of MSW disposal is being carried

out at the site in question since 2005 onwards. Mere fact

</p><p id="p_13">         Why for the closure of the plant?.              The reason,

according to the Applicants is that selection of the landfill

site is improper and illegal. The Applicants submitted

that under Clause-8 of the MSW Rules, the landfill site

shall be away from habitation clusters, forest areas, water

bodies, Monuments, National parks, Wetlands and place

of important cultural historical or religious interest. They

further allege that the landfill site is situated on public

grazing lands adjoining to the agricultural fields. So also,

it is on the hill top and therefore, during rainy season the

rain water naturally is drifted below the downstream

towards nearby villages carrying soluble and insoluble

particles mixed with sub soil water resulting into

groundwater and surface water contamination.

<p id="p_16">12.                We may pin-point at this juncture that the

facts of the said case stand on different footings from the

facts of present case. It was found by the Hon'ble

Principal Bench that the construction of plant was

carried out in blatant violation of the orders passed by

the High Court and also by the SEIAA. It was also found

that the NOC had lapsed on 2nd June, 2010 and the same

was not renewed. It was, therefore, a case where no

construction activity could be carried out. The High Court

itself had stated that even the trenching ground from the

site in question should be shifted to an appropriate site.

The site selection was not finally completed by the

Municipal Corporation. The Hon'ble Principal Bench

further noticed that the residents of the University and

 the villages were likely to be affected due proximity of the

site, which could have hazardous effects on their health.

The hostels of the students, other buildings of the

University, water bodies etc. were at a distance of less

than 400 mtrs from the site selected for the plant of the

MSW disposal. Under the peculiar circumstances of that

case, the Hon'ble Principal Bench, directed closure of the

MSW management plant, which was being operated

without NOC and directed relocation thereof. So far as

question of site selection is concerned, the Applicants

have placed on record various complaints made by the

villagers, regarding the foul smell emanating from the

landfill site. It appears that nearby villagers have objected

site. We do not have any authentic map about the

proposed acquisition of 40 acres land to expand the site

 record is that landfill site No.1, is filled up to its full

capacity and therefore during rainy season the disposal of

residual           solid     wastes   becomes   unmanageable.   The

residual solid waste is mixed up with rain water and flows

along with surface water, due to slope instability. The real

problem is not of selection of landfill site as such. The

problem is that of mismanagement of the MSW disposal

by the contractor viz. HBEPL (Respondent No.1). We will

demonstrate during the course of further discussion as to

how such problem has been aggravated due to failure of

HBEPL to take immediate steps to deal with MSW

management at the landfill site and also due to soft

attitude of the Municipal Corporation to deal with said

contractor.

<p id="p_17">13.                There cannot be two opinion about the fact

that GPCB (Respondent No.1) issued several Notices to

RMC, indicating deficiencies in the operation of the MSW

management plant. It was repeatedly pointed out that

leachate collection and treatment was improper. It was

further pointed out by GPCB that at the landfill site No.1,

leachate was flowing outside the premises during rainy

season creating pools of contaminated water outside the

landfill site. It was further pointed out that the facilities

like RDF plant, composting etc., were not provided by

HBEPL. The groundwater analysis carried out by GPCB,

indicated excess concentration of certain parameters.

indicated that the contractor had not arranged for proper

leachate collection and treatment facilities. It was found

that the landfill site is partly covered with Plastic sheet. It

was further noticed that the problem had aggravated due

to failure of HBEPL to complete the work of construction

and providing the facility of MSW management at Cell

No.II. What appears from the record, is that landfill Cell

No.I, has capacity of 80000 MT, which is already filled

with residue material and it is covered with a Plastic

sheet. The excess wastes residue is being stacked over

and passed over the Cell No.I. The Cell No.II, of the

landfill site has capacity of 2,00,000 Cubic mtrs. The Cell

No.II, is under construction, but the work is delayed for

more than five years, for one or other reasons, leading to

improper storage and management of the MSW, resulting

into foul smell due to tearing of Plastic cover, flowing of

leachate, as there are slopes, and particularly so during

rainy season and thereby causing air pollution as well as

water pollution.

(J) Appln. No. 131 of 2013
 It is obvious that comparison of the area of landfill site

with the landfill sites of other cities, is not proper and no

such yardstick can be applied only because RMC has

provided more land for management of the MSWs under

the MSW Rules. It is further provided that "a buffer zone

of no-development shall be maintained around landfill

site and shall be incorporated in the Town Planning

Department's land use plans."               The inert and non-

biodegradable waste shall be used for building roads or

filling-up of appropriate areas on hills.

</p><p id="p_29">18.                Taking a stock of the material placed on record

and foregoing discussion, we are of the opinion that

during rainy season the air and water pollution is caused

on account of water slippage from the landfill site, (Cell

No.I), because of untreated MSW which flows along with

rainy water from the slope of small hillock towards the

village side. We also find that HBEPL, failed to take

proper precaution for maintenance of landfill site, in as

much as there is no proper compound wall erected, nor

the protection walls are provided around the lower steps

for the purpose of arresting flow of leachate, mixing with

rain water. We find that HBEPL has failed to complete the

work of Cell No.II, within given time frame and thereby

aggravated the problem of threat to the environment.

Under the circumstances, though we do not agree with

the contention of the Applicants that location of the

has to be applied in the peculiar circumstances of the

present case. We are also of the opinion that this is a fit

case, in which those villagers, who are having agricultural

lands or residences in the proximity of 500 mtrs near the
