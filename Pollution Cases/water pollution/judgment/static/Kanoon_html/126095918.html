         petitioner at its unit at Jhagadia. Learned Senior Counsel for
         the petitioner submitted that the demand raised by the
         respondents for payment of electricity duty and the refusal to
         allow benefit of exemption from the payment of duty for five
         years is arbitrary, unjustified and contrary to the provisions of
         the Act. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner also relied
         on the amendment in the Act which, according to the
         petitioner, contemplates that any additional unit of an existing
         / established industrial undertaking will be entitled to
         exemption from the payment of electricity duty subject to the
         terms and conditions specified by the Government. So as to
         support and justify the contentions and submissions, learned
         Senior Counsel for the petitioner relied on the decisions in
         case of <a href="/doc/259313/" id="a_10">Textile Machinery Corporation Limited, Calcutta v.
         The Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal, Calcutta</a>

         Gandhinagar &amp; Ors. [(2014) 1 GLR 545].
</p>
<p id="p_29">         8.   Per contra, Ms. Shruti Pathak, learned AGP, opposed the
         submissions by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and
         submitted that the petitioner cannot be considered new
         industrial undertaking and the petitioner is not entitled for
         exemption from payment of electricity duty for period of five
         years as claimed by it. Learned AGP relied on the application
         submitted by the petitioner in prescribed Form - E whereby
         the petitioner sought exemption from payment of electricity
         duty. Learned AGP submitted that the meaning of the term
         "new industrial undertaking" under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_12">section 3(2)(vii)(a)</a> of the
         Act, does not cover industrial units / undertakings such as the
         petitioner's. According to learned AGP, the explanation under
         the said section carves out an exception according to which
         certain     units        cannot     be      considered          as     new       industrial
         undertaking. According to learned AGP, even an undertaking
         which      is        formed    by   transferring            business       or     building,
         machinery or plant previously used in the State for any
         industrial purpose by any other unit also cannot be considered
         to be new industrial undertaking and from the details
         provided by the petitioner in the application submitted in
         prescribed Form - E, it has emerged that the petitioner,
         according to its own claim, was engaged in business and
         activity        of    manufacture          and       sale    of      gases       including
         manufactured oxygen, medical oxygen, liquid nitrogen, etc.
         and merely because the said gases were manufactured at the
         premises of the clients, does not take away or eliminate the
         fact that the petitioner was engaged in industrial activity in
         the State of Gujarat and that therefore, it is not justified in
         claiming         that    its   unit      at     Jhagadia        is     new       industrial

         undertaking. Learned AGP relied on clause No.2.2.2 of the
         agreement entered into by and between the petitioner with
         company named Gujarat Guardian Limited and another
         company named E.I.Dupont and submitted that the liability to
         pay all taxes, cost, duties, charges (freight and insurance) etc.
         were to be borne by the petitioner and that in view of the said
         provision and in view of the nature of business and activity
         which was being carried on by the petitioner, its unit at
         Jhagadia cannot be considered as new industrial undertaking.
          Learned AGP submitted that the petitioner's claim that prior
         to 2009 - at the site of the clients - it was not using electricity
         is not correct and that the petitioner does not fulfill the
         requirements, conditions and criteria prescribed by the Act
         under the said provision so as to be eligible for being
         considered as new industrial undertaking to be eligible for
         exemption from payment of electricity duty.

<p id="p_30">         9.    I have heard learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
         and learned AGP for the respondents and also considered the
         material on record of this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_31">         10.   The petitioner has claimed that since 1996 until 2009, it
         used to undertake its business activities at the premises of its
         clients on "build, own and operate and maintain" basis and for
         putting in operation such arrangement the petitioner had
         entered into contracts with clients viz.                Gujarat Guardian
         Limited and E I Dupont Limited in State of Gujarat and with
         one more client in State of Maharashtra. According to the
         terms of the contract between the parties, the arrangement
         for other resources and infrastructure, including supply of
         power for the said activity, was made by clients at their cost

         and   as     part        of   its   obligation         the      petitioner          ensured
         installation, operation and maintenance of the plant for
         generation of gaseous nitrogen and to supply the gas.
         Subsequently, somewhere in 2009, the petitioner established
         its own industrial unit for production and supply of gases
         namely, liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, gaseous hydrogen and
         gaseous nitrogen and the said unit is also engaged in trading
         of argon and acetylene.
</p>
<p id="p_32">         11.   The dispute between the petitioner and the respondents
         has arisen in respect of the said industrial unit at Jhagadia.
         The dispute and difference between the petitioner and the
         respondents arose on account of an application submitted by
         the petitioner on or around 28.1.2010 seeking exemption from
         the obligation to pay electricity duty on the premise that its
         industrial unit at Jhagadia is "New Industrial Undertaking"
         and that therefore, in view of the provisions under the Act, it
         is entitled for exemption from payment of duty for first five
         years from the date when the commercial production started
         the petitioner also prayed for certificate of eligibility for
         exemption of electricity duty under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_13">Section 3(2)(vii)</a> read with
         Rule 11(1) of the Rules. The respondent No.3 considered the
         application and vide order dated 18.11.2010, the respondent
         No.3 rejected the application and the appellate authority
         rejected the appeal vide order dated 29.5.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_33">         12.   In this factual background, the dispute between the
         parties    arise     from       construction          and       application          of     the
         definition     and        meaning       of      the      term        "new        industrial
         undertaking" and it is necessary to decide as to whether
         petitioner's industrial unit at Jhagadia can be considered

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">         14.   According to the scheme of the Act, the obligation to pay
         electricity duty arises on consumption of electricity / energy
         and duty is levied on "consumption" of electricity and the
         Duty shall be payable by "consumer". The rates at which the

         obligation to pay the duty. The said provision brings in picture
         the terms "industrial undertaking" and "industrial purpose"

         the Duty shall not be leviable, for five years, on the units
         consumed for "industrial purpose" by a "new industrial
         undertaking". The answer to the question as to which
         undertaking can be considered "industrial undertaking" lies in

         14.6 The petitioner has further claimed that its unit at
         Jhagadia is "consumer of first instance". As mentioned earlier,
         <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_27">Section 3</a> of the Act, being charging section, levies the duty on
         consumption of electricity and imposes the obligation to pay
         duty on the consumer. It is in light of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_28">Section 3</a> that the
         petitioner seems eager to claim that prior to 2009, i.e. before

         "consumer" as contemplated under <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_29">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act.
         True it is that the obligation to pay duty is imposed on a
         consumer, however, when a dispute or controversy arising in

<p id="p_46">         14.7 On the other hand, it is necessary to also take into
         account the fact that before it set-up the unit at Jhagadia, the
         petitioner's business activities were already in operation since
         1996. The petitioner was already in business and by entering
         into special arrangement with its clients, it was continuing its
         business in full swing. The petitioner, to put it in its own
         words, saw "great potential" for "expansion of business" and
         therefore, it set-up the unit at Jhagadia.

         purview of the term "industrial undertaking". When the
         nature of business activities of the petitioner are considered,
         it also becomes clear that the petitioner's undertaking cannot
         be classified under <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_35">section 2(ee)</a> of the Act i.e. as a service

         activities in the State since 1996. The petitioner, according to
         its own claim, is essentially and materially in business of
         manufacturing and selling / supplying various gases. It is also
         relevant that prior to 2009, the petitioner was engaged in
         same business activity i.e. manufacture and sale / supply of
         gases and after 2009 also the petitioner's business activity is
         the same i.e. manufacture and supply of gases.
</p>
<p id="p_50">         15.2 True it is that at its Jhagadia unit, the petitioner is
         manufacturing more or different type of gases than what it
         used to do at the site of its clients, prior to 2009 in the State
         of Gujarat and that it has, according to its claim,                    installed
         "state-of-the-art-technology". However, even if it is assumed
         that the petitioner has installed new and better technology,
         the fact remains that such latest and better technology is used

         expansion of business and/or whether the unit is hit by said or
         any other explanation under clause (vii). It is profitable to
         recall, at this stage, that according to proviso of sub-section

         more, would ordinarily amount to modernization or up-
         gradation of method and means of production but when the

         the explanation then mere installation and use of new
         technology would, without anything more, not automatically
         make     the     unit     "new   undertaking".              Likewise,          starting
         production or manufacture of more or different gases would
         amount to or would, without anything more, amount to
         expansion of business or at the most diversification. When the
         principal activity and business of the unit remains the same,
         then, the unit or undertaking which is set up may or may not,
         depending on facts of the case and depending on presence or
         absence of other facts, factors and connected or related or

         2009 for the same business which it has been engaged in,
         since 1996. Though it is claimed that improved technology is
         installed and more products are introduced, important fact of

         various gases. Accordingly, the unit at Jhagadia came to be
         set up. Thus, even according to the petitioner, the industrial
         unit at Jhagadia is set up for expansion of its business in
         which the petitioner has been engaged since 1996 in the

         undertaking / unit in question is new undertaking or not is to
         determine whether it is all the same a new and identifiable
         undertaking separate and distinct from existing business or
         not; and whether the new industrial undertaking cannotes
         expansion of existing business. There must be new emergence
         of a physically separate industrial unit which can exist on its
         own as a viable unit and physical identity with the old unit is
         not preserved. In this context, it is relevant to take into
         account the observations in paragraph No.18 of the decision
         of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Textile Machinery
         Corporation (supra):-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">              "18. The assessee continues to be the same for the purpose of
              assessment. It has its existing business already liable to tax. It
              produced in the two concerned undertakings commodities
              different from those which he has been manufacturing or
              producing in its existing business. Manufacture or production of
              articles yielding additional profit attributable to the new outlay
              of capital in a separate and distinct unit is the heart of the
              matter, to earn benefit from the exemption of tax liability under
              S. 15C. Sub-section (9) of the section also points to the same
              effect, namely, production of articles. The answer, in every
              particular case depends upon the peculiar facts and conditions
              of the new industrial undertaking on account of which the
              assessee claims exemption under S. 15C. No hard and fast rule
              can be laid down. Trade and industry do not run in earmarked
              channels and particularly so in view of manifold scientific and
              technological developments. There is great scope for expansion
              of trade and industry. The fact that an assessee by establishment
              of a new industrial undertaking expands his existing business,
              which he certainly does, would not, on that score, deprive him of
              the benefit under S. 15C. Every new creation in business is some
              kind of expansion and advancement. The true test is not whether
              the new industrial undertaking connotes expansion of the

               existing business of the assessee but whether it is all the same a
               new and identifiable undertaking separate and distinct from the
               existing business. No particular decision in one case can lay
               down an inexorable test to determine whether a given case
               comes under S. 15C or not. In order that the new undertaking
               can be said to be not formed out of the already existing business,
               there must be a new emergence of a physically separate
               industrial unit which may exist on its own as a viable unit. An
               undertaking is formed out of the existing business if the physical
               identity with the old unit is preserved. This has not happened
               here in the case of the two undertakings which are separate and
               distinct."

<p id="p_59">         17.4 In the above mentioned decision, Hon'ble Apex Court
         has observed that "every new creation in business is some
         kind of expansion and advancement and the fact that
         establishment of new undertaking expands existing business
         would not deprive the person from benefit available to new
         undertaking". However, it is also necessary to keep in focus
         that the said observations are made in view of the provision
         under <a href="/doc/299622/" id="a_42">section 15(c)</a> of the Income Tax Act, whereas in present
         case, by virtue of explanation under clause (vii) of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_43">Section 3(2)</a>
         unit set-up for "expansion of business" is excluded from the
         ambit of "new industrial undertaking. Moreover, it is also
         relevant to note that even in the cited decision Apex Court did
         not consider the appellant's unit as "new undertaking" in view
         of the fact that Apex Court noticed that the unit was not
         totally independent because certain assets were used in the
         manufacturing activity at new unit.

         factual details stated by the petitioner, whereby the salient

         permissions, licences, etc. the unit is considered and treated
         as independent unit set up for the first time. The features
         emphasized by the petitioner and other vital facts emerging
         from the record viz. that the petitioner had set-up the plants
         at the site / premises of its clients, however, it retained the
         ownership and continued to be the owner, of the said plants
         have given rise to the issue whether physical identity of the
         unit at Jhagadia with the plants at the site of clients is main or
         not and whether there is any continuation of physical
         existence of the plants used by it previously. Unfortunately,
         any clear finding on these issues is not recorded by the
         authority. Further, relevant material which may render help in
         deciding the issue is also not available on record of the
         petition.

<p id="p_61">         18.1 At this stage, it is appropriate to consider a fact viz. all
         that the petitioner's clients wanted was "gases" and not the
         plant for manufacture or production of gases. This is evident
         from clause Nos.1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 of the contract with M/s.
         Gujarat Guardian and clause describing object of agreement
         and clause Nos.2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.8 of the contract
         with EIDI and ownership of the plants was retained with and
         by the petitioner and in the end result electricity was
         "consumed" to operate petitioner's plants - though at the site
         of its clients - ownership of which was with, and retained by,
         the petitioner. On such "consumption" of electricity, the Duty
         became leviable in light of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_47">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act.

         18.2 It is relevant to note that the petitioner wants to enjoy
         exemption from the liability to pay the duty on the premise
         that it was not consumer prior to 2009. In these facts and
         circumstances, the relevant issue was whether any one -
         either the petitioner or its clients - paid the electricity Duty
         for the energy / electricity "consumed" for operating of
         "Plants" / Floxal system (owned by the petitioner) so as to
         manufacture - production of gases purchased and used by its
         clients during the period of those contracts and before the
         petitioner set-up and commenced its unit at Jhagadia; or by
         such peculiar and special arrangement both i.e. petitioner and
         its clients avoided payment of Duty. Petitioner claims that it
         was not a consumer prior to 2009 and to support the claim
         and contention it has placed reliance on the meaning of the
         term defined under <a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_48">Section 2(a)</a> according to which a person
         who is supplied electricity by a licencee can be termed
         "consumer" and since it was not supplied electricity, it cannot
         be termed consumer. On strength of such claim both i.e.
         petitioner and clients would avoid Duty. Therefore, authority
         ought to have examined the matter by lifting the veil and
         ought to have identified the actual and real user / beneficiary
         of "electricity consumption" i.e. real consumption.

         plant and / or the assets and machinery of the plants installed
         by the petitioner at the site of its clients are, in any manner,
         used in setting up the plants at Jhagadia and thereby, whether
         the identity and / or continuity of the unit / plants previously
         installed and used by the petitioner (at the sites of the clients)
         is maintained.
</p>
<p id="p_66">         19.1 It is pertinent that in case of Textile Machinery
         Corporation (supra), Hon'ble Apex Court noticed that the
         appellant      before       Hon'ble        Apex     Court         was       not     totally
         independent because certain assets were being used in the
         manufacturing            activity    carried        on     by      the       new       unit.
         Consequently, Hon'ble Apex Court held that physical identity
         with old unit was preserved and therefore, the said new unit
         cannot be considered new unit completely independent of /
         from existing / old unit. In the said case, Hon'ble Apex Court
         observed and held that if use of old plant and machinery, etc.
         was necessary or if old plant and machinery were used to
         complete the manufacturing activity in the new unit then such
         unit cannot be said to be totally independent.

<p id="p_67">         19.2 According to the decision, true taste for determining as
         to whether an industrial undertaking is new industrial
         undertaking or not is to examine as to whether it is all the
         same new and identifiable undertaking separate from and
         distinct from the existing business and not as to whether the
         new undertaking connotes expansion of existing business and
         that there must be new emergence of a physically separate

         preserved.
</p>
<p id="p_68">         19.3 In this view of the matter, it was vital for the petitioner
         to place on record material - evidence to establish that the
         plat or machinery used previously for executing the contracts
         with its clients - customers are not used in setting up the unit
         at Jhagadia and the petitioner should have satisfied the
         authority on this count by showing credible and cogent
         evidence and it was necessary to decide this aspect as well
         before taking final decision.
</p>
<p id="p_69">         19.4 At this stage, it is pertinent to mention that though the
         petitioner has claimed in the petition that for setting up the
         industrial unit at Jhagadia, GIDC Estate, it did not install and
         did not use whole or part of the machinery and plant installed
         and used by it while executing the contracts with its clients
         from 1996 onwards, however, the issue is neither mentioned
         nor addressed and discussed in the orders and not decided by
         the authority and any material to prove relevant aspects is not
         available on record of this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_70">         19.5 This aspect is relevant and important in present case
         because the petitioner continued to be the "owner" of the
         plant/s installed and set-up by it at the sites of the clients and
         the ownership and title in said property rested and continued
         to be with the petitioner. In this context, it is relevant to
         mention that Gujarat Guardian Limited and EI Dupont Ltd, the
         petitioner was, as per the conditions of the contract, obliged
         to install plant for supply of gas to the clients on "build, own,
         operate and maintain" basis. The terms of the contract also

         provided that the ownership of the plant and machinery,
         under all circumstances, "shall remain personal property of
         the petitioner" and the clients had to pay only rental / fee of
         the plant to the petitioner. The ownership and title of the
         plant remained with and of the petitioner. In this context, it
         would be appropriate to take into account some of the clauses
         in the contracts in question viz. clause Nos. 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 5.2,
         5.5, 5.6, 6.1, 8.1 and 11.1 of the contract with Gujarat
         Guardian and clause Nos.2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.8 of the
         contract with EIDI.
</p>
<p id="p_71">         19.6 It is true that the plant and machinery were installed at
         the site of the client and entire infrastructure for its
         installation was provided by the client, however, essentially,
         the contract was to supply gas/gases (required by the
         particular client) to the clients at the client's site. The
         contracts do not contain any provision which oblige the
         petitioner to hand over the ownership and title of the plant to
         the clients and until the expiration of the period of contract
         and thereafter the petitioner continued to be the owner of
         entire plant and machinery. Thus, question which stares in the
         fact is what happened to the said plants and its machinery
         after expiry of the period of contracts. Whether the plants and
         its machinery were retrieved by the petitioner.

<p id="p_72">         19.7 On initial assessment this aspect may not seem to be
         relevant in deciding whether the unit at Jhagadia is new
         undertaking or not, however, on overall consideration of
         relevant provisions and the object of the provisions, it
         emerges that so as to establish that it is a "new industrial
         undertaking"        an industrial undertaking must comply four

         must establish that it does not violate any one of the said
         conditions which include the requirement that it should not

         plant previously used in India for any industrial purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_73">         19.8 It is pertinent that the provision uses expression "for any
         industrial purpose" and the words "machinery" and "plant"
         and "building". Thus, what is necessary is that the machinery
         or plant or building at the unit seeking exemption should not
         have been previously used by anyone for any industrial
         purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_74">         19.9 Since the plants were installed and set-up by the
         petitioner at its client's premises for "industrial purpose" and
         the ownership rested with the petitioner, it was necessary to
         establish that the said plant/s or part of the plant/s or said
         machinery were not used in setting-up the unit at Jhagadia.
         However, unfortunately, these aspects are not considered by
         the authority and factual aspects are not verified and
         ascertained by the authority.

<p id="p_75">         19.10           Therefore, it was necessary to find out as to
         whether at the stage when the contract period expired and
         the contract were terminated, the plant (including machinery)
         i.e. floxal unit, was removed, retrieved and taken back by the
         petitioner or the title and ownership of the plant was, at that
         stage, transferred (upon sale thereof or on any other terms
         and conditions) to its clients or whether the same plant or
         part of it came to be shifted to Jhagadia and was used at the
         industrial unit set up by the petitioner at Jhagadia in 2009.

</p><p id="p_77">         20.   Of course, the petitioner has claimed that it employed
         new and improved technology. However, such assertion is not
         sufficient to reach to necessary conclusion in respect of the
         issue whether entire new plant and machinery was purchased
         and installed at Jhagadia or whole (or part of) the plant/s
         installed at the site of clients and previously used for
         industrial purpose, is used at Jhagadia and whether the
         petitioner comes within the purview of clause (vii) of sub-
         section (2) of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_50">section 3</a> or not.

<p id="p_78">         20.1 On this count, it is relevant to note that in the impugned
         order/s the apparent as well as implied consequences of the
         fact (that according to the terms of the contract, the title and
         ownership of the plant (i.e. Floxal unit) was retained by and
         remained with the petitioner during the entire period of the
         contracts and the plant was never sold and the title and
         ownership of the plant was never transferred but it continued
         to be of the petitioner), though vital, are not considered and
         decided by the authorities.

<p id="p_79">         21.   Examination and adjudication of the said issue would,
         obviously, require examination of relevant documents and
         other material. In this context, it is appropriate to take into
         account the submission / reply dated 25.2.2011 said to have
         been filed by the petitioner before Chief Electrical Inspector
         and Duty Collector wherein the petitioner, in para 8.3 of reply,
         has mentioned some details related to this aspect.

         applicant to disclose the details about capital investment and

         petitioner at the Jhagadia unit and/or used for and in the
