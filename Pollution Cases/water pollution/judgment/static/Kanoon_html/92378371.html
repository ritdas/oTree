              writ petitioners-appellants challenging order dated 03.03.2008 by

              which the learned Single Judge of this Court dismissed CWJC

              No.4568 of 2003 relying upon a decision of a division of this Court

              in case of Dilip Kumar Jha &amp; Anr. Vs. The State of Bihar &amp;

              Ors. reported in 1999 (1) PLJR 664.

<p id="p_4">                                 2. The aforesaid writ petition bearing CWJC

              No.4568 of 2003 was filed by the appellants along with proforma

              respondent nos. 5 to 8 of this Letters Patent Appeal for quashing

              office order no.7001 dated 28.04.2003 issued by the Bihar State

              Pollution Control Board, Patna (hereinafter referred to as 'the

              Board' for the sake of brevity) by which the services of the writ

              petitioners along with 16 others were terminated with effect from

              28.04.2003 and for a further direction to the respondents to reinstate

              the petitioners to their respective posts with effect from 28.04.2003.

              and a counter affidavit was filed on behalf of respondent nos.3 and

              4 contesting the claim of the petitioners. However after a detailed

              discussion the said writ petition was dismissed by a learned Single

              Judge of this Court vide order dated 03.03.2008 after arriving at the
 Patna High Court LPA No.242 of 2008 dt.16-07-2013

          following findings:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                             "In CWJC No.11899 of 1995 stand of the Board
                     was that since the pay scale of 1986 has been revised,
                     as such the Board has right to make appointment on
                     such posts which carries pay scale of proportionate
                     revised pay scale of Rs.2500/-. The writ application was
                     dismissed as no sanction of the Government had been
                     taken before making appointment. The L.P.A. no.960 of
                     1998 has been dismissed on 21.2.2007 and the order
                     passed in the writ application reported in 1999 (1)
                     P.L.J.R. 664 has been affirmed. It has been held that
                     Rule 8 of the Water Rules 1986 framed under <a href="/doc/850762/" id="a_1">Section
                     64</a> of the Water Act 1974 mandates deep and pervasive
                     control of the State Government over the State Board. It
                     is difficult for the Court to hold that in the matter of
                     selection of candidates for appointment, the Board can
                     deviate proviso to Rule 8 or that it can ignore any
                     direction issued by the State Government to stop the
                     selection when the same is held without complying with
                     the requirement of Rule 8. With regard to pay scale of
                     Rs.2500/- it was held that it is not unreasonable
                     restriction and cannot be interpreted as variable with
                     the revision of the pay because proviso to the rule
                     empowers the State Board to create post, make
                     appointment, carrying pay more than Rs.2500/- with
                     prior sanction of the State Government.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                             In view of the reported decision in 1991 (1)
                     P.L.J.R. 664 affirmed in L. P. A. No.960 of 1998 I do
                     not find that the order of termination issued on the
                     direction of the Deputy Secretary, Department of Forest
                     and Environment can be held to be illegal. In the
                     matters of appointment, termination, creation of posts
                     and abolition of posts, the State Government can put
                     restriction on the State Board. It has already been held
                     that such restriction is not unreasonable restriction."

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                             4. Against the aforesaid order of the learned Single

          Judge, the appellants have filed this Letters Patent Appeal claiming

          that the Board had earlier supported regularization of petitioners

          which was a conscious decision of the Board after due enquiry, but
 Patna High Court LPA No.242 of 2008 dt.16-07-2013


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                    4</span>




          only after receiving the letter of the Government, the authorities of

          the Board turned against the petitioners, although there was no valid

          ground for the same.</blockquote><p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">                             5. Learned counsel for the appellants stated that the

          appointment of the appellants were made by the Board and thus the

          Board and its authorities had to act independently on its own as per

          the provisions of law and they have not to tow the line of the

          Government. In this regard, he relied upon Rule 8 of Chapter 3 of

          the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1986

          (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules' for the sake of brevity) which

          had come into force on 30.04.1986.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                             6. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that

          the salary of the petitioners at the time of their appointment was

          much less than Rs.2,500.00 per month and hence the Board was

          fully entitled to make such appointment without any permission of

          the State Government as the Board was alone the master and had a

          free hand in framing the criteria for selection and appointing on its

          basis. In this connection he relied upon the decision of a Division

          Bench of this Court in case of Bihar State Pollution Control

          Board &amp; Ors. Vs. Dilip Kumar Jha &amp; Ors., reported in 2007(3)

          PLJR 109.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                             7. Learned counsel for the appellants averred that

          the learned Single Judge has wrongly confused the instant matter of
 Patna High Court LPA No.242 of 2008 dt.16-07-2013


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                    5</span>




          CWJC No.4568 of 2003 with the earlier writ petition of the

          petitioner bearing CWJC No.2148 of 2003 as the instant writ

          petition is only against the petitioners' removal dated 28.04.2003,

          whereas the earlier writ petition was for regularization of

          petitioners' service which was disposed of on 29.07.2004 due to

          removal of the petitioners. Hence, now this Court has only to see as

          to whether the removal of the petitioners from the sanctioned

          vacant posts on which they were appointed by a competent

          authority to whom power was delegated was legal and proper,

          especially when the appellants had served the Board since 1987,

          1991 and 1984 etc. and they fulfilled all the criteria of Class IV

          posts.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                             8. On the other hand learned counsel for the

          respondent-State of Bihar stated that initial appointment of the

          appellants were found to be irregular and in any view of the matter,

          the appellants were casual employees and hence they can be

          removed from such posts at any time. He also submitted that

          admittedly appellants were casual/adhoc appointees and as such

          they had no legal right to be regularised and if they wanted

          regularization on the basis of working in the Board for more than

          10 years they should have filed a representation before the

          authorities for the said purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                             9. Learned counsel for the respondent-State of Bihar
 Patna High Court LPA No.242 of 2008 dt.16-07-2013


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                    6</span>




          averred that the learned Single Judge had found the initial process

          of appellants' appointment to be illegal as the prescribed selection

          process was not followed by the authorities concerned. In any view

          of the matter, the appellants' claim for regularization had been

          rejected by a Bench of this Court vide order dated 29.07.2004

          passed in CWJC No.2184 of 2003.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                             10. Learned counsel for the respondents-State of

          Bihar argued that Rule 8 of the Rules was with respect to creation

          and abolition of posts in which there was no difference between

          Class I, II, III and IV posts and the Board was empowered to make

          appointment as per the aforesaid Rule. Hence, the Board having

          taken a decision in the matter, the same cannot be legally

          challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                             11. Learned counsel for the respondents- Bihar State

          Pollution Control Board and its authorities stated that initial

          engagement of the appellants in the Board either on Class III posts

          or    on     Class     IV     posts       had   been   made    without      any

          advertisement/notice          and     without    following    the   rules    of

          recruitment, roster and reservation and therefore initial engagement

          of the appellants was in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the

          Constitution of India. However, they were continuing in the Board

          without any interruption and were being paid their wages as

          prescribed by the Labour and Employment Department, Govt. of
 Patna High Court LPA No.242 of 2008 dt.16-07-2013


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                    7</span>




          Bihar or by the Board on the basic pay of Class III and Class IV

          posts with admissible dearness allowance without any increment.

</p><p id="p_14">                             12. Learned counsel for the respondent-Board

          submitted that the Board in its meeting dated 25.07.1986 had

          already resolved that since the service rules for the employees of

          the Board had not been framed, hence Rules applicable to the

          employees of the State of Bihar shall be applicable to the

          employees of the Board also. Direction as per the resolution of the

          said meeting had been issued by the Board vide office order dated

          11.08.1986 under the signature of its Member-Secretary. Hence, the

          alleged appointment of the appellants will also have to be

          considered as per the Rules applicable to the employees of the State

          Government. In this connection, learned counsel for the respondent-

          Board relied upon a decision of a Single Judge of this Court in case

          of Dilip Kumar Jha &amp; Anr (supra) affirmed by the Division

          Bench of this Court in case of Bihar State Pollution Control

          Board &amp; Ors. (supra) and stated that in the same breadth analogy

          may be taken that the State Government had a say in the matter of

          removal of such employees who are class III and Class IV

          employees.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                             13. Learned counsel for the respondent-Board also

          relied upon a Full Bench decision of this Court in case of Ram

          Sevak Yadav Vs. State of Bihar &amp; Ors, reported in 2013 (1)
 Patna High Court LPA No.242 of 2008 dt.16-07-2013

          PLJR 964 specially paragraph 41 thereof which is as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                        "The public power to make appointment on public
                        posts is conferred for public good. The power is given
                        to the officer concerned by the government in trust,
                        that it shall be used and not abused. If the trust is
                        belied, the protection conferred upon a government
                        servant stands denuded. The answerability and
                        accountability is then individual of the officer. The
                        government is duty bound to take appropriate civil/
                        criminal action against the officer. The illegality in
                        the appointment is not a one way street. If there was
                        someone willing to pay a price for the job, there was
                        another waiting to take advantage of the same by
                        fixing a price. It is not without reason that majority of
                        such appointments relate to class III and IV posts. The
                        standard by which the government professes to act is
                        the same standard by which its actions shall be
                        judged. Therefore whenever the government
                        terminates an appointment being illegal, it is the
                        constitutional duty of the government to
                        simultaneously take action against the officials who
                        belied the trust of the government. Those who made
                        hay while the sun shined must see the darker cloudy
                        days also".</blockquote><p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">                              14. Considering the averments made by learned

          counsel for the parties and the materials on record it transpires

          that the aforesaid decision of a Full Bench of this Court in case of

          Ram Sevak Yadav (supra) is with respect to general employees

          of the State Government and their appointments and their

          termination. The said decision does not in any way concern with

          the question of appointment in the Board which was governed by

          its own Act of 1974 and Rules of 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                              15. From the arguments of learned counsel for

          the parties and the materials on record it also transpires that the
 Patna High Court LPA No.242 of 2008 dt.16-07-2013


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                    9</span>




          petitioners were appointed on vacant sanctioned posts and their

          appointments were made by a competent authority of the Board

          to whom the power was delegated. It is also not in dispute that

          the appellants had fulfilled the requisite qualifications and other

          requirements for the posts. They have admittedly also served for

          much more than 10 years in the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                              16. These aspects of the matter were placed

          before a Bench of this Court in CWJC No.2148 of 2003 which

          was filed by the appellants and others for regularization of their

          services, but in the meantime the order of appellants' removal

          was passed by the Board on 28.04.2003 and hence the said writ

          petition was disposed of by a Bench of this Court on 29.07.2004

          without going into the merits. In the said circumstances, the

          appellants had to file CWJC No.4568 of 2003 out of which this

          Letters Patent Appeal has arisen challenging their removal by the

          Board vide order dated 28.04.2003.

<p id="p_20">                              17. It may be stated in this regard that the legality

          of appellants' appointment and their competence and their

          regular work etc. had been fully considered by the Board in its

          68th and 69th meetings dated 07.07.2001 and 12.02.2002 and it

          was decided that the process of regularization of casual/adhoc

          employees in different categories would be completed by the 10 th

          of April, 2002. Thereafter they also took legal advice/opinion of

          the then Advocate General who in his opinion dated 20.08.2002

          stated that the services of casual/adhoc employees can be

          regularised if their initial appointment had been made by the

          authority competent for the said purpose and sanctioned posts

          were available on which the said persons could be absorbed,

          especially when such employees had served for a long duration.

          In that opinion, reference was also made to a decision of the

          Apex Court in case of             Union of India and others Versus

          Pradeep Kumar Saxena reported in 1995 (4) Supplementary

          S. C. C. 69.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                              18. Rule 8 of the Rules of 1986 clearly provided

          that the Board was competent to create such posts in different

          scales as it considered necessary for the efficient performance of

          its functions, make appointment against such posts, abolish such

          posts so created and consequently terminate the appointments

          made against such posts provided that the State Board shall

          obtain prior sanction of the State Government for the creation,

          abolition and appointment to the posts above the maximum pay

          scale of Rs.2,500.00 per month.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                              19. Admittedly at the time of appointment of the

          appellants their pay scale was much below Rs.2,500.00 and

          hence according to the said Rules the State Government had no

          role to play in the matter and it was specifically within the

          jurisdiction of the Board to create such posts, make appointments

          on such posts and terminate the appointments as per the Rules.

          Thus, the Board having decided in its aforementioned meetings

          in favour of the appellants and the opinion of the Advocate

          General also affirming the said resolution of the Board, there was

          no occasion for the authorities of the Board to take a U-turn in

          the matter and refer the matter to the State Government for

          approving the regularization of the appellants vide letter dated

          17.12.2002.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                              20. In response to the aforesaid letter of the

          Board, the Deputy Secretary, Department of Environment and

          Forest, Government of Bihar issued letter dated 04.03.2003

          stating that there was no question of their regularization assuming

          that the casual/adhoc appointment of the said employees were

          illegal. Thereafter, the said Deputy Secretary vide letter dated

          19.04.2003 directed the Board for removal of such employees.

          The said authority did not even wait for the Board's meeting

          fixed for 03.05.2003 although the Board was the only competent

          authority to take action in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_24">                              21. The aforesaid letters of the Government were

          absolutely frivolous and misconceived as they had no authority to

          give such directions especially when the presumption that the

          appointments of such casual/adhoc employees were illegal, was

          not based on any valid materials or basis, rather it was against the

          materials on record considering which the Board had earlier

          taken the decision to regularise their services. In spite of the

          aforesaid facts, the Board meekly surrendered to the illegal

          directions of the Department and passed the impugned orders

          dated 28.04.2003 terminating the services of the appellants and

          other similarly situated persons.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                              22. So far the reliance of the respondents upon

          the decisions of this Court in case of Dilip Kumar Jha &amp; Anr.

          (supra) affirmed by the Division Bench in case of the Bihar

          State Pollution Control Board &amp; Ors. (supra) is concerned,

          the said decisions are with respect to <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_2">Section 18</a> of the Act

          regarding powers of Central Board or the State Board in the

          performance of its functions under the Act. Hence, the said

          power of the State Government is limited only with respect to the

          functions of the Board as provided under the Act.

</p><p id="p_26">                              23. The functions of the Board are provided in

          <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_3">Section 17</a> of the Act and from a bare perusal of the aforesaid

          provision it transpires that it does not include the matters of

          appointment, absorption or termination. Hence, in the instant case

          neither the said case laws, nor the said provision of law would be

          attracted.

          abolition of posts as well as appointments and termination against

          such posts will be governed by Rule 8 of the Rules which has

          been dealt in detail in paragraph 13 of the decision of a Division

          Bench of this Court in case of the Bihar State Pollution

          Control Board &amp; Ors. (supra). The said provision and its

          interpretation clearly shows that the State Government had no

          authority at all with regard to any appointment made by the

          Board on any post having basic salary less than of Rs.2500.00.

          Hence, admittedly the appellants having been appointed in the

          salary of much less than Rs.2500.00, the State Government or its

          Department had no authority to interfere in such matters.

</p><p id="p_28">                              25. It may be noted in this regard that the Board,

          apart from its being State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of

          India is also a creation of Statute and is an independent and

          autonomous body capable of taking steps on their own as per the

          law governing the Board without any external pressure or

          influence. Hence, if any external pressure or influence is exerted

          on the Board against the provisions of law or the settled

          principles of law and such act is brought before the Court of law,

          it has to be set aside. These aspects of the matter have not been

          considered by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order

          dated 03.03.2008 passed in CWJC No.4568 of 2003.

                        Appeal is allowed, the impugned orders are set aside and the
