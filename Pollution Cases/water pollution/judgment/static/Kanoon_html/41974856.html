mining area fell in a hill top (un-surveyed hill poramboke) having

an elevation of 628 meters, and was 2.34 K.Ms away from the

Sarugudu Reserve Forest boundary; the proposed mining area is

not in the reserve forest; it was having a tree growth of less than

0.4 density; no application was received from the lease holder or

the concerned authorities, i.e the revenue department and the

mining department, for removal or cutting of trees in the leased

area; the lease holder and the concerned authorities had not

approached the forest department for assessing the value of the

existing tree growth; and no recent accidental death of any wild

animal was reported at the office of the Divisional Forest Officer by

the concerned Range Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_27">      In his additional counter-affidavit the 7th respondent-

Divisional Forest Officer, Narsipatnam stated that, as per the

report of the Divisional Forest Officer dated 18.08.2012, the mining

area was located 2.34 K.M. away from Sarugudu reserve forest; the

density of vegetation was less than 0.4; as per classification of

forest cover, by the Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, all lands

with forest tree cover with a canopy density of between 10% to 39%

are described as 'open forest'; all forest land with poor tree growth

mainly of small or stunted trees, having canopy density of less

than 10%, are described as 'scrub'; and as per the glossary of

forestry terms, described in the Working Plan of Narsipatnam

Forest Division for the period 2013-14 to 2022-23, when the

canopy density is between 0.1 and 0.4 the vegetation type is 'open',

and when the density is under 0.1 the forest type is scrub; no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  14</span>




recent incidents of accidental death of wild animals had been

reported to the office of the Divisional Forest Officer by the

concerned field staff of Narsipatnam Range or the public or officials

of other departments; during January, 2018 census the concerned

field staff had reported the presence of wildlife in Sarugudu reserve

forest; no application had been received from the lease holder, or

from the revenue and mining department officials, for valuation,

removal or cutting of trees in the leased area; and, therefore, he

was not aware of the alleged removal of vegetation or trees in the

leased area.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      The 7th respondent further stated that the District Collector,

vide proceedings dated 28.09.2014, had accorded permission for

diversion of 0.9741 hectares of forest land in favour of the

Executive Engineer, Panchayat Raj Division, Narsipatnam for

formation of a road from Sarugudu to Sundarakota; all the

villagers were using this road ever sine its formation; in terms of

G.O.Ms.No.532 dated 21.07.1975, the Revenue Divisional Officer,

all Tahsildars and Deputy Tahsildars were required to perform the

functions of Forest Officers, and compound forest offences

committed in un-surveyed lands and registered poramboke lands

at the disposal of the revenue department;             the Revenue

Department had not reported illegal removal of trees by the lease

holder; the lease area, in question, is revenue land located 2.34

K.M away from Sarugudu reserve forest; the conditions mentioned

in the proceedings dated 18.12.2014 were not communicated to

the Divisional Forest Officer, Narsipatnam, and he is not aware of

any such proceedings; no application was received for removal or

cutting of trees in the leased area; whenever leases are granted in

areas    outside   the   lands   under   the   control   of   the   Forest

Department, and having tree growth, generally the concerned

departments takes steps to clear the tree growth before handing

over the leased area to the lease holder; as per G.O.Ms.No.1757

dated 17.09.1978, the forest department is entrusted with the sale

of forest produce in Government lands; as per Section 4 of the

Andhra Pradesh (Protection of Trees and Timber in Public

Premises) Rules, 1989, no trees, timber, fuel, fodder etc. should be

disposed without the written concurrence of the Divisional Forest

Officer concerned; in the present case, no such action was taken

by the revenue department before handing over land to the lease

holder; the lease holder and the concerned authorities i.e. the

revenue and mining departments did not approach the forest

department for assessing the value of tree growth; and as the

mining area is located outside the reserve forest, the forest

department is not aware of the irregularities allegedly committed

by the lease holder.
</p>
<p id="p_29">        In his counter-affidavit, the 8th respondent stated that the

proceedings of the District Collector dated 18.12.2014 is not the

basis for grant of mining lease to him; the petitioner was aware of

the same despite which he made false statements; the petitioner

was earlier working for him, and he used to pay for the services

rendered by the petitioner; since his services were not satisfactory,

he was not engaged thereafter; the        Writ Petition is lacking in

bona-fides; the petitioner is also involved in criminal cases,

registered in Nathavaram Police Station, for cheating, forgery and

for other offences in Crime Nos.5 of 2017 and 60 of 1997; the

petitioner has made false assertions and is liable for perjury;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                   16</span>




Laterite mineral was a major mineral till January, 2015; however,

by virtue of the amendment to the MMRD Act dated 23.07.2016, it

became a minor mineral; consequently grant of mining lease is

under a different legal regime i.e the A.P. Minor Mineral

Concession Rules, 1966; when the said mineral was a major

mineral, by virtue of the provisions of the MMRD Amendment Act,

all applications pending with the authorities, including his

application, for grant of leasehold rights for major minerals stood

rejected;   a fresh application was made under the A.P. Minor

Mineral Concession Rules, 1966 based on which a lease was

granted vide proceedings dated 12.04.2017; after complying with

the conditions in the grant order, Form-G agreement was executed

on 18.04.2017; he has complied with the conditions of the grant

order, and the conditions contained in the statutory lease in Form-

G; it is not even the petitioner's case that the 8th respondent had

violated either of these orders i.e. the grant order or the lease

conditions; reliance placed on the proceedings dated 18.12.2014 is

misplaced as it was issued long prior to the amendment to the

MMRD Act; it does not form the basis for grant of a lease in favour

of the 8th respondent; it has lost its relevance since the petitioner's

earlier application, for grant of a mining lease, stood rejected by

operation of law; the lease area is 2.34 k.m. away from the forest

boundary; the petitioner has falsely alleged that it is close to the

reserve forest area; the allegation that the reserve forest is a

habitat for many wild animals is also false and is, in any event,

vague; the petitioner has not even specified the kind of wild

animals which allegedly inhabit the forest area; at any rate since

the forest is 2.34 K.M. away, the mining activity would not have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                   17</span>




any impact on wild animals; the allegation that the lease area had

thousands of trees of various kinds is false; the reports of the

officers clearly show that the leased area consists of shrubs and

bushes;    G.O.Ms.No.2      was    subsequently     amended      vide

G.O.Ms.No.107 dated 30.07.2016; G.O.Ms.Nos.2 and 107 did not

authorize the District Collector to impose any conditions, and at

any rate the proceedings of the District Collector dated 18.12.2014

has nothing to do with the lease granted to the 8th respondent; the

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests had issued clarification, vide

proceedings dated 09.12.2003, regarding the buffer zone between

the mining area and the reserve forest; there is no concept of buffer

zone to a reserve forest; keeping in view the clarification of the

forest department, the grant order did not rightly impose any

condition as suggested by the District Collector; the allegation that

he had removed 20,000 trees for the purpose of mining, and 5000

trees for formation of a road, is false; he had not cut any tree; the

allegation that 200 lorries were moving from the mining area was

also false; and only 15 to 20 lorries move the mineral from the

mining area every day.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      The 8th respondent would further submit that the allegation

that a journalist was attacked at his behest is false; While Crime

No.32 of 2017 was registered against five persons, his name was

not mentioned either in the FIR or in the charge-sheet; the

allegation that a bear died under the wheels of a vehicle is false; no

case was registered either in the Police Station or brought to the

notice of the forest department; the photographs filed by the

petitioner are not clear, and could have been morphed; no such

incident took place; the Department of Mines and Geology issued
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       18</span>




notice dated 23.09.2016 directing him to submit a mining plan

approved by the Deputy Director of Mines and Geology, along with

consent for establishment from the A.P. Pollution Control Board

and Environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment

and Forests within six months; he had, accordingly, submitted the

mining plan approved by the Deputy Director of Mines and

Geology,     Visakhapatnam       vide        letter    dated    07.11.2016,

environmental clearance approved by the Ministry of Environment

Forest     and   Climate    Change,        Hyderabad    vide   letter   dated

27.02.2017, and the consent for establishment approved by the

A.P. Pollution Control Board, Visakhapatnam vide letter dated

24.03.2017;      after   submission    of    these    documents,    the   2nd

respondent issued proceedings dated 12.04.2016 granting quarry

lease for Laterite over an extent of 20.17 hectares; he executed a

lease deed in Form-G with the 3rd respondent who issued

proceedings dated 18.04.2017 directing him to submit consent for

operations order from the A.P. Pollution Control Board, before

commencing quarrying operations; the order of consent for

operations was submitted, vide letter dated 02.05.2017, to the

third respondent before commencement of quarrying operations;

and the District Collector had issued a no objection certificate

dated 07.05.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      The 8th respondent also stated that, after commencement of

the mining operations, he had laid a road, for a length of 2.75 K.M,

from the mining area to Sundarkota - Sarugudu road; it was false

to state that trees were cut for laying the road; only shrubs and

bushes were removed; as per the directions of the mining

department, he had planted 3000 trees on both sides of the road;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   19</span>




he had planted 12000 trees (of which 6700 trees were supplied by

the Department of Forests, Narsipatnam) around the mining area

by arranging water facility through drip irrigation; the letter of the

Forest Section Officer dated 21.08.2017, and the photographs of

plantations and water tanks were being filed; the petitioner had

made several unfounded allegations, contrary to the inspection

carried out much prior to the lease, only to blackmail and exploit

the 8th respondent; the lease was granted with the consent of the

Gram Panchayat, of which the petitioner is a member; the

petitioner made a false complaint in the name of Ganga Raju who,

on enquiry, stated that his signature was forged; Sri Ganga Raju

gave a complaint to the Nathavaram Police Station stating that the

petitioner had forged his signature; he (i.e the 8th respondent) has

deployed heavy machinery at the quarrying area paying huge

rentals for the said equipment; more than 300 persons were

working in the quarry area; they are deprived of their livelihood

because of stoppage of quarrying operations; he had contractual

commitments to third parties for supply of laterite minerals; if

quarrying operations were not started, it would result in breach of

trust and contractual commitments; he was paying seigniorage fee

of Rs.10 crores per annum, besides income-tax and GST to the

government regularly; stoppage of work would also result in loss of

revenue to the Government; and the interim order should therefore

be vacated and the Writ Petition should be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_32">      In the affidavit, filed in reply to the counter-affidavit filed by

the 3rd respondent, the petitioner stated that the 1st respondent

issued G.O.Ms. No.2 dated 02.01.2013 appointing the District

Level Scrutiny Committee to grant no objection to the proposed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                  20</span>




mining leases; this G.O. was in force till it was superseded by

G.O.Ms. No.107 dated 30.07.2016; when G.O.Ms. No.2 dated

02.01.2013 was in force, the 8th respondent made his second

application on 30.05.2016, and on the very next day i.e.

31.05.2016 the 3rd respondent had directly submitted his proposal

to the 2nd respondent recommending grant of quarry lease; the

authorities had taken NOC dated 28.01.2014 issued by the

Grampanchayat, and the NOC dated 18.12.2014 issued by the

District Level Scrutiny Committee, into consideration and had

processed the application of the 8th respondent; except the NOC

issued by the DLSC, there is no other NOC in existence with

respect to the subject mining area; the District Collector,

Visakhapatnam had submitted a report confirming the correctness

of the DLSC proposal vide letter dated 18.05.2017; the conditions,

imposed in proceedings dated 18.12.2014, would form part of the

conditions of the grant; the 8th respondent is obligated to obey the

conditions stipulated by the District Level Scrutiny Committee; the

8th respondent had failed to fulfil any of the said conditions; he had

cut the trees, and had removed the thicket bushes without

obtaining prior permission, and he had failed to pay compensation;

existence of trees is recorded in the mining plan; the District Level

Committee had taken into consideration all factors, particularly

that the mineral had to be transported through the road adjacent

to the reserve forest, and had imposed the conditions with a view

to protect the forest and the wild life; a portion of the road passes

through Sarugudu reserve forest, and comes out of the Reserve

forest at the end of Sarugudu Reserve Forest boundary; the

authorities had, therefore, permitted the 8th respondent to form a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                   21</span>




road to Sundarakota connecting the road at the end point of the

Reserve forest; the entire area, at the right hand side of the "Y"

junction, is the reserve forest; the left hand side road leads to

Sundarkota; as the mineral had to be transported through the

road passing adjacent to the reserve forest boundary, construction

of a compound wall was essential; the 8th respondent is

transporting mineral through Sarugudu Reserve Forest unlawfully;

the 8th respondent is put to strict proof of his contention that he

had planted 3000 trees on both sides of the road, and has planted

12000 trees in the mining area; Sri Gangaraju, having complained

against the 8th respondent, could not withstand the harassment

meted out to him by the 8th respondent; the 8th respondent was

idle till he obtained a mining lease, and the question of his

providing employment to others does not arise; the 8th respondent

is a resident of Visakhapatnam, and the very fact that the counter-

foils produced by him belong to Kakinada falsifies his version; the

petitioner has 3½ acres of cashew garden; the money transactions

into his account were in respect of the sale of cashew to M/s.Pavan

Kumar Agency at Kakinada; the 8th respondent had obtained

counter-foils from M/s.Pavan Kumar Agency, and had cooked up a

false story; he got a false criminal case foisted against the

petitioner in Cr. No.5 of 2017; the said complaint was closed before

the Lok-Adalat; the Writ Petition is filed only in public interest, and

the petitioner has no personal interest in the matter; he has no

personal grudge or animosity against the 8th respondent; when

NOC was granted, the petitioner was not a member of the

Grampanchayat; the consent of the Grampanchayat was obtained

by mis-representation stating that the mining area is situated at a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                    22</span>




distance of 2.4 kilometres from the residential area of Thorrada

village; the mining area falls within 800 metres from the village;

the 8th respondent has used excavators to remove and load the

minerals into trucks; and the very fact that the 8th respondent

produces 7½ lakh tonnes of Laterite every year falsifies his

contention of transporting mineral only with 15 to 20 lorries per

day.
</p>
<p id="p_33">       In his affidavit, filed in reply to the counter-affidavit filed by

the 3rd respondent, the petitioner stated that location of the mining

area was suppressed, and the resolution of the Gram Panchayat

was obtained misrepresenting facts to the general body; the gram-

panchayat was led to believe that the mining area is located at a

distance of 2.5 kilometres, while it is located only at a distance of

700 metres; as per the Toposheet prepared by the department of

Survey of India, the area in Torrada village is classified as Dense

Mixed Jungle; as per the definition provided by the Forest Survey

of India, all lands with a forest cover of trees, with a canopy

density of 40-69%, fall within the category of dense forest; it is

therefore not true to state that there are no trees in this area; the

District Forest Officer is also a member of the District Level

Scrutiny    Committee;    and    the    conditions   imposed    by    the

Committee, as well as the conditions imposed by the Forest

Department, necessitated compliance.

requirement of an NOC;      though the Rules do not prescribe a

detailed procedure for grant of NOC, executive instructions have

been issued to fill up this gap; in the exercise of its powers under

Rule 9-S of the 1966 Rules, the State government had issued

G.O.Ms.No. 181 dated 28.5.1998 prescribing the procedure to

issue an NOC; G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 2.1.2013 was issued thereafter

appointing the DLSC, in the place of the Tahsildar, to grant NOCs;

the NOC is a statutory requirement, and is mandatory for the

mining lease application to be processed; there is no provision,

either in the 1966 Rules, or in the executive instructions,

restraining the NOC issuing authority i.e the District Level

Scrutiny Committee (in short the DLSC) from imposing conditions

while granting NOC; as the DLSC has been appointed to perform

the statutory function of granting an NOC, it is entitled to impose

conditions for such grant in the absence of any restriction; the 8th

respondent was well aware that his application, for grant of a

mining lease, was processed on the basis of the NOC granted by

the DLSC; the order of       grant, and the lease orders dated

12.04.2017 and 18.4.2017 respectively, were issued subject to the

outcome of the enquiry in respect of the NOC; the present mining

lease is covered by the NOC passed under G.O.Ms.No.2 only; the

conditions imposed by the DLSC       should be read as part of the

conditions imposed under the grant and the lease proceedings;

violation of the said condition would result in termination of the

lease under Rule 12(1)(5)(h(xii) of the 1966 Rules; and the 8th

respondent had failed to comply with the conditions imposed by

the DLSC, in its proceedings dated 18.12.2014, to safeguard the

environment, particularly to restrict exploitation of trees, to save

trees.

<p id="p_37">         On the other hand Sri C.V. Mohan Reddy, Learned Senior

Counsel appearing on behalf of the 8th respondent, would submit

that,    when   the    8th   respondent's   earlier   application    dated

18.09.2009 was under process, the Tahsildar was authorized to

issue the NOC;         the Government of Andhra Pradesh issued

G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013 prescribing guidelines for grant of

NOC by the DLSC; the DLSC granted a No objection Certificate,

vide proceedings dated 18.12.2014, subject to certain conditions;

the NOC is not contemplated either under the 1957 Act or the

1966 Rules; it is merely an administrative arrangement to

ascertain whether Govt. land, over which lease is sought, is

available for lease or not; NOC is an internal departmental affair,

without the intervention/ knowledge of the applicant who has

sought grant of lease; the proceedings of the DLSC were neither

communicated to the 8th respondent nor is it referred to in any

consequential /subsequent proceedings; the Government of India

promulgated      the    Mines    and     Minerals     (Development    and

<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_16">Regulation) Act</a>, 2015 on 12.01.2015; 31 minerals were deleted

from the list of major minerals, and included in the list of minor

minerals by Notification No S.O 423(E) dated 10.02.2015 under

<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_17">Section 3(3)</a> of the 1957 Act; Laterite, which was hitherto a major

mineral, has, by virtue of the above notification, become a minor

mineral; by virtue of the amendment to the 1957 Act, all pending

applications, excluding those where a letter of intent (LOI) was

issued, stood rejected; thereafter the State Government issued

GO.MS No. 56 dated 31-04-2016, amending the 1966 Rules,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                 25</span>




requiring all applicants for mining leases to apply afresh wherever

the mineral has become a minor mineral; G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02-

01-2013 was preceded by G.O.Ms. No.181 dated 28-05-1998; both

of them are administrative instructions issued by the Government

of A.P. to facilitate easy processing of applications for grant of

mining leases relating to government lands i.e. to ascertain

whether the land has any encumbrances like assignment or forest

land etc; there is no statutory basis for the said G.Os; under G.O

Ms. No 181 dated: 28-5-1998, it was the Tahsildar who alone could

grant an NOC; the Government of Andhra Pradesh issued

G.O.Ms.107 dated 30.07.2016 superseding G.O.Ms.No.2 dated

02.01.2013, providing for a new procedure for grant of NOC to

lease applications; one significant change was that the Tahsildar

was given authority to grant NOC dispensing with the DLSC; in

respect of revenue lands, adjoining or within 500 meters distance

from the reserve forest boundary, the Tahsildar was required to

issue NOC only after a no objection report was obtained from the

concerned Divisional Forest Officer; the application of the 8th

respondent was processed, and an order of grant was issued by the

Director of Mines and Geology on 12.04.2017; the Grant order does

not reflect the conditions mentioned in the proceedings of the

DLSC; the 8th respondent is bound by the Grant Order and the

statutory lease agreement in Form-G executed on 18.4.2017; and

even if the proceedings of the DLSC dated 18.12.2014 is assumed

to apply to the 8th respondent's mining lease, these conditions did

not form part of any of the statutory proceedings issued later,

which alone are binding on the 8th respondent.

Ac.49.85 cents of Thorada of Sarugudu revenue village, was

forwarded; the Assistant Director of Mines and Geology had called

for a report on the classification and availability of the area

applied; and the Tahsildar, Nathavaram had, by proceedings dated

06.03.2013 and 27.04.2013, reported that the quarry lease area

was an un-surveyed hill poramboke, the Assistant Director, Survey

and Land Records, had allotted new survey number as 532 and

had approved the same after scrutinizing the records, there were

no historical monument traces, irrigation canals, H.T. Lines etc,

the forest boundary was at a distance of 2.4 K.M. from the nearest

Sarugudu-1 reserve forest boundary, a road already existed from

Sarugudu to Sundarakota village, however the road for the

proposed mining area had to be laid, and to that effect a combined

sketch was being furnished.

<p id="p_40">      The District Collector further stated that a joint inspection

was conducted on 07.05.2013 by the Revenue Divisional Officer,

Narsipatnam, the Divisional Forest Officer, Narsipatnam and the

Assistant Director, Mines and Geology, Anakapalli; their report

revealed that the proposed extent was covered in Survey No.532;

the village was 2.34 K.Ms away from the nearest Sarugudu-1

reserve forest boundary in any corner; the proposed mining area

was between latitude 17.52067 to 17.51889 and longitude

82.35364 to 82.35364 with small alterations; no assignment was

the 8th respondent had filed an application on 18.09.2009; before

that, there were no applications pending; it was a first priority

application of the applicant; basing on the recommendations of the

joint inspection team and field level officers, and the Grama Sabha

resolution, the proposals were being forwarded with a direction to

contended by the petitioner that any of the conditions in the grant

his case that the conditions stipulated in the No Objection

Certificate issued by the District Collector dated18.12.2014 has

been violated.
</p>
<p id="p_55">      As noted hereinabove, the 8th respondent had submitted an

application for grant of mining lease earlier on 18.09.2009. The

entire exercise of inspection and survey was undertaken pursuant

thereto, the matter was placed before the DLSC thereafter, and its

recommendations are those referred to in the proceedings of the

District Collector dated 18.12.2014.      The fact, however, remains

that, as a consequence of the amendment to the 1957 Act and

insertion of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_31">Section 10-A</a> therein with retrospective effect from

12.01.2015, the 8th respondent's application for grant of mining

thereafter, submitted a fresh application on 30.05.2016.

</p><p id="p_56">      It is no doubt true that, when the 8th respondent made the

fresh application on 30.05.2016, G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013

was   still   in   force   as   G.O.Ms.No.107,    which   superceded

G.O.Ms.No.2, was issued thereafter on 30.07.2016. However, by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                   36</span>




the time the Director of Mines and Geology granted a quarry lease

vide proceedings dated 12.04.2017, and a lease agreement in

Form-G was entered into on 18.04.2017, G.O.Ms.No.107 dated

30.07.2016 had already come into force superceding the earlier

G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013. G.O.Ms.No.107 dated 30.07.2016

conferred power on the Tahsildar to cause an inspection, and to

submit a report to the Assistant Director of Mines and Geology.

The said G.O. substituted the Tahsildar as the NOC issuing

authority in the place of the DLSC.     The No Objection Certificate,

issued by the Tahsildar, is for grant of a mining lease to the eligible

applicant. It enables the Director of Mines and Geology to grant a

mining lease and execute a lease agreement with the lessee

permitting the latter to quarry minor mineral.         The executive

instructions issued in G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013 required a

joint inspection team to cause an inspection and submit its report

to the District Collector. The DLSC was required to scrutinize the

joint inspection report, and take a decision regarding grant of NOC.

G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013 related to grant of NOC in respect

of government lands.    It did not specifically confer any power to

prescribe conditions for grant of NOC.      Since a mining lease is

granted only on the lessee obtaining environmental clearance,

consent for establishment and consent for operations from the

Pollution Control Board, it is debatable whether the DLSC can

impose any further conditions, more so in the absence of any

specific provision in this regard in G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013.

In any event, by the time a lease was granted to the 8th respondent,

and a lease agreement was executed in his favour, G.O.Ms.No.2

dated 02.01.2013 stood superceded by G.O.Ms.No.107 dated

30.07.2016. We find considerable force in the submission of Sri

C.V.Mohan Reddy, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of

the 8th respondent, that the proceedings of the District Collector

dated 18.12.2014, granting a conditional NOC in terms of

G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013, ceased to have any application

after the amendment to the 1957 Act with effect from 12.01.2015,

and on G.O.Ms.No.107 dated 30.07.2016 coming into force.

</p><p id="p_57">      The Director of Mines and Geology granted a quarry lease in

favour of the 8th respondent, vide proceedings dated 12.04.2017,

subject to the outcome of the enquiry on the NOC by the District

Collector.   The Assistant Director of Mines and Geology, in his

letter addressed to the 8th respondent on 18.04.2017, had also

observed that the permission granted to the 8th respondent, to

commence quarrying operations for Laterite, was subject to the

outcome of the enquiry on the NOC by the District Collector.

While neither of the aforesaid proceedings disclose what the

enquiry on the NOC by the District Collector related to, it does

appear from the material on record that the enquiry was caused on

the complaint of Sri   B.Ganga Raju who had requested that no

mining lease be granted to the 8th respondent, as it would affect

the rights of tribals. Pursuant thereto, the Director of Mines and

Geology appears to have addressed a letter dated 31.03.2017

requesting the District Collector to enquire into the contents of the

petition filed by Sri B.Ganga Raju. It is only on 08.05.2017 that

the District Collector appears to have submitted his report to the

Director of Mines and Geology stating that the petition filed by Sri

B. Ganga Raju is fake; the allegations mentioned in the petition

were also not truthful; proposals, for grant of mining lease in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                  38</span>




favour of the 8th respondent, were being sent following the

guidelines issued in G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013; and further

action may be taken in the matter.       By the time the District

Collector sent his letter on 08.05.2017, the Director of Mines and

Geology had already granted the quarry lease on 12.04.2017, and

a lease agreement had also been entered into with the 8th

respondent on 18.04.2017.     It does appear that reference in the

grant order dated 12.04.2017, to the outcome of the enquiry on the

NOC by the District Collector, is the enquiry which was required to

be caused on the complaint of Sri B. Ganga Raju which the District

Collector, in his proceedings dated 08.05.2017, has held to be

fake.
</p>
<p id="p_58">        In his report dated 08.05.2017 the District Collector has,

however, referred only to the earlier proposal and to the

recommendations      made   by   him   under   G.O.Ms.No.2    dated

02.01.2013 which does appear to indicate that the District

Collector was also of the view that the conditions imposed in the

proceedings dated 18.12.2014, which was issued in terms of the

executive instructions issued in G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013,

should be complied with.    It is relevant, in this context, to note

that the proceedings dated 18.12.2014 was addressed by the

District Collector to the Assistant Director of Mines and Geology;

and, while a copy thereof was marked to the Revenue Divisional

Officer, the Tahsildar and the Director of Mines and Geology, the

said letter was not communicated to the 8th respondent. Further,

neither in the order of grant dated 12.04.2017, nor in the lease

agreement executed on 18.04.2017, is there any reference to the

conditions imposed in the proceedings of the District Collector
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                 39</span>




dated 18.12.2014. It does appear that the Director of Mines and

Geology, while granting a quarry lease in favour of the 8th

respondent on 12.04.2017 and in executing a lease deed in his

favour on 18.04.2017, has chosen not to impose any such

conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_59">      While the 8th respondent cannot be faulted for not abiding by

the conditions in the proceedings dated 18.12.2014, the contents

of which were not even brought to his notice, the question which

would necessitate examination is whether the Director of Mines

and Geology had erred in granting a lease in favour of the 8th

respondent, and in having executed a lease deed in his favour,

without imposing the conditions stipulated by the DLSC as

reflected in the letter addressed by the District Collector to the

Assistant Director of Mines and Geology on 18.12.2014. It is in

this context that supercession of G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013 by

G.O.Ms.No.107 dated 30.07.2016 assumes significance. While the

requirement   of   an   NOC   from   the   DLSC   is   stipulated    in

G.O.Ms.No.2 dated 02.01.2013, the said G.O. was superceded by

G.O.Ms.No.107 dated 30.07.2016.        Under G.O.Ms.No.107, the

requirement of an NOC from the DLSC has been dispensed with

and, instead, the power to grant the NOC has been conferred on

the Tahsildar. In the absence of any obligation imposed either by a

statutory provision, or even by way of executive instructions of the

Government, the Director of Mines and Geology cannot be faulted

for not imposing the conditions stipulated in the proceedings of the

District Collector dated 18.12.2014 either in the grant order dated

12.04.2017 or in the lease agreement dated 18.04.2017.              The

petitioner's contention of the lease granted in favour of the 8th

respondent being vitiated, for non-compliance with the conditions

imposed by the DLSC, does not therefore merit acceptance. The

question       which   would,   however,   necessitate   examination   is

whether such conditions were imposed in the larger public interest

of environmental protection of the reserved forest, and to protect

the wild life therein.     This issue shall be examined later in this

order.

road area to the Y junction, in the adjacent reserve forest area, and

the wildlife in the reserve forest,    fall within the definition of

"environment" as defined under Section 2(2) of the Environmental

Protection Act 1986 (the "1986 Act" for short); the Chief Engineer

of the A.P. Pollution Control Board is the statutory authority to

exercise powers under the 1986 Act; the Revenue Divisional

Officer, who is also a member of the DLSC, is also a statutory

authority under the provisions of the A.P. Water Lands and Trees

Act, 2002; the District Collector, a member of the DLSC and a

statutory authority, is obligated to protect forests in the agency

area under the A.P. Forest Act; the Chief Engineer and RDO, being

statutory authorities to protect the environment and trees, are

duty bound to guard the forest, trees, and the environment; they

are empowered to impose conditions to preserve them, while giving

their NOC for grant of a mining lease; the conditions so imposed

shall bind the Owner (government in this case) and its lessee (R.8);

the 8th respondent is not authorised to cut           trees, or even

brushwood or undergrowth, as it is in violation of the DLSC

conditions, and also the terms of the grant and the lease; it is clear

that the mining lease holder did not obtain permission from any

competent authority either to cut the trees or other growth in the

leased area, and the area through which the road was formed to

the 'Y' junction; when R.8 removed trees unauthorizedly, the

authorities were watching silently; in the order of grant dated

12.4.2017 and the terms of lease dated 18.4.2017 prohibition is

imposed on cutting of trees, and the lessee is permitted to clear

brush wood or undergrowth on payment of compensation to the

without permission, is in violation of the conditions of lease and

the grant proceedings, besides the conditions imposed by the

DLSC, the lease is liable to be cancelled as per Rule 12(1)(5)(h(xii)

of the 1966 Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_62">      Sri V.V.Satish, Learned Counsel, would further submit that,

in the approved mining plan of R.8, the location of the mining area

is mentioned on the Topo sheet 65k/6 issued by the Survey of

India; the Topo sheet, which is an authorized document, shows

existence of a forest in the mining area, and also in the road to the

Y junction area; they are classified as DENSE MIXED FOREST; the

Forest Survey of India, Dehradun issued a Manual of Instructions

for Field Inventory according to which the definition of Dense

Forest is "cover of trees with canopy density of 40% to 69%"; the

State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, in its letter

dated 31.12.2016, observed that the area is covered by a Green

Belt (as the petitioner could get it after hearing, a copy of the same

is filed herewith); the photographs filed by the petitioner, along

with the PIL, clearly show that the entire area is covered by tree

growth; initially, in his counter-affidavit, the Divisional Forest

Officer admitted existence of trees, and alleged that the density of

tree growth is 0.04 as per their document; and, subsequently, after

physical inspection, he stated that the average tree density is

calculated to be 238 no. per hectare; the 7th respondent filed his

report of inspection, allegedly conducted on 23.7.2018, in which it

was estimated that about 1396 trees in the active mining area of

Ac.3.86, and the road area to Y junction, were removed; the

inspection report does not speak about the remaining portion of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                   43</span>




the lease area of 16.31 hectares in which R.8 had already removed

the growth; if the same calculation (238 trees per hectare) is

applied to the entire mining area, the number of trees removed

would come to 4,800 trees, and 476 trees towards the road i.e a

total   number    of   5276    trees;   the   8th   respondent     has,

unauthorisedly, formed a road to Y junction by removing trees; the

7th respondent has admitted removal of trees in this stretch; the

lease deed does not cover the stretch of 2.5 kilometers of the road

area; the 8th respondent was required to obtain separate orders of

allotment to form the road from the concerned authorities; hence,

formation of the road to Y junction, and removing trees therein, is

illegal; and there is no justification, on the part of the officials, in

keeping quiet without initiating action against the 8th respondent.

</p><p id="p_63">        On the other hand Sri C.V.Mohan Reddy, Learned Senior

Counsel appearing on behalf of the 8th respondent, would submit

that the leased area has sparse tree growth, that too stunted, and

consists mainly of shrubs and bushes; even if trees were present,

their growth was stunted; the petitioner has made bald, baseless

and misleading/malicious averments that the 8th respondent had

removed 25,000 trees; all relevant proceedings of the official

respondents show that the proposed mining area does not have

trees at all, and is covered with shrubs and bushes; there were no

big trees or trees having commercial timber value; according to

ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) Laterite Soils are

acidic and residual in nature which are formed under typical

monsoonal conditions; the process of formation is called leaching;

in leaching process siliceous compounds of soil are washed away

by heavy rain in hot climate and sloppy terrain; hence such soils
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                      44</span>




are deficient in siliceous compounds; these soils are not very

fertile, and are suitable for bushes and pastures only; these soils

are in oxides of iron and aluminum, but deficient in nitrogen,

phosphoric acid, lime and potash; and the 8th respondent has

planted 15,000 trees on both sides of the road, and around the

mining area, (of which 6700 trees were supplied by the department

of Forest, Narsipatnam), by arranging water facility through drip

irrigation system.

the leased area was not forest land, and was classified as hill

poramboke; the mining lease area is covered by thick bushes and

rocks; there were no big trees; and as per the report of the District

Forest Officer dated 18.08.2012, the forest department had not

reported any objection regarding mining operations of the 8th

respondent. In his counter-affidavit, the 5th respondent-Tahsildar

also stated that the mining area, demarcated in the sketch, was

not forest land; it was a rocky terrain not fit for cultivation; the

proposed area did not lie in the reserve forest; and the Revenue

Divisional Officer, Narsipatnam had submitted a report to the

District Collector, Visakhapatnam stating that the proposed

Divisional Forest Officer has also stated that the proposed mining

area is not in the reserve forest; it was having a tree growth of less

than 0.4 density; and no request was made for assessing the value

of the existing tree growth. The 7th respondent-Divisional Forest

Officer has also explained that, when the canopy density is

between 0.1 and 0.4, the vegetation type is 'open'; and neither the

revenue department nor the mining department had approached

the forest department for assessing the value of the tree growth.

submissions, to contend that the area is classified as Dense Mixed

calculated the number of trees existing on the land.              These

contentions do not form part of the pleadings either in the Writ

affidavit or in the reply-affidavits filed by the petitioner or in any of

the counter-affidavits filed by the respondents.          As noted

hereinabove, all the respondents have stated, in their counter-

affidavit, that there was no tree growth and the mining area was

covered by thickets and bushes. Sri C.V.Mohan Reddy, Learned

Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 8th respondent, would

contend that the soil is incapable of tree growth; and the area had

sparse tree growth consisting mainly of shrubs and bushes.

</p><p id="p_72">      After the Writ Petitioner was heard in part on 20.07.2018, a

copy of the joint inspection report dated 25.07.2018 of the

Divisional Forest Officer, Narsipatnam, pursuant to the inspection

caused by him along with the concerned mining and revenue

officials, was filed as part of the additional material papers. The

said report records that, as per the report of the special team dated

24.07.2018, the average trees per hectare was found to be 238 in

the locality, and the team estimated that, in the total area already

mined and the area in which the approach road was formed,

approximately 1396 trees may have existed, and may have been

removed by the lease holder. The report further states that it is a

general procedure for the government departments to obtain

enumeration and valuation of the tree growth in government lands

and premises from the forest department before commencement of

any developmental work; but, in this case, neither the revenue

department nor the mining department or even the mining lease

holder (i.e. the 8th respondent) had not approached the forest

department for enumeration and valuation of the tree growth,

existing on the mining area and the approach road area, before

commencement of mining operations. While this report refers to

the joint inspection caused on 25th July, 2018, its contents run
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                             50</span>

earlier wherein existence of trees in the mining area was denied.

</p><p id="p_73">         If     the   contents   of   the    joint   inspection   report   dated

25.07.2018 are true, then the 8th respondent must be held to have

felled        trees   without    obtaining       permission   from   the   forest

department.           It would also mean that all the respondents have

failed to disclose true and correct facts in their counter-affidavits.

Since the joint inspection report dated 25.07.2018 was enclosed

along with the additional material papers filed by the 7th

respondent on 31.07.2018, the 8th respondent has not had the

opportunity to rebut the contents of the said report. It would not

be appropriate for us, therefore, to fault the 8th respondent or

proceed on the premise that several trees were felled without

obtaining prior permission from the forest department or that the

8th respondent had failed to pay compensation for the trees felled

by him.          In any event, if trees have already been felled, the

question of their now seeking permission to fell the trees does not

arise. As the 8th respondent did not have an opportunity to rebut

these allegations, we direct the 7th respondent to put the 8th

respondent on notice regarding existence of 1396 trees, give them

an opportunity of being heard, and after determining the exact

number of trees, if any, felled by the 8th respondent, to fix its value

and direct the 8th respondent to pay the said amount to the gram

Panchayat.
</p>
<p id="p_74">         The value of the shrubs and bushes in the mining area,

besides the value of the trees, should have also been determined,

compensation for cutting such tree growth in the light of <a href="/doc/133769481/" id="a_56">Section

date on which a mining lease was granted to the 8th respondent), to

also determine the extent to which the area was covered by

thickets and bushes, determine its value, and intimate the same to

the 8th respondent who shall, within one month from the date of

receipt of such intimation, pay its value to the Gram Panchayat.

In case the 8th respondent fails to make payment for the trees,

IV of the Constitution, and the State was burdened with the

responsibility of making an endeavour to protect and improve the

environment and to safeguard the forest and wildlife of the

country. By the same amendment, Fundamental Duties of the

citizens were enumerated in the form of <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_66">Article 51-A (Part-IV A).</a>

These include the duty to protect and improve the natural

environment including forests and wildlife and to have compassion

for      living   creatures   [<a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_67">Article        51-A(g)].</a>   (Association   for

doubt, <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_69">Article 51-A</a> can serve as a guide not only for resolving the

issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by

the Courts. The fundamental duties must be given their full

meaning. The State is, in a sense, "all the citizens placed together"

and, therefore, though <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_70">Article 51-A</a> does not expressly cast any

fundamental duty on the State, the duty of every citizen of India is,

collectively speaking, the duty of the State. (Mirzapur Moti

Kureshi Kassab Jamat4; <a href="/doc/1149825/" id="a_71">AIIMS Students' Union v. AIIMS7</a>). The

obligation to protect and preserve forests is the fundamental duty

of every citizen, and all persons in a comprehensive sense, i.e.,

juristic as well. Maintenance of ecology is the primary duty of the

State to prevent any further degradation of the ecology and

<p id="p_80">         The State and the citizen are under a fundamental obligation

to protect and improve the environment, including forests and to

of the environment, and keeping the ecological balance unaffected,

<p id="p_81">         In examining whether the conditions imposed by the DLSC,

as reflected in the proceedings of the District Collector dated

18.12.2014, should be enforced, and the 2nd respondent be called

upon to prevent further mining activity being carried on by the 8th

respondent, we must bear in mind that the terms of the grant, and

the mining lease deed, have not been violated; and the 8th

respondent       has     obtained   all    statutory   clearances   such   as


8   1986 Supp SCC 517
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                  55</span>




environment clearance, consent for establishment and consent for

operations. It is only if the conditions imposed by the DLSC are

reasonable, and in larger public interest, would the question

whether such conditions should have been imposed in the grant

and the mining lease necessitate examination.
</p>
<p id="p_82">      The conditions imposed by the DLSC are (1) the buffer area

of the reserve forest should be protected by construction of a

compound wall; (2) mining operations should be carried out

without entering the forest boundaries; (3) permission should be

obtained for removal/cutting of trees in the leased area; (4) after

the value of the trees are assessed by the forest department, the 8th

respondent should remit the tree value to the concerned Gram

Panchayat; (5) a road should be constructed and handed over to

the Gram Panchayat for its utilization by the general public; and

(6) the 8th respondent should not trespass into government land.

</p><p id="p_83">      We have already dealt with conditions (3) and (4) in the

earlier part of this order. With regards condition No.(5), a road has

already been laid from the mining area till the "Y" junction, and it

is not even the petitioner's case that the general public have not

been given free access to the road. As all public roads vest in the

Gram Panchayat, the 8th respondent is bound to hand it over to

them, and it is always open to the officials concerned to take

necessary action in accordance with law. Even if condition No.6

had not been imposed, the 8th respondent cannot carry on mining

operations beyond the area leased in their favour. If they do so, it

would violate the conditions of the grant and the mining lease

agreement, for which the 2nd respondent is entitled to take

necessary action in accordance with law.

DLSC as reflected in the proceedings of the District Collector dated

18.12.2014. We shall examine condition No.(2) later in this order.

In so far as condition No.1 is concerned no reasons have been

assigned by the DLSC for imposing such a condition.        The road

laid from the mining area to the "Y" junction splits into two

thereafter. While one of the two roads goes through the reserve

forest, the other goes outside the reserve forest to Sundarakota. If

the intention of imposing the condition of construction of a

compound wall is to prevent the 8th respondent from entering into

the forest, condition No.2 would have sufficed, and it was wholly

unnecessary to impose condition No.1.         As construction of a

compound wall is not referable to any statutory provision - either

plenary or subordinate, and as the object of prescribing such a

condition has not been spelt out either by the District Collector or

the DLSC, we see no reason to prescribe any such condition as it is

not stated as to how this condition would further the directive

principles of State policy under <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_75">Article 48-A</a> and the fundamental

duties under <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_76">Article 51-A</a> of the Constitution of India.


IV. IS THE ROAD, THROUGH THE RESERVE FOREST, MEANT
    FOR THE USE OF THE FOREST DWELLERS ONLY?
</p>
<p id="p_86">      Sri V.V.Satish, Learned Counsel for the petitioner, would

submit that the road through the Reserve Forest is provided for

community rights to the user agency only; the proceedings of the

7th respondent dated 13.8.2014 show that the villagers of

Sarugudu Panchayat had requested that a road be provided from

Sarugudu to Sundarkota; the condition prescribed for construction

of a protection wall, imposed by the DLSC, is justified; the District

Collector-cum-Chairman of the District Level Committee, and the

Divisional Forest Officer, had forwarded proposals to the District

Level Committee under the provisions of the ST and Other

Traditional Forest Dwellers(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006

(the "2006 Act" for short) for its final decision on providing a road

for community rights to the User Agency; as forest land was

diverted to provide a road for community rights       of the agency

people, the road so laid through Sarugudu Forest to Sundarkoda

can be used only by the ST and other Traditional Forest Dwellers

for exercising their community rights, but not for the commercial

activity of transporting mineral of the 8th respondent; once a road

is formed through the reserve forest, clearly stating that this

access has been provided for community rights of the user agency,

the 8th respondent has no authority to enter into the reserve forest

for transportation of his mineral.
</p>
<p id="p_87">      The 2006 Act is an Act to recognize and vest forest rights,

and occupation in forest land, in forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes

and other traditional forest dwellers. Chapter-II prescribes forest

rights, and <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_77">Section 3</a> stipulates the forest rights of forest dwelling

Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. <a href="/doc/149451464/" id="a_78">Section 4</a>

relates to recognition of, and vesting of, forest rights in forest

dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers,

and <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_79">Section 5</a> prescribes the duties of holders of forest rights.

Under Rule 7 of the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest

Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Rules, 2008, the State

Government is required to constitute a District Level Committee

with the District Collector as the Chairperson. Rule 8 details the

functions of the District Level Committee. None of the functions

stipulated in clauses (a) to (i) thereunder relate to the grant of an

NOC. Neither the provisions of the 2006 Act nor the 2008 Rules

have any application to the case on hand, since it is not even the

petitioner's case that any of the provisions of the 2006 Act or the

2008 Rules have been violated on a mining lease being granted in

favour of the 8th respondent or by their transportation of the

quarried mineral.
</p>
<p id="p_88">      In the absence of any specific provision in the 2006 Act being

violated, and as neither the provisions of the 2006 Act nor the

2008 Rules so prohibit, the 8th respondent cannot be disabled from

entering the reserve forest in terms of the said Act and Rules.

Whether the 8th respondent should be permitted to transport large

truck loads of laterite through the reserve forest, and whether such

transportation would cause ecological degradation of the reserve

forest, besies causing harm to the wildlife therein, shall be

examined hereinafter in this order.

<p id="p_89">V. PROTECTION OF WILDLIFE IN THE RESERVE FOREST : IS
   IT NECESSARY THAT RESTRICTIONS BE IMPOSED ON
   TRANSPORTATION OF MINERAL THROUGH THE RESERVE
   FOREST?
</p>
<p id="p_90">      With regards protection of wild life in the reserve forest, Sri

V.V. Satish, Learned Counsel for the petitioner, would submit that

the 7th respondent, in his counter, has admitted existence of

wildlife in Sarugudu Reserve Forest; it is an undisputed fact that

the 8th respondent is transporting his mineral through Sarugudu

Reserve Forest; in the mining plan, it is clearly stated that R.8

would extract 7,50,000 tonnes of laterite every year; this, by itself,

supports the petitioner's case that 200 transporting lorries move

through the reserve forest; none of the officials have disputed the

said fact of movement of 200 lorries per day to transport the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                  59</span>




mineral; this activity of transportation is dangerous to wildlife in

the reserve forest; the condition of restriction of entry into the

Reserve forest, imposed by the DLSC, is valid and is binding on the

8th respondent; entering into the reserve forest is illegal; the

original route for transportation of mineral, as prescribed by DLSC

after taking note of the Sub-Collector Narsipatnam's Letter dated

26.9.2014, is through Sundarakota Road; the District Collector

enclosed a road sketch to his proceedings dated 18.12.2014, and

imposed certain conditions to form a road; and the 8th respondent,

instead of forming a road from the mining area to Sundarakota, is

entering and transporting his mineral through the Sarugudu

Reserve Forest illegally.
</p>
<p id="p_91">      On the other hand Sri C.V.Mohan Reddy, Learned Senior

Counsel appearing on behalf of the 8th respondent, would submit

that the petitioner has made unsubstantiated and incorrect

averments that a wild animal was killed, due to the movement of

vehicles; no such incident occurred; and neither was it reported to

the concerned police nor to the office of Divisional Forest Office,

Narsipatnam.
</p>
<p id="p_92">      In his counter-affidavit, and additional counter-affidavit, the

7th respondent-Divisional Forest Officer, Narsipatnam has stated

that an animal census was conducted in the Vedurupalli beat area

of Sarugudu reserve forest in January, 2018; and, during census,

the concerned field staff had reported the presence of wild life in

Sarugudu reserve forest.    The importance of protecting wild life,

and preventing degradation of forests, is well recognised.       <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_80">The

Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short "the 1986 Act") was

enacted to protect and improve the environment and for prevention

of hazards to human beings, other living creatures, lands and

property.       <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_81">Section   3</a>   of   the   1986    Act   enjoins   the   Central

Government that it should take such measures as it deems

necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving

the quality of the environment and preventing, controlling and

abating environmental pollution. Forests should be preserved from

deforestation to maintain the ecology and to prevent environmental

degradation, and hazardous effects on the right to life. (Samatha1).

The environmental clearance obtained by the 8th respondent, to

carry on mining operations in the area given to him on lease, does

not relate to transportation of the quarried mineral through the

Sarugudu reserve forest.           While the 8th respondent claims that

between 15 to 20 lorries transport the quarried mineral each day,

the petitioner claims that around 200 lorries, carrying the quarried

mineral, would pass through Sarugudu reserve forest each day.

</p><p id="p_93">          It is the duty of the Government to protect wildlife and

natural resources. The "Doctrine of the Public Trust" is founded

on the premise that certain common properties such as forests are

of immense importance to the people in general, and they must be

held by the Government as a trustee for the free and unimpeded

use by the general public. The doctrine enjoins upon the

Government         to   protect    natural    resources.   (Association    for

Environment Protection6). The State is the trustee of all natural

resources which are, by nature, meant for public use and

enjoyment. As a trustee, it is under a legal duty to protect natural

resources. (Association for Environment Protection6; <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_82">M.C.

Mehta v. Kamal Nath9</a>).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                  61</span>




      If there is a law made by Parliament, or the State Legislature,

Courts serve as an instrument of determining legislative intent in

the exercise of its powers of judicial review under the Constitution.

In the absence of legislation, the executive, acting under the

doctrine of public trust, cannot abdicate natural resources. The

aesthetic use and pristine glory of natural resources, the

environment and the eco-system of our country cannot be

permitted to be eroded unless it is for the public good and in public

interest to encroach upon these resources. (Association for

Environment Protection6).
</p>
<p id="p_95">      Formulated from a negative angle, the doctrine does not

prohibit alienation of the property held as a public trust. However,

to properly scrutinise such actions of the Government, Courts

must make a distinction between the Government's general

obligation to act for the public benefit, and the special, more

demanding obligation which it may have as a trustee of public

resources. (Association for Environment Protection6).

</p><p id="p_96">      The heart of the public trust doctrine is that it imposes limits

and    obligations   upon     government     agencies    and     their

administrators on behalf of all the people and especially future

generations. For example, renewable and non-renewable resources,

associated uses, ecological values or objects in which the public

has a special interest are held subject to the duty of the State not

to impair such resources, uses or values.      The same obligations

apply to managers of forests and other public assets. (Association

for Environment Protection6). The Court can invoke the public

trust doctrine, and take affirmative action, to protect forests and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                  62</span>




associated natural eco-systems.       (Association for Environment

Protection6).
</p>
<p id="p_97">      No exercise has been undertaken by the forest department to

determine the number of lorries, carrying the quarried mineral

from the 8th respondent's leased area, which would pass through

the Sarugudu reserve forest each day.       Nor has any steps been

taken to examine its effect on the wildlife, and to the forest itself,

because of vehicular pollution and accidental death of wild animals

being caused by such vehicles. In this context it is necessary to

also note that, while there exists a road to Sundarakota outside

the reserve forest, the distance is far longer than the road passing

through the Sarugudu reserve forest. The economic benefits which

the 8th respondent may gain, on the shorter route being taken for

transportation of the quarried mineral through the Reserve forest,

must yield to the larger public interest of protection of wildlife in

the Reserve forest and to prevent environmental degradation to the

reserve forest itself.
</p>
<p id="p_98">      Applying the doctrine of public trust, we direct the Principal

Chief Conservator of Forests, Andhra Pradesh to undertake the

exercise of estimating the number of vehicles belonging to the 8th

respondent which pass through the reserve forest, carrying the

quarried mineral, each day; and determine the threat to wildlife in

the Reserve forest, and the damage which may be caused to the

forest itself, because of vehicular pollution caused by the large

scale movement of such vehicles. Based on the result of such an

exercise, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Andhra

Pradesh may either prohibit or regulate movement of the vehicles,

carrying the quarried mineral from the 8th respondent's mining
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                 63</span>




area, through the Reserve Forest. The entire exercise, culminating

in an order being passed by the Principal Chief Conservator of

Forests, Andhra Pradesh, shall be completed within a period of two

months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.      Till a

decision is taken by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests,

Andhra Pradesh, and is communicated to him, the 8th respondent

shall not transport the quarried mineral through the Sarugudu

Reserve Forest, and shall, instead, use the road leading to

Sundarakota passing outside and beyond the Sarugudu Reserve

Forest limits.

</p>
<p id="p_100">
</p><p id="p_101">      Sri C.V.Mohan Reddy, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on

behalf of the 8th respondent, would submit that this Writ Petition

lacks bonafides, and is only filed for the purpose of black-mail;

criminal cases have been registered against the petitioner; the

petitioner was earlier working for the 8th respondent who used to

pay for the services rendered by him; since the services of the Writ

Petitioner were not satisfactory, the 8th respondent stopped

engaging him; the consequence is the present Writ Petition; and

any other contention, advanced by the petitioner, has no basis in

the pleadings.
</p>
<p id="p_102">      On the other hand Sri V.V.Satish, Learned Counsel for the

petitioner, would submit that the allegation that petitioner was an

employee of the 8th respondent is completely false; it is made only

to dilute the cause in this PIL; while the present PIL was under

adjudication, the Police of Nathavaram had detained the petitioner

on 28.04.2018, and had later showed arrest in connection with the

FIR in a 20 years old matter i.e., Cr.No.60 of 1997, though the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                   64</span>




petitioner's name is not there in it; on 1.8.2018, the court below

granted bail, holding that the prosecution had failed to show that

the name of the petitioner was wrongly omitted in the FIR; even 20

days after granting bail, the petitioner was not released as the

police deliberately delayed verifying the sureties produced by the

petitioner; immediately upon his arrest, the petitioner's son filed

I.A Nos.2 &amp; 3 of 2018 seeking to implead the concerned police

authorities, and sought for production of the detenue before this

Court; later on, the family members were told that he was arrested

in connection with the above case; in the petition, it is clearly

stated that the 8th respondent is behind this detention; neither the

8th respondent nor the police officials have filed any counter to

I.A.Nos.2 and 3 of 2018; the petitioner is implicated in the crime

only to suppress his voice against the illegal activities of the 8th

respondent; the action of the official respondents, in allowing the

8th respondent to    continue   his mining operations despite their

knowledge that     the 8th respondent has consciously violated the

terms and conditions imposed under the NOC, the terms of the

grant and the lease, and though he was causing biological

imbalance and threat to wildlife, is illegal and arbitrary; and the

lease of the 8th respondent is liable to be cancelled.

</p><p id="p_103">      The allegations and counter-allegations, leveled both by the

petitioner   and    the   8th   respondent    against    each   other,

notwithstanding, we may not be justified in non-suiting the

petitioner, particularly when the joint inspection report of the

Divisional Forest Officer, Narsipatnam, pursuant to an inspection

caused along with the concerned Mining and Revenue officials on

25.07.2018, discloses that there may have existed approximately
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                   65</span>




1396 trees in the total area already mined, and in the area in

which the approach road was formed. If this assessment, in the

joint inspection report, is true, then all the respondents, including

the 7th and 8th respondents, must be held to have failed to bring

these facts to the notice of this Court in the counter-affidavits and

additional counter-affidavits filed by them earlier.

</p><p id="p_104">          Even otherwise if any other member of the public, to whom

the conduct alleged against the        petitioner in the present case

could not be attributed, can file such a writ petition for the same

relief, this disability would not attach to him. The relief claimed by

the petitioner in the writ petition, being in the nature of a class

action, without seeking any relief personal to him ought not to be

dismissed merely on the ground of lack of standing since this is a

matter of public concern, relates to the good governance of the

State itself, and the preservation of forests and protection of wild

life. We see no reason, therefore, to non-suit the petitioner on this

ground. (<a href="/doc/571597/" id="a_83">Dr. Kashinath G. Jalmi v. The Speaker10</a>; Campaign

of Wild Life in the Sarugudu Reserved Forest. If, as is contended

by the petitioner, around 200 lorries carrying quarried Laterite,

pass through the Sarugudu Reserved Forest each day, it may not

only have an adverse ecological impact on the forest, but may also

cause harm to the wild life therein. In any event, since the issues

involved are of paramount importance, and the personal difference,

            Collector    dated       18.12.2014      were       not   even
            communicated to him, the 8th respondent cannot be
            held to be bound thereby.

            District Collector dated 18.12.2014 does not have
            statutory sanction, strict judicial scrutiny by Courts is
            necessary in environmental matters, in view of the
            directive principles of State policy enshrined in <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_84">Article
            48A</a>, and the fundamental duties in <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_85">Article 51A</a> of the

            imposing the condition of construction of a compound
            wall in the buffer zone of Sarugudu Reserve Forest,
            and as such a condition is not referable to any

            instructions, issued by the Government from time to

     felling of those trees. The 7th respondent shall estimate the
     value of the trees so felled, collect the said amount from the
     8th     respondent,     and   remit    it     to     the     concerned
     Grampanchayat.
</p><p id="p_108">  b. The     7th   respondent   shall   ascertain       whether    the   8th
     respondent's claim of having planted more than 12,000 trees
     is true; and determine whether such plantation and
     maintenance would suffice as reforestation compensation for
     the trees felled earlier by the 8th respondent.

     undertake the exercise of estimating the number of vehicles
