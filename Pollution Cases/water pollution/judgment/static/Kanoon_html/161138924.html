</p>
<p id="p_9">8.      The petitioner, in the present case, has set up a Restaurant under
the name and style of 'KFC Sapphire Foods India Private Limited'.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.      Admittedly, the petitioner has not applied for permission in
terms of <a href="/doc/1704963/" id="a_16">Section 21</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_18">Section 25</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Water
Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.     On 07.03.2017, when the petition was listed, the categorical
stand of the petitioner was that the petitioner has complied with the
requirements of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_20">Water Act</a> as well as of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_21">Air Act</a>, but had not
made an application seeking prior permission to open the Restaurant.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.     It is contended that an application was made on 04.03.2017
seeking permission under the said Acts.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.     This Court, noticing the contention of the petitioner that all
compliances have been made, directed the respondent - Delhi
Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to carry out an inspection and
submit a report.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) No.2154 /2017                                            Page 4 of 11</span>
<p id="p_14"> 13.     Inspection has been carried out on 08.03.2017 and a report is
handed over in the Court. The same is taken on record.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.     The Inspection report notices that there is a seating capacity of
109 persons in the Restaurant. The Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)
was found installed but in defunct condition. It was also observed that
chemicals required for treatment were not found available in the
premises. The Restaurant was found operational. It was also found
that there was a bypass arrangement installed in the ETP. The bypass
arrangement, it is submitted, would enable the operator of the ETP to
bypass the system of the effluent treatment and divert the
sludge/waste water directly into the sewage system without any
treatment. Certain photographs have also been produced and filed in
the Court showing the condition of the ETP.
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the DPCC also points
out that the application made by the petitioner on 04.03.2017 for grant
of permission is also defective and states incorrect facts with regard to
the water consumption and the effluent.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.     It is pointed out that in the application, water consumption for
all different uses in the restaurant has been shown to be only 10 litres
per day. The source of water supply has been shown to be 15 litres a
day. The quantity of waste effluent generated, as claimed in the
application, in terms of litres per day, has been shown as 15 litres per
day. In the type of treatment plant in the column for trade effluent, it


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) No.2154 /2017                                           Page 5 of 11</span>
 has been stated, that ETP (Physiochemical) capacity is only 2 litres a
day and ETP (Biological) capacity has been shown as again 2 litres a
day. With regard to disposal of treated effluents, the total quantity
shown is 8 litres a day.
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.     Learned counsel for the respondent points out that for a
Restaurant having been sitting capacity of 109, the figures are clearly
incorrect. He submits that as per the standard calculation, the
estimated water consumption would be roughly over 7,000 litres per
day against 10 per day shown. This would also entail generation of a
substantial amount of effluent. Which has not been correctly shown in
the application made on 04.03.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_19">18.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that if there are any
deficiencies, the petitioner may be granted some time to rectify the
same.
</p>
<p id="p_20">19.     Reliance is placed by learned counsel for the petitioner on a
decision of a Coordinate Bench in Splendor Landbase Limited versus
Delhi Pollution Control Committee, 173(2010) DLT 53. Learned
counsel has referred to and relied on paragraph 29(vi) to contend that
when buildings in question have already been constructed, without
obtaining prior consent to establish, the direction of the DPCC that
those who had failed to obtain prior consent to establish should now
apply for such consent is a direction that is not capable of being
complied with and the DPCC should invoke powers under Section


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C) No.2154 /2017                                          Page 6 of 11</span>
 25(5) of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_22">Water Act</a> and issue show cause notices prior to taking
any action.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.     In my view, the said judgment would not be applicable to the
facts of the present case. In Splendor Landbase Limited (Supra), 38
Writ Petitions had been filed by various builders. The Court was
concerned with some of the properties comprising of Residential
Housing Complexes, Commercial Shopping Complexes and Shopping
Malls, some of which had built up area of over 20,000 square metres.
The question in the said petition was whether the activity of
construction of Commercial Shopping Complexes, Shopping Malls
and Residential Complexes was covered under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_23">Air Act</a> and the
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">Water Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_22">21.     In the present case, there is no such issue about the applicability
of the Air and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_25">Water Act</a>. It is admitted position that both Air and
<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Act</a> are applicable. The petitioner has admittedly set up a
Restaurant without prior permission.
</p>
<p id="p_23">22.     Learned counsel for the petitioner further relies on the decision
of the Supreme Court in Velore Citizens Welfare Forum versus
Union of India &amp; Others, (1996) (6) Scale 194 and contends that
even in case of pollution, time should be granted before taking any
action. He contends that in the said case even where Supreme Court
found that the tanneries were polluting the in the State of Tamil Nadu,
the Supreme Court granted further time to the tanneries to install


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(C) No.2154 /2017                                             Page 7 of 11</span>
 necessary pollution control devices. Likewise he submits that time
should be granted to the petitioner to make compliances before
closing the Restaurant.
</p>
<p id="p_24">23.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has been repeatedly asked as
to what is the principle of law laid down by the Supreme Court in
Velore Citizens Welfare Forum (supra), which the petitioner relies
upon. Learned counsel has been unable to point out the same except to
contend that even in cases of pollution, some time has to be granted to
the polluting units to rectify the situation.
</p>
<p id="p_25">24.     In my view, the Supreme Court in Velore Citizens Welfare
Forum (supra) does not lay down as a principle of law that every
polluting unit has to be granted time to rectify the situation before any
action is taken.
</p>
<p id="p_26">25.     In Velore Citizens Welfare Forum (supra), the Supreme Court
has held that the salient principles of sustainable development, inter
alia,     includes      use   and   conservation   of   natural   resources,
environmental protection, the precautionary principle, Polluter Pays
principle, obligation to assist and cooperate etc. The Supreme Court
has held that the precautionary principle and the Polluter Pays
principle are sustainable developers.
</p>
<p id="p_27">26.     The Supreme Court in Velore Citizens Welfare Forum (supra)
noticed another decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Council for
Enviro-Legal Action Etc. versus Union of India &amp; Others, J.T. 1996

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.(C) No.2154 /2017                                              Page 8 of 11</span>
 (2) SC 196, wherein the Supreme Court held that once the activity
carried on is hazardous or inherently dangerous, the person carrying
on such activity is liable to make good the loss caused to any other
person by his activity irrespective of the fact whether he took
reasonable care while carrying on his activity.
</p>
<p id="p_28">27.     The Supreme Court in Velore Citizens Welfare Forum (supra)
thereafter held that the polluting industries are "Absolutely liable to
compensate for the harm caused by them to villagers in the affected
areas". They are bound to take all necessary measures to remove
sludge and other pollutants lying in the affected areas. "The Polluter
Pays Principle" was held to mean that there was absolute liability for
harm to the environment and it extends not only to compensate the
victims of pollution but also the cost of restoring the environmental
degradation. Remediation of the damaged environment is the part of
the process of "Sustainable Development" and the polluter is liable to
pay the cost to the individual suffers as well as the cost of reversing
the damaged ecology.      The Judgment in Velore Citizens Welfare
Forum (supra), in my view, does not further the case of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_29">28.     I may also point out that when I had passed the order on
07.03.2017, directing respondents to carry out an inspection, I was
even inclined to indulge the petitioner in ignoring the fact that the
petitioner had made the restaurant operational without taking prior
approvals. This I was inclined because the petitioner had contended
that the petitioner had complied with the condition of grant of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P.(C) No.2154 /2017                                         Page 9 of 11</span>
 permission and had submitted that it had made all the necessary
compliances under the Air and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_27">Water Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_30">29.     The inspection carried out, on 08.03.2017, pursuant to my order
dated 07.03.2017, shows to the contrary. The petitioner has not made
any compliances rather the petitioner has tried to circumvent the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_28">Water Act</a> by installing a bypass system to the ETP.
Clearly, the petitioner is not a person, who can be granted any
indulgence.
</p>
<p id="p_31">30.     The admitted position is that the petitioner had not made the
necessary compliances under the Air and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_29">Water Act</a> on the date
when the last inspection was carried out on 08.03.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_32">31.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has handed over a reply dated
09.03.2017 submitted to the Respondents - DPCC, in response to the
inspection report dated 08.03.2017, to contend that all compliances
have been made and a request has been made to re-inspect the
premises.
</p>
<p id="p_33">32.     In my view, since the petitioner admittedly was not a compliant
 on 07.03.2017, when a statement was made that the petitioner is
 compliant, which is fortified by the inspection report dated
 08.03.2017, no further indulgence can be shown to the petitioner by
 this court.
</p>
<p id="p_34">33.     The petitioner has already made an application to respondents


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P.(C) No.2154 /2017                                          Page 10 of 11</span>
  on 09.03.2017 to contend that compliances have been made. The
 respondents are free to deal with the same in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_35">34.     In my view, I find no infirmity in the impugned order dated
 13.02.2017 directing the petitioner to close down the Unit with
 immediate effect and directing the concerned authority, i.e., the New
 Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) to disconnect the electricity and
 water supply to the petitioner with immediate effect.
</p>
<p id="p_36">35.     The Writ Petition is accordingly dismissed. The appropriate
 authorities are at liberty to take action in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_37">36.     It is however, clarified that the dismissal of this petition would
not come in the way of the petitioner making an application, in
accordance with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_30">Air Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_31">Water Act</a> for
grant of requisite permissions for running a restaurant, after the
necessary compliances have been made. Any application so made
would be liable to be considered in accordance with law.
