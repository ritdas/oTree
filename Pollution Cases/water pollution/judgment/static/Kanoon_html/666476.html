	View expressed by High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur Bench at 

Indore holding that after introduction of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control 

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>') 

and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 

(hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>'), there was implied repeal of 

<a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_5">Section 133</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 

'Code'), is questioned in these appeals. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">

	Factual background needs to be noted in brief as legal issues of 

pristine nature are involved. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate 

(hereinafter referred to as the 'SDM')of the area concerned served 

orders in terms of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_6">Section 133</a> of the Code directing the respondents 

who owned industrial units to close their industries on the allegation 

that serious pollution was created by discharge of effluent from their 

respective factories and thereby a public nuisance was caused. The 

preliminary issues and the proceedings initiated by the SDM were 

questioned by the respondents herein before the High Court under 

<a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_7">Section 397</a> of the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

	The main plank of their arguments before the High Court was that 

by enactment of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a> there was implied repeal of 

<a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_10">Section 133</a> of the Code. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">

	The plea was contested by the SDM on the ground that the 

provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_12">Air Act</a> operate in different fields, 

and, therefore, the question of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_13">Section 133</a> of the Code getting 

eclipsed did not arise. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">

The High Court referred to various provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_14">Water Act</a> 

and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_15">Air Act</a> and compared their scope of operation with <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_16">Section 133</a> of 

the Code. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">

	The High Court was of the view that the provisions of the Water 

and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_17">Air Act</a>s are in essence elaboration and enlargement of the 

powers conferred under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_18">Section 133</a> of the Code. Water and Air pollution 

were held to be species of nuisance or of the conduct of trades or 

occupation injuries to the health or physical comfort to the community. 

As they deal with special types of nuisance, they ruled out operation 

of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_19">Section 133</a> of the Code. It was concluded that existence and working 

of the two parallel provisions would result not only in inconvenience 

but also absurd results. In the ultimate, it was held that the 

provisions of the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_20">Air Act</a>s impliedly repealed the provisions 

of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_21">Section 133</a> of the Code, so far as allegations of public nuisance by 

air and water pollution by industries or persons covered by the two 

Acts are concerned. As a consequence, it was held that the SDM had no 

jurisdiction to act under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_22">Section 133</a> of the Code. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">

	Learned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that the view 

expressed by the High Court is not legally tenable. The three statutes 

operate in different fields and even though there may be some amount of 

over-lapping, they can co-exist. A statutory provision cannot be held 

to have been repealed impliedly by the Court. Learned counsel for the 

respondents-units submitted that this Court had occasion to pass 

interim orders on 2.1.2001. Exception was taken to the manner of 

functioning of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (in short the 

'Board') and directions were given to take necessary action against the 

delinquent officials. Proceedings were initiated and on the basis of 

the reports filed by the functionaries of the reconstituted Board, 

functioning of the factories had been discontinued. The legality of the 

proceedings and the orders passed therein have been questioned and the 

Board has been moved for grant of necessary permission for making the 

factories functional. In this background it is submitted that the 

issues raised have really become academic. Though, learned counsel for 

the appellant-State and the Board accepted the position to be factually 

true, it is submitted that considering the impact of the decision which 

would have far reaching consequences, the legal issues may be decided 

and appropriate directions should be given so far as the functioning or 

closure of the factories aspect is concerned. 
</p>
<p id="p_9"> <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_23">Section 133</a> of the Code appears in Chapter X of the Code which 

deals with maintenance of public order and tranquility. It is a part of 

the heading 'public nuisance'. The term 'nuisance' as used in law is 

not a term capable of exact definition and it has been pointed out in 

Halsbury's Laws of England that "even at the present day there is not 

entire agreement as to whether certain acts or omissions shall be 

classed as nuisances or whether they do not rather fall under other 

divisions of the law of tort". <a href="/doc/47646/" id="a_24">In Vasant Manga Nikumba and Ors. v. 

Baburao Bhikanna Naidu</a> (deceased) by Lrs. and Anr. (1995 Supp.(4) SCC 

</p><p id="p_10">54) it was observed that nuisance is an inconvenience which materially 

interferes with the ordinary physical comfort of human existence. It is 

not capable of precise definition. To bring in application of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_25">Section 

133</a> of the Code, there must be imminent danger to the property and 

consequential nuisance to the public. The nuisance is the concomitant 

act resulting in danger to the life or property due to likely collapse 

etc. The object and purpose behind <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_26">Section 133</a> of the Code is 

essentially to prevent public nuisance and involves a sense of urgency 

in the sense that if the Magistrate fails to take recourse immediately 

irreparable damage would be done to the public. It applies to a 

condition of the nuisance at the time when the order is passed and it 

is not intended to apply to future likelihood or what may happen at 

some later point of time. It does not deal with all potential nuisance, 

and on the other hand applies when the nuisance is in existence. It has 

to be noted that some times there is a confusion between <a href="/doc/340949/" id="a_27">Section 133</a> 

and <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_28">Section 144</a> of the Code. While the latter is more general provision 

the former is more specific. While the order under the former is 

conditional, the order under the latter is absolute.  The proceedings 

are more in the nature of civil proceedings than criminal proceedings. 

	One significant factor to be noticed is that person against whom 

action is taken is not an accused within the meaning of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_29">Section 133</a> of 

the Code. He can give evidence on his own behalf and may be examined on 

oath. Proceedings are not the proceedings in respect of offences. <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_30">The 

Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_31">Air Act</a> are characteristically special statutes. 



	The two statutes relate to prevention and control of pollution 

and also provides for penal consequences in case of breach of statutory 

provisions. Environmental, ecological air and water pollution amount to 

violation of right to life assured by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_32">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of 

India, 1950 (in short 'the Constitution').  Hygienic environment is an 

integral facet of healthy life.  Right to live with human dignity 

becomes illusory in the absence of humane and healthy environment.

   

	Chapter V of the Water Act deals with prevention and control of 

water pollution.  Similarly, Chapter IV of the Air Act deals with 

prevention and control of air pollution.  <a href="/doc/1837118/" id="a_33">Sections 30</a>, <a href="/doc/140281/" id="a_34">32</a> and <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_35">33</a> of the 

Water Act deal with power of the State Board to carry out certain 

works, emergency measures in certain cases and power of Board to make 

application to the Courts for restraining apprehended pollution 

respectively.  Under <a href="/doc/656953/" id="a_36">Sections 18</a>, <a href="/doc/1324149/" id="a_37">20</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_38">22-A</a> of the Air Act deal with 

power to give directions, power to give instructions for ensuring 

standards and power of Board to make application to Court for 

restraining persons from causing air pollution respectively.     

	The provisions of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_39">Section 133</a> of the Code can be culled in aid to 

remove public nuisance caused by effluent of the discharge and air 

discharge causing hardship to the general public. To that extent, 

learned counsel for the appellant is correct in his submission.



There is presumption against a repeal by implication; and the 

reason of this rule is based on the theory that the Legislature while 

enacting a law has a complete knowledge of the existing laws on the 

same subject matter, and therefore, when it does not provide a 

repealing provision, the intention is clear not to repeal the existing 

legislation. (See: Municipal Council, Palai through the <a href="/doc/793142/" id="a_40">Commissioner of 

Municipal Council, Palai v. T.J. Joseph</a> (AIR 1963 SC 1561), <a href="/doc/352854/" id="a_41">Northern 

India Caterers (Private) Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Punjab and Anr</a>. (AIR 

1967 SC 1581), <a href="/doc/7087/" id="a_42">Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Shiv Shanker</a> (1971 (1) 

SCC 442) and <a href="/doc/291727/" id="a_43">Ratan Lal Adukia and Anr. v. Union of India</a> (AIR 1990 SC 

</p><p id="p_11">104). When the new Act contains a repealing section mentioning the Acts 

which it expressly repeals, the presumption against implied repeal of 

other laws is further strengthened on the principle expressio unius 

(persone vel rei) est exclusio alterius. (The express intention of one 

person or thing is the exclusion of another), as illuminatingly stated 

in Garnett v. Bradley (1878) 3 AC 944 (HL). The continuance of existing 

legislation, in the absence of an express provision of repeal by 

implication lies on the party asserting the same. The presumption is, 

however, rebutted and a repeal is inferred by necessary implication 

when the provisions of the later Act are so inconsistent with or 

repugnant to the provisions of the earlier Act and that the two cannot 

stand together. But, if the two can be read together and some 

application can be made of the words in the earlier Act, a repeal will 

not be inferred. (See: A.G. v. Moore (1878) 3 Ex. D 276, Ratanlal's 

case (supra) and <a href="/doc/995861/" id="a_44">R.S. Raghunath v. State of Karnataka and Anr</a>. (AIR 

1992 SC 81). 
</p>
<p id="p_12">

	The necessary questions to be asked are:
</p>
<p id="p_13">	(1) Whether there is direct conflict between the two provisions.

	(2)	Whether the Legislature intended to lay down an exhaustive 

Code in respect of the subject-matter replacing the earlier law;

	(3)	Whether the two laws occupy the same field.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	(See:  <a href="/doc/1401686/" id="a_45">Pt. Rishikesh and Anr. v. Salma Begum (Smt</a>.) (1995(4) SCC 

</p><p id="p_15">718), and Shri A.B. Krishna &amp; Ors. v. The State of Karnataka &amp; Ors. (JT 

1998(1) SC 613)



	The doctrine of implied repeal is based on the theory that the 

Legislature, which is presumed to know the existing law, did not intend 

to create any confusion by retaining conflicting provisions and, 

therefore, when the court applies the doctrine, it does not more than 

give effect to the intention of the Legislature by examining the scope 

and the object of the two enactments and by a comparison of their 

provisions. The matter in each case is one of the construction and 

comparison of the two statutes. The Court leans against implying a 

repeal, "unless two Acts are so plainly repugnant to each other that 

effect cannot be given to both at the same time, a repeal will not be 

implied, or that there is a necessary inconsistency in the two Acts 

standing together." (See Craies on Statute Law, Seventh Edition, page 

366, with reference to Re: Berrey (1936) Ch. 274).  To determine 

whether a later statute repeals by implication an earlier, it is 

necessary to scrutinize the terms and consider the true meaning and 

effect of the earlier Act.  Until this is done, it is impossible to 

ascertain whether any inconsistency exists between the two enactments. 

The area of operation in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_46"> the Code</a> and the pollution laws in question 

are different with wholly different aims and objects; and though they 

alleviate nuisance, that is not of identical nature.  They operate in 

their respective fields and there is no impediment for their existence 

side by side. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">

	While as noted above the provisions of <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_47">Section 133</a> of the Code 

are in the nature of preventive measures, the provisions contained in 

the two Acts are not only curative but also preventive and penal.  The 

provisions appear to be mutually exclusive and the question of one 

replacing the other does not arise. Above being the position, the High 

Court was not justified in holding that there was any implied repeal of 

<a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_48">Section 133</a> of the Code. The appeals deserve to be allowed to the 

extent indicated above, which we direct. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">

However, if applications are pending before the Board, it would 

be appropriate for the Board to take necessary steps for their 

disposal.  The question whether there was no infraction under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_49">Section 

133</a> of the Code or the two Acts is a matter which shall be dealt with 

by the appropriate forum, and we do not express any opinion in that 

regard.
