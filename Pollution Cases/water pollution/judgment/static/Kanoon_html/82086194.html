Swamy Vivekananda Road,
Sharadadevi Nagar,
Mysore District-570023,
Karnataka, India.                             ... Respondent

(By Sri. Sudhir Kumar, Advocate)

      This Criminal Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of
Cr.P.C. praying to quash the complaint and entire
proceedings in C.C.No.1280/2010(Annexure 'A') on the
file of the Hon'ble Civil Judge (Jr. Dn) and JMFC,
Nanjangud, as against the petitioners.

      This Criminal Petition coming on for Admission
this day, the Court made the following:

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The    petitioners   have     sought   to    quash     the

complaint    and    the   entire     proceedings       in   CC

No.1280/2010 pending on the file of Hon'ble Civil Judge

(Jr.Dn.)   and   JMFC,    Nanjangud     for      the   offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_2">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_3">44</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and for

violation of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_5">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">25</a> of the above Act.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            -3-</span>
</p><p id="p_2">     2.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners

and learned counsel for the respondent and perused the

records.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">     3.     The grievance of the petitioners is that in

respect of the very same allegations, the Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board has taken action against

the petitioners herein and had withdrawn the consent

for operation of the paper mill run by accused No.1 and

pursuant to the said action, the consent was not

renewed for the subsequent three years. The petitioners

herein challenged the action of the Pollution Control

Board before the Karnataka State Appellate Authority at

Bengaluru    by   preferring   appeal Nos.11/2009     c/w

12/2009, 24/2009 c/w 25/2009 and 27/2010 c/w

28/2010 and by order dated 06.03.2012, the appeals

were allowed and the Order passed by the Pollution

Control Board was set-aside and the Board was directed

to consider the case of the petitioners for grant of fresh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              -4-</span>




consent to the petitioners - Industries. Accordingly, the

consent has been accorded and the petitioners have

been running the paper mills in accordance with law by

complying with the terms and conditions imposed in the

consent order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     4.      Learned counsel further submits that the

respondent    herein   was    impleaded   in    the   above

proceedings and the contentions urged by him with

regard to the violation of provisions of Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a> were duly considered and

negatived. Respondent did not challenge the order

passed by the Appellate Court, instead, has approached

the Criminal Court by filing the complaint under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Section   200</a>    Cr.P.C   seeking   action     against   the

petitioners for the alleged offences under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_9">Sections 43</a>

and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_10">44</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>. It is submitted that in the said complaint, the very

same allegations are made which have been already
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                -5-</span>




considered and decided by the Appellate Authority and

therefore, initiation of the criminal proceedings against

the petitioners is wholly illegal and a sheer abuse of the

process of Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      5.       Refuting its contentions, learned counsel for

the respondent submits that the Authority concerned

has decided the case only with regard to compliance of

provisions of the Act, whereas, in the instant case, the

respondent has come up with the specific allegations

that the petitioners have resorted to violations of the

provisions     of   <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_12">Sections   24</a>    and   <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_13">25</a>   of   the   Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, allegations

made in the complaint squarely attract the ingredients

of the said offences and therefore, the investigation and

the further action cannot be quashed against the

petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">      6.       Considered the submission and perused the

records.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             -6-</span><p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      7.    A perusal of the order passed by the

Karnataka State Appellate Authority at Bengaluru

under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a>

discloses that the permission granted to the petitioners

to operate paper mill was revoked by the Pollution

Control Board for the alleged violation of the provisions

of the Act. In the said order, it is specifically noted that

the respondent herein got himself impleaded in the said

appeals raising a grievance that on account of discharge

of untreated affluents to the stream, he has been

subjected to hardship and irreparable injury.


</p><p id="p_13">      8.    In Paragraph 20 of the said order, it is noted

that the members of the Appellate Authority visited the

spot and inspected the industry and its surroundings

on 05.11.2011.    During the inspection by the officers,

the General Manager of the industry and the local

residents including the respondent herein were present.

The observation made at Para 20 reads as follows:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               -7-</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "The impleading applicant who accompanied
     us during the inspection alleged that the
     appellant industry is allowing effluents into
     the Rampura Canal at a number of places
     without treatment, which causes decease to
     the human beings and cattle and the yield
     from the lands has gone down. It is alleged
     that the industry sells plastic and other waste
     to local people who burn the waste to get iron
     and other metals which causes air pollution
     and they also dump the hot ash everywhere
     which causes burns to human beings and
     cattle and they also contaminate the canal
     water. The complaint was supported by some
     locals while another set of villages who were
     also accompanying us denied the allegations
     made by the complaint and requested us to
     direct the appellant industry to release more
     treated water to their lands."</blockquote><p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">     9.     Considering the objections raised by the

impleading applicant as well as other residents, the

Appellate   Authority   has    ultimately   held    that   the

petitioners have been carrying on the              operations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              -8-</span>




without    violating   any   of    the   provisions   of   law.

Undisputedly, neither the respondent nor any other

residents have preferred any appeal against the said

order. As such, the said order has attained finality.


</p><p id="p_16">     10.    A reading of the private complaint indicates

that the respondent herein has raised the very same

contentions which have been already been considered

and decided by the Authority constituted under the Act

of 1974.    In this complaint, prayer sought for by the

respondent is to take cognizance of the offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_16">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_17">44</a> of the Act.




</p><p id="p_17">     11.    The very same subject matter having been

already adjudicated and decided by the complainant

authority, in my view the continuous of the proceedings

against the petitioners would be nothing but an abuse

of process of Court. It is not the case of the respondent

that the Authorities constituted under the Act have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            -9-</span>




failed to take any action on the complaint lodged by

him.    The grievance of the respondent having been

already addressed by the concerned authorities, it

would be a travesty of justice to allow the proceedings to

continue any further.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">       Accordingly, Petition is allowed.   The impugned

proceedings in PCR No.26/2010, now numbered as

CC No.1280/2010 on the file of The Civil Judge (Jr. Dn.)

&amp; JMFC, at Nanjangud is hereby quashed.


</p><p id="p_20">       It is made clear that this order shall not come in

the way of the respondent to take recourse any other

remedy available under law.
