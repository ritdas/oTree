<p id="p_1">         Prayer in the instant petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. has

been made for quashing Complaint No.COMA388/2013 dated

14.12.2011 (P-8) and summoning order dated 14.12.2011 (P-9) and all

subsequent proceedings arising therefrom.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         Briefly, respondent No.1 filed a complaint dated 14.12.2011

(Annexure P-8) against the petitioners under <a href="/doc/73521/" id="a_2">Sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/120844/" id="a_3">44</a> read

with <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_4">Section 47</a> of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution)

Act, 1974 (for short, "Act") as amended for violation of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_5">Sections 24</a>,

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_7">26</a> of the said Act on the ground that the petitioner as a colonizer

carved out a residential colony named as Rajinder Estate at Moga

without providing basic amenities and facilities.

</p><p id="p_4">         The petitioners by way of instant petition have laid challenge

to the aforesaid complaint (Annexure P-8) on the ground that the same

was liable to be dismissed being not maintainable, inasmuch as, they

had provided all basic amenities and facilities before allotment of plots

to the buyers. In fact, at the time of granting licence to the petitioners,

no condition was imposed upon them for installation of any effluent

treatment plant. It was simply directed that charges for sewerage and

water connection shall directly be payable to Municipal Corporation-

respondent No.3 by the petitioners. Therefore, no space for effluent

treatment plant was reserved in the layout plan. The                officers of

respondent No.1 inspected the colony carved out by the petitioners and

being not satisfied with the sewerage effluent treatment work carried

out by them, passed order dated 10.12.2008 asking the petitioners to

submit/produce a bank guarantee of Rs.5 lakhs as an assurance to

install sewerage treatment plant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         Consequently, petitioners wrote a letter to PUDA for approval

of a revised layout plan, reserving a site for installation of sewerage

treatment plant in compliance to the aforesaid order dated 10.12.2008

of respondent No.1.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_6">         However, in the meantime, respondent No.1 filed the

impugned complaint for no fault of the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_7">         Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_8">         Admittedly, the approval has been granted to the petitioners

by respondent No.3, permitting them to join the sewerage lines of their

colony in its sewerage line vide letter No.1138 dated 08.10.1996.

Therefore, there is no necessity to install sewerage treatment plant in

compliance to the order dated 10.12.2008 of respondent No.1.

</p><p id="p_9">         Consequently, the impugned complaint (P-8) and summoning

order dated 14.12.2011 (P-9) are liable to be quashed.

</p><p id="p_10">         Ordered accordingly.
