           SUIT FOR PERMANENT &amp; MANDATORY INJUNCTION.

: JUDGMENT :
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1. Plaintiff has filed this suit for permanent and mandatory injunction. He

  has   claimed   himself   to   be   tenant   of   entire   first   &amp;   second   floor   of

  property bearing No.1810, Katra Sheikh Chand, Lal Kuan, Delhi.   It is

  the   case   of   the   plaintiff   that   defendant   no.1   is   in   possession   of   the
                                        Page numbers

ground floor and about a year back from the filing of the suit started

using   the   ground   floor   for   the   purpose   of   running   business   of

commercial   cook   and   for   that   purpose,   he   installed  bhatti  in   the

courtyard and the said bhattis are burnt by wooden fuel because meat

and other items cannot be prepared by any other fuel as they require

high heating which can be given only by wooden fuel.  It is the case of

the plaintiff that due to the burning of this wood, smoke travels to the

first and second floor which cause pollution and inconvenience to the

plaintiff.     It   is   the   case   of   the   plaintiff   that   the   said  bhatti  and   the

business   of   commercial   cook   has   been   carried   out   without   getting

licence from defendant no.2 (MCD) under the D.M.C. Act.  It is further

stated that he is also to take permission from defendant no.3 i.e. Delhi

Pollution   Board.     Hence,   the   suit   has   been   filed   for   restraining

defendant   no.1   from   burning   of   wooden   fuel  bhatti  and   running

commercial business without getting proper licence.  It is also prayed

that   mandatory   injunction   be   also   passed   against   defendant   no.2

directing   them   to   take   action   against   defendant   no.1   for   running

business   without   obtaining   licence.     A   further   injunction   has   been

prayed directing defendant no.3 to take action against defendant no.1

for running the pollution unit without proper 'No Objection' certificate.

</p><p id="p_3">2. In  the  written   statement  filed  by   defendant  no.1,   he  stated  that  the

  present   suit   has   been   filed   as   a   counterblast   due   to   the   various

  litigations   between   the   parties.     He   has   denied   that   he   is   using   a

  wooden bhatti and further stated that no licence was required and no

  'No Objection' certificate was required from the Pollution Department

  as the Pollution Department has already inspected the premises and

  the same was found in order.   He denied the case of the plaintiff.  He

  denied that any licence was required to carry out this business activity. 



</p><p id="p_4">3. Written statement   also been filed by defendant no.2 who stated that

  the suit premises was inspected by the area officials of defendant no.2

  and they found that defendant no.1 was using one room at the ground

  floor   as   commercial   kitchen   without   any   trade   licence/municipal

  licence.     As   such,   he   was   prosecuted   for   running   the   trade   without

  licence under Sec.417/397 of D.M.C. Act.  It was further stated that as &amp;

  when work in the commercial kitchen would be seen in progress, the

  same shall be dealt strictly as per the provisions of D.M.C. Act.



</p><p id="p_5">4. Defendant   no.3   also   filed   their   written   statement   stating   that   their

  officials had also inspected the site on 28.3.2003 and did not find any

  cooking   activity   or   pollution   activity   and   a   letter   was   issued   to
                                       Page numbers

   the plaintiff who denied the case of the defendants and reiterated the

   averments in the plaint.

  g. Relief.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">8. The plaintiff examined himself as PW­ 1 and none of the defendants

  cross examined this witness.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">9. I   have   heard   the   final   arguments   advanced   by   plaintiff   as   well   as

  defendant no.2 and my issuewise finding is as under:

</p><p id="p_20">                          I propose to decide Issues No. 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 before deciding

     Issues No.1 &amp; 2.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

  ISSUES NO.3&amp;4 

</p><p id="p_22">10.The  burden to prove both  these  issues  was on defendant no.1 who

  failed to lead any evidence and therefore, this issue is decided against
                                      Page numbers

  the defendant and in favour of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

  ISSUE NO.5 

</p><p id="p_24">11.The suit of the plaintiff is for injunction which is covered under the

  Proviso to Sec. 478 of D.M.C. Act.  The burden to prove this issue was

  on defendant no.2 who did not lead any evidence.  Hence, the issue is

  decided against the defendant and in favour of the plaintiff.



  ISSUE NO.6 

</p><p id="p_25">12.The   burden   to   prove   this   issue   was   upon   the   defendant   no.3.     An

  application of the defendant no.3 under Sec. 46 of the Air Prevention &amp;

  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution Act</a> of 1981 was allowed vide order dated 8.1.2004,

  Defendant no.3 did not lead any evidence to prove this issue.  In view

  of the same, the issue is decided against the defendant.



  ISSUE NO.1 

</p><p id="p_26">13.  The  plaintiff  has   examined  himself   and  proved   that   the   defendant

  no.1 was carrying out a commercial kitchen and burning wooden fuel

  bhatti  and   was   also   running   business   without   proper   licence   from

  defendant no.2 and without obtaining proper sanction from defendant

  no.3.  Finally, defendant no.2 &amp; 3 inspected the premises of defendant
                                       Page numbers

   no.1   and   the   activity   of   defendant   no.1   was   booked   by   officials   of

   defendant no.2 and after prosecuting him, he was warned not to carry

   out commercial business without obtaining a valid municipal licence.

   Similarly, officials of defendant no.3 after inspecting the premises of

   defendant no.1 issued a direction to him not to use wooden fuel and to

   convert the same to LPG.   It is also quite clear that burning of wood

   from   the   kitchen   emits   smoke   and   is   obviously   causing   nuisance   to

   plaintiff   who   is   residing   on   the   second   floor   of   the   premises.

   Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff.



   ISSUE NO.2 

</p><p id="p_27">14.   It   has   been   proved   by   the   pleadings   of   defendant   no.2   &amp;   3   that

   defendant no.1 was running the business without obtaining any licence

   from defendant no.2 and also 'No Objection' from defendant no.3.  The

   defendant no.1 or the other defendants have not cross examined the

   plaintiff   on   this   averment   and   therefore,   due   to   this   unchallenged

   statement of the plaintiff, this issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff.



   Relief

</p><p id="p_28">15.  In view of the findings on the issues above, plaintiff is entitled for a

   decree  of permanent   injunction.    Defendant  no.1  is  restrained  from
                                       Page numbers

  burning   wooden   fuel  bhatti  and   from   running   commercial   business

  defendant   no.   2   &amp;   3   are   further   directed   to   take   action   against   the

  defendant   no.1   as   per   law   in   case   of   any   breach   committed   by
