<p id="p_1">JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">            The appellants, while being engaged in the business of  stocking
iron ore, had  allegedly violated certain norms  prescribed  by  the  Deputy
Commissioner under  <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_1">Section  22</a>  of  the  Air  (Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control  of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  '<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air  Act</a>').   The
allegation against the appellants was, that they had  illegally  established
iron ore stack yard(s) at various places in  Uttara  Kannada  District.   It
was alleged, that the appellants  had  not  made  provisions  for  pollution
control measures, despite repeated requests and instructions given to  them,
by the officials of the Karnata State Pollution Control  Board  (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Board').  It was  therefore,  that  CC  No.546/2006,  CC
No.547/2006, CC  No.548/2006  and  CC  No.549/2006  were  filed  before  the
Judicial Magistrate, First Class-II, Karwar.  The  proceedings  against  the
appellants were sought to be challenged by  petitions  filed  under  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_4">Section
482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, wherein  the  appellants  prayed  for
quashing of the above proceedings.
</p><p id="p_3">            A number of similar criminal petitions, filed by the  appellants
and others, were sought to be disposed of by the High  Court  of  Karnataka,
Circuit Bench at Dharwad (hereinafter referred to as the 'High  Court'),  by
a common order dated 7.1.2009. The above order dated  7.1.2009,  is  subject
to challenge in these appeals. A perusal  of  the  impugned  order  reveals,
that the High Court did not examine  the  merits  of  the  controversy.   To
dispose of the merits of the claim raised by the appellants before the  High
Court, it relied  upon  an  earlier  order  passed  by  the  High  Court  on
17.04.2007, disposing   of  Criminal  Petition  No.  4760  of  2006.   Based
thereon, the challenge raised by the appellants before this Court, was  also
sought to be  rejected.   The  factual  position  indicated  hereinabove  is
apparent from paragraphs 3 to 5 of  the  impugned  order,  which  are  being
extracted hereunder:
</p><p id="p_4">"3.   The allegations against  the  respective  petitioner  is  that,  while
being engaged in the business of stocking iron  ore,  the  petitioners  have
violated the norms prescribed by the Deputy Commissioner  and  thus  offence
un/s 22 of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Pollution Control Act</a>, has been  committed  and  the  further
allegation  in  the  complaint  is  that  the  petitioners  have   illegally
established and operating iron ore stack yard at various  places  in  Uttara
Kannada District  without  the  previous  consent  of  the  Karnataka  State
Pollution Control Board (for  short,  'the  Board')  and  that  the  accused
petitioners  have  not  provided  any  pollution  control  measures  despite
repeated requests and instruction given to them  by  the  officials  of  the
Board.  Based on the complaint lodged by the Board,  learned  Magistrate  of
the trial Court directed issuance of process against the petitioners. It  is
this order of the trial Court that  is  called  in  question  in  all  these
petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    At the outset, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that  the
present petitions are liable to be dismissed as all  the  grounds  urged  in
the present petitions by each one of the petitioner have been considered  by
this Court in a batch of petitions which were disposed of  on  17.4.2007  in
Crl. Petition No. 4760/06 and connected petitions.  Therefore,  the  present
petitions are also liable to be dismissed following the aforesaid  order  of
this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.    Learned counsel appearing  for  the  respective  petitioner  have  not
disputed  the  fact  of  this  court  having  already  dismissed  the  other
petitions filed by the petitioners which are similarly placed  and  all  the
contentions which are urged in the present petitions  have  been  considered
by  the  learned  single  Judge  while  dismissing  batch  of  petitions  on
17.4.2007."
</p>

<p id="p_7">             During  the  course  of  hearing,  learned  counsel   for   the
appellants invited our attention to the fact, that cognizance of an  offence
could be taken only by the Board or an officer authorised by the  Board,  in
terms of <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_6">Section 43</a> of the Air Act.  <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_7">Section  43</a>  afore-mentioned,  was  the
primary basis of  the  challenge  raised  before  us.   The  same  is  being
reproduced hereunder:
</p><p id="p_8">"43.  Cognizance of offences - (1) No court shall  take  cognizance  of  any
offence under this Act except on a complaint made by -
</p>
<p id="p_9">(a)   a Board or any officer authorised in this behalf by it; or

</p><p id="p_10">(b)   any person who has given notice of not less than sixty  days,  in  the
manner prescribed, of the alleged offence and of his  intention  to  make  a
complaint to the Board or officer authorised as aforesaid,
and no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan  Magistrate  or  a  Judicial
Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence  punishable  under  this
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(2)   Where a complaint has been made under clause (b) of  sub-section  (1),
the Board shall, on demand by  such  person,  make  available  the  relevant
reports in its possession to that person:
</p>
<p id="p_12">Provided that the Board may refuse to make  any  such  report  available  to
such person if the same is, in its opinion, against the public interest."
</p>

<p id="p_13">            Our attention has been pointedly invited to sub-section  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_8">Section 43</a> of the Air Act.  Having perused the same,  there  cannot  be  any
doubt, that when the authorities decided to initiate proceedings  under  the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>, the complaint could have been made either by  the
Board or by an officer authorised by the Board.  The question which  has  to
be adjudicated upon (as has been raised by  the  appellants),  was  whether,
the complaint in furtherance of which CC No. 546/2006,  CC  No.547/2006,  CC
No.548/2006 and CC No.549/2006, had been filed by the Board, or  an  officer
authorised by the Board.  To be valid, in terms of the  mandate  of  <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_10">Section
43(1)</a> of the Air Act, it ought to be filed either by  the  Board  or  by  an
officer authorised by the Board.
</p><p id="p_14">             Insofar  as  the  above  mentioned  aspect  of  the  matter  is
concerned, it is not a matter of dispute, that vide  notification/resolution
dated 29.3.1989, the  Karnataka  State  Pollution  Control  Board  delegated
certain powers to the Chairman  of  the  Board.   The  aforesaid  resolution
(limited to the instant issue), is being reproduced below:
"subject :  Delegation/Empowering of Technical,
No.63.11    Administrative and Finalcial Powers to
                 Chairman, Member Secretary and Other
                 Officers working in the Board.
</p><p id="p_15">The subject of Delegation of Power  to  the  Chairman  was  also  discussed,
while subject No.10 was being  discussed.  After  detailed  discussion,  the
Board decided to delegate its power and functions to  the  Chairman  of  the
Board in terms of  <a href="/doc/546828/" id="a_11">Section  11A</a>  of  the  Water(Prevention  and  Control  of
Pollution)Act, 1978 (Amended) and <a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_12">Section 15</a> of Air (Prevention and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 under the following circumstances:
</p>
<p id="p_16">a)    In respect of industries who are discharging their effluent without  a
valid consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_14">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_15">26</a> of the Water (Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control  of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and  under  <a href="/doc/22265957/" id="a_17">Section  23</a>  of  the  Air  (Prevention  and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the  Chairman  is  authorized  to  initiate
legal action under relevant sections.
</p>
<p id="p_17">b)    In respect of Industries against whom orders passed  by  the  Chairman
under <a href="/doc/1829773/" id="a_19">Section 32(1)(c)</a> of the Water (Prevention and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_20">Control  of  Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/22265957/" id="a_21">Section  23</a>  of  the  Air  (Prevention  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">Control  of
Pollution)  Act</a>,  1981  and  if  such  Units  have  not  complied  with  the
directions issued, the Chairman of  the  Board  is  authorized  to  initiate
legal action for violating  the  direction  issued  under  <a href="/doc/29853635/" id="a_23">Section  32(1)(c)</a>
under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_24">Water Act</a> and  <a href="/doc/991807/" id="a_25">Section  23</a>  of  the  Air  Act,  under  relevant  penal
provision of the respective Acts.
</p>
<p id="p_18"><a href="/doc/77633/" id="a_26">The Legal Act</a>ion initiated in terms  of  above  delegation  of  powers,  the
Board shall be kept informed at the next immediate meeting."
</p>

<p id="p_19">The Board could delegate the above power  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,
because <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_27">Section 43(1)</a> of the Air Act, allowed it to do so. In  view  of  the
conclusions recorded above, consequent upon the passing  of  the  resolution
dated 29.3.1989, the complaint under <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_28">Section 43(1)</a> of  the  Air  Act,  could
have been filed either by the Board or by its Chairman.
</p><p id="p_20">             According  to  the  learned  counsel   for   the   respondents,
proceedings came to be initiated by an order dated 4.4.2006  passed  by  the
Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.   Relevant  extract
of the above order is reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_21">"In view of the above, I do here by authorize the Regional  Officer,  Karwar
to initiate criminal action under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_29">Section 37</a> of Air (Prevention and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 by filing  criminal  case  in  the  competent  court
against 17 occupiers of the Iron Ore Stack Yards located in and  around  the
Karwar, Ankola and Jolda Taluks of Uttara Kannada District as per  the  list
enclosed as Annexure-1."
</p>

<p id="p_22">Having perused the aforesaid communication it emerges, that the Chairman  of
the Board authorised  the  Regional  Office,  Karwar  to  initiate  criminal
action under <a href="/doc/1296808/" id="a_31">Section 37</a> of the Air Act, by filing criminal cases  in  Courts
having jurisdiction to deal with them, against 17 owners of iron  ore  stack
yards, located in and around the Karwar, Ankola and Jolda Taluks  of  Uttara
Kannada District. It is not  possible  to  accept,  the  contention  of  the
respondents, that initiation of the proceedings on the basis  of  the  above
order dated 4.4.2006 can be treated as compliance of the  mandate  contained
in <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_32">Section 43(1)</a> of the Air  Act,  because  the  same  has  reference  to  a
complaint made by the "Board or any officer authorised  in  this  behalf  by
it".
</p><p id="p_23">            In compliance with the order of  the  Chairman  dated  4.4.2006,
the Regional  Officer(Deputy  Environmental  Officer  Sri  Gopalakrishna  B.
Sanatangi, filed complaints before the Judicial Magistrate, First  Class-II,
Karwar.  It is natural therefore to conclude,  that  the  complaint  against
the appellants was neither filed by the  Board  or  its  Chairman,  but  was
filed by the Regional Officer (Deputy Environmental Officer).
</p>
<p id="p_24">             <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_33">Section  43</a>  of  the  Air  Act  has  already   been   extracted
hereinabove.  It is apparent therefrom, that Courts  would  take  cognizance
of complaints filed by the Board, or any officer authorised  by  the  Board,
in that behalf. The notification/resolution dated 29.3.1989 indicates,  that
the officer authorised was the Chairman  of  the  Board.   The  Board  could
delegate the above power to the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  because  <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_34">Section
43(1)</a> of the Air Act, authorised the Board to do so.  In that  view  of  the
matter, either the Board or the Chairman of the Board could have  filed  the
complaints in terms of the mandate contained in <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_35">Section  43(1)</a>  of  the  Air
Act.  The power to file the complaint could not be exercised  by  any  other
authority/officer.  Under the principle of 'delegatus not potest  delegare',
the delegatee (the Chairman of the Board) could not have  further  delegated
the authority vested in him, except by a clear mandate of law.   <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_36">Section  43</a>
of the Air Act vested the authority, to  file  complaints  with  the  Board.
<a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_37">Section 43</a> afore-mentioned, also authorised the Board to delegate the  above
authority to any "officer authorised in this behalf by  it".   The  "officer
authorised in this behalf" was not authorised by the provisions  of  <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_38">Section
43</a> of the Air Act, or by any other provision thereof, to  further  delegate,
the authority to file complaints. The Chairman of the Board, therefore,  had
no authority to  delegate  the  power  to  file  complaints,  to  any  other
authority, for taking cognizance of offences  under  the  <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_39">Air  Act</a>.   It  is
apparent, that the determination to initiate action against the  appellants,
and other similarly placed persons, against whom action was proposed  to  be
taken, by the Chairman of the Board, vide his order dated 4.4.2006, was  not
in consonance with law.  Annexure P-11,  appended  to  Criminal  Appeal  No.
152/2012 reveals, that the  complaint was filed, and  the  proceedings  were
initiated before the Judicial Magistrate, First  Class-II,  Karwar,  by  the
Regional  Officer(Deputy  Environmental  Officer)   Sri   Gopalakrishna   B.
Sanatangi, in his capacity as a  complainant.  The  Regional  Officer(Deputy
Environmental Officer) Sri Gopalakrishna B. Sanatangi, had  no  jurisdiction
to prefer such complaints.  Accordingly, we are of the view, that the afore-
stated complaints dated 28.04.2006 are  liable  to  be  set  aside,  on  the
instant technical ground itself.  Ordered accordingly.
</p><p id="p_25">            Since the petitions filed by the appellants, under  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_40">Section  482</a>
of the Criminal Procedure Code, are being accepted  merely  on  a  technical
ground, we hereby direct the competent authority, namely, the Board (or  the
Chairman of the Board) to re-initiate the above proceedings,  in  consonance
with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1003254/" id="a_41">Section 43(1)</a> of the  Air  Act.   The  process  shall
positively be re-initiated  within  two  months  from  today.   In  case  of
failure  to  initiate  fresh  proceedings   within   the   time   stipulated
hereinabove, it shall be imperative for the competent  authority,  to  place
the reasons for not doing so before this Court, on the expiry  of  a  period
of two months.  Extension of time, if needed, shall also be  sought  by  the
authorities  from  this  Court,  by  moving  an  appropriate   interlocutory
application.           Needless to mention, that  on  re-initiation  of  the
proceedings, the concerned authorities, and  the  Courts  below,  shall  not
take into consideration any observations  recorded  by  us,  or  the  Courts
below, while adjudicating upon the merits of instant controversy.  It  shall
be open to the parties to raise all contentions, as  may  be   available  to
them, in consonance with law.
