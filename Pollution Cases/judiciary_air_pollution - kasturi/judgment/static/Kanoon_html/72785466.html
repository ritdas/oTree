<p id="p_1">1.        The      present      petition     under      <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article      226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">/227</a>      of

<p id="p_2">2.        The     petitioner     being     Municipal      Council,     Guna     has
approached this court against the interlocutory order dated
29.11. 2016 vide P-1 by which the Bhopal Bench of the National
Green Tribunal in O.A. No. 336/<a href="/doc/29119813/" id="a_4">2014 (CZ) Mamta Devi v. State

       of the State Government and the Municipal Authority as
       to which of the two is responsible for removal of the
       encroachments and the cleaning of the river Gunia/Nigri
       they undertake that in accordance with the directions

       cleaning of the river.

        assistance in this behalf to the Municipal Authority.

<p id="p_3">3.        The bare perusal of the above impugned order reflects
that despite the counsel for the petitioner appearing before the
      2 Nagar Palika Parishad thr its <a href="/doc/121095379/" id="a_6">Chief Municipal Officer v. State of M.P and Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_4">                                                                     WP.193.2017

Tribunal being in the know of dispute of territorial jurisdiction
between the State Government and the municipality in regard to
removal of encroachment and cleaning of the river in question,
undertook that the Council shall take all necessary steps                        for
removing         the encroachment as directed by the Tribunal                    for
cleaning the river. Accordingly, the Tribunal afforded one month
time for doing the needful by adding the rider that in case the
needful is not done the concerned persons including the
Chairman and CMO of the petitioner Council shall expose
themselves to the rigors prescribed under Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for brevity 'Act of 1974')
</p><p id="p_5">4.        Learned counsel submits that the area in question which
has to be cleaned is not under jurisdiction of the Municipal
Council and therefore no effort whatsoever can be made by the
Council in compliance of the order of the Tribunal impugned
herein.
</p><p id="p_6">5.        It   appears      that    the    Municipal      Council     instead     of
approaching the Tribunal by filing appropriate application seeking
recalling or modification of the order dated 29.11. 2016                          or
assailing the said order before the Apex Court u/S. 22 of the
<a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_8">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 (for brevity 'Act of 2010') has
chosen to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this court to interfere in
the matter relating to encroachment for which complete                         code
under Act of 2010 is provided.
</p><p id="p_7">6.        Admittedly the writ jurisdiction of this court is not barred
by the Act of 2010 for interfering in environmental matters but
once       a distinct      mechanism prescribing            special courts and
authorities are constituted under the special enactment of the
Act of         2010, this court refrains from exercising it's writ
jurisdiction unless a case of grave failure of justice is made out
which cannot be looked into by statutory forums constituted by
           3 Nagar Palika Parishad thr its <a href="/doc/121095379/" id="a_9">Chief Municipal Officer v. State of M.P and Ors</a>.
</p><p id="p_8">                                                                          WP.193.2017

     law for the said purpose.
</p><p id="p_9">     7.        This court thus declines interference in writ jurisdiction
     under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Article 226</a> of Constitution of India and therefore the
     present petition stands dismissed.
