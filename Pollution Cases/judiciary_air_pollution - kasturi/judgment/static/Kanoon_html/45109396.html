<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  Page 1 of 3</span>
<p id="p_1">           R/CR.A/564/2001                                   JUDGMENT




        The present appeal under sec. 378 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, is directed against the impugned judgment and order
rendered in Criminal Case No. 2550/1991 by the Judicial Magistrate,
First Class, Ankleshwar dated 18th May 1999 recording acquittal for the
offences under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.      The facts of the case, briefly stated, are that respondent No.1 is the
industry and respondents Nos. 2 &amp; 3 are the responsible officers in-
charge of the affairs of respondent No. 1. It is the case of the prosecution
that on 14.11.1990 when the officers of the complainant Gujarat Pollution
Control Board visited the premises of respondent No.1 industry, it was
found that affluent water was allowed to flow outside without any
treatment resulting in the fertility of the land and also causing hazard to
the public health which led to filing of the complaint culminating into the
aforesaid Criminal Case No. 2550/91.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.      On the basis of the complaint the aforesaid case has been registered
and the court below proceeded with the trial. In order to bring home the
charges levelled against the respondents-original accused, the witnesses
were examined and the statements of the respondents original accused
were recorded under sec. 313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">CrPC</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.      After hearing the learned advocate for the appellant as well as the
learned advocate for the respondents accused, the court below recorded
acquittal on appreciation of the material and evidence. It is this judgment
and order which has been assailed in the present appeal by the appellant
Board.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.      Heard learned advocate Shri Biren Vaishnav for the appellant

          R/CR.A/564/2001                                  JUDGMENT




Board, learned advocate Shri GM Joshi for the respondents accused and
learned APP Shri HK Patel for respondent No.4-State.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.     In view of the submissions and having regard to the reasons
recorded for arriving at the findings and the conclusion, it cannot be said
that the findings are erroneous, much less perverse, which would call for
any interference in the present appeal. The court below, on appreciation
of material and evidence, referred to the procedure required to be
followed including the mandatory procedure in Rule 27 of the Gujarat
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. The court
below has also referred to the aspect of taking of samples and the
procedure followed and has recorded the findings referring to rule 27 of
the Rules that the mandatory provision of the rule has not been followed.
The court below has also referred to and relied upon the judgment of this
High Court reported in 1996 (2) GLH 138.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.     As it transpires from the observations, Rule 27 is mandatory and
similar contentions have been dealt with with reference to Rule 27.
Therefore, in light of the provisions of the Act as well as the Rules, and
also the observations made by the High Court in the aforesaid judgment
in the case reported in 1996 (2) GLH 138, the findings cannot be said to
be perverse which would call for any interference in the present appeal.
This court is in complete agreement with the findings and conclusion
arrived at by the court below on appreciation of material and evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8.     Therefore, the present appeal deserves to be dismissed and
accordingly stands dismissed. Bail bonds, if any, shall stand cancelled.
</p>
