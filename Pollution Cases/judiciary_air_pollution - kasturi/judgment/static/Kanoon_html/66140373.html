</p><p id="p_6">3.    Notice. Mr. Mayank Mishra, Advocate accepts notice on behalf of
the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.    With consent of parties, arguments have been heard, and we proceed
to dispose of this Letters patent appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.    The appellant has preferred the present Letters Patent Appeal to assail
the judgment dated 08.05.2017 passed by the learned Single Judge in
W.P.(C) No. 8031/2016. Vide the impugned judgment, the learned Single
Judge has dismissed the appellants said writ petition as being not
maintainable against the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.    The case of the appellant/ petitioner in the writ petition was that the
petitioner had started construction of the Rajpur Hydro Electrical Project in
Rajpura Village, Tehsil Shimla, District Himachal Pradesh, and had entered
into an agreement with the respondent, M/s PTC India Financial Services
Ltd. to obtain a loan of Rs. 60 crores, out of the total project cost of Rs.
85.75 crores.     The grievance of the petitioner was that the respondent
disbursed only an amount of Rs. 47 crores by 01.11.2015. By that time,
80% of the project was already complete. The respondent, however, failed
to release the balance loan amount which was essential for completion of the
project.   The said failure on the part of the respondent resulted in the
petitioner's inability to complete the project. The respondent, rather than
disbursing the balance loan amount, served a notice dated 17.06.2016 upon
the petitioner's promoters threatening to acquire 100% equity shares of the
promoters in the petitioner company. Consequently, the writ petition was



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">LPA 401/2017                                                      Page 2 of 25</span>
 preferred to seek a writ of mandamus against the respondent so as to restrain
the respondent from acquiring the promoters 100% equity share capital in
the petitioner company, or taking any coercive steps against the assets of the
petitioner company. The petitioner also sought a direction to the respondent
to disburse the complete sanctioned credit facility and provide the overall
costs of the project, on account of the alleged non-disbursal of the entire
sanctioned loan as per the Agreement dated 28.03.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.    Upon issuance of notice in the petition, on 15.09.2016 learned counsel
for the respondent appeared and contested the maintainability of the writ
petition on the ground that it was neither a 'State' nor a 'Public Authority'
or a 'Government Agency', and that it was not amenable to the writ
jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.    The learned Single Judge has held in the impugned judgment that the
writ petition was not maintainable since the respondent was neither 'State';
nor 'an Authority' nor "an instrumentality of the State'. In the course of the
impugned judgment, the learned Single Judge has considered the various
pronouncements of the Supreme Court on the issue, viz.:

 fourth tests are attracted in the facts of the present case. The relevant extract
from this decision, wherein the tests at Serial Nos. 1 &amp;4 were laid down by
the Supreme Court reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "9.     The tests for determining as to when a corporation can
      be said to be a instrumentality or agency of Government may
      now be called out from the judgment in the International
      Airport Authority's case. These tests are not conclusive or
      clinching, but they are merely indicative indicia which have to
      be used with care and caution, because while stressing the
      necessity of a wide meaning to be placed on the expression
      "other authorities", it must be realised that it should not be
      stretched so far as to bring in every autonomous body which
      has some nexus with the Government within the sweep of the
      expression. A wide enlargement of the meaning must be
      tempered by a wise limitation. We may summarise the relevant
      tests gathered from the decision in the International Airport
      Authority's case as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      (1)      One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the
               corporation is held by Government it would go a
               long way towards indicating that the corporation is an
               instrumentality or agency of Government.

      (4)      Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_19">               an indication that the Corporation is a State agency or

 reads as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      "40. The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests
      formulated in Ajay Hasia are not a rigid set of principles so
      that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex hypothesi,
      be considered to be a State within the meaning of Article
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      12. The question in each case would be whether in the light of
      the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially,
      functionally and administratively dominated by or under the
      control of the Government. Such control must be particular to
      the body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found
      then the body is a State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12.</a> On the other hand,
      when the control is merely regulatory whether under statute
      or otherwise, it would not serve to make the body a State."
      (emphasis supplied)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">14.   Mr. Malhotra submits that the PTC India Ltd. exercises control over
the respondent company and in this regard, he places reliance upon the
definition of the expression "    Control" under Section 2 (27) of the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_19">Companies Act</a> 2013, which reads as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">      "(27) "control" shall include the right to appoint majority of
      the directors or to control the management or policy decisions
      exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in
      concert, directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their
      shareholding or management rights or shareholders
      agreements or voting agreements or in any other manner."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">15.   The submission of Mr. Malhotra is that the Board of Directors of the
respondent company controls its polices and functions. Since the Board of
Directors of the respondent company is controlled by PTC India Limited
and other public sector companies, it is under the indirect control of the
Government and is, therefore, amenable to the jurisdiction, as it falls within
the definition of 'other authority'.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">LPA 401/2017                                                      Page 10 of 25</span>
<p id="p_23"> 16.   Mr. Malhotra also places reliance on State of Uttar Pradesh &amp;Anr.
Vs. Radhey Shyam Rai, (2009) 5 SCC 577 and, in particular, on para 23 of
the said decision where the Supreme court took into consideration the fact
that the majority of the office-bearers of the Government Council of Uttar
Pradesh Sansathan were holders of various offices of the Government, and
the Supreme Court observed that there was dominance of the holders of the
offices of the Government of Uttar Pradesh and the Governing Council of
the said Sansathan. He also relies on para 26 of this decision which reads
as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      "26. From the materials placed before the Court there cannot
      be any doubt whatsoever that the State exercises a deep and
      pervasive control over the affairs of the Sansthan, the Cane
      Commissioner being at the helm of the affairs. The Accounts
      Officer is the officer of the State Government and, is also sent
      on deputation. The majority of the members of the Governing
      Council, as noticed hereinbefore, are holders of different offices
      of the State Government. They play a vital role in carrying out
      the affairs of the Sansthan. They alone have power to appoint
      anybody of their choice on the post. It is required to obey all
      the directions issued by the State Government from time to time.
      We, therefore, are of the opinion that the Full Bench of the
      High Court has rightly held the Sansthan "State" within the
      meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_20">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India."
</blockquote><p id="p_24">17.   Mr. Malhotra also places reliance on the observations made in para 11
of the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1944115/" id="a_21">Mysore Paper Mills Ltd. vs.
Mysore Paper Mills Officers' Association and Anr</a>., (2002) 2 SCC 167.
The relevant extract thereof reads as under:-

       but enumerated from the day-to-day running of the business and
      administration of the Company leave no room for any doubt as
      to the identity of the appellant-Company being "other
      authority" and consequently "the State" within the meaning of
      <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_22">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">18.   On the other hand, Mr. Mehra, learned Sr. counsel for the
respondent/Caveator supports the impugned judgment. He submits that
PTC India Ltd itself is not an "instrumentality" of the State in as much, as,
only 16% shares in the PTC India Ltd are held by the promoters and the
remaining are held by the Domestic and the International Financial
Institutions. Thus, the foundation of the appellant's argument is itself
fallacious, since the same is premised on the assumption that PTC India
Ltd. is a Government Company. He points out that PTC India Ltd is a
registered Company whose shares are traded on the stock exchange. He
further submits that the respondent is a finance company and its activities
are like any other private finance company. He submits that notice under
<a href="/doc/1960266/" id="a_23">Section 13</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_24">SARFAESI Act</a> has already been issued to the
petitioner. As and when the respondent takes any steps under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_25">section 13(4)</a>
of the SARFAESI Act, the petitioners will be entitled to approach the Debt
Recovery Tribunal for relief under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_26">Section 17</a> of the SARFAESI Act.
</p>
<p id="p_26">19.   In rejoinder, Mr. Malhotra submits that when the writ petition was
preferred, action under <a href="/doc/1960266/" id="a_27">Section 13</a> (4) of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_28">SARFAESI Act</a> had not yet
been initiated, and merely because the same was initiated subsequently, the
issue of maintainability of the writ petition cannot be decided on the basis
of such subsequent development.

 consideration to the matter. We have also gone through the impugned
judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_28">21.   In Federal Bank (supra), the eight categories of bodies/ persons who
may be found amenable to writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India were stated as follows:
</p>
<pre id="pre_9">      i)       the State (Government);

      ii)      an authority;

      iii)     a statutory body;

      iv)      an instrumentality or agency of the State;

      v)       a company which is financed and owned by the State;

      vi)      a private body run substantially on State funding;

      vii)     a private body discharging public duty or positive obligation
               of public nature; and

</pre><p id="p_29">      viii) a person or a body under liability to discharge any function
               under any Statute, to compel it to perform such a statutory
               function.
</p>
<p id="p_30">22.   In the present case, though the appellant claims that M/s PTC India
Ltd. is a government company i.e. a company of which the over-whelming
majority of shares are held by the government, there is nothing placed on
record to substantiate this assertion of the appellant. On the contrary, it
appears that only about 16% shares in M/s PTC India Ltd. are held by the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">LPA 401/2017                                                        Page 13 of 25</span>
 promoters and the remaining are held by the Domestic and International
Financial Institutions. This fundamental premise of the appellant's case is,
therefore, knocked out.    The respondent company is, undisputedly not
discharging a sovereign function, a public duty or positive obligation of
public nature. It is not pointed out that the respondent company is under an
obligation or a statutory liability to discharge any function under any
Statute, the performance whereof can be compelled through the writ of a
court. The respondent company is a finance company. The appellant itself
claims to have agreed to obtain finances from the respondent company for
its hydro electric project in Himachal Pradesh.
</p>
<p id="p_31">23.   The observations of the Supreme Court in Federal Bank (supra) are
aptly attracted in the present scenario. The Supreme Court, inter alia,
observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      "26. A company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_30">Companies Act</a> for the
      purposes of carrying on any trade or business is a private
      enterprise to earn livelihood and to make profits out of such
      activities. Banking is also a kind of profession and a
      commercial activity, the primary motive behind it can well be
      said to earn returns and profits. Since time immemorial, such
      activities have been carried on by individuals generally. It is a
      private affair of the company though the case of nationalized
      banks stands on a different footing. There may well be
      companies, in which majority of the share capital may be
      contributed out of the State funds and in that view of the matter
      there may be more participation or dominant participation of
      the State in managing the affairs of the company. But in the
      present case we are concerned with a banking company which
      has its own resources to raise its funds without any
      contribution or shareholding by the State. It has its own
      Board of Directors elected by its shareholders. It works like




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">LPA 401/2017                                                     Page 14 of 25</span>
       any other private company in the banking business having no
      monopoly status at all. Any company carrying on banking
      business with a capital of five lakhs will become a scheduled
      bank. All the same, banking activity as a whole carried on by
      various banks undoubtedly has an impact and effect on the
      economy of the country in general. Money of the shareholders
      and the depositors is with such companies, carrying on banking
      activity. The banks finance the borrowers on any given rate of
      interest at a particular time. They advance loans as against
      securities. Therefore, it is obviously necessary to have
      regulatory check over such activities in the interest of the
      company itself, the shareholders, the depositors as well as to
      maintain the proper financial equilibrium of the national
      economy. The banking companies have not been set up for the
      purposes of building the economy of the State; on the other
      hand such private companies have been voluntarily established
      for their own purposes and interest but their activities are kept
      under check so that their activities may not go wayward and
      harm the economy in general. A private banking company with
      all freedom that it has, has to act in a manner that it may not be
      in conflict with or against the fiscal policies of the State and for
      such purposes, guidelines are provided by Reserve Bank so that
      a proper fiscal discipline, to conduct its affairs in carrying on
      its business, is maintained. So as to ensure adherence to such
      fiscal discipline, if need be, at times even the management of
      the company can be taken over. Nonetheless, as observed
      earlier, these are all regulatory measures to keep a check and
      provide guidelines and not a participatory dominance or
      control over the affairs of the company. For other companies in
      general carrying on other business activities, maybe
      manufacturing, other industries or any business, such checks
      are provided under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_31">Companies Act</a>, as
      indicated earlier. There also, the main consideration is that the
      company itself may not sink because of its own mismanagement
      or the interest of the shareholders or people generally may not
      be jeopardized for that reason. Besides taking care of such
      interest as indicated above, there is no other interest of the
      State, to control the affairs and management of the private




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">LPA 401/2017                                                        Page 15 of 25</span>

      that their production, which is important for the economy, may
      not go down, yet the business activity is carried on by such
      companies or corporations which only remains a private
      activity of the entrepreneurs/companies.

      to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.
      But in certain circumstances a writ may issue to such private
      bodies or persons as there may be statutes which need to be
      complied with by all concerned including the private
      companies. For example, there are certain legislations like the
      <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_34">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_35">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_36">Factories
      Act</a> or for maintaining proper environment, say the Air
      (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_37">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or the Water
      (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_38">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes
      of the like nature which fasten certain duties and
      responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies which they
      are bound to comply with. If they violate such a statutory
      provision a writ would certainly be issued for compliance with
      those provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispenses
      with the service of its employee in violation of the provisions
      contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_39">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable
      cases the High Court interfered and has issued the writ to the
      private bodies and the companies in that regard. But the
      difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where there may not be
      any non-compliance with or violation of any statutory provision
      by the private body. In that event a writ may not be issued at
      all. Other remedies, as may be available, may have to be
      resorted to.

       applied to the facts of the present case and see whether those
      tests apply to the appellant Bank or not. As indicated earlier,
      share capital of the appellant Bank is not held at all by the
      Government nor is any financial assistance provided by the
      State, nothing to say which may meet almost the entire
      expenditure of the company. The third factor is also not
      answered since the appellant Bank does not enjoy any
      monopoly status nor can it be said to be an institution having
      State protection. So far as control over the affairs of the
      appellant Bank is concerned, they are managed by the Board
      of Directors elected by its shareholders. No governmental
      agency or officer is connected with the affairs of the appellant
      Bank nor is any one of them a member of the Board of
      Directors. In the normal functioning of the private banking
      company there is no participation or interference of the State
      or its authorities. The statutes have been framed regulating the
      financial and commercial activities so that fiscal equilibrium
      may be kept maintained and not get disturbed by the
      malfunctioning of such companies or institutions involved in the
      business of banking. These are regulatory measures for the
      purpose of maintaining a healthy economic atmosphere in the
      country. Such regulatory measures are provided for other
      companies also as well as industries manufacturing goods of
      importance. Otherwise these are purely private commercial
      activities. It deserves to be noted that it hardly makes any
      difference that such supervisory vigilance is kept by Reserve
      Bank of India under a statute or the Central Government.
      Even if it was with the Central Government in place of
      Reserve Bank of India it would not have made any difference,
      therefore, the argument based on the decision of All India
      Bank Employees' Assn. [AIR 1962 SC 171 : (1962) 3 SCR
      269] does not advance the case of the respondent. It is only in
      case of malfunctioning of the company that occasion to exercise
      such powers arises to protect the interest of the depositors,
      shareholders or the company itself or to help the company to be
      out of the woods. In times of normal functioning such occasions
      do not arise except for routine inspections etc. with a view to
      see that things are moved smoothly in keeping with fiscal

       policies in general.

<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      29. There are a number of such companies carrying on the
      profession of banking. There is nothing which can be said to
      be close to the governmental functions. It is an old profession
      in one form or the other carried on by individuals or by a
      group of them. Losses incurred in the business are theirs as
      well as the profits. Any business or commercial activity, maybe
      banking, manufacturing units or related to any other kind of
      business generating resources, employment, production and
      resulting in circulation of money are no doubt, such which do
      have impact on the economy of the country in general. But
      such activities cannot be classified as one falling in the
      category of discharging duties or functions of a public nature.
      Thus the case does not fall in the fifth category of cases
      enumerated in the case of <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_42">Ajay Hasia [Ajay Hasia v. Khalid
      Mujib Sehravardi</a>, (1981) 1 SCC 722 : 1981 SCC (L&amp;S) 258] .
      Again we find that the activity which is carried on by the
      appellant is not one which may have been earlier carried on
      by the Government and transferred to the appellant company.
      For the sake of argument, even if it may be assumed that one

      SCC (L&amp;S) 258] may be attracted, that by itself would not be
      sufficient to hold that it is an agency of the State or a
      company carrying on the functions of public nature. In this
      connection, observations made in the case of Pradeep Kumar
      Biswas [(2002) 5 SCC 111 : 2002 SCC (L&amp;S) 633] quoted
      earlier would also be relevant." (emphasis supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_32">24.   As rightly observed by learned Single Judge, upon examination of
the shareholding pattern of the respondent company, it is clear that neither
the Central Government nor the State Government holds any shares therein.
The respondent company is not a creation of a Statute. It is a Public
Limited Company registered with the Reserve Bank of India. Its activities
are of purely commercial and private nature. It does not enjoy any State




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">LPA 401/2017                                                     Page 18 of 25</span>
 protection or monopoly. It does not discharge any public or statutory
function-enforcement whereof is sought in the present petition. Merely
because its activities may be regulated by the RBI-since it is engaged in the
business of money lending on commercial terms, it would not become
amenable to writ jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_33">25.   From the above quoted observations of the Supreme Court in
Federal Bank (supra), and on application of the principles laid down by the
Supreme Court therein, it is clear that the respondent does not qualify to be
labelled as an instrumentality of the State, or an authority, or 'any other
person' against whom a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
of India could be maintained, particularly in relation to a grievance
regarding its commercial dealings.
</p>
<p id="p_34">26.   Much emphasis have been laid by Mr. Malhotra on the fact that the
Board of Directors of M/s PTC India Ltd. has the presence of IRS and IAS
officers apart from nominee Directors of other Public Sector Companies
like the NTPC, PFC, NHPC, PGC and the LIC.
</p>
<p id="p_35">27.   By pointing out that the Board of Directors of the M/s PTC India
Ltd. has the officers of the aforesaid class, the appellant is merely pointing
out a fact. However, Mr. Malhotra has not pointed out the source of
authority under which the members with the aforesaid background have
been appointed on the Board of Directors of M/s PTC India Ltd. The
Board of Directors of a Company enjoys autonomy in its functioning,
particularly, when the company is running a commercial enterprise. In
fact, the Board of Directors are duty bound to act in the interest of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">LPA 401/2017                                                      Page 19 of 25</span>
 company. It is not pointed out by Mr. Malhotra that the mandate of either
PTC India Ltd. or the respondent company is to discharge an obligation
which could be described as a governmental or sovereign obligation.
Merely because one or two members/office bearers on the Board of
Directors of a company may be IRS or IAS officers, it is not sufficient to
infer deep and pervasive governmental control in the affairs of the
company. In the facts of the present case, the control of the government in
the respondent company appears to be even more distinct and remote. Only
person wearing the hat of the government is the Chairman, who is shown to
be 1984 batch IRS officer, namely, Mr. Deepak Amitabh. Pertinently, he is
also on the Board of Directors of M/s PTC India Ltd. Since M/s PTC India
Ltd. appears to be the majority stake holder in the respondent company, his
appointment as the Chairman of the respondent company is not out of the
ordinary. Apart from him, all other Directors on the Board of Directors of
the respondent company are free from any governmental control, since
none of them appear to be serving either under the Central or the State
Government. Out of the seven other Directors - apart from the Chairman,
three appear to be nominee of M/s PTC India Ltd., namely, Mr. Ajit
Kumar-Ex Technocrat, Mr. H.L.Bajaj-Ex Chairman of Central Electricity
Authority, Government of India and Mr. Arun Kumar. In any event, this
singular feature, by itself, is not sufficient to conclude that either PTC India
Ltd., or the respondent company is a State instrumentality. As observed in
Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra), the cumulative facts have to be
considered, and if - upon such consideration the body is found to be
dominated      financially,   functionally   and   administratively     by    the
government; and the control of the government is deep and pervasive, then



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">LPA 401/2017                                                          Page 20 of 25</span>
 alone the body would be considered to be an instrumentality of the State.
That is certainly not the case in hand.
</p>
<p id="p_36">28.   As rightly observed by learned Single Judge, in the normal
functioning of the respondent, there is nothing to suggest that the State or
its authorities have any role or participation.      Reliance placed by Mr.
Malhotra on the definition of the expression, 'control' as defined in <a href="/doc/1311488/" id="a_45">Section
2(27)</a> of the Companies Act, 2013, also appears to be of no avail. It was
essential for the appellant to show by reference to the Memorandum and
Articles of Association of the respondent company, the existence of the
right to appoint majority of the Directors, or to control the management or
policy decisions in the promoter company, namely, M/s PTC India Ltd vis
a vis the respondent company. It was also essential for the appellant to
show the existence of similar control in the government over M/s PTC
India Ltd. The appellant has neither established the existence of control by
the government over M/s PTC India Ltd., nor the existence of control by
M/s PTC India Ltd. over the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_37">29.   Reliance placed by Mr. Malhotra on Ajay Hasia and Ors. (supra) is
out of place. Neither is it established that the entire share capital of the
respondent is held by the government, nor is it established that the State
exercises deep and pervasive control over the affairs of the respondent.
There is nothing to show that the respondent is financially, functionally, or
administratively dominated by or under the control of the government,
much less to show that the said control is pervasive. At the highest, the
control is merely regulatory - by the RBI, on account of nature of the
business activities carried out by the respondent.

<p id="p_38"> 30.       Radhey Shyam Rai (supra) also has no application in the facts of the
present case. Unlike in the present case, in Radhey Shyam Rai (supra), the
Supreme Court found that the State exercised deep and pervasive control
over the affairs of the Sansthan. The Cane Commissioner was at the helm
of affairs of the Sansthan. The majority of the members of the government
council were holders of different government office. Unlike in the present
case, it was these government officers who were carrying out affairs of the
Sansthan. However, in the present case, there is nothing to show that the
power to appoint officers of the respondent company vests in the
government, or government appointed officers/directors who may be
serving in the government. There is nothing to show that the Central, or
the State Government has any power to issue any special directions to the
respondent, which the respondent is bound to obey at all times.
</p>
<p id="p_39">31.       Mysore Paper Mills Ltd. (supra) also is of no relevance since it was
in the facts and circumstances of that case, that the Supreme Court came to
the conclusion that day to day running of the business and administration of
the company was within the control of the government.
</p>
<p id="p_40">32.       Even otherwise, looking to the nature of the activities carried out by
the respondent company, a writ petition would not be maintainable in
respect of the business/ commercial activities undertaken by it. Even if the
submission of the appellant were to be accepted for the sake of argument
that the respondent is an instrumentality of the State, a writ petition under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_46">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India would not lie to enforce private law
rights.

      common law that involves relationships between individuals,
      such as law of contract or torts. Therefore, even if writ petition
      would be maintainable against an authority, which is "State"
      under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_47">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, before issuing any writ,
      particularly writ of mandamus, the Court has to satisfy that

imposed restraint exercised by the High Court while entertaining a petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_48">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India applies with greater rigour in
matters involving recovery of taxes, cess, fees, other types of public money
and the dues of banks and other financial institutions. The Supreme Court
observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">      "43. Unfortunately, the High Court overlooked the settled law
      that the High Court will ordinarily not entertain a petition
      under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_49">Article 226</a> of the Constitution if an effective remedy is
      available to the aggrieved person and that this rule applies
      with greater rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes,
      cess, fees, other types of public money and the dues of banks
      and other financial institutions. In our view, while dealing
      with the petitions involving challenge to the action taken for
      recovery of the public dues, etc. the High Court must keep in
      mind that the legislations enacted by Parliament and State
      Legislatures for recovery of such dues are a code unto
      themselves inasmuch as they not only contain comprehensive
      procedure for recovery of the dues but also envisage
      constitution of quasi-judicial bodies for redressal of the
      grievance of any aggrieved person. Therefore, in all such
      cases, the High Court must insist that before availing remedy
      under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_50">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, a person must exhaust

      supplied)

dispute arising from the contract between the parties. It is apparent that the
respondent has advanced substantial moneys to the appellant under a loan
agreement entered into between the parties. While the appellant claims that
the remainder of the loan was not disbursed unjustifiably-leading to the
appellant not being able to completely implement the hydro electric project,
the respondent claims that the appellant has not discharged its obligation
under the agreement. Such disputes cannot become the subject matter of
adjudication in writ proceedings, when there are disputed questions and
rival claims raised by the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_44">36.   There is also merit in the submission of Mr. Mehra that a writ
petition would not be maintainable also for the reason that the appellant
would have an alternate efficacious remedy available to it under <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_51">Section 17</a>
of the SARFAESI Act, as and when the respondent takes steps under
<a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_52">Section 13(4)</a> of the said Act. The learned Single Judge has taken note of
the fact that the respondent had issued a notice to the appellant on
02.09.2016 under <a href="/doc/122562177/" id="a_53">Section 13(2)</a> of the SARFAESI Act. The appellant had
responded to the said notice on 27.10.2016. The respondent had again put
appellant to notice that in case the appellant fails to pay the amount of Rs.
65,73,75,290/- calculated upto 15.08.2016 together with future interest
within 15 days, by 17.11.2016, the respondent shall have recourse to

 the invocation of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_56">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, is misdirected.
Since there was no stay of proceedings granted by the learned Single Judge,
and the writ petition was also eventually dismissed, the appellant is not
justified in claiming that the further development, if any - of the invocation
of <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_57">Section 13(4)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, would have no bearing for
determination of the issue of maintainability of the writ petition.
