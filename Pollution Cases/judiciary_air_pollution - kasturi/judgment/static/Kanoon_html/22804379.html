                 satisfied that no cause of action has, actually, arisen to the petitioner or any

                 Public Cause has arisen to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article

                 226</a> of the Constitution of India.         The direction of the Central Pollution

                 Control Board appears to have been issued in exercise of powers conferred

                 to the Board under <a href="/doc/5027662/" id="a_14">Section 18</a> of the Act to reduce the delays caused in

                 issuing the Environmental Clearance and CTE under the Pollution Control

                 Enactments and no Statutory provisions or procedural requirements have

                 been cut down by the Central Pollution Control Board, nor in our opinion, it

                 amounts to any amendment of law by Central Pollution Control Board.

                 Moreover, since no prejudice is said to have been caused to any public and

                 therefore, no case for invoking the PIL jurisdiction is made out.          The Court

                 cannot undertake the academic interpretation of the Statues unless a cause

                 of action is shown to have arisen when a public cause is espoused by any

                 individual or Society.
