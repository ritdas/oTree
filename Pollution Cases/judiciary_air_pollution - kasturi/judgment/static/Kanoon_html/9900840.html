Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1. The challenge in this petition is to system generated notices dated 19th
June 2015, 17th July 2015, 17th August 2015, 19th August 2015 and 7th
October 2015 issued to the Petitioner by Value Added Tax Officers
(VATOs) of the Department of Trade &amp; Taxes („DT&amp;T‟) of different
Wards under <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_1">Section 59</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_2">Delhi Value Added Tax Act</a>, 2004
(DVAT Act), uploaded on the DT&amp;T's website.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. During the pendency of this petition, 13 further system generated
notices, each dated 16th November 2015 issued to the Petitioner were also
uploaded on the website by the VATO of Ward-3.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3. The Court was informed during the hearing on 4th March 2016 by Mr.
Gautam Narayan, learned Additional Standing counsel appearing for the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) 10156/2015                                              Page 1 of 14</span>
 DT&amp;T, that on 24th September 2015, the Commissioner of VAT had
passed an order under <a href="/doc/1467808/" id="a_3">Section 67</a> (2), 68 and 106 of the DVAT Act read
with <a href="/doc/186159249/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 („<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_5">CST Act</a>‟) to the
effect that the Assistant Commissioner, Ward-206 who would exercise
jurisdiction as far as the Petitioner is concerned and that this had to be
read with the order dated 12th November 2013 issued by the
Commissioner (VAT) inter alia delegating the powers of assessment and
re-assessment under Section 32 of the DVAT Act to all officers not below
the rank of the Assistant VATO. The Court recorded in para 6 of its order
dated 4th March 2016 as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "6. Mr Narayan, ASC on instruction of Mr M. K. Aggarwal,
        Assistant Commissioner, states that all the notices issued to the
        Petitioner hereinbefore i.e. the notices which have been challenged
        in the present petition as well as the 13 notices dated 16th
        November 2015 referred to in civil miscellaneous application No.
        28227/2015 should be treated as withdrawn by the DT&amp;T. It is
        accordingly recorded. Mr Narayan states that Mr M. K. Aggarwal
        will now issue a fresh notice to the Petitioner under Section 59(2)
        of the DVAT Act."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">4. At that stage Mr. Rajesh Jain, learned counsel appearing for the
Petitioner, drew the attention of the Court to one of the grounds urged in
petition on which he desired the Court to give a ruling. The said ground
reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        "A. Because the impugned notices u/s 59(2) are required to be
        struck down for being issued in the absence of rules being
        framed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_6">Section 102(2)</a> (z) of the Act.
        <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_7">Section 102(2)(z)</a> empowers the Government to make rules
        laying down the conditions subject to which the Commissioner
        may require any dealer or any other person to produce before
        him such record, books of accounts, registers and other
        documents and answer such queries and furnish such additional
        information sought by the Commissioner. In the case of
        Sreenath Travel Agency &amp; Am. Vs. Lt. Governor of Delhi &amp;
        Ors. reported as AIR 2004 Delhi 1, impounding of the vehicle


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) 10156/2015                                              Page 2 of 14</span>
         done u/s 207 of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_8">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, 1988 was set aside by
        this Hon'ble Court because no rules had been framed under the
        Act laying down the manner in which the vehicles would be
        impounded. Reliance is also placed upon the judgment of the
        Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Garware Shipping
        Corporation Ltd. &amp; P.R. Sawant Vs. J.H. Joglekar, Addl,
        Collector of Customs reported as 1984 (15) ELT 375. There
        also, confiscation of the ship carrying smuggled goods was set
        aside when no rules were framed by the Government for
        precaution required to be taken U/S 115(2) of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_9">Customs Act</a>,
        1962 (Annexure P10). The word 'prescribed' has been defined
        U/S 2(y) of the Act which means prescribed by the rules made
        under the Act. Had the conditions been prescribed under the
        Rules, there would not have been much difficulty in avoiding
        the situation in which the matter stands landed up today."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">5. Mr. Jain pointed out that no rule had been framed under <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_10">Section 102</a>
(2) (z) of the DVAT Act in regard to the exercise of the power under
<a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_11">Section 59</a> (2) thereof. According to Mr. Jain, in the absence of such a
Rule, a „dealer‟ registered under the DVAT Act cannot be called upon by
the Commissioner or other officer mentioned in <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_12">Section 59</a> (2) of the
DVAT Act, to produce records, books of accounts etc.

</p><p id="p_6">6. At that stage, Mr. Narayan referred to the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/190743767/" id="a_13">The
Commissioner, VAT v. A.K. Woollen Industries</a> (order dated 19th
February 2015 in Sales Tax Appeal No. 65 of 2014) and submitted that
absence of such a rule will not preclude the exercise of the powers under
<a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_14">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act. The Court then adjourned the case to
enable learned counsel for the Respondent to examine the issue and for
the learned counsel for the Appellant to examine whether Rules of a
similar nature had been framed in the VAT statutes of other States.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7. Mr. Jain has since placed on record his written submissions enclosing
the details of the statutes in other States. Mr. Jain points out that in at


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) 10156/2015                                              Page 3 of 14</span>
 least 10 VAT statutes, there exists a similar provision enabling the
Commissioner to call for production of records subject to such conditions
"as may be prescribed". In these 10 States, Rules have been framed in
terms of the said provision. A tabulation of such <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_15">State Act</a>s and the
corresponding Rules in the said States are set out as under:

</pre><p id="p_9">9. Mr. Jain further points out that there were other provisions of the DVAT
Act, for e.g., <a href="/doc/450290/" id="a_20">Sections 5</a> (2), 6 (2), 8 (1), 9 (1) , 14 (2) , 59 (2), 68 (1) and 92
(1), which used the words „subject to such conditions as may be prescribed‟
and the DVAT Rules contains provisions in respect of each of the above
provisions of the DVAT Act. However, it is only in respect of <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_21">Sections 59</a>
(2) of the DVAT Act that no rules have been framed despite <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_22">Section 102</a> (2)
(z) of the DVAT Act providing for it. Relying on the decision of the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/130581093/" id="a_23">Dr. Subramanian Swamy v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> (2014)
5 SCC 75, Mr. Jain submitted that in the absence of any rules being framed
thereunder, the power under <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_24">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act cannot be
exercised. He further relied on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1353825/" id="a_25">Goa Central Cooperative

under <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_27">Section 59</a> (2) had been exercised by the VATOs indiscriminately, as
an instrument of harassment. He illustratively referred to the following
instances:

</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">14. A plain reading of the above provision indicates that the Commissioner
can exercise the powers under <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_41">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act to call upon
the dealer or any other person to produce records, books of accounts etc. for
</p><p id="p_15">(i) the proper administration of the DVAT Act and (ii) subject to such
conditions "as may be prescribed." The expression „as may be prescribed‟
has to be interpreted as requiring Rules to be framed in the matter of
inspection of production of records. <a href="/doc/130581093/" id="a_42">In Dr. Subramanian Swamy v. State of
Tamil Nadu</a> (supra) the Supreme Court was interpreting Section 45 of the
Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and <a href="/doc/495092/" id="a_43">Charitable Endowments Act</a>, 1959
(„TNHRCE Act‟) which envisages the appointment of an Executive Officer
(„EO‟) by the Commissioner HRCE, subject to such conditions as may be
prescribed. In that context, the Supreme Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">        "60. Section 2(16) CPC defines the term "prescribed" as
        prescribed by the rules. Further, Section 2(18) CPC defines

         rules as rules and forms as contained in the First Schedule or
        made under <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_44">Section 122</a> or Section 125 CPC. Sections 122 and
        125 CPC provide for power of the High Court to make rules
        with respect to its own functioning and procedure. Therefore, it
        appears that when the legislature uses the term "prescribed", it
        only refers to a power that has simultaneously been provided
        for or is deemed to have been provided and not otherwise.
        Similarly, <a href="/doc/334666/" id="a_45">Section 2(n)</a> of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986
        defines "prescribed" as "prescribed by rules made by the State
        Government or as the case may be, by the Central Government
        under the Act".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">        61. <a href="/doc/1327353/" id="a_46">Section 45</a> of the 1959 Act provides for appointment of an
        Executive Officer, subject to such conditions as may be
        prescribed. The term      "prescribed" has not been defined
        under the Act. Prescribed means prescribed by rules. If the
        word "prescribed" has not been defined specifically, the same
        would mean to be prescribed in accordance with law and not
        otherwise. Therefore, a particular power can be exercised only
        if a specific enacting law or statutory rules have been framed
        for that purpose. (<a href="/doc/5192/" id="a_47">See Manohar Lal Chopra v. Seth Hiralal</a>

<p id="p_16">15.1 <a href="/doc/1353825/" id="a_50">In Goa Central Cooperative Consumers v. Bhagwant Narayan
Tendulkar</a> (supra), the Supreme Court interpreted Section 45 of the

        rule has been prescribed by which any restriction in respect of such
        transaction has been imposed. Therefore, <a href="/doc/1327353/" id="a_52">Section 45</a> is also not
        attracted."

<p id="p_18"> 16.1 The third decision relied upon by Mr. Jain is Telecom Employees
Cooperative Housing Society Limited (supra) where the Karnataka High
Court was interpreting Section 38 of the Bangalore Development
Authority Act, 1976 which stated that "subject to such restrictions,
conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, the Authority shall have
power to lease, sell or otherwise transfer any movable or immovable
property which belongs to it, and to appropriate or apply any land vested
in or acquired by it for the formation of open spaces or for building
purposes or in any other manner for the purpose of any development
scheme."
</p>

<p id="p_19">16.2 In that context, the Karnataka High Court observed that the power
under <a href="/doc/1208898/" id="a_53">Section 38</a> is unavailable "unless those restrictions, conditions and
limitations are prescribed" and concluded that "when power is made
available, conditional upon prescription, the phrase „subject to‟ in the
context meaning only conditional upon, the exercise of power in the
absence of such prescription is illegal."
</p>

<p id="p_20">17. There is a clear distinction between the wording of the provisions
considered in the above decisions, and <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_54">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act.
It is not as if there are no guidelines in <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_55">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act to
indicate under what circumstances the Commissioner may require
production of books of accounts, records etc. Apart from the fact that the
Commissioner has to exercise the power for 'the proper administration' of
the DVAT Act, he has to make assure that what is being asked to be
produced, in the form of books of accounts and other documents, are
"related to the activities" of either the person to whom such notice is
issued or any other person as the Commissioner may deem necessary.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P.(C) 10156/2015                                               Page 10 of 14</span>
<p id="p_21"> The Commissioner has to decide what document should be asked to be
produced. It is another matter that there have been instances of misuse of
the powers. The Court has had to step in to correct such misuse. That by
itself, however, does not make the provision bad in law.
</p>
<p id="p_22">18. It also does not mean that in the absence of a Rule, the power under
<a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_56">Section 59</a> (2) is incapable of being exercised. It is in this context that the
language used in Section 45 of TNHRCE Act or Section 45 of the
Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 or Section 38 of the
Bangalore Development Authority Act, 1976 became relevant. In each of
the above instances, the language of the provision was such that the
exercise of the power was dependent on the framing of the Rules.
However, <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_57">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act is so worded that it can be
given effect to even in the absence of the rules.
</p>
<p id="p_23">19.1 In the above context, the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1161634/" id="a_58">Orissa
State (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution) Board v. Orient Paper Mills</a>
(supra) is relevant. The question that arose in the said decision was
whether in the absence of any Rules framed under <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_59">Section 19</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_60">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 („<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_61">Air Act</a>‟), the power in
terms of the said provision could be exercised. <a href="/doc/1994038/" id="a_62">Section 19</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_63">Air
Act</a> reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">        "19. Power to declare air pollution control areas - (1) The State
        Government may, after consultation with the State Board, by
        notification in the Official Gazette, declare (in such manner as may
        be prescribed), any area or areas within the State as air pollution
        control area or areas for the purposes of this Act."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">19.2 The Supreme Court first dealt with the expression „such manner as
may be prescribed" and distinguished the said expression from the
expressions „in the manner prescribed‟ or „in the prescribed manner‟ used


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P.(C) 10156/2015                                                Page 11 of 14</span>
 in certain other statues. It is then observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">        "In one of the cases decided by this Court, to be referred later in
        this judgment "as may be prescribed" has been held to mean "if
        any". It is thus clear that such expression leaves the scope for some
        play for the workability of the provision under the law. The
        meaning of the word "as" takes colour in context with which it is
        used and the manner of its use as prefix or suffix etc. There is no
        rigidity about it and it may have the meaning of a situation of being
        in existence during a particular time or contingent, and so on and
        so forth. This is to say, something to happen in a manner, if such a
        manner is in being or exists, if it does not, it may not happen in that
        manner. Therefore, the reading of the provision under
        consideration makes it clear that manner of declaration is to be
        followed "as may be prescribed" i.e., "if any" prescribed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">        13. Thus, in case manner is not prescribed under the rules, there is
        no obligation or requirement to follow any, except whatever the
        provision itself provides viz., <a href="/doc/1994038/" id="a_64">Section 19</a> in the instant case which
        is also incomplete in itself even without any manner being
        prescribed as indicated shortly before to read the provision
        omitting this part "in such manner as may be prescribed". Merely
        by absence of rules, the State would not be divested of its powers
        to notify in the Official Gazette any area declaring it to be an air
        pollution control area. In case, however, the rules have been
        framed prescribing the manner, undoubtedly, the declaration must
        be in accordance with such rules."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">19.3 The Supreme Court reiterated in para 15 that
        "the power which vests in an authority would not cease to exist
        simply for the reason that the rules have not been framed or the
        manner of exercise of the power has not been prescribed. So far as
        <a href="/doc/55733/" id="a_65">Section 54</a> of the Act is concerned, it only enumerates the subjects
        on which the State Government is entitled to frame rules."
</p>
<p id="p_26">19.4 The Court in that process referred to the decision of the Constitution
Bench in <a href="/doc/328740/" id="a_66">T. Cajee v. U. Jormanik Siem</a> AIR 1961 SC 276 as well as
decision in <a href="/doc/1030864/" id="a_67">Surinder Singh v. Central Government</a> (1986) 4 SCC 667. In
the latter decision, the Supreme Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">        "Where a statute confers powers on an authority to do certain acts


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P.(C) 10156/2015                                                  Page 12 of 14</span>
         or exercise power in respect of certain matters, subject to rules, the
        exercise of power conferred by the statute does not depend on the
        existence of rules under the statute expressly provides for the same.
        In other words framing of the rules is not condition precedent to
        the exercise of the power expressly and unconditionally conferred
        by the statute. The expression „subject to the rules‟ only means, in
        accordance with the rules, if any. If rules are framed, the powers so
        conferred on authority could be exercised in accordance with these
        rules. But if no rules are framed there is no valid and the authority
        is not precluded from exercising the power conferred by the statute.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">20. Therefore, in the present case the Court is unable to accept the
submission of Mr. Jain that in the absence of any rules being framed
under <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_68">Section 102</a> (2) (z) read with <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_69">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act, the
power of the Commissioner under <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_70">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act to call
upon a person to produce the books of accounts and other documents
cannot be exercised.
</p>
<p id="p_28">21. In that view of the matter, the Court concurs with the view expressed
by the co-ordinate Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/190743767/" id="a_71">The Commissioner, VAT v.
A.K. Woollen Industries</a> (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_29">22. Mr. Jain earnestly pleaded that a direction should be issued to the
Respondent to frame rules in exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_72">Section 102</a> (2)
(z) of the DVAT Act.
</p>

<p id="p_30">23. There are a few limitations on the scope of the powers of this Court
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_73">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. One such limitation is the inability
to issue a mandamus to the Respondent/Executive to frame a rule in
respect of any particular topic or issue and in a specific manner. That is
the prerogative of the Executive.
</p>
<p id="p_31">24. However, that does not preclude the Petitioner, along with other

 dealers, to make a representation to the Government of NCT of Delhi and
in particular to the DT&amp;T that Rules in terms of <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_74">Section 102</a> (2) (z) read
with <a href="/doc/626522/" id="a_75">Section 59</a> (2) of the DVAT Act should be framed. They can draw
the attention of the GNCTD to the provisions in the ten other states which
have VAT statutes. If such representation is made, the Court has no doubt
that it will receive adequate and serious consideration in the hands of
GNCTD and specifically, the DT&amp;T, particularly since such a rule will
serve the salutary purpose of guiding the officers in the exercise of their
powers and serve to also act as a check on the possible abuse of powers.
