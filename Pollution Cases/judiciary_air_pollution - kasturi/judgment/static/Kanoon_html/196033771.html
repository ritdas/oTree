ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">1.         The present revision petition is directed against order
dated 03.03.2007, passed by Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate, Rohini,
Delhi.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.         The backdrop of the present revision petition is that
respondent No.2 herein namely Smt. Kamlesh Garg filed a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -: 2 :-</span>

complaint under Section 138 read with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_1">Section 141</a> of the
Negotiable Instruments Act against the petitioners. The case of the
respondent No.2 is that petitioner No.2 is the Director of petitioner
No.1 and he approached the complainant and requested for a loan
of Rs 2 lacs, she gave a loan of Rs. 2 lacs by way of cheque
No.59223 drawn on Punjab National Bank, Arya Samaj Road, Rani
Bagh, Delhi. In discharge of its liability to repay the loan amount,
petitioner No.2 who is responsible for day to day work of the
petitioner No.1 company issued two post dated cheques for Rs.
One lac each to the complainant and on presentation, both the
cheques were dishonoured by the banker of petitioner No.1 with the
remarks "account closed".       The respondent No.2 herein issued
notice dated 08.03.2006 and called upon the petitioners to pay the
amount of cheque within 15 days of the receipt of notice, said notice
was served on the petitioner No.2 but he failed to repay the amount
of the cheques.       Thereafter, respondent No.2 filed a complaint.
After   recording     pre-summoning        evidence,   petitioners    were
summoned vide order dated 22.04.2006. After hearing arguments
on notice, notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_2">Section 251</a> Cr.P.C. was given to the
petitioners, vide impugned order dated 03.03.2007.
</p><p id="p_3">3.        Feeling aggrieved by the said order dated 03.03.2007 the
petitioners have preferred the present revision petition.            I have
heard Shri Vinod Kumar Adv for the petitioners and Shri S.K. Attri
Adv for respondent No.1.        I have also carefully gone through
material on record.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   -: 3 :-</span>

<p id="p_4">4.         Ld counsel for the petitioners submitted that petitioner
No.1 is a Private Limited Company and there are four other
directors besides petitioner No.2 Shri J.P. Aggarwal. The cheques
were issued by petitioner No.1 company, petitioner No.2 never
issued the cheques in his individual capacity and, therefore,
petitioner No.2 alone cannot be held responsible for dishonour of
the said cheques. The cheques are signed by two Directors and not
by petitioner No.2 alone.          He also contented that as per
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the petitioner No.1
company, all the Directors are equally and jointly liable for its liability


</p><p id="p_5">5.         According to Ld counsel for the petitioners all the
Directors of the petitioner No.1 Company should have been made
as a party.    In support of his submissions he had relied upon
Judgments in case titled as Smt. Davinder Kaur &amp; Anr Vs. Small
Scale Industries Development Bank of India reported as 1998 (3)
Crimes 548, U.P. Pollution Control Board Vs. M/s. Modi Distillery &amp;
Ors reported as AIR 1988 Supreme Court 128, Indira &amp; Ors Vs.
Karthikeyan &amp; Ors reported as II (1995) BC 208 and case titled as
Steel Authority of India Ltd Vs. Harbhajan Singh reported as 1999
(4) RCR (Criminal) 4.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.         Ld counsel for the respondent No.2 urged that respondent
No.2 / complainant has averred in the complaint that petitioner No.2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 -: 4 :-</span>

who is Director of petitioner No.1 approached the complainant and
requested for loan of Rs. 2 lacs, the complainant gave loan to him,
two cheques were issued by petitioner No.1 company through
petitioner No.2. He also pointed out that all the Directors of the
Company are not responsible. The complainant has mentioned in
para No.4 of the complainant that petitioner No.2 is responsible for
day to day affairs of petitioner No.1 company.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.        I have carefully considered the submissions made by Ld
counsel for both the parties. I have also carefully gone through the
Judgments cited by Ld counsel for the petitioners. In my view the
Judgments cited by Ld counsel for the petitioners are of no help to
the petitioners.   In Smt.Davinder Kaur's case (Supra), complaint
under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a>/<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_4">141</a> of the Act was filed, two Directors of the
Company filed a petition for quashing of proceedings on the ground
that they had ceased to directors of company by the date of
issuance of cheques.       It was held that there were specific
allegations in the complaint that the petitioners were assisting
Managing Director in running the business of company, they were
equally responsible in approaching the complainant for extending
facility of direct discounting of bills to the company and the petition
was dismissed. The case of U.P. Pollution Control Board (supra)
was under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>.           In
Indira's case (supra) petition for quashing of complaint under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                -: 5 :-</span>

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Section 138</a>/<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">141</a> of the Act was filed. It was held that as per <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Section
141</a> of the Act if a person committing an offence under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Section 138</a>
is a company, every person who, at the time the offence was
committed, was incharge of, and was responsible to, the company
for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the
company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence. In Steel
Authority of India's case (supra), there was allegation in the
complaint that Chairman cum Managing Director, Executive
Director, Deputy General Manager, Purchase Officer were incharge
of and responsible for conduct of Company's business. It was held
that there was sufficient material to proceed against the said
accused persons.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8.        <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_10">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act reads as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "141 Offences by companies - (1) If the
          person committing an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">Section 138</a>
          is a company, every person who, at the time the
          offence was committed, was in charge of, and
          was responsible to the company for the conduct
          of the business of the company, as well as the
          company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the
          offence and shall be liable to be proceeded
          against and punished accordingly.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                    Provided that nothing contained in this
          sub-section shall render any person liable to
          punishment if he proves that the offence was
          committed without his knowledge, or that he had
          exercised all due diligence to prevent the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  -: 6 :-</span>

             commission of such offence."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">9.           From bare reading of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_12">Section 141</a> of the Act, it is
manifestly clear that if any offence is committed by a company,
every person who, at the time offence was committed, was incharge
of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the
business of the company, as well as the company, shall be
responsible. Proviso to <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_13">Section 141</a> of the Act shows that every
person who is a Director or employee of the company is not liable
and only such person would be held responsible who was incharge
and responsible to the company when the offence is committed. In
this regarding reliance can be placed on a Judgment of Apex Court
in case titled as N.K. Wahi Vs. Shekar Singh &amp; Ors reported as
2007 (1) Bank CLR 540 (SC).
</p>

<p id="p_10">10.          In the instant case respondent No.2 has filed a complaint
under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_14">Section 138</a>/<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_15">141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act.          The
complainant has alleged that petitioner No.2 being Director of
petitioner    No.1   company    approached    the   complainant   and
requested for loan, the complainant gave loan to petitioner No.2,
cheque was issued by petitioner No.1 through petitioner No.2 and
petitioner No.2 is responsible for day to day work of the company.
Petitioner No.2 is signatory to both the cheques. In my considered
opinion other Directors cannot be impleaded as party at the
instance of petitioners, who are accused.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                -: 7 :-</span>

<p id="p_11">11.       For the foregoing reasons, revision petition fails, same
deserves to be dismissed and same is hereby dismissed. Trial
Court record alongwith copy of this order be sent back. File of
revision petition be consigned to record room.
