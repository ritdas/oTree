                   Vaikunda Ekathesi and vedic chanting are being arranged without the loud

                   The usage of loud speakers and other sound menance affects them and it

                   will cause hardship to them. Due to festival season various religions are

                   extensively operating sound amplifiers horn even at 3 A.M, due to which

                   people are unable to have peaceful time during morning and evening. The

                   use of loud speakers at places of worship, public meetings, road side are

                   causing serious hardship to public.

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                      “ 2. The questions involved in this appeal are
                               that in a country having multiple religions and
                               numerous      communities       or    sects,   whether    a
                               particular community or sect of that community can
                               claim right to add to noise pollution on the ground
                               of religion. Whether beating of drums or reciting of
                               prayers by use of microphones and loudspeakers so
                               as to disturb the peace or tranquillity of the
                               neighbourhood should be permitted. Undisputedly,
                               no religion prescribes that prayers should be
                               performed by disturbing the peace of others nor
                               does it preach that they should be through voice
                               amplifiers or beating of drums. In our view, in a
                               civilized society in the name of religion, activities
                               which disturb old or infirm persons, students or
                               children having their sleep in the early hours or
                               during daytime or other persons carrying on other
                               activities cannot be permitted. It should not be
                               forgotten that young babies in the neighbourhood
                               are also entitled to enjoy their natural right of
                               sleeping in a peaceful atmosphere. A student
                               preparing   for     his   examination     is   entitled   to
                               concentrate on his studies without their being any
                               unnecessary       disturbance    by     the    neighbours.

                          Similarly, the old and the infirm are entitled to
                          enjoy reasonable quietness during their leisure
                          hours without there being any nuisance of noise
                          pollution. Aged, sick, people afflicted with psychic
                          disturbances as well as children up to 6 years of age
                          are considered to be very sensible (sic sensitive) to
                          noise.    Their    rights    are    also required     to   be
                          honoured.
</p><p id="p_8">                                   3. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Under the Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
                          1986, rules for noise-pollution level are framed
                          which prescribe permissible limits of noise in
                          residential, commercial, industrial areas or silence
                          zone. The question is — whether the appellant can
                          be permitted to violate the said provisions and add
                          to the noise pollution. In our view, to claim such a
                          right itself would be unjustifiable. In these days,
                          the problem of noise pollution has become more
                          serious     with       the   increasing     trend    towards
                          industrialisation, urbanization and modernisation
                          and is having many evil effects including danger to
                          health. It may cause interruption of sleep, affect
                          communication, loss of efficiency, hearing loss or
                          deafness,       high     blood      pressure,    depression,
                          irritability,     fatigue,    gastrointestinal      problems,
                          allergy, distraction, mental stress and annoyance
                          etc. This also affects animals alike. The extent of
                          damage      depends      upon      the   duration   and    the
                          intensity of noise. Sometimes it leads to serious law

                          appearing on behalf of the appellant contended
                          that the High Court has failed to note that the two
                          survey reports of the Pollution Control Board clearly
                          attributed the noise pollution in the area in
                          question to the vehicular traffic and not to any of
                          the   activities   of   the   appellant   Church   and,
                          therefore, direction issued in respect of controlling
                          the noise ought not to have been extended in

                           would not be a ground for permitting others to

                           though the Rules are unambiguous, there is lack of

                           rampant and yet for one reason or the other, the

                                 “8. … The power to grant exemption is conferred on
                           the State Government. It cannot be further delegated. The
                           power shall be exercised by reference to the State as a
                           unit and not by reference to districts, so as to specify
                           different dates for different districts. It can be reasonably
                           expected that the State Government would exercise the

                           exemption cannot be widened either by increasing the
                           number of days or by increasing the duration beyond two
                           hours. If that is attempted to be done, then the said sub-

                           to be struck down as violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the

                           exemption will be operative. Such specification would
                           exclude arbitrariness in the exercise of power. The

                           one is immune to this stress. Though we seem to adjust
                           to noise by ignoring it, the ear, in fact, never closes and
                           the body still responds — sometimes with extreme
                           tension, as to a strange sound in the night.

                           human health. Effects of noise depend upon the sound's
                           pitch, its frequency and time pattern and length of
                           exposure. Noise has both auditory and non-auditory
                           effects depending upon the intensity and the duration
                           of the noise level. [ P.S. Jaswal and Nistha Jaswal —

                           either     temporary    or   permanent.    Noise-induced
                           temporary threshold shift (NITTS) is a temporary loss of
                           hearing acuity experienced after a relatively short

                           problems are being experienced in other countries as
                           well. In fact in the United Kingdom, in Nottingham the

</p><p id="p_143">                                    93. It is not that the legislature and the executive
                           in India are completely unmindful of the menace of
                           noise pollution. Laws have been enacted and rules have
                           been framed by the Executive for carrying only the
                           purposes of the legislation. The real issue is with the
                           implementation of the laws. What is needed is the will
                           to implement the laws. It would be useful to have a
                           brief resume of some of the laws which are already
                           available on the statute-book. Treatment of the
                           problem of noise pollution can be dealt with under the
                           law of crimes and civil law. Civil law can be divided
                           under two heads (i) the law of torts (ii) the general civil
                           law. Cases regarding noise have not come before the
                           law courts in large quantity. The reason behind this is
                           that many people in India did not consider noise as a
                           sort of pollution and they are not very much conscious
                           about the evil consequences of noise pollution. The

                           It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced
                           to listen. The right comprehends freedom to be free
                           from what one desires to be free from. Free speech is
                           not to be treated as a promise to everyone with
                           opinions and beliefs, to gather at any place and at any
                           time and express their views in any manner. The right is
                           subordinate to peace and order. A person can decline to
                           read a publication, or switch off a radio or a television
                           set. But, he cannot prevent the sound from a
                           loudspeaker reaching him. He could be forced to hear
                           what, he wishes not, to hear. That will be an invasion of
                           his right to be let alone, to hear what he wants to hear,
                           or not to hear, what he does not wish to hear. One may
                           put his mind or hearing to his own uses, but not that of
                           another. No one has a right to trespass on the mind or
                           ear   of   another     and   commit   auricular   or   visual
                           aggression. A loudspeaker is a mechanical device, and it
                           has no mind or thought process in it. Recognition of the
                           right of speech or expression is recognition accorded to
                           a human faculty. A right belongs to human personality,
                           and not to a mechanical device. One may put his
                           faculties to reasonable uses. But, he cannot put his
                           machines to any use he likes. He cannot use his
                           machines to injure others. Intervention with a machine,

                           control methodology in India
</p><p id="p_198">                           123. India has passed through the stage of being
                           characterised as a developing country and is ready to
                           enter and stand in the line of developed countries. Yet,
                           the issue of noise pollution in India has not been taken
                           so far with that seriousness as it ought to have been.
                           Firstly, as we have stated earlier, there is a lack of will
                           on the part of the Executive to implement the laws.
                           This has contributed to lack of infrastructure essential
                           for attaining the enforcement of laws. Secondly, there
                           is lack of requisite awareness on the part of the
                           citizens. The deleterious effects of noise pollution are
                           not well known to the people and are not immediately
                           perceptible. People generally accept noise pollution as
                           a part of life, a necessary consequence of progress and
                           prosperity.
</p><p id="p_199">                                 124. The problems that are being faced in
                           controlling noise pollution are:

                           problems and issues related to noise pollution. This
                           impression of ours stands reaffirmed on a comparative
                           reading of legislation in India with these in other

                           the laws are not yet fully identified. Those which have
                           been designated, do not seem to be specialised in the
                           task of regulating noise pollution. There is a dearth of
                           necessary   personnel    technically   qualified   to   act
                           effectively. What is needed is a combination of
                           technically qualified and administratively competent
                           personnel with the requisite desire and dedication for
                           implementation of the laws.
</p><p id="p_202">                                 3. There is lack of proper gadgets and equipments
                           and other infrastructure such as labs for measuring the
                           noise levels. Due to the shortage of the instruments
                           needed for the purpose of measuring sound, the
                           policemen who are on the job usually end up measuring
                           sound with their ears itself and not with the use of
                           technical instruments.

                           to be found. What should be the maximum permissible
                           sound level for firecrackers? What should be the method
                           of checking whether a particular firecracker shall emit
                           sound which shall be within permissible limits? Which
                           authority shall be conferred with the responsibility for
                           ensuring the effective implementation of these noise
                           levels? What should be the time-limit during which the

                           are exempted from the Indian noise standards?
                           What is the maximum sound level that should be

</p><p id="p_240">                                 140. Briefly stated, it is pointed out that if the
                           firecrackers are allowed to be manufactured in the
                           manner in which they are being done now and the noise
                           level is left to be measured at the time of bursting of
                           firecrackers, several difficulties in implementation
                           would arise, frustrating the regulation. Very expensive
                           instruments and gadgets are necessary to measure the
                           sound level of firecrackers. A sound level meter with
                           required capabilities may cost around Rs 3 lakhs or
                           upwards. Factors like wind velocity, temperature and
                           humidity have a bearing on the measurement of noise
                           level. The gadgets for monitoring these factors shall
                           also be required to be installed at the testing field.
                           Technically trained persons would be required to be
                           posted at every point of measuring. Testing the sound
                           level of firecrackers at the point of bursting would
                           mean that the firecrackers have already reached the
                           market. The persons to be hauled up would be unwary
                           retailers or users and it would be difficult to fix the
                           responsibility on the manufacturers or distributors.

                           Difficulties of proof in a court of law would also arise.
                           The noise level in a firecracker is not stable. The same
                           firecracker may have a different noise level at the time
                           of manufacturing and at the time of use on account of
                           climatic changes which would naturally occur by the
                           lapse of time and change of place. If the noise level was
                           to be tested at the factory, the firecracker would have
                           already been manufactured. There would also be other
                           difficulties inasmuch as the clearance for marketability
                           would depend on the firecrackers satisfying the test
                           carried out and at that point of time the firecrackers
                           have already been manufactured and shall have to be
                           only destroyed if unsuccessful in the test. That apart,
                           the manufacturers are spread throughout the country.
                           Some of them are small-scale industries. Either many a
                           testing station shall have to be established or else the
                           manufacturers would be required to go to centralised
                           testing stations carrying untested firecrackers. Both
                           seem to be difficult situations.

                           composition of chemicals to be used in manufacturing
                           firecrackers would mean experiments or analytical tests
                           being carried out at any one station followed by
                           publication   of   results   and   laid   down   standards.
                           Experimental checks would be enough to satisfy the
                           authorities, if the manufacturers were following the
                           laid down standards as to the size of firecrackers,
                           weight and percentile composition of chemicals used.

                           This system would enable identification of illegal
                           firecrackers with comparatively more ease. Size and
                           mass of charge are two basic factors that determine the
                           noise level of a firecracker. By restricting these two
                           prime    factors,   noise    standard   is    achieved   more
                           effectively.   Though       other   factors    like   climatic
                           conditions may affect the noise level to some extent,
                           but this system seems to us to be more dependable and
                           logical, at least on the materials made available before
                           us.
</p><p id="p_244">                                   142. On a comparison of the two systems i.e. the
                           present system of evaluating firecrackers on the basis of
                           noise levels, and the other where the firecrackers shall
                           be    evaluated     on   the   basis    of    their   chemical
                           composition, we feel that a change in the method of
                           evaluating the firecrackers shall surely be more
                           beneficial. It shall reduce the expenditure that shall
                           otherwise have to be incurred on expensive instruments
                           that are necessary for the purpose of measuring sound.
                           The firecrackers shall easily be identifiable on the basis
                           of their mass of charge, and the weight of the chemicals
                           contained in the firecrackers can also be easily
                           measured. There shall not be too much need of the
                           personnel technically qualified for measuring sound, as
                           what would then be needed, would be to simply weigh
                           the chemical constituents. It shall to a great extent also
                           be successful in putting an end to illegal fireworks,
                           which come in bigger sizes, as they now shall be more

                           rules relating to firecrackers shall be easier and carried

                           are of the opinion that a method as proposed by the

                           permissible    limit,   should    be   adopted.     Every
                           manufacturer should mention details of its chemical
                           contents on the box of each firecracker as well. In case

                           restriction on bursting of firecrackers in the night
                           should be removed during the Diwali festival. Similar
                           relaxation was demanded for other festivals. These
                           applications highlighted practices prevalent in some of
                           the western countries wherein such relaxation is
                           allowed. We do not think that we will be justified in
                           granting   any      such   relaxation.    Indian    society   is
                           pluralistic. People of this great country belong to
                           different castes and communities, have belief in
                           different religions and customs and celebrate different
                           festivals. We are tolerant of each other. There is unity
                           in diversity. If relaxation is allowed to one there will be
                           no justification for not permitting relaxation to others

                           population is very thin. Roads are maintained in a
                           perfect order. Traffic noise is insignificant. The use of
                           horn by vehicles is a thing which is prohibited there
                           unless in case of emergency. People are disciplined.
                           Traffic moves in a disciplined manner. No horns are
                           there. The Ambient Noise Level in those countries are
                           not on a par with the noise level in the City of Calcutta
                           and/or in different parts of State of West Bengal.
                           Accordingly, whatever may be decided by the European
                           countries or America, cannot have any direct bearing on
                           the fixation of the sound level in the State of West
                           Bengal. In other civilised countries, cars move without
                           making any noise or sound. Condition of the roads is
                           such that it cannot create any noise beyond tolerance.
                           People in those countries are not in the habit of
                           creating unnecessary sounds but in our country because
                           of the gift of the technology sound has become a source
                           of pleasure for few people including some young people.
                           Use of unnecessary horn in the vehicles has become a
                           part and parcel of Indian culture.”

                           an insignificant percentage of the population indulges in
                           bursting crackers. Very few families, mainly Indian, in
                           these countries celebrate the festival of Diwali and
                           burst crackers. Thus the noise pollution produced by
                           this small use of firecrackers is not a cause of worry in
                           these countries.
</p><p id="p_258">                                 153. The situation in India is almost the opposite.
                           The streets are congested and the density of population
                           per square kilometre is one of the highest in the world.
                           Firecrackers are burst in almost all houses, thus leading
                           to pollution in the form of noise and smoke — both on a
                           large scale, making it a cause of worry.
</p><p id="p_259">                                 154. It is a judicially noticeable fact that in
                           advanced countries there is a move for collective
                           celebration of festivals. For example, in the United
                           States, on May Day, a show of fireworks is arranged
                           outside the city. People assemble in large numbers to
                           witness such a show, which is officially arranged by the
                           State. Such example can be emulated in our country.
                           People belonging to that section of the society which
                           wishes to celebrate a festival or an occasion may be
                           encouraged to organise such event collectively and may
                           have a show of fireworks away from the residential
                           locality. Such a move would save the people from the
                           hazardous effects of noise pollution caused by fireworks
                           and at the same time bring people together and
                           contribute     in   developing   closeness,   unity   and

                           bursting firecrackers to amount to infringement of
                           religious rights under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_73">Article 25.</a> He says:

                           celebrating the festivals, amounts to infringement of
                           religious rights under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_74">Article 25</a> and the limitation
                           under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_75">Article 21</a> does not cause any health hazard.”

                           religious rights of any person as enshrined under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_76">Article
                           25</a> of the Constitution. The festival of Diwali is mainly
                           associated with pooja performed on the auspicious day
                           and not with firecrackers. In no religious textbook is it

</p><p id="p_274">                                 163. We are inclined to agree with the view of
                           the Department of Explosives. Firecrackers for the
                           purpose of export may be manufactured and bear higher
                           noise levels subject to the following conditions:
</p><p id="p_275">                                 (i) The manufacturer should be permitted to do
                           so only when he has an export order with him and not
                           otherwise; (ii) the noise levels for these firecrackers
                           should conform to the noise standards prescribed in the
                           country to which they are intended to be exported as
                           per the export order; (iii) these firecrackers should
                           have a different colour packing, from those intended to
                           be sold in India; (iv) the firecrackers should have a clear
                           print on them stating that they are not to be sold in
                           India. In case these firecrackers are found being sold in
                           the Indian territory, then the manufacturer and the
                           dealer selling these goods should be held liable.
                           XI. How to check/control noise pollution
</p><p id="p_276">                                 164. The need for checking noise pollution as
                           highlighted by the petitioners and several intervenors
                           deserves appreciation.
</p><p id="p_277">                                 165. Need for specific legislation to control and
                           prevent noise pollution still needs some emphasis.
                           Undoubtedly, some laws have been enacted. Yet,
                           compared with the legislation in developed countries

                           India is still lagging behind in enacting adequate and
                           scientific legislations. We need to have one simple but
                           specific and detailed legislation dealing with several
                           aspects referable to noise pollution and providing
                           measures of control therefor.
</p><p id="p_278">                                 166. There is an equal need of developing a
                           mechanism and infrastructure for enforcement of the
                           prevalent laws. Those who are entrusted with the task
                           of enforcing laws directed towards controlling noise
                           pollution, must be so trained as to acquire expertise in
                           the matter of fighting against noise pollution by taking
                           both preventive and deterrent measures. They need to
                           be equipped with the requisite equipment such as
                           audiometers as would help them in detecting the level
                           of noise pollution, more so when it crosses the
                           permissible limits and the source thereof.
</p><p id="p_279">                                 167. Above all, there is a need for creating
                           general awareness towards the hazardous effects of
                           noise pollution. Particularly in our country the people
                           generally lack consciousness of the ill-effects which
                           noise pollution creates and how society including they
                           themselves   stand   to   benefit   by   preventing   the

                           area should be educational institutions and more
                           particularly schools. Young children of impressionable
                           age should be motivated to desist from playing with
                           firecrackers, use of high sound-producing equipments

                           prevent it, if generated by others. Holding of special
                           talks and lectures can be organised in schools to
                           highlight the menace of noise pollution and the role of
                           children in preventing it. For these purposes the State
                           must play its role with the support and cooperation of
                           non-government organisations (NGOs), which can also be
