(Sri.R.G.Kolle, AGA for respondents 1 and 3

                            ****
      These Writ Petitions are filed under Articles 226 and
227 of Constitution of India praying to issue to writ of
certiorari quashing the closure notices all dated 30.8.2012
vide Annexure-A1 to A9 issued by respondent No.2.


       These Writ Petitions coming on for preliminary hearing
this day, Dr.Jawad Rahim, J., made the following:-


                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners are proprietary concerns engaged in

running stone crushing units under licenses issued by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              5</span>


competent authority arrayed in these writ petitions as

respondent no.3.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   It is not in dispute the petitioners are licensees and

the licenses are valid to run the stone crushing units.   In

this writ action they have sought a writ of certiorari to

quash the closure notices bearing    the following reference

numbers:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     a)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/438,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     b)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/405,

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     h)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/454 and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     i)   No.PCB/MIN/SC/CO/UIN/35/2012-13/440

all dated 30.8.2012 vide Annexures-A-1 to A-9 issued under

<a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Section 31(A)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution

Act</a>, 1981, by the 2nd respondent . They also seek issuance

of a writ of mandamus to direct the 3rd respondent

(competent authority under the Act) to consider their

applications filed on 2.11.2012, 22.11.2012, 10.12.2012

and 18.12.2012 vide Annexures-C-1 to C-9 to permit them
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                6</span>


to operate their crushing units pending consideration of the

applications, and consequential reliefs.


</blockquote><p id="p_4">3.    These   writ petitions   and several other      petitions

seeking similar relief are listed for consideration and we

have heard learned counsel, Sri Chandrashekar P.Patil for

the petitioner, Sri R.G.Kolle, AGA, who accepts notice on

behalf of respondents 1 and 3 and Sri Gururaj Joshi, learned

advocate who accepts notice for respondent no.2.


</p><p id="p_5">4.     The contextual facts manifesting from the averments

in the writ petitions and the submissions of the learned

counsel for the petitioners and respondents leaves no scope

for doubt that this writ action is similar to the writ action of

similarly placed owners of crushing units in which questions

raised in this writ petition were considered in detail in

W.P.41069/12 disposed of by the Division Bench of this

court on 21.11.2012 quashing the closure notice issued by

the   Karnataka    Pollution   Control     Board   arrayed   as

respondent no.2 in that writ petition and issuing a writ of

mandamus to permit the petitioner therein to continue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     7</span>


stone crushing activity till its application for re-locating the

unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent

authority,   i.e.   Deputy    Commissioner        (respondent   no.3

arrayed in that writ petition).
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.     We are satisfied the orders impugned in that writ

petition, grounds against it and the relief sought are the

same as in this writ action. Therefore, we cannot summon

ourselves to take a different view but to follow the decision

of the Division Bench in W.P.41069/12 dated 21.11.2012 in

which, while rendition of the judgment, all facts and

circumstances       have     been       taken   into   consideration.

However, to avoid any doubt, we need to extract the core of

the judgment which is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">            'In the present case, by Gazette
         Notification dated 14.8.2012 safer zones in
         Haveri had been duly notified to the public.</blockquote><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">         Section 3(3) of the Karnataka Regulation of
         Stone Crushers Act, 2011 (for short, 'the
         Act') permits a period of three months to
         existing stone crusher units to trans-locate
         themselves to safer zones. In this regard
         an application has to be filed with the
         Licensing Authority within a reasonable
         time.    Unfortunately, the Act does not
         prescribe this period. In the present case,
         the Petitioner applied to the Licensing
         Authority on 24.9.2012. It is not disputed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                        8</span>

that consequent upon the petitioner's
application, the Licensing Authority till date
has neither granted or refused the license
under the provisions of the said Act. Since
<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_4">Section 3(4)</a> of the Act prescribes an outer
limit of six months for shifting from the
date of grant, it could be inferred that the
application has to be made within three
months of the requisite Gazetting of the
safer zones.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2. In these circumstances, the petition is
allowed by directing the respondents to
permit the operation of the petitioner at
the present site upt 23.12.2012 or till such
time the application is considered and
disposed of, by the Licensing Authority.

</p><p id="p_11">3. Learned counsel for the Karnataka State
Pollution Control Board (for short 'the
Board) submits that the petitioner did not
apply for the consent of the Board on the
expiry of the previous consent on
30.6.2012. In normal circumstances, the
contention would be well founded since no
one is permitted to operate without current
permission or consent.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4. In the circumstances of the present
case, however, a piquant situation has
arisen, inasmuch as the Pollution Control
Board cannot grant permission to the
petitioner to operate in its present site,
since it must statutorily relocate to a safer
zone as identified by the State. Needless
to add that if and when the petitioner is
granted a license to relocate to a safer
zone, conditions under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_5">Section 6(9)</a> of the
Act will have to e complied with as also the
permission would have to be obtained from
the Board.
</p><p id="p_13">5. With these observations, the petition is
allowed and Annexure-H dated 5.9.2012 is
quashed.'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                9</span>



</p><p id="p_14">6.     Under the circumstances, Annexures-A-1 to A-9, all

dated 30.8.2012 impugned in these writ petitions issued by

the 2nd respondent are quashed.        In terms of the order

extracted above, these petitions are also allowed directing

the respondents to permit operation of the stone crushing

units of the petitioners at the present site till such time their

applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing

authority, or for a period of four weeks from now, as

ordered in that writ petition.      Rule issued and made

absolute. In the circumstances, there shall be no order as

to costs.
