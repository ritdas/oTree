                       Brief statement of the reasons for the decision:


1.</pre><p id="p_1">                  That the Complainant i.e. Delhi Pollution Control Committee
      (for short 'DPCC') filed the present complaint u/s 24/25/26/33A read with

      1974 (hereinafter to be referred as 'Act') against the accused. Present
      complaint was filed through Sh. Pankaj Kapil, the then Assistant
      Enironmental Engineer in DPCC.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.                  As per the complaint on 18.02.2000, the industrial unit M/s.
</p><p id="p_3">      Siyaram Dyeing run by accused Shyam Sunder Saini was inspected by
      Vigilance Squad consisting of SDM (Environment) and engineers of DPCC.
      During inspection, the unit was in operation without ETP thereby
      discharging untreated effluent i.e., heavily coloured effluent observed in the
      drains and therefore, the unit closure directions were issued by the SDM. It
      is also alleged that the accused was operating its unit without obtaining
      requisite consent from DPCC. Hence, this complaint.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.                  On filing of the complaint, accused was summoned and
      thereafter the prosecution examined Sh. Pankaj Kapil, Sr. Environmental
      Engineer as CW1 in pre-charge evidence. Thereafter, a charge u/s 24 (1)
</p><p id="p_5">      (a) / 25 (1) (a) &amp; 26 of the Act, punishable u/s 43 &amp; 44 of the Act was

      Ex.CW1/A passed by Dr. Chandra Prakash, Incharge (Legal Cell). CW1
      reiterated the facts mentioned in the complaint and stated that an
      inspection of industrial unit of accused was carried out on 18.02.2000 and
      found that accused is discharging the effluent without any treatment. The
      accused was operating its unit without obtaining requisite consent from

<p id="p_8">6.          CW2 Sh. B.M.S. Reddy, the then SEE, DPCC, deposed that he
      alongwith SDM and DPCC Engineer, inspected the unit of the accused
      which was found engaged in the activity of cloth dyeing without mandatory
      consent under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Water Act</a> and without effluent treatment plant to treat the

</p>

<p id="p_9">7.             CW3 Sh.Y.V.V.J.Rajasekhar, Additional Secretary, Power of GNCTD,

</p><p id="p_15">12.         Ld. counsel for complainant argued that cases pertaining to
      discharge of industrial effluent in the river Yamuna are launched on the
      basis of series of directions passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case
      titled as "Yamuna Vs. Central Pollution Control Board &amp; Anr, M.C.
      Mehta Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors., M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India, U.P.
      Pollution Control Board Vs. M/s Mohan Meakins Ltd. &amp; Ors. He further
      argued that upon inspection, the industrial unit under the name and title of
      M/s Siyaram Dyeing being run by accused Shyam Sunder Saini was found
      discharging untreated effluent in drain and, thus the instant complaint was
      filed. He further argued that at the time of inspection, one Sarfuddin met at
      the spot and disclosed the name of accused Shyam Sunder Saini being
      owner and proprietor of the said industrial unit. During the course of
      arguments, Ld. counsel for the complainant submitted that as a matter of
      abundant precaution, the instant complaint has been lodged against the
      industrial unit i.e. M/s Siyaram Dyeing as well as accused no. 2 Shyam
      Sunder Saini though the industrial unit is a proprietorship concern having
      no legal entity, both accused are one and the same. He further argued that
      even the factum of proprietorship of the industrial unit has been admitted
      by accused no. 2 at several stages during the trial. As per order of this
      Court dated 15.7.11 it was recorded that accused is willing to pay Rs. 1 lac
      as fine.   Further in statement of accused recorded U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a>.,
      accused no. 2 Shyam Sunder Saini was shown as proprietor of industrial
      unit M/s Siyaram Dyeing. Even before Lok Adalat on 23.11.13 accused
      appeared for himself as well as for accused no. 1 which indicates that he
      was the proprietor of industrial unit. He further stressed that even in


DPCC Vs. M/s Siya Ram Dyeing CC No. 518337/16                 page no. 5 of 13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          6</span>

      affidavit dated 19.02.11 filed alongwith plea bargining application, he
      represented himself as proprietor of accused firm and now he cannot deny
      that he has no concern with the accused firm. Ld. counsel further
      contended that during entire trial, the same counsel has represented both
      the accused and common cross-examination has been conducted on
      behalf of the accused. Ld. counsel for the complainant also relied upon
      cross-examination of CW-1 wherein a suggestion was given that accused
      has not committed the offence deliberately or intentionally. He further
      submitted that even in defence evidence, accused Shyam Sunder Saini
      admitted that he was owner of the property wherein the industrial unit is
      being set up and thus it proves that he was running the accused unit. He
      further submitted that though in his defence accused claimed that he sold
      out the property in question to one Sh. Jaykant, however neither he
      provided the details of Jaykant nor examined him as defence witness and
      thus adverse inference should be drawn against him. He relied upon
      statement of accused U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.P.C</a>. and stated that accused has simply
      denied the charges and allegations and thus in the absence of any reason
      for non explanation of incriminating circumstances his denial cannot be
      considered.     In support of his contention he relied upon following
      judgments:-

            "In their examination under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> Cr.PC the accused
            denied the prosecution story in toto. They denied that the lorry
            accident had taken place. They also denied to have received
            any injuries. In short, in their <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Section 313</a> statement they
            completely denied the established facts and offered false

           answers. By now it is a well-established principle of law that in
           a case of circumstantial evidence where an accused offers
           false answer in his examination under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Section 313</a> against the
           established facts, that can be counted as providing a missing
           link for completing the chain."

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "The answers given by the accused under Section 313 of
          Cr. PC are not strictly 'evidence' as it is understood but sub-
          section (4) of the said Section, itself, inter alia, provides that
          the answers given by the accused may be taken into
          consideration. The same can be taken into consideration
          either in judging the innocence of the accused or his guilt.
          The purpose of putting the questions to the accused under
          Section 313 Cr. PC is to afford an opportunity to him to given
          explanations consistent with his innocence. This provision is
          mainly for the benefit of the accused though it helps the Court
          to find out the truth. It is well settled that this examinations
          consistent with his innocence. This provision is mainly for the
          benefit of the accused though it helps the Court to find out the
          truth.

          him of the incriminating circumstances appearing against him

          section 313 Cr. PC, in the present case, taken cumulatively

</p><p id="p_20">16.         He further argued that in the instance case there was no requirement
      of collection of samples as there was no ETP (Effluent Treatment Plan).
      He further contended that no public witness was joined during the
      inspection as the same is not mandatory and relied upon State of U.P.
      Vs. Anil Singh: AIR 1988 SC 1988. Lastly he submitted that in view of the
      site inspection report and the admission of the accused at several stages,
      it is proved that accused no. 2 was running the said industrial unit which
      was found to be discharging effluent without any treatment or ETP and
      thus committed offence U/s 24,25, 26 punishable U/s 44 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_21">17.         On the other hand, Ld. Defence counsel assailed the prosecution
      case on the ground that being the criminal case, the burden is upon the
      prosecution to establish its case against the accused and the same cannot
      be shifted upon the accused in any case. The best evidence in the
      instance case would be of Sarfuddin who disclosed the name of the
      accused to the complainant. However, he was neither examined as a
      defence witness nor made an accused though present at the spot, for the
      reasons best known to the prosecution. Thus his information regarding
      accused being the owner of the industrial unit M/s Siya Ram Dyeing
      cannot be read against accused being hearsay. He further contended that
      presence of SDM at the time of inspection is doubtful as he has not signed
      the inspection report Ex. PW-1/6 nor the samples were seized in the
      instant case.    He further contended that in the instance case the
      complainant had not complied with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1392032/" id="a_14">Section 23(2)</a> of Water
      Act as well as <a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_15">Section 100</a> of Cr.P.C. while conducting alleged inspection
      and thus the entire proceedings stands vitiated.

</p><p id="p_23">18.         Ld. defence counsel also argued that no reliance can be placed on
      the statement of accused recorded U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16">Cr.P.C</a>. without having
      substantial evidence to this effect nor the contents of the affidavit filed
      alongwith plea bargaining application can be considered as per the
      protection provided U/s 265 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_24">19.         Lastly he contended that even if it is presumed that inspection was
      carried out and the violation was noticed, still there is not even an iota of
      evidence connecting accused no. 2 Shyam Sunder Saini with the said
      industrial unit.
</p>

<p id="p_25">20.         Heard. Record perused. Considered.
</p>

<p id="p_26">21.         Admittedly, being the criminal proceedings, the onus lies upon the
      prosecution to stand on its own leg and they cannot derive any benefit
      whatsoever out of the lacuna's in the defence case.
</p>

<p id="p_27">22.          Further as the complainant admitted before the Court that accused
      no. 1 and 2 are one entity being proprietorship concern and its proprietor,
      the onus lies upon the prosecution to establish the identity of the accused.
      In the instance case though complainant alleged that M/s Siya Ram
      Dyeing is a proprietorship unit run by accused no. 2 Shyam Sunder Saini,
      however, apart from mere bald averments, no evidence to this effect has
      been led. Though in the inspection report Ex. PW-1/6 and order of sealing
      Ex. CW-1/9, the name of the accused Shyam Sunder Saini was recorded


DPCC Vs. M/s Siya Ram Dyeing CC No. 518337/16                 page no. 9 of 13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                         10</span>

      as owner, however, the source of said information has not been proved on
      record. As per their own case, the name of the accused was disclosed to
      them by one Sarfuddin who met at the site during investigation, but neither
      he was examined as a witness nor made an accused. Rather, on the
      contrary, during the evidence, CW-1 admitted before the Court that they
      have not established or verified the identity of Sarfuddin and did not collect
      any document of ownership. Thus information provided by him cannot be
      relied upon being hearsay. Apart from this, no evidence has been led by
      the prosecution to suggest that accused Shyam Sunder Saini has any
      concern with M/s Siyaram Dyeing. As far as suggestions given during
      cross examination are concerned, it has to be read in toto and not in
      piecemeal. Upon reading cross-examination of CW-1, it is observed that
      the said suggestion was given in series of suggestions wherein entire case
      of the prosecution has been denied .
</p>

<p id="p_28">23.         Further the authorities relied upon by Ld. counsel for the complainant
      in support of his contention that mere denial of incriminating evidence
      during statement of accused recorded U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">Cr.P.C</a>. can be read against
      him are distinguishable on facts as in those judgments, the accused
      denied the incriminating evidence established against him during the
      evidence, wherein in the instant case there is no such evidence at all to
      connect the accused with the said polluting industrial unit. Further in the
      instant case, there is no chain of circumstances connecting the accused
      with the offence in question. Law in this regard is well settled as held by
      Hon'ble Supreme Court in Raj Kumar Singh @ Raju @ Batya Vs. State
      of Rajasthan: (2013) 5 Supreme Court Cases 722:
</p>

<p id="p_29">DPCC Vs. M/s Siya Ram Dyeing CC No. 518337/16                 page no. 10 of 13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                        11</span>

               "In view of the above, the law on the issue can be
               summarized to the effect that statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_19">Section
               313</a> Cr.P.C. is recorded to meet the requirement of the
               principles of natural justice as it requires that an
               accused may be given an opportunity to furnish
               explanation of the incriminating material which had
               come against     in the trial.   However, his statement
               cannot be made a basis for his conviction. His answers
               to the questions put to him under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_20">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.
               cannot be used to fill up the gap left by the prosecution
               wittinesses in their depositions. Thus, the statement of
               the accused is not a substantive piece of evidence and
               therefore, it can be used only for appreciating the
               evidence led by the prosecution, though it cannot be a
               substitute for the evidence of the prosecution. In case
               the prosecution evidence is not found sufficient to
               sustain conviction of the accused, the inculpatory part of
               his statement cannot be made the sole basis of his
               conviction. The statement U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_21">Cr.P.C</a>. is not reorded
               after administering oath to the accused. Therefore, it
               cannot be treated as an evidence within the meaning of
               <a href="/doc/1031309/" id="a_22">Section 3</a> of the Evidence Act, though the accused has
               a right if he chooses to be a witness and once he makes
               that option, he can be administered oath and examined
               as a witness in defence as required under <a href="/doc/615908/" id="a_23">Section 315</a>
               Cr.P.C. An adverse inference can be taken against the


DPCC Vs. M/s Siya Ram Dyeing CC No. 518337/16                page no. 11 of 13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                          12</span>

                accused only and only if the incriminating material stood
                fully established and the accused is not able to furnish
                any explanation for the same. However, the accused
                has a right to remain silent as he cannot be forced to
                become a witness against himself."
</p>

<p id="p_30">24.         Even reliance upon the contents of the affidavit enclosed with the
      plea bargaining application is also misplaced as same cannot be looked
      into being part and parcel of accompanying application. Similarly,
      ordersheets cannot replace the evidence. However, as far as contention
      regarding non taking of samples and the inspection report not signed by
      the SDM is concerned, the same are not mandatory requirements, thus
      does not effect the case of the prosecution.
</p>

<p id="p_31">25.         In view of the above submissions, I am of the considered view that
      prosecution has miserably failed to prove that accused Shyam Sunder
      Saini was running the industrial unit namely M/s Siya Ram Dyeing. Thus
      acquitted.
</p>

<p id="p_32">26.         However, before parting, this Court would like to place on record
      certain observations regarding the mechanical manner in which the instant
      complaint was filed for the sake of formality.      This Court is unable to
      understand as to why even the basic enquiry was not conducted before
      filing the instant complaint. It is not an uphill task to connect an individual
      with his business/livelihood. M/s Siyaram Dyeing being proprietorship
      concern must be having several documents issued by the Government


DPCC Vs. M/s Siya Ram Dyeing CC No. 518337/16                  page no. 12 of 13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                           13</span>

      such as Pan Card, Licence from various authorities, bank account, utility
      bills etc. , but complaint did not bother at all to collect even a single
      document to connect the accused with the polluting industrial unit. Rather
      the complainant chooses to become a mute spectator and fulfilled their
      duties by filing the half baked complaint. The complainant has not even
      bothered to collect the record from the SDM concerned who passed the
      desealing order of the unit as stated during the course of arguments by Ld.
      counsel for the complainant.      There is every likelihood that during the
      proceedings before the SDM concerned, if any, the proprietor of the
      polluting industrial unit might have submitted some documents connecting
      him with his proprietorship concern. The entire case is based upon hearsay
      evidence and shoddy enquiry/investigation if at all conducted by the
      complainant/department before launching of prosecution. The complainant
      being a government body entrusted with the task of handling the most
      challenging problem of pollution which the entire nation is facing.
      Therefore, let the copy of this judgment be sent to the worthy Chairman of
      DPCC and its Member Secretary for appropriate immediate remedial
      action to avoid such failures in future.
