:COMMON JUDGMENT
P.JYOTHIMANI,J	

</pre><p id="p_8">	Since all the writ appeals are relating to the same issue all of them were
heard together and the common judgment is passed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	2.While W.A.(MD)Nos.885 of 2010 and W.A.(MD)No.238 of 2011 are filed
against the order of the learned single Judge, dated 28.07.2010 passed in
W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010 by the  Kodanthur Village Panchayat through its Vice
President Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District who was a third party in the writ
petition and the second respondent(s) in the writ petition namely, the
Commissioner, Karur Paramathi Panchaayt Union and the Chairman, Karur Paramathi
Panchayat Union respectively, W.A.(MD)Nos.14, 15 and 97 of 2011 have been filed
against the order of the learned single Judge, dated 03.12.2010 passed in
W.P.(MD)Nos.12948 and 13105 of 2010 by the writ petitioner and by the President
of Kodanthur Village Panchayat, Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	3.The issue involved in these writ appeals relate to the proposed poultry
farm and feed mill to be set up in Kodanthur village (south) by the company
called M/s.Supreme Poultry Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Company') the appellant in W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011 and the first
respondent in W.A.(MD)Nos.97 of 2011, 238 and 885 of 2010. It is a Private
Limited Company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> stated to be running a
poultry farm and feed mill in Pondurai Semoor. It is stated that with an
intention of setting up a poultry farm and feed mill at Kodanthur village, 75
acres of land were purchased. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has granted
consent to establish the said industry in the name of the said company at Survey
No.696,  Kodanthur village, Aravakurichy Taluk, Karur District as per <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_2">Section 21</a>
of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 in the proceedings,
dated 24.03.2010. That consent to establish was granted by the Pollution Control
Board is valid for 2 years or till the industry obtained consent to operate
under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section 21</a> of the abovesaid Act and the consent to establish was granted
subject to the conditions in respect of the products and quantity namely:-
</p>
<p id="p_11">	i)Poultry Chick Feed		60T/M
</p><p id="p_12">	ii)Poultry Grower Feed		150T/M
</p><p id="p_13">	iii)Poultry Layer Feed		1790T/M
and for establishing the facility in manufacturing of products or bye products
and quantity as stated above. The further conditions with which the consent for
establishment of the industry was granted are relating to the equipments to be
installed for measuring the control and emission generated from various sources
of the plant apart from other general conditions stating that unless all
conditions are complied with, consent to establish will not be issued.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	4.Similarly, the Pollution Control Board has also granted consent to
establish on the same day namely on 24.03.2007 under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> of the Water
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 in respect of the site namely,
Survey No.696, Kodanthur Village, Aravakurichy Taluk, Karur District also valid
for two years with the special conditions which also include apart from the
facility for manufacturing of products and bye products stated under the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The consent was granted
prescribing the outlet for discharging of sewage/trade effluent stating that in
respect of sewage maximum daily discharge as 2.50 KLD with the point of disposal
on the industry's own land and without permission for trade effluent. The
further special condition includes the provision for the Septic tank with sock
pit as dimension of 3.3x1.2x.2.40m      for one unit and 3.30x2.4m for another
unit apart from other general conditions stated above.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	5.Similarly, in respect of S.F.Nos.698/1, 697, 718/A, 1B, 717/1, 704, 705,
706, 707, 708/2 and 709, Kodanthur  village, Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District
as per <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, a
consent to establish was granted on 31.03.2010 for the purpose of manufacturing
products or by products with description and quantity namely:</p><pre id="pre_4">
	 Product			Quantity/Month
	1.Table Eggs 			126  lakh numbers
	By Product
	Cull birds 4			40000 numbers/M
</pre><p id="p_16">along with the special condition regarding the emission/noise sources and
control measures and special conditions to achieve/emission standards and the
general conditions.  Similarly, for the abovesaid S.F.Nos, the consent to
establish under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 was
also granted by order, dated 31.03.2010 subject to the above said conditions as
well as the conditions to be fulfilled.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	6.As per the proceedings of the President of the Village Panchayat, the
second respondent in W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011, dated 05.04.2010, building
permission was granted in respect of S.F.No.696 in favour of the said appellant
company valid from 05.04.2010 to 04.04.2011. It is stated that Karur Paramathi
Panchayat Union Council has also resolved on 16.04.2010 to issue no objection
for staring poultry farm and feed mill in S.No.691, 679/A-2, 696/1, 696/2,
693/3, 696/4, 698/1, 697/1, 865/1, 859/1, 862/2, 355/1, 718/A, 717/1, 505, 706,
707, 708/2, 719, 718/1B, 704 and 705. The Commissioner of Karur Paramathi
Panchayat Union who is the second respondent in W.A.(MD)No.885 of 2010 and the
first appellant in W.A.(MD)No.238 of 2011 has passed the consequential order,
dated 28.04.2010 granting permission to run the poultry farm and feed mill
subject to various conditions mentioned therein. It is stated that the Deputy
Director, Public Health and Family Welfare, Karur has granted permission to the
company for installation of electronic motor apart from no objection certificate
issued by the Fire Department. It is stated that the said company has paid
various amounts to the Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union Council apart from
various other authorities. It appears that at that stage, the residents of
Udayampalayam, Natchipalayam, Kariamapudur, Vettupalayam, karukkampalayam and
Mudaligoundanpudur hamlets of Kodanthur village have filed a suit in O.S.No.225
of 2010 on the file of the District Munsif Court, Karur for a declaration that
the erection and running of poultry farm in the said survey number by the above
said company as an objectionable and actionable nuisance to the inhabitants of
the area and also for a permanent injunction. It was thereafter, Karur Paramathi
Panchayat Union has passed a resolution on 01.07.2010 cancelling the earlier
resolution, dated 16.04.2010 on the ground of public health and to prevent
pollution as requested by the public by way of representation and as per the
request of the members of the panchayat union council. Consequent to the same,
the Commissioner of Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union, by his order dated
05.07.2010 has communicated the company cancelling his earlier order of
permission, dated 28.04.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	7.The Company, appellant in W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011, has challenged
the said proceedings of the Commissioner cancelling the permission as per the
resolution in W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010 before this Court on the basis that when
once the authority contemplated under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 has given consent for establishment based on which the Panchayat Union
Council itself has granted approval and the Company has invested huge amount of
money in purchasing the lands and installing various machines in compliance of
the conditions issued by the authorities, under the abovesaid Acts, the
Panchayat Union Council has no authority to pass such resolution since the
issues are relating to and within the domain of the Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	8.This Court while allowing the writ petition in the order, dated
28.07.2010 has set aside the said impugned communication of the Commissioner of
the Panchayat Union Council, dated 05.07.2010 in accordance with the resolution
of the council dated 01.07.2010 holding that the cancellation has been done
without notice to the Company to whom permission was granted earlier; that the
Pollution Control Board being the authority having exclusive domain to say about
the emanation of water pollution and air pollution has granted consent to
establish and that as per the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_13">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_14">Air Act</a>, the Civil
Court would not have any jurisdiction to entertain any suit. The portion of the
order which is relevant is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_20">	"13.Surprisingly, it appears that the second respondent has passed the
resolution on 01.07.2010. The resolution would read that the second respondent
received some complaint from the public on the ground that the establishment of
such Poultry Farm and Poultry Feed Mill would adversely affect the public health
and the environment would also be polluted.
</p><p id="p_21">	14.Firstly, the second respondent has not taken the petitioner into
confidence by issuing notice to him before ever such a resolution was passed. In
all fairness, the second respondent should have issued notice to the petitioner,
as the second respondent has proposed to give a go by to the earlier resolution
passed by it and has proposed to pass a resolution adverse to the interest of
the petitioner. Secondly, as rightly pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the petitioner, no enquiry was embarked upon by the second
respondent based on the alleged complaint received from the public. Thirdly, the
petitioner was not given any opportunity to counter the plea of the second
respondent that the earlier resolution passed by it was given a go by only on
account of the objections raised by the public. Fourthly, it is only the
Pollution Control Board, which has the exclusive domain to say whether such an
industry would emanate water pollution or air pollution. The second respondent
is not a scientific expert to jump to a conclusion based on some alleged
complaint that such a factory proposed to be established within its jurisdiction
would create pollution and affect the health of the public. If such a stand of
the second respondent is sustained, all the  Poultry Farm and Poultry Feed Mill
located in and around Namakkal will have to be shut down on mere resolution
passed by the Municipality.

<p id="p_25">	9.It is as against the said order of the learned single Judge, the Vice
President of the Kodanthur Village Panchayat which is a third party in the writ
petition and the respondents in the said writ petition namely, Commissioner,
Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union and the Chairman, Karur Paramathi Panchayat
Union have filed W.A.(MD)Nos.885 of 2010 and 238 of 2011 respectively, on the
ground that the village panchayat and the panchayat union are having statutory
responsibility of maintaining health and livelihood of inhabitants of the
village and even if the impugned order is in violation of principles of natural
justice it ought to have been remanded the issue for fresh orders; that creation
of such massive poultry farm will have direct impact on the living condition of
the people who are living in the hamlets; that in spite of the consent order
obtained from the Pollution Control Board, it is open to the village panchayat
and panchayat union to grant licence or approval for establishment or reject the
same based on the local conditions; that the power to grant approval includes
the power to cancel; that the right of the company to carry on business under
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_19">Article 19</a> of the Constitution is subject to reasonable restrictions and that
the earlier permission given by the President of the Kodanthur Village Panchayat
to the company, in his proceedings, dated 05.04.2010 is without the support of
any resolution passed by the panchayat apart from other grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_26">	10.In the meantime, by an order dated 04.10.2010, as per the proceedings
of the President, Kodanthur Village      Panchayat, the building permission
granted to the company came to be cancelled on the ground that the previous
permission of the President of the village panchayat, dated 05.04.2010, was
granted without any resolution by the panchayat and on the basis that by
establishing poultry farm, the environment will become unhygienic and there is a
possibility of epidemic diseases due to insects and mosquitoes as represented by
the public thereby directing the company to stop further construction.  The said
order refers about the resolution of an emergency meeting of the panchayat,
dated 01.10.2010 and 02.10.2010. The District Collector being the Inspector of
Panchayats who is the first respondent in W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011 has
passed an order on 11.10.2010 stating that the permission granted in favour of
the company for construction to establish the poultry farm and feed mill without
resolution passed by the panchayat is not valid.
</p>
<p id="p_27">	11.The company has filed W.P.(MD)No.12948 of 2010 challenging the
abovesaid order of the District Collector dated 11.10.2010 and W.P.(MD)No.13105
of 2010 challenging the proceedings of the Panchayat President signed by the
Vice President, dated 04.10.2010 on various grounds including that the said
orders are illegal and without jurisdiction and without affording an opportunity
and in violation of the principles of natural justice; that the executive
authority of the Village Panchayat alone is entitled to grant building
plan/permission and it is not necessary to be approved by the Panchayat Union
Council; that even otherwise under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994
permission has been granted by the panchayat union council for the purpose of
installation of the     feed mill; that the District Collector cum Inspector of
Panchayats is not vested with any power under the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994
to cancel the order passed by the President of the Village Panchayat; that the
impugned orders are tainted with mala fide; that the cancellation of building
permission having been granted by the President of the village panchayat in the
manner known to law, is not valid in law apart from other grounds.
</p><p id="p_28">	 12.When the writ petitions came up before the learned single Judge, there
was an interim order passed on 21.10.2010 granting interim stay stating that any
construction put up by the writ petitioner would be subject to the result and
the final orders passed in the writ petitions. The writ petitions have been
resisted by the village panchayat in the counter affidavit reiterating that the
panchayat has got every jurisdiction and obligation to see that the health
condition is not harmed by any of the industrial activities and the Collector
being the Inspector of Panchayats has every right to exercise his powers under
Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act apart from other various other
grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_29">	13.Learned single Judge while taking up both the writ petitions
W.P.(MD)Nos.12948 and 13105 of 2010 by a common order, dated 03.12.2010 which is
impugned in Writ Appeals (MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011 dismissed the writ petitions
filed by the company, however directed the District Collector cum Inspector of
Panchayats to hold an enquiry after giving sufficient notice to the Company and
such other persons or local bodies etc. since the impugned orders challenged in
the writ petitions were passed without opportunity and notice to the appellant
company. The operative portion of the order of the learned single Judge is as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_30">	"42. As seen from the provisions of Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats Act, 1994, the District Collector, Karur District, who is the
Inspector of Panchayats, has the power to suspend or cancel any resolution
passed, order issued or licence or permission granted, if such   resolution,
order or licence has not been legally passed, issued or granted, or if it is
found that it is not in exercise of powers conferred by the Act or any other
law, or an abuse of such powers or if it is considered to be otherwise
undesirable, or if it would cause danger to the human life or health or safety.
In such circumstances, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned
order of the first respondent, dated 11.10.2010 and the impugned order of the
third respondent in the writ petition, in W.P.No.13105 of 2010, dated
04.10.2010. Therefore, the writ petitions stand dismissed. No costs. However, in
view of the fact that no notice had been issued to the petitioner company before
the impugned order had been passed and no opportunity had been given to the
petitioner company to put forth its views, it would be appropriate for the first
respondent to hold an enquiry, after giving sufficient notice to the petitioner
company and to such other persons, authorities and local bodies as the first
respondent may consider to be necessary, and pass appropriate orders thereon, on
merits and in accordance with law, within a period of eight weeks from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order.  If the petitioner company is in a position
to  convince the first respondent that no pollution or health hazard or
ecological imbalance or degradation of the environment would be caused, due to
the establishment of the poultry farm and the feed manufacturing mill,  the
petitioner company may be permitted to establish the poultry farm and the feed
manufacturing mill, at Udaiyanpalayam, as already proposed by the petitioner
company".
</p>
<p id="p_31">	14.As stated above, the company which is the appellant in W.A.(MD)Nos.14
and 15 of 2011 has challenged the order of the learned single Judge in
dismissing the writ petitions holding that the District Collector being the
Inspector of panchayats as per Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act, 1994
has power to suspend or cancel any resolution passed or cancelled any licence or
permission etc.,  if it is considered to be otherwise or would cause to damages
to the livelihood.
</p>	
<p id="p_32">	15.Likewise, the President of Village Panchayat has filed W.A.(MD)No.97 of
2011, in respect of the portion of the impugned order of the learned single
Judge remitting the matter to the District Collector for reconsideration while
approving the powers of the District Collector under Section 202 of the Tamil
Nadu Panchayat Act.
</p>
<p id="p_33">	16.Mr.K.M.Vijayan, learned Senior Counsel for the company which is the
appellant in W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011 while taking to the various factual
aspects of obtaining consent for establishment as required under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_20">Air Act</a> and
water Act as narrated above would submit that at the first instance, as per the
provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules, 1997 framed in
accordance with the powers conferred under Section 242(2) of the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats Act, 1994 especially under Rule 29, the executive authority being the
President of the Village Panchayat need not get any prior approval from the
meeting of the panchayat. It is just sufficient that such decision by the
executive authority shall be placed in the next meeting of the Panchayat for
information and therefore, according to the learned Senior Counsel, there is no
necessity for passing such resolution by the panchayat. Therefore, in his
submission, the permission granted originally, by the President of the Village
Panchayat in his proceedings, dated 05.04.2010 for the purpose of construction
cannot be held to be improper. Therefore, the cancellation of such permission
passed in the proceedings of the President of the  Village Panchayat signed by
the Vice President challenged in W.P.(MD)No.13105 of 2010 on the ground that
approval of the village panchayat has not been obtained is contended to be
against statutory rules.
</p>
<p id="p_34">	17.It is his further contention that power of the District
Collector/Inspector of Panchayats under Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat
Act, 1994, is only in respect of suspension or cancellation of resolution. On
the facts of the present case, according to the learned Senior Counsel, inasmuch
as no resolution is required as per the Rules, the question of invoking powers
by the Inspector of panchayats namely, the District Collector under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Section 202</a>
does not arise and therefore, the order of the District Collector, dated
11.10.2010 impugned in W.P.(MD)No.12948 of 2010 is without jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_35">	18.His further contention is that even otherwise as per the provisions of
Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act itself, the District Collector
cannot pass any order without giving opportunity to the persons concerned for
explanation.
</p>
<p id="p_36">	19.It is his further submission that even though the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 respectively are the earlier Acts in point of time when
compared to the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, specialised Acts having
overriding effects of other Act makes the order of consent given under the
special Acts as superior only subject to the conditions based on which such
consent has been given.
</p>
<p id="p_37">	20.According to him, when once the authority under the Water (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_25">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, passed appropriate orders for consent to establish a
poultry farm and feed mill, it cannot be set at naught by the local bodies like
village panchayat or even panchayat union council on the basis of pollution,
inasmuch as the the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and
the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 have the overriding
effect over any other enactments.
</p>
<p id="p_38">	21.Further, he would submit that when once the Panchayat Union Council has
passed a resolution taking note of the order of the Pollution Control Board, the
no objection certificate granted by the Fire and Health Departments and granted
due permission, thereafter, it is not open to such Panchayat Union Council to
re-open the case on the ground of pollution safety or public health for the
purpose of withdrawing the permission granted by it.
</p>
<p id="p_39">	22.He would further submit that when once the High Court passed order
setting aside the resolution passed by the Panchayat Union Council and
cancelling the earlier order passed by the Council, it is not open to the vice
president of the panchayat in the name of the proceedings of the executive
authority and the District Collector being the Inspector of panchayats to pass
the impugned orders dated 04.10.2010 and 11.10.2010 respectively and that it
would amount to ignoring the orders of the High Court and what cannot be done
directly, has been done indirectly in disobeyance of court order.
</p>
<p id="p_40">	23.His further submission is that when once the consent to establish has
been granted by the authorities the panchayat cannot scuttle it in the starting
stage itself merely on the apprehension and based on the alleged objections by
the village people.
</p>

<p id="p_41">	24.He would submit that the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Action Council, Poovathode and others Vs. Benny Abraham and others reported in
(2002) 9 SCC 493 cannot be taken as a precedent and it was on the facts and
circumstances of the said case.
</p>
<p id="p_42">	25.It is his further submission that when once the panchayat union council
has given permission by passing a resolution especially after the Pollution
Control Board has given consent to establish, there is no necessity for the
company to approach the village panchayat for passing the resolution when the
President of the Village Pancahyat as an executive authority has already given
permission. According to him, the permission granted by the President of the
Village Panchayat under Rule 29 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules,
1997 is equivalent to the permission granted by the Panchayt Union Council under
Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act.
</p>
<p id="p_43">	26.He would also refer to the Rules 14 and 15 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayts
(Quorum and Procedure for the Convening and Conduct of Meetings of Village
Panchayat) Rules 1999 which show that the proceedings and record of the meetings
shall be with the President of the Village Panchayat and the copies shall be
certified by him as per <a href="/doc/186146/" id="a_28">Section 76</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. In the impugned
proceedings of the Vice President of the Village Panchayat, dated 04.10.2010
challenged in W.P.(MD)No.13105 of 2010, a reference has been made about the
proceedings of the emergency meeting of the panchayat, dated 01.10.2010 and
02.10.2010 and such order has been passed knowing that the earlier order of
cancellation has been set aside by the High Court and the order has been signed
not by the President of the Village Panchayat but by the Vice President which is
not the Executive Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_44">	27.It is his further submission that under <a href="/doc/1931523/" id="a_29">Article 243 (g)</a> of the
Constitution of India, the State Legislature is empowered to enact a law by
necessary notification in respect of the matters listed in the 11th schedule and
in the 11th schedule, item-4 contains poultry and therefore, in the absence of
specific notification issued by the State Government enabling the Village
Panchayat to formulate a scheme, the exercising of the power stated to have been
made by the panchayat by way of resolution culminating into the impugned order
challenged in the writ petitions is without jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_45">	28.He would also refer to Section 57 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act,
1994 which enables the State Government to pass notification in respect of items
mentioned in schedule-4 which is also a reproduction of schedule-11 of the
Constitution of India and schedule-4 of the Tamil Nadu    Village Panchayats Act
also relates to poultry, the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_30">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1974 passed by the Parliament is made applicable to the States by virtue of
<a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_31">Article 252</a> of the Constitution of India and the authority constituted under the
Act by the State namely, the Pollution Control Board having given consent for
establishment, it should be construed that in respect of pollution, the
exclusive jurisdiction lies to the Parliament and therefore, the Panchayat has
no power to interfere in the name of prevention of pollution and there is no
necessity for any harmonious construction with Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats Act in the absence of any precedent on the scheme of the Act in
respect of pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_46">	29.It is his submission that the findings by the learned single Judge as
if the Inspector of Panchayats has got an overriding effect under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_32">Section 202</a> of
the Act has to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_47">	30.On the other hand, it is the submission made by Mr.T.Mohan, learned
counsel for the Village Panchayat as adopted by Mr.K.M.Vijayakumar, learned
counsel for the appellant in W.A.(MD)No.885 of 2010 that under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_33">Section 84</a> (c) of
the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, the executive authority has to carry out
the resolutions passed by the Village Panchayat. He would also submit that even
in respect of S.No.696, the permission or consent for establishment was given
not for poultry farm but for manufacturing of poultry feed and therefore, it
cannot be said that the company is having a consent to establish a poultry farm.
It is his submission that the orders passed by the Pollution Control Board shows
that the Pollution Control Board has never applied its mind. He would further
submit that when the company has made an application on 19.03.2010 which happens
to be Friday, the consent has given on 24.03.2010 on Wednesday and the zonal
council has passed orders on the next day itself and that shows the hasty manner
with which the Company is able to obtain the consent order.
</p>
<p id="p_48">	 31.He has also submitted that even the no objection certificate from the
Fire Department and other Departments was obtained so hastily when application
was made on 12.05.2010, no objection certificate has been issued was easily on
17.05.2010 itself and therefore, it is his submission that in such circumstances
no reliance can be placed on mere consent granted by the Pollution Control Board
for the purpose of deciding as to whether the local village panchayt ceases to
have any jurisdiction in spite of the fact that such a large industry will
result in unhygienic condition of the entire mass of the area. Such a view will
be inconsistent with the concept of the village panchayat which is the
constitutional goal.
</p>
<p id="p_49">	32.He would also rely heavily upon the judgment of the Division Bench of
this Court in Kings India Chemicals Corporation Limited Vs. The District
Collector cum Inspector of Panchayats reported in 2010(1)CWC 319 and the
judgment of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court reported in AIR 2002
Kerala 65, (Action Council, Poovathode and others Vs. Benny Abraham and others)
which has discussed the entire issue  and the powers about the panchayat and
contend that while the powers of the panchayat are wide, the Pollution Control
Board is restricted.  While the Pollution Control Board thinks about the
location of the industries, the panchayat looks into the location itself as to
whether it is appropriate to have a such a huge industry. His submission is that
when once even as per the consent order issued by the Pollution Control Board
40,000, cull birds are to be killed and 4 lakhs eggs are to be produced, the
resultant feature will be the huge wastage in water, movement of lorries,
employees which are all the local concern. Therefore, according to him, the
panchayat when once has decided to withdraw the permission, the company cannot
claim as a matter of right since the panchayat has decided on the health ground
that even under the consent order of the Pollution Control Board, the survey
number differs; that the resolution passed by the Panchayat has not been
challenged by the Company and in fact, the order of the District Collector need
not be challenged by the Company which has become infructuous inasmuch as the
Panchayat has passed resolution and his contention is that there is no purpose
for sending it back to the District Collector to reconsider the issue since the
Panchayat having seized of the entire matter has taken a decision in accordance
with law.
</p>
<p id="p_50">	33.We have heard the respective learned counsel and gone through the
impugned judgments passed by the learned single Judges and given our anxious
thought to the issue involved in these cases.
</p>
<p id="p_51">	34.As far as the two writ appeals in W.A.(MD)Nos.885 of 2010 and 238 of
2011 filed by the Kodanthur Village Panchayat and the Commissioner of Karur
Panchayat Union respectively are concerned, it is an indisputed fact that
originally the President of the Village Panchayat in his proceedings, dated
05.04.2010 has granted approval for the plant for putting up construction by the
company for a period of one year namely 05.04.2010 to 04.04.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_52">	35.Under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_34">Section 2(11)</a> defines
"executive authority" means as "a person notified as such by the Government
under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_35">Section 83</a>". Section 83 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_53">	"83.Executive authority of village panchayat:-The Government may, by
notification, appoint any person, who shall, subject to such rules as may be
prescribed, exercise the powers and perform the functions of the executive
authority of a village panchayat".
</p>
<p id="p_54">Therefore, by virtue of notification issued by the Government or by framing the
rules an executive authority can be appointed by the Government.
</p>	
<p id="p_55">	36.In exercise of the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_36">Section 242</a> which enables the
Government to make rules, the Government has framed the Tamil Nadu Panchayat
Building Rules 1997. Under the said statutory Rule 2(e) "executive authority is
defined as "the President of the Village Panchayat". Under the Rules which
relate to permission to be granted for building and approval for site for
buildings, the procedure are contemplated. Rule-4 contemplated the application
to be made for approval for site, for building and huts to the executive
authority with various stipulations. Rule-25, however, deals with the
construction of multi-storeyed and public buildings in which event, the Multi-
Storeyed and Public Building Rules,  1973 issued under the Tamil Nadu District
Municipalities Act, 1920 is directed to be followed and in such event, the
executive authority namely, the President of the Panchayat cannot grant approval
for construction, reconstruction, addition or alteration without consulting the
concerned Joint Director or Deputy Director of Town and Country Planning. On
facts of the present case, it is not for the multi-storeyed public building, the
Company has made application under Rule 29 which is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_56">	"29.Grant of approval by executive authority:-1) All approvals granted
under these rules in the panchayat shall be placed in the next panchayat meeting
for information.
</p><p id="p_57">	(2)Any appeal against the orders of the executive authority under sub-rule
(1) shall be made to the Collector of the revenue district concerned within
thirty days from the date of receipt of the such orders. The orders of the
Collector on such appeal shall be final".
</p>
<p id="p_58">	37.The approval granted by the executive authority or any other person as
contemplated under Rules including as that of the Rule 25 has to be placed
before the next meeting of the panchayat for information. As stated above, under
Rule 29, anyone who is aggrieved by the approval that may be granted by the
executive authority has a right of appeal to the District Collector.
</p>
<p id="p_59">	38.Rule 32 enables the executive authority to require alteration of work,
if the work is executed otherwise than the plan approval or the specification
granted or any contravention of the rules or contravene the approval.
</p>
<p id="p_60">	39.Under Rule 33 if any construction endangers human life, the executive
authority may stop construction. The executive authority has also powers under
Rule 34 to demolish or alter the building work which has been unlawfully done.
Therefore, when the President of the Panchayat being the executive authority as
per the Act and Rules granted building permission to the company on 05.04.2010
which was alive between 05.04.2010 to 04.04.2011 in the absence of any appeal
filed by any person against such permission, it is not known  as to how the
Commissioner, Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union has cancelled the said order in
the name of cancelling a resolution passed by the Paramathi Panchayat Union,
dated 16.04.2010 by which, in fact the same Panchayat Union, has approved the
permission granted by the executive authority namely the President of the
Panchayat, dated 05.04.2010.
</p>

<p id="p_61">	40.It is not in dispute that by the time, the executive authority namely
the President of the Panchayat has granted permission on 05.04.2010, the
Pollution Control Board has in fact given its consent for establishment on
24.03.2010 itself. Even assuming that the Panchayat Union Council which has
earlier passed resolution on 16.04.2010 approving the executive authority's
permission to the company can cancel its earlier resolution, as it is stated to
have been done on 01.07.2010 based on an alleged representation of public and
also to avoid pollution, such resolution itself, in the absence of any mandatory
requirements under the Rules for granting approval from the panchayat cannot
indirectly nullify the permission granted by the executive authority, dated
05.04.2010, for, what cannot be done directly shall not be done indirectly also.
Even otherwise, when approval has been granted to the company on 05.04.2010, if
the executive authority or any other higher authority like District Collector,
either on representation on public or suo motu on a finding that there is a
pollution problem and desire to cancel the permission, it is elementary that
such cancellation can be only done after giving opportunity to the company which
has stated that pursuant to the permission granted by the executive authority
apart from the consent to establish from the Pollution Control Board, Fire and
Health Departments, has proceeded to put up construction in accordance with the
approved plan. In the absence of following the elementary principles of natural
justice, the order of the Commissioner of Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union, dated
05.07.2010 challenged in W.P.(MD)No.8812 of 2010 cannot be sustained in the eye
of law.  It was in those circumstances, the learned single Judge in the order
dated 28.07.2010 has set aside the impugned proceedings of the Commissioner of
Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union, dated 05.07.2010. There is absolutely no
illegality in the said order especially when the authorities under the the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_37">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_38">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 have given consent to establish the unit.
Therefore, there is nothing to interfere with the order of the learned single
Judge. However, quashing of the order of the Commissioner, dated 05.07.2010 by
which the original order of the executive authority, dated 05.04.2010 stands
restored does not in our view take away the right of the authorities
contemplated under the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Building Rules, 1997 in cancelling
or modifying the same in accordance with law. In all fairness, in our considered
view especially during the subsistance of the permission granted by the
executive authority, when a contrary decision was attempted to be taken by the
Commissioner of Panchayat Union, he ought to have heard the company before
passing such orders.
</p>
<p id="p_62">	41.In such view of the matter, the writ appeals filed by the Vice
President of the Kodanthur Village Panchayat and the Commissioner of Karur
Paramathi Panchayat Union namely in W.A.(MD)Nos.885 of 2010 and 238 of 2011
stand dismissed.  However, it is always open to the Executive Authority, to act
as per the said provision of the rules enumerated above in the event of any
contingency in respect of the grant of permission.
</p>
<p id="p_63">	42.In respect of the other three appeals namely, W.A.(MD)Nos.14, 15 and 97
of 2011, a crucial point has been raised as to whether the village panchayat or
the panchyat union council or for that matter, the District Collector cum
Inspector of Panchayats or the Pollution Control Board is having supremacy to
decide about the devices to be formulated to avoid pollution in respect of the
alleged starting of poultry farm and feed mill. It is strange that in the name
of proceedings of the President of the village panchayat being the executive
authority, the vice president of the village panchayat who has filed the third
party appeal namely in W.A.(MD)No.885 of 2010 which has been dismissed as stated
above has passed an order of directing the company to stop work. As stated
above, as per the Rules elicited above, the executive authority is defined
exhaustively as the President of the village panchayat and therefore, one cannot
imagine that the vice president can claim to be the executive authority. Even
assuming that there has been any endangering  human life because of the approval
granted for construction, it is the executive authority who has granted
permission to construct who alone can issue a stop of work notice that is
contemplated under Rule 33 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Building Rules 1997,
which is as follows:
</p>	
<p id="p_64">	"33.Stoppage of work endangering human life:-Notwithstanding anything
contained in any of the preceding provisions, the executive authority may at any
time stop the construction or reconstruction of any building if in his opinion
the work in progress endangers human life".
</p>
<p id="p_65">	43.Whileso, simply because it is stated to be the proceedings of the
President of the Panchayat when it is not signed by the President of the
Panchayat who is the executive authority and signed by somebody else as the vice
president that can never be considered as a stop work notice issued by the
executive authority. On that score itself, the impugned order which is
challenged in W.P.(MD)No.13105 of 2010 which is the subject matter of
W.A.(MD)No.15 of 2011 ought to have been set aside. However, this aspect has not
been considered by the learned single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_66">	44.The finding by the learned single Judge that permission has been
originally granted to the company by the executive authority against the
provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules, 1997, in our view, is
totally contrary to the provision of the Rules. As stated above, when the
resolution of the panchayat union council or panchayat union itself is not a
condition precedent for the purpose of granting approval by the executive
authority, there is no question of the impugned order passed by the vice
president on 04.10.2010 based on any resolution passed by the village panchayat.
This aspect has not been considered by the learned single Judge.  Accordingly,
the stop work notice issued by the vice president of the panchayat, dated
04.10.2010 challenged in W.P.(MD)No.13105 of 2010 cannot sustain in the eye of
law, when the Company has been issued a permission by the executive authority by
way of a building permission as per the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules
1997. Insofar as it relates to the order of the Inspector of Panchayats on
11.10.2010 which has been challenged in W.P.(MD)No.12948 of 2010, it has to be
remembered that the power of the executive authority namely the President of
Village Panchayat in issuing permission for building as per the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats Building Rules, 1997, or the power of Inspector to suspend any
resolution passed by the village panchayat or cancel any licence or permission
granted is certainly unassailable. That power is available to the District
Collector being the Inspector of Panchayats under <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_39">Section 202</a> of the Tamil nadu
Panchayat Act, 1994 which is as follows:
</p><p id="p_67">	"202.Power to suspend or cancel resolution, etc., under the Act:-(1)The
Inspector may, by order in writing:-
</p><p id="p_68">	 (i)suspend or cancel any resolution passed, order issued, or licence or
permission granted, or
</p><p id="p_69">	 (ii)prohibit the doing of any act which is about to be done or is being
done, in pursuance or under colour of this Act, if in his opinion,
</p><p id="p_70">	   a)such resolution, order, licence, permission or act has not been
legally passed, issued, granted or authorised, or
</p><p id="p_71">	    b)such resolution, order, licence, permission or act is in excess of
the powers conferred by this Act or any other law or an abuse of such powers or
is considered by the Inspector to be otherwise undesirable, or
</p><p id="p_72">	     c)the execution of such resolution or order, or the continuance in
force of such licence or permission or the doing of such act is likely to cause
danger to human life, health or safety, or is likely to lead to a riot or an
affray:
</p><p id="p_73">		Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall enable the Inspector
to set aside any election which has  been held.
</p><p id="p_74">	2)The Inspector shall, before taking action on any of the grounds referred
to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1), give the authority or person
concerned an opportunity for explanation.
</p><p id="p_75">	3)The power conferred on the Inspector under clause (c) of sub-section (1)
may be exercised by the collector in accordance with the provisions of that
clause".
</p>
<p id="p_76">	45.But while passing such orders, the District Collector being the
Inspector of Panchayats, before taking any such action must give opportunity for
explanation to the person who is going to be affected by such action even in the
absence of any specific provision akin to Section 202(2) of the Tamil Nadu
Panchayats Act elicited above. Law is well settled that if statutory right has
accrued on a person and such right is sought to be taken away the following of
the principles of natural justice is inbuilt in any statute. But as stated
above, there is a specific provision to Section 202 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats
Act, 1994 imposing an obligation upon the Inspector of Panchayats namely, the
District Collector to give opportunity to the person who is likely to be
affected either by cancelling the licence or suspend the resolution etc.,
Admittedly, while passing such order on 11.10.2010, the Inspector of Panchayats
namely, the District Collector has not given opportunity or heard anything from
the company which is the appellant in W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011. This aspect
has also not been considered by the learned single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_77">	46.Even assuming that under Section 160 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act,
1994 which in our considered view is applicable to a factory or workshop or
installation of machinery or manufacturing plant as it is stated in the Section
itself which is as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_78">	"160.Permission for construction of factories and the installation of
machinery:- No person shall, without the permission of the panchayat union
council in panchayat villages and except in accordance with the conditions
specified in such permission,
</p><p id="p_79">	(a)construct or establish any factory, workshop or workplace in which it
is proposed to employ steam power, water power or other mechanical power or
electrical power, or
</p><p id="p_80">	(b)install in any premises any machinery or manufacturing plant driven by
any power as aforesaid, not being machinery or manufacturing plant exempted by
the rules",

</p><p id="p_81">	47.By virtue of the power under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_40">Section 202</a>, the Inspector of Factories
can even nullify such permission for construction of factories or installation
of machinery granted under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_41">Section 160</a> of the Act. But that can be only on
complying with the principles of natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_82">	48.Inasmuch as we are of the view that the authority competent namely, the
executive authority under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994 being the
President as per the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Building Rules, 1997, has granted
permission to the company which is the appellant in W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of
2011. Unless and until, that is varied either by the executive authority himself
in the manner known to law as enumerated above or set aside or suspended by the
Inspector of panchayats namely, the District Collector as per the provision of
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_42">Section 202</a> by following the principles of natural justice as provided therein,
it is certainly not open to the District Collector unilaterally to come to a
conclusion as if the resolution passed by the panchayat on 16.04.2010 approving
the approval granted by the executive authority, dated 05.04.2010 is invalid or
without jurisdiction or such approval has been granted unilaterally by the
President without resolution of the panchayat when such resolution is not a
condition precedent as per the statutory rules or based on any other reasons.
This aspect has also not been considered by the learned single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_83">	49.Even though elaborate argument has been advanced about the supremacy of
the Pollution Control Board which has been opposed by Mr.T.Mohan, learned
counsel stating that the Pollution Control Board has been granting permission in
a hasty manner, taking note of the fact that the Pollution Control Board has not
yet granted any consent for starting manufacturing activity and consent has been
given only for establishment, we propose not to enter into such controversy as
to whether the Pollution Control Board is the superior authority in deciding
about the Pollution matters or the Village Panchayat or Panchayat Union Council
or the Inspector of Panchayat for that matter who are entitled to consider the
local implication of starting of such unit. Such construction, in our considered
view would arise only after the village panchayat or panchayat union council or
the Inspector of panchayats have followed the principles of law and passed
appropriate orders. Unless and until such orders are passed, we are of the
considered view that the order of the District Collector, dated 11.10.2010 is
not valid in law. With respect,  the contrary decision rendered by the learned
single Judge in this regard is not acceptable.
</p>
<p id="p_84">	50.There is one other aspect, the learned single Judge having found that
the impugned orders of the Vice President of the village panchayat passed in the
name of the proceedings of the executive authority, dated 04.10.2010 and the
Inspector of Pancahayats namely, the District Collector, dated 11.10.2010 as
valid in law and dismissed the writ petition in spite of such finding, chosen to
direct the Inspector of Panchayats to give sufficient opportunity to the company
and such other persons or local bodies as the District collector may consider it
necessary. This is totally in our considered view a contradictory order. We do
not subscribe to the views of the learned single Judge in this regard also.
Accordingly, W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 stand allowed and the orders of the vice
president issued in the name of the President, dated 04.10.2010, impugned in
W.P.(MD)No.13105 of 2010 and the impugned order of the Inspector of Panchayats,
dated 11.10.2010 impugned in W.P.(MD)No.12948 of 2010 stand set aside and the
order of the learned single Judge contrary to our view stands set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_85">	51.Insofar as W.A.(MD)No.97 of 2011 filed by the Kodanthur village
panchayt is concerned, we agree with the contention raised by the appellant that
the finding of the learned single Judge in upholding the impugned orders but at
the same time, directing the District Collector to conduct proper enquiry after
giving opportunity, is contradictory. Therefore, W.A.(MD)No.97 of 2011 stands
ordered permitting the President of the panchayat or the Inspector of Panchayats
namely, the District Collector to act in accordance with the provisions of Tamil
Nadu Panchayats Building Rules, 1997 and the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994
particularly as per <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_43">Section 202</a> of the Act and pass appropriate orders after
giving opportunity to the company as well as all other persons concerned
including any public who may be aggrieved by the starting of the poultry farm
and feed mill regarding the permission granted by the executive authority
namely, the President of the village panchayat, dated 05.04.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_86">	52.In the result,
</p><p id="p_87">	i)W.A.(MD)Nos.14 and 15 of 2011 are allowed and the impugned orders, dated
11.10.2010 and 04.10.2010 are set aside.
</p><p id="p_88">	ii)W.A.(MD)No.97 of 2011 stands ordered with a direction to the President
of the Panchayat and the Inspector of Panchayats, namely, the District
Collector, to act as per the provisions of the Rules as well as the Act after
giving opportunity to the writ petitioner as well as the public and others who
are likely to be affected in respect of granting of permission by the executive
authority namely, the President dated 05.04.2010 and pass appropriate orders.
</p>
<p id="p_89">	iii)The writ appeals No.885 of 2011 and 238 of 2011 stand dismissed. No
costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
