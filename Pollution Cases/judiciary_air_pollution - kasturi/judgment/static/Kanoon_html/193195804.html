<p id="p_1">MANMOHAN, J: (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.     Present writ petition has been filed by the petitioner-Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. with the following prayers:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "(i) Issue a writ or order or direction in the nature of mandamus
       to Respondent No.1 ordering the Respondent No.1 to act on the
       Representations of the Petitioner (Given as ANNEXURE P-1 and



WP(C) 2066/2014                                                    page 1 of 7
        dated 28 January 2014 and ANNEXURE P-2 dated 25 February
       2014) without any delay;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii)   Issue a writ or order or direction in the nature of mandamus
       directing Respondent No.1 and 2 to adopt a clarification that is
       harmonious with the dominant purpose of the Schedule to the EIA
       Notification 2006 inasmuch as the prescription of the area
       thresholds given in Items 8(a) and (b) of the Schedule to the EIA
       Notification 2006 cannot be extended to any and all activities and
       projects;

       Respondent No.2 quashing the Impugned Directions of the
       Respondent No.2 (Given as ANNEXURE P-3 and dated 28th
       February 2014).

       Respondent No.1.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (v)    Grant any ad interim ex-parte reliefs in the aforementioned

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (vi) Issue any other appropriate writ, order or directions as this
       Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of
       the case."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">2.     The relevant facts are that petitioner is engaged in the activity of
automobile manufacturing and has various projects throughout India.
</p><p id="p_4">3.     Respondent No.1 is the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests of the
Government of India and is responsible for the promulgation and
implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification (S.O.
1533) dated 14th September, 2006 ('EIA Notification 2006').
</p><p id="p_5">4.     Respondent No.2 is the Haryana State Environment Impact
Assessment Authority which is an authority constituted by the respondent


WP(C) 2066/2014                                                         page 2 of 7
 No.1 in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_1">Section 3(3)</a> of the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986 and the EIA Notification 2006 by respondent No.1's
Notification S.O. 899 (2) (E) dated 21st April, 2008 (and amended and
superseded by respondent No.1's Notifications S.O.568(E) dated 23rd
March, 2012 and S.O. 937 (E) dated 05th April, 2013).
</p><p id="p_6">5.     Respondent No.2 is also a delegate of respondent No.1 and is
responsible for the grant of prior Environmental Clearance (for short 'EC') in
the State of Haryana for Category 'B' projects and activities as listed in the
Schedule to the EIA Notification 2006 promulgated by respondent No.1.
</p><p id="p_7">6.     Respondent No.3 is the Haryana State Expert Appraisal Committee
which has been constituted by the respondent No.1 (in consultation with the
Government of Haryana) in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/66315068/" id="a_2">Section 3(3)</a> of the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the EIA Notification 2006 by
respondent No.1's Notification S.O. 899(2)(E) dated 21st April, 2008 (and
amended and superseded by respondent No.1's Notification S.O. 568(E)
dated 23rd March, 2012). Respondent No.3 functions under the supervision
and directions of the respondent No.2, which in turn, is a delegate of the
respondent No.1. Respondent No.3 assists in the functioning of respondent
No.2 and is responsible for making recommendations to the respondent No.2
regarding the grant of EC for Category 'B' projects and activities.
</p><p id="p_8">7.     Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned senior counsel for petitioner submits that
in accordance with the EIA Notification 2006, only those projects and
activities, clearly and specifically listed in the Schedule to the EIA
Notification 2006 require EC. According to him, projects and activities not
listed in the Schedule are exempted from its regulatory ambit.                  The
petitioner contends that though the petitioner's activity was specifically


WP(C) 2066/2014                                                       page 3 of 7
 included in the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Notification S.O.
1324(E) dated 15th September, 2005, yet it was omitted from the Schedule
to the EIA Notification 2006. He contends that this omission clearly
suggests that petitioner's activity would not be covered by the EIA
Notification 2006.
</p><p id="p_9">8.     Mr. Rohatgi points out that even the Supreme Court in Re:
Construction of Park at NOIDA near Okhla Bird Sanctuary, reported in
(2011) 1 SCC 744 had commented on the ambiguity in the Notification and
observed that "The projects/activities under items 8(a) and 8(b) of the
schedule to the notification need to be described with greater precision and
clarity and the definition of built-up area with facilities open to the sky
needs to the freed from its present ambiguity and vagueness" confusion in
fact, continues to remain unattended to by respondent No.1.
</p><p id="p_10">9.     Mr. Rohatgi states that in any event, the petitioner has been obtaining
the requisite environmental clearances and approvals such as Consents to
Establish and the Consents to Operate under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974 and the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and
Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 from the Haryana State Pollution
Control Board (for short 'HSPCB') for its various projects.
</p><p id="p_11">10.    Mr. Rohatgi further states that the petitioner has now without
prejudice to its rights and contentions sought EC after the formation of such
view by respondent No.2. He, however, states that the petitioner despite a
'without prejudice' application of EC dated 14th February, 2013 for the
petitioner's project at Rohtak is being sought to be prosecuted under
<a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_5">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_6">19</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for failure to


WP(C) 2066/2014                                                   page 4 of 7
 obtain prior EC. In this regard, he refers to the Minutes of the 67th Meeting
of the respondent No.2 dated 28th February, 2014 and 01st March, 2014
where the respondent No.2 has in Item 14 of the minutes of the
abovementioned meeting ordered:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       ".....[1] The Principal Secretary, Environment may be requested to
       initiate credible action on the violation by invoking powers under
       <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_7">Section 19</a> of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 for taking
       necessary legal action under Section 15 of the EP Act for the period
       for which the violation has taken place, against MSIL, EMG
       Department, Palam Gurgaon Road, Gurgaon, Haryana for
       commencing construction of "Industrial Building for testing of
       Vehicles" at Plot No.1, Section 33-B, 33-C IMT, Rohtak, Maruti
       Suzuki India Limited Rohtak without obtaining prior EC under the
       EIA Notification. The Principal Secretary, Environment may also be
       requested to provide the evidence of credible action taken against
       the project proponent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       [2] The matter relating to the violation shall be put by the project
       proponent to the Board of Directors of MSIL for consideration of its
       environmental related policy/plan of action as also a written
       commitment in the form of a formal resolution to be submitted to the
       SEIAA within a period of 60 days of the date of this letter ensuring
       that the violations will not be repeated; failing which it will be
       presumed the project proponent is not interested in pursuing the
       project further and the project file will be closed..."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">11.    However, Mr. Rajeeve Mehra, learned ASG who appears for
respondent No. l states that respondent No.2 relies upon clarification dated
21st October, 2009 on the subject matter of "Environmental Clearance to
Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Projects- Reg." issued by the respondent
No.1 to contend that in case the built-up area of a project or activity is &gt;
20,000 sq. mts., then irrespective of the nature of the project or activity, the
project or activity would require EC under Item 8(a) and 8(b) of the
Schedule to the EIA Notification 2006 i.e. "Building and Construction


WP(C) 2066/2014                                                      page 5 of 7
 Projects" and "Township and Area Development Projects".
</p><p id="p_13">12.    Mr. Manjeet Singh, Additional AG for respondent No. 2 states that
though the said respondent has raised preliminary objection to the
maintainability of the present writ petition, yet it supports an amicable
resolution of the disputes. He states that if the legality and validity of the
EIA Notification 2006 is upheld and the petitioner as well as its directors
undertake that the petitioner shall obtain ex-post facto EC and comply with
the terms and conditions stipulated in the EC as well as further undertake to
obtain EC for all their future projects in Haryana, the said respondent would
consider not initiating any criminal action against the petitioner and/or its
board members/officials for not procuring prior EC with regard to the
present project being executed by the petitioner in the State of Haryana.
</p><p id="p_14">13.    In rejoinder, the petitioner submits that the circular clearly pertains to
SEZs and does not in any way, support the respondent No.2's view that all
projects and activities having a built-up area of &gt; 20,000 sq. mts.,
irrespective of the nature of the project or activity, would require EC.
</p><p id="p_15">14.    Having heard learned counsel for parties, this Court is of the view that
the EIA Notification 2006 applies to all projects with a built up area of &gt;
20,000 sq. mts. irrespective of the nature of the project or activity. Omission
of some words/expressions from the draft EIA Notification 2006, which are
superfluous, would not assist the petitioners. Moreover, deletion of
words/expressions from a draft Notification is not equivalent to a deletion of
words/expressions from an existing statute or Notification. Also internal
notings of Government officials cannot be a guide to interpretation when the
Notification is otherwise free from ambiguity.
</p>



<p id="p_16">WP(C) 2066/2014                                                      page 6 of 7
</p><p id="p_17"> 15.    However, in the present case, petitioner cannot be said to have acted
with malafide intent in not applying for prior EC as firstly there was no
authoritative judgment on the said issue and secondly, upon the petitioner
being asked to seek prior EC, despite its bonafide belief that EIA
Notification 2006 was not applicable to its projects, did in fact apply for EC
in compliance with HSPCB direction for its projects in Haryana as far back
as 14th February, 2013, i.e., prior to filing of the present writ petition.
</p><p id="p_18">16.    In any event, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for petitioner
undertakes that petitioner shall obtain ex post facto EC and comply with all
terms and conditions stipulated by the EC as well as obtain necessary EC for
all its future projects in Haryana. The statement made by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi
is accepted by this Court and petitioner as well as its Board of Directors are
held bound by the same. Accordingly, this Court is of the view that the ends
of justice would be met in the present instance by directing respondent No.2
to consider petitioner's application for grant of ex post facto EC for its
projects in Haryana.
</p><p id="p_19">17.    Also, upon perusal of the paper book, it transpires that in the 29th
Meeting of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, Haryana
held on 2nd July, 2010 under similar facts and circumstances respondent No.
2 itself was of the view that no prosecution under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_8">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_9">19</a> of the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 be initiated. The relevant portion of the
Item No. 10 of the Minutes of aforementioned meeting reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "The SEAC has considered this case and appointed a Sub-Committee
      also which did not recommend the prosecution in view of the
      circumstances of the case. The SEAC accordingly agreeing with the
      report of the Sub-Committee did not recommend any prosecution in
      this case."
</blockquote>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11"> 18.     Consequently, the respondents are directed not to initiate any criminal
action against the petitioner and/or its Board Member/officials. This Court
once again reiterates that present order has been passed on the peculiar facts
and circumstances of this case and the same shall not be treated as a
precedent. With the aforesaid observations, present writ petition and
application are disposed of.
