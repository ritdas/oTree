Government for notification of SEZ by the Ministry of

Commerce, Government of India; that Hyderabad, being the

Bulk Drugs Manufacturing Hub of the country, there was a

possibility of attracting large scale investments in this sector,

thereby generating employment in this backward district of

Mahaboob Nagar known for migration of labour and hence,

such a proposal was considered appropriate and accordingly

action was taken by APIIC to initiate the formalities for SEZ

notification; that 954 acre land was earmarked from Green

Industrial Park and out of which 250 acre of land for the SEZ

in Jadcherla was acquired under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_10">Land Acquisition Act</a> at

a rate of Rs.50,000/- per acre in 2004-05 by APIIC and the

development of Infrastructure was yet to be started for SEZ

when land was allotted to the first allottees. When enquired

about procedure to be followed for allotment of lands by APIIC

Limited to entrepreneurs either on outright sale basis or on

lease   basis   along   with   relevant   guidelines      issued        by

Government of AP / APLLIC Limited, Shri Acharya stated

that, normally, the allotments made by APIIC in Industrial

Parks are on freehold basis wherein the land cost is collected

upfront and after implementation of the project, Sale Deed is
                                10                                  Dr.SSRB,J

registered in the name of the allottee; that, in case of SEZs,

this was not applicable; that as per Section 51(1) of SEZ Act,

2005, the provisions of the SEZ Act supersede all other acts

and rules as the SEZ land cannot be allotted on freehold

basis and it should be with the Developer; that in the present

case, APIIC is the Developer and hence APIIC allotment

regulations had to be modified accordingly; that for SEZs, it

was decided to adopt the practice of collecting a lease

premium initially to be paid Upfront by the Lessee and

Annual Lease Rental thereon for a period of 33 years and this

procedure was unanimously decided by the Board of APIIC

Limited. when enquired about the procedure of fixation of

price for allotment of lands in various industrial areas

developed by APIIC Limited, Shri Acharya stated that the

price fixation committee comprising senior officers of APIIC

Limited headed by the Executive Director, is an internal

committee appointed by the Managing Director of APIIC, to

recommend benchmarks for price fixation, duly considering

land   cost,   development    cost   of   external     &amp;      internal

Infrastructure such as approach road, internal roads, water &amp;

power supply, effluent disposal, compound wall, etc.; that

Price Fixation Committee is only a recommending body, the

Board of APIIC has delegated full powers to the Managing

Director regarding fixation of price for sale of land in the very

first resolution passed in January, 1974; that more often

than not, the Managing Director uses the price recommended
                                 11                                    Dr.SSRB,J

by price fixation committee as an indicative price and takes a

decision about the price keeping in view several factors such

as    current   state   of   development   of     internal/external

infrastructure, importance of investment and the possibility

of attracting further investments to the cluster; that as per

the normal practice, in the rate recommended by price

fixation committee, the land cost accounts for 30% and

development cost of infrastructure contributes to 70% of the

price fixed; that the price fixation committee recommended

the rate of Rs.15 Lakh Per Acre in August 2006 in respect of

Green Industrial Park where land can be allotted on Out-right

sale or freehold basis and not for the formulation SEZ in

which land can be allotted only on lease basis as per the SEZ

Act, 2005; that for SEZs, it was decided to adopt the practice

of collecting a lease premium initially to be paid upfront by

the lessee and annual lease rental thereon for a period of 33

years and that this system was applicable to the allotments

made to M/s Hetero Drugs Limited and M/s Aurubindo

Pharma Limited at Jadcherla and the price recommended by

the price fixation committee for the Green Industrial Park was

not at all relevant or applicable; that the Plot Allotment

Committee headed by the Managing Director takes a decision

regarding allotment of Plots for Industrial Parks located in

and    around    Hyderabad;     that   normally      the      allotment

committee takes a decision considering the importance of the

project, etc., but, this was not applicable to SEZs. When
                              12                                 Dr.SSRB,J

enquired about as to whether any notification/ advertisement

was published in newspapers regarding allotment of lands in

Jadcherla, Shri Acharya stated that the development of SEZ

was highlighted by APIIC in the advertisements issued on the

occasion of the foundation day and other promotional

programmes on SEZs and sufficient awareness was created

all over the country about the new SEZ on formulation, first

of its kind in India ; that BDMA also publicized it among its

members asking them to seek allotment in this SEZ; that the

applications of M/s Hetero Drugs Limited, M/s Aurobindo

Pharma Limited were the first applications received for

allotment of land by APIIC Limited duly fulfilling all the

requisite conditions and hence they were treated as anchor

investors; that the application of M/s Lee Pharma which was

received afterwards was not accompanied by the mandatory

Earnst Money Deposit (EMD) and even then, a decision was

taken to offer the land at a lease premium of Rs.10 Lakh per

Acre duly treating as early bird incentive; that the required

payment was not made by M/s Lee Pharma and thus

allotment was not finalised for the said company and other

Pharma companies such as M/s Glochem applied for

allotment apart from other companies; that the Plot Allotment

Committee did not look into allotments in SEZs and thus

there was no need to place the allotments to plot allotment

Committee for the allotment of lands to M/s Hetero Drugs

Limited and M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited. When enquired
                                13                                  Dr.SSRB,J

about basis for allotment of land of 75 Acre each to M/s

Hetero Drugs Limited and M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited

without any justification for such huge lands, Shri Acharya

stated that based on the investment plans presented by M/s

Hetero Drugs Limited and M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited,

wherein they planned to invest around Rs.500 Crore each

with global tie up, they had requested to allot 125 acre of land

each in the 250 acre SEZ at Jadcherla; that, in order to

maximize returns to APIIC by allotting to other investors in

future at higher rate, a decision was taken to restrict the

allotment to 75 acre of land to each which was quite justified

in view of the environmental requirements of retaining open

area, etc. When enquired about various steps taken in

safeguarding the interest of M/s APIIC Limited as VC &amp; MD of

M/s APIIC Limited in allotment of land to M/s Hetero Drugs

Limited and M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited and transfer of

lands to M/s Trident Life Sciences in SEZ, Jadcherla, Shri

Acharya stated that all steps were taken to protect the

interest of APIIC Limited and land leased could be resumed as

per lease conditions if the lessee failed to implement the

project.   When     enquired        the   persons      who          gave

directions/suggestions for fixing the land cost @ Rs. 7 lakh

per acre for allotment to M/s Hetero Drugs Limited and M/s

Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Shri Acharya stated that based

on the prevailing status of the development of infrastructure

and the price of land available in the surrounding areas, the
                                14                                 Dr.SSRB,J

development wing of the office arrived at a reasonable lease

the promoter of the original company, he marked their

application to process accordingly; that, subsequently, when

the proposal was put up after due scrutiny by the

development wing, he cited the recent precedent M/s

Zenotech in Bio Tech Park and asked to collect nominal

processing fee, as per the practice followed by APIIC Limited,

as per Circular No.347/DW/206 dated 29.06.2006 issued by

APIIC wherein it was prescribed that land can be transferred

within the family members or to subsidiaries by colleting

nominal process fee; that, however, if the applicant had

suppressed any facts or failed to submit any documents to

the Zonal Manager who was asked by the Head Office to

scrutinize the request before transfer of land, it is the

responsibility of the Zonal Manager concerned (Shri YVL

Prasad) to verify the same and in no way the Head Office or

Managing Director is responsible for any lapse in this regard

and that M/s Trident Life Sciences Limited was subsequently

merged in M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited. When enquired

specifically about the remarks viz. 'Pl. process for change' on

representation dated 02.11.2006 of Shri K Nityananda Reddy

without obtaining any proof whether the proposed company

M/s Trident Life Sciences Limited is a wholly owned

subsidiary of M/s Aurobindo Pharma Limited or not", Shri

land was transferred to M/s Trident Life Sciences Limited by

M/s   APIIC   Limited   without    any   application       for     such

allotment. The actual allotment was done in favour of M/s

Aurobindo Pharma Limited and subsequent to the allotment,

violating the norms of allotment, the subject land was

transferred in favour of M/s Trident Life Sciences Limited,

which is ex-facie illegal. Hence, it is clear that Shri B.P.

dated 08.10.2013, conveyed the fact of refusal of sanction

under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_31">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. to the Secretary, DoPT, while

recommending the same to the Government of India to refuse

sanction of prosecution under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_32">Prevention of Corruption

the prosecution under PML Act since same is independent

and that too as submitted supra no sanction to prosecute is

required under Sections 3 &amp; 4 of PML Act and the contra

contentions in the quash petition are incorrect and not

forwarded the application of M/s Indu Tech Zone Limited for

          came to be committed. It is far different from saying

</p><p id="p_74">           The nexus between the discharge of the public

     public duty by a public servant and the legitimate and
     bona fide grievance of an aggrieved person. Sometimes
     while discharging or purported to discharge the public

appropriate Government is an assurance to a public
servant to discharge his official functions diligently,
efficiently and honestly without fear or favour, without
having haunt of later harassment and victimization, so
that he would serve his best in the interest of the
public. The offending act must be integrally connected
with the discharge of duty and should not be fanciful
or pretended. If the act complained of is directly, and
inextricably connected with the official duty, though it
was done negligently, or in dereliction of duty or in
excess thereof, <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_93">Section 197</a> and similar provisions
operate as a canopy against malicious, vexatious or
frivolous accusation or prosecution at the hands of the
aggrieved persons. It is well settled law that public
servant can only be said to act or purported to act in
the discharge of his official duty if his act or omission
is such as to lie within the of his official duty, It is not
every offence committed by a public servant that
requires sanction for Prosecution, nor even every act
done by him while he actually engaged or purported to
have engaged under colour of his official duty that
receives protection from prosecution. If questioned he
must claim that he had done by virtue of office and it
is inextricably connected with the duty.
</p><p id="p_75">      Sanction then would be necessary, irrespective
of whether it was in fact a proper discharge of his duty
or not is a matter of defence on merits, which would be
considered at the trial and could not arise at the time
of grant of sanction which must precede taking
cognizance of the prosecution. Therefore, there must
be reasonable connection between the acts complained
and discharge or purported discharge of the official
duty, the act or omission must bear such a relation to
the duty that the accused could lay reasonable, nexus
between the offending act or omission and the duty
but not a pretended or fanciful claim that he did it in
the course of the performance of his duty. It is no part

preferred appeal before the Supreme Court against said writ

petition went unsuccessful therein also, thereby estopped

from questioning of maintainability of the writ petition and it

is also stated the contention of he was not discharging official

duties is not correct so also of the allegation of he is

responsible for the alleged illegal benefits to the India

Cements in the form of allocation of water without referring to

the Inter State Water Resources Authority for same is

factually incorrect as in case of water for Krishna river due

consultation was done with CE, ISWR and so far as Kagna

river (not a tributary of Krishna) when queried of necessity of

such consultations in the absence of rule/order mandating

reference to ISWR and getting no reply of existence of any rule

or order of compulsory consultation with ISWR and in view of

the fact of State policy to adopt single window through State

Investment Promotion Board (SIPB) reserving 10% water for

industrial use coupled with deemed to have approved

provisions if any approved in 7 days makes clear that prior

consultation with ISWRA not mandatory and after taking the

views of Advisor to the department the recommendations of

CM through Minister concerned made as per Business rules

and there is no undue favour nor undue haste nor violation of

procedure taken place and contra allegations are baseless so

also any allegation of abusing his position in the allocation of

water for same is far from truth and factually incorrect

companies for allocation of water kept pending not correct,

though it is mentioned that he never contended of sanction

necessary for prosecuting public servant under PML Act it is

as referred supra taken as an additional ground of sanction is

mandatory    and   pre-requisite.   He   also    referred          about

G.O.Ms.No.201 dated 01.12.1995, the Government of Andhra

Pradesh constituted State Level Promotion Board and whose

decisions are the cabinet decisions as per Rule 26 of AP

Secretariat Business Rules and SIPB by resolution dated

18.11.2000 resolved to make available 10% of water for

existing projects and later on 23.05.2001 SIPB supra decided

to keep its decisions out of the scrutiny of the ACB and

Vigilance Departments and in 2003 SIPB made CE Irrigation

as competent to give water allocation and directed the request

to special amenities like water and electricity should be

decided in 7 days and otherwise would be deemed to have

approved and as per G.O.Ms.No.178 dated 21.06.2005 the

industrial policy of the State of AP to allocate water to a tune

of 10% to the use of industrial use for existing as well as

future projects. The water allocation in Krishna river as per

the recommendation contained in Bachavat River Water

Tribunal and the allotment of Kagna basin is governed by

recommendations of Bachavat Tribunal, where under AP's

share was limited to 6 TMC as river Kagna is a minor stream

and it is tributary to River Bheema and not of Krishna and as

per G.O.Ms.No.195 dated 22.03.1979 for rivers other than

Krishna and Godavari and its tributaries, the CE Minor

Irrigation is the authority designated to deal with the streams

and rivers which are not Inter State Rivers and thereby the

water allocation was as per procedure prescribed and not by

any violations. The Advisors of the Government over see the

functions     of        the   Advisory        Committee     and       give      their

suggestions and feed back on technical matters constituted

and the petitioner followed by the procedure laid down by the

SIPB and the industrial policy enumerated in G.O.Ms.No.178

dated 21.06.2005 and contra allegations in the counter are

baseless. The counter affidavit by the Assistant Director to

the additional ground on want of sanction is nothing new to

what is there in the counter affidavit averments in the other 2

quash petitions referring to proposition and provisions in

saying   no    sanction         is   required     for    the    contention           of

nothing beyond and as per the Government policy exercised

resolution dated 18.12.2000 to make available 10% of water

for existing projects and SIPB decided on 23.05.2001 to keep

its decisions out of scrutiny particularly ACB and Vigilance

merit at the highest level by the Minister concerned with the

conference of the CM and no error found in Inter State Water

Resources by Chief Engineer ISWRA in the said allotment and

that too when it is a renewal of the old allotment with extra

quantity from Krishna and Kagna rivers to India cements and

that too from the proposal came from Superintending

Engineer, Irrigation Circle after arrears realized of the water

royalty, for no involvement of money laundering much less

with intention or knowledge much less commission of money

laundering or aiding or abetting any others to have benefit

and sanction for prosecution refused by Central and State

Governments to the CBI of PC Act and IPC offences

respectively earlier sought by CBI against the petitioner from

the say of no any irregularity and no loss to the Government,

that required to be considered with reference to any offence of

money laundering defined in Section 3 of the Act which

speaks whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or

knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is actually

involved in any process or activity connected with the

proceeds of crime and projecting or claiming it as untainted

property shall be guilty of offence of money-laundering that is

punishable under Section 4 of the Act with different

punishments for the advance specified in Part-A of the

departments involved and the Minister concerned or the

cabinet committee that have taken the decisions and there is

no any offence of money laundering committed by him and

      The Preamble with statement of objects and reasons of the
<a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_159">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act</a>, 2002 (Act, No.15 of 2003) is
as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_125">      "The Statement of Objects and Reasons: It is being
realized, world over, that money-laundering poses a serious threat
not only to the financial systems of countries, but also to their
                                    58                                Dr.SSRB,J

integrity and sovereignty. Some of the initiatives taken by the
international community to obviate such threat are outlined below:


</p><p id="p_126">      (a) The United National Convention Against Illicit Traffic in
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, to which India is a
party, calls for preventing of laundering of proceeds of drug crimes
and other connected activities and confiscation of proceeds derived
from such offence.
</p>
<p id="p_127">      (b) The Basle Statement of Principles, enunciated in 1989,
outlined basic policies and procedures that banks should follow in
order to assist the law enforcement agencies in tackling the
problem of money laundering.
</p>
<p id="p_128">      (c) <a href="/doc/231604/" id="a_160">The Financial Act</a>ion Task Force held in Paris from 14 to
16 July, 1989, to examine the problem of money-laundering has
made forty recommendations, which provide the foundation
material for comprehensive legislation to combat the problem of
money-laundering. The recommendations were classified under
various heads. Some of the important heads are-----

</p><p id="p_129">(i) declaration of laundering of monies earned through serious
crimes, a criminal offence;
</p>
<p id="p_130">(ii) to work out modalities of disclosure by financial institutions
regarding reportable transactions;
</p>
<p id="p_131">(iii) confiscation of the proceeds of crime;

</p><p id="p_132">(iv) declaring money-laundering to be an extraditable offence; and

</p><p id="p_133">(v) promoting international co-operation in investigation of money-
laundering.
</p>
<p id="p_134">      (d) The Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action
adopted by United Nations General Assembly by its Resolution
No.S-17/2 of 23 February, 1990, inter alia, calls upon the member
States to develop mechanism to prevent financial institutions from
being used for laundering of drug related money and enactment of
legislation to prevent such laundering.

</p><p id="p_135">      (e) The United Nations in the Special session on Countering
World Drug Problem together concluded on 8 to 10June, 1998, has
                                     59                                   Dr.SSRB,J

made another declaration regarding the need to combat money-
laundering. India is a signatory to this declaration.

</p><p id="p_136">        In view of an urgent need for the enactment of a
comprehensive legislation inter alia, for preventing money-
laundering and connected activities, confiscation of proceeds
of     crime,   setting   up   of   agencies   and   mechanisms              for
coordinating measures for combating money-laundering, etc.,
the Prevention of Money-laundering Bill, 1998 was introduced
in the Lok Sabha on the 4th August, 1998. The Bill was
referred to the Standing committee on Finance, which
presented its report on the 4th March, 1999 to the Lok Sabha.

</p><p id="p_137">        The recommendations of Standing Committee accepted by

definition of money-laundering;

<p id="p_141">        (d) The banking companies, financial institutions and
intermediaries should be required to furnish information of
transactions to the director instead of Commissioner of Income-
tax;
</p>
<p id="p_142">        (e) The banking companies should also be brought within the
ambit of clause II relating to obligations of financial institutions
and intermediaries;
</p>
<p id="p_143">        (f) a definite time-limit of 24 hours should be provided for
producing a person about to be searched or arrested before the
gazetted officer or Magistrate;

Tribunal, by reason of his death, resignation or otherwise, the
senior most member shall act as the Chairperson till the date on
which a new Chairperson appointed in accordance with the
provisions of this Act to fill the vacancy, enters upon his office;

information may be enhanced from three months imprisonment to
two years imprisonment, or find of rupees ten thousand to find or
rupees fifty thousand or both;
</p>
<p id="p_149">      (k) the word 'good faith' may be incorporated in the
clause relating to bar of legal proceedings.

</p><p id="p_150">      The Central Government have broadly accepted the above
recommendations       and     made      provisions      of      the        said
recommendations in the Bill.
</p>
<p id="p_151">      In addition to above recommendations of the Standing
Committee, the Central Government proposes to:

</p><p id="p_152">      (a) relax the conditions prescribed for grant of bail so that
the Court may grant bail to a person who is below sixteen years of
age, or woman, or sick or infirm

</p><p id="p_153">      (b) levy of fine/penalty for default of non-compliance of the
issue of summons, etc.

</p><p id="p_154">      (c) make provisions for having reciprocal arrangement for
assistance in certain matters and procedure for attachment and
confiscation of property so as to facilitate the transfer of funds
involved in money-laundering kept outside the country and
extradition of the accused persons from abroad. The Bill seeks to
achieve the above objects.
</p>
<p id="p_155">      From the above, it is clear that the law seeks to prevent
money-laundering which in plain terms means the preventing
legitimizing    of   the   money    earned    through        illegal       and
criminal activities by investments in movable and immovable
                                   61                                     Dr.SSRB,J

properties. The need for a law on the subject has been the focus
of the Government world over in recent times and that of the U.N.
also, because the scourge of money-laundering has threatened to
wreck the foundations of the States and undermine their
sovereignty even. The terrorist outfits and smuggling gangs have
been depending upon money laundering to finance their operations
and it is known that money for such operations are arranged
through laundering. Many such illegal outfits have set up
ostensibly legal front organization. The money generated through
illegal activities is ultimately inducted and integrated with
legitimate money and its species like movable and immovable
property. Thus certain economic offences, commercial frauds,
crimes   like   murder,   extortion    have   contributed      to     money-
laundering in a significant manner. The perpetrators of such
heinous crimes should not be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the
money that passed under the activity and therefore the present
enactment is intended to deprive the property which is related to
the proceeds of specific crimes listed in the Schedule to the Act."

The provisions<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_225"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of

<p id="p_248">      On the afore-stated scheme and from the provisions of the

thereby separate procedures contemplated even in relation thereto
for the reason either these two sets of proceedings may be initiated
against the same person if he is accused of the offence of money-
laundering or any one out of the two sets of proceedings. Thus,
even when a person is not so accused, the property in his
possession    may    be   proceeded     against   for    attachment           and
confiscation, on a satisfaction by the appropriate and competent
authority that such property constitutes proceeds of crime.

laundering, the provisions of the Act contemplate two sets of
proceedings; (a) prosecution for the offence of money-laundering
defined in Sec.3 with the punishment provided in Sec.4; and (b)
attachment, adjudication and confiscation in the sequential steps
and subject to the conditions and procedures enumerated in

Chapter III of the Act and out of the two now we are concerned
with the first set of the proceedings for prosecution covered by the
offence of money laundering as ascribed in <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_227">Sections 3</a> r/w 2(p) of
the Act in an expansive locus as comprehending direct or indirect
attempt to indulge; assist, be a party to or actually involved
knowingly in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of
the crime and projecting it as untainted property and on proof of
guilt for punishment of the offenders of Money-Laundering, as
provided in <a href="/doc/1182345/" id="a_228">Section 4</a> of the Act, that would follow after a due
cognizance of the offence with pre-trial enquiry if any and trial by
the Special Court; which is conferred exclusive jurisdiction qua

criminal sanction administered by the Legislation and effectuated
by a deprivation of personal liberty as a disincentive to a

proceeds of crime are sequentially transferred through
several transactions, in favour of a series of individuals
having no knowledge or information as to the criminality
antecedent to the property; the authorities may proceed
against each and all of such sequential transactions,
thus bringing within the vortex of Chapter-III of the Act,
all the properties involved in several transactions.
<a href="/doc/969613/" id="a_231">Section 8(1)</a> clearly postulates affording of an opportunity
to a person in possession of proceeds of crime to indicate
the sources of his income, earnings or assets; out of
which or by means of which he has acquired the property
attached, under <a href="/doc/774308/" id="a_232">Section 5(1)</a> or seized under <a href="/doc/690830/" id="a_233">Sections 17</a>
or 18 the evidence on which he relies and other relevant
information and particulars. It is therefore clear that
where a property is provisionally attached under <a href="/doc/838793/" id="a_234">Section
5</a>, the person in possession of such property may avail
the opportunity under <a href="/doc/449543/" id="a_235">Section 8</a> to indicate/establish
that he has acquired the property attached (prima facie
the proceeds of crime) out of his lawful earnings or
assets, that he has the means to do so, and that his
acquisition is therefore legitimate, bona fide and at fair
market value of such property; and that the value paid
for acquisition of the property and not the property in his
possession that constitutes proceeds of crime, if at all.
On such showing, to the satisfaction of the adjudicating
authority, it would perhaps be not the property in
possession of a person but the fair value for which he
has acquired the property and paid to the transferor that
constitutes proceeds of crime and the authorities may
have to proceed against the property or value in the
hands of the transferor.

are proved to be involving in money-laundering, then for
the purposes of adjudication or confiscation under
Chapter-III, the Act enjoins a rebuttable presumption
that the remaining transactions form part of such
interconnected transactions.
</p>
<p id="p_255">From the scheme of the provisions of the Act, it is
apparent that, a person accused of an offence under
<a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_239">Section 3</a> of the Act whose property is attached and
proceeded    against    for   confiscation   must    advisedly
indicate the sources of his income, earnings or assets,
out of which or means by which he has acquired the
property attached, to discharge the burden (<a href="/doc/519998/" id="a_240">Section 24</a>)
that the property does not constitute proceeds of crime.
Where a transaction of acquisition of property is part of
inter-connected transactions, the onus of establishing
that the property acquired is not connected to the
activity of money-laundering, is on the person in
ownership, control or possession of the property, though
not accused of a <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_241">Section 3</a> offence, provided one or more
of the interconnected transactions is or are proved to be
involved in money-laundering (<a href="/doc/424628/" id="a_242">Section 23</a>).

It further requires to be noticed that not only from the
second proviso to <a href="/doc/1080526/" id="a_243">Section 9</a> of the Act but on general
principles of law as well, a person deprived of the
property in his ownership, control or possession on
account of confiscation proceedings under the Act, has a
right of action against the transferor of such property to
recover the value of the property.

<p id="p_256">In the context of the fact that money-laundering is

countries across the globe and to their integrity and

confiscation of the proceeds of crime is conceived to be
the appropriate legislative strategy; and given the several
safeguards      procedural       and   substantive     alluded        to
hereinbefore, we are not persuaded to the view that
attachment and confiscation of property constituting
proceeds of crime in the possession of a person not
accused/charged       of    an     offence   under      <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_244">Section         3</a>
constitutes an arbitrary or unconstitutional legislative
prescription.
</p>
<p id="p_257">The contention that the definition of "proceeds of crime"
[<a href="/doc/564136/" id="a_245">Section 2(u)</a>] is too broad and is therefore arbitrary and
invalid since it subjects even property acquired, derived
or in the possession of a person not accused, connected
or associated in any manner with a crime and thus
places innocent persons in jeopardy, is a contention that
also does not merit acceptance. In Attorney General for
India   and     others     Vs.    Amratlal   Prajivandas           and
others [1994] 5.SCC 54, a Constitution Bench of the
Supreme Court considering the validity of provisions of
the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators
(Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 (SAFEMA) observed:

 "The relatives and associates are brought in only for
 the purpose of ensuring that the illegally acquired
 properties of the convict or detenu, acquired or kept in
 their names, do not escape the net of the Act. It is a
 well-known fact that persons indulging in illegal
 activities screen the properties acquired from such
 illegal activity in the names of their relatives and
 associates. Sometimes they transfer such properties to
 them, may be, with intent to transfer the ownership
 and title. In fact, it is immaterial how such relative or
 associate holds the properties of convict/detenu -
 whether as a Benami or as a mere name-lender or as a
 bona fide transferee for value or in any other manner.
 He cannot claim those properties and must surrender
 them to the State under the Act. Since he is a relative
                                  78                                       Dr.SSRB,J

or associate, as defined by the Act, he cannot put
forward any defence once it is proved that that
property was acquired by the detenu - whether in his
own name or in the name of his relatives and
associates. The Court further observed : By way of
illustration, take a case where a convict/detenu
purchases a property in the name of his relative or
associate - it does not matter whether he intends such
a person to be a mere name lender or whether he
really intends that such person shall be the real owner
and/or possessor thereof - or gifts away or otherwise
transfers his properties in favour of any of his relatives
or associates, or purports to sell them to any of his
relatives or associates - in all such cases, all the said
transactions   will   be   ignored        and   the      properties
forfeited   unless       the      convict/detenu           or       his
relative/associate, as the case may be, establishes that
such property or properties are not "illegally acquired
properties" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_246">Section 3(c)</a>. In this
view of the matter, there is no basis for the
apprehension      that     the        independently        acquired
properties of such relatives and associates will also be
forfeited even if they are in no way connected with the
convict/detenu. So far as the holders (not being
relatives   and    associates)         mentioned        in <a href="/doc/376538/" id="a_247">Section
2(2)(e)</a> are concerned, they are dealt with on a
separate footing. If such person proves that he is a
transferee in good faith for consideration, his property
</p><p id="p_258">- even though purchased from a convict/detenu - is
not liable to be forfeited. It is equally necessary to
reiterate that the burden of establishing that the
properties mentioned in the show-cause notice issued
under <a href="/doc/600637/" id="a_248">Section 6</a>, and which are held on that date by a
relative or an associate of the convict/detenu, are not
the illegally acquired properties of the convict/detenu,
lies upon such relative/associate. He must establish
                             79                                      Dr.SSRB,J

that the said property has not been acquired with the
monies or assets provided by the detenu/convict or
that they in fact did not or do not belong to such
detenu/convict.
</p>
<p id="p_259">The Supreme Court concluded: The application of
SAFEMA to the relatives and associates [in clauses (c)
and (d) of <a href="/doc/376538/" id="a_249">Section 2(2)</a>] is equally valid and effective
inasmuch as the purpose and object of bringing such
persons within the net of SAFEMA is to reach the
properties of the detenu or convict, as the case may
be, wherever they are, howsoever they are held and by
whomsoever they are held. They are not conceived with
a view to forfeit the independent properties of such
relatives and associates as explained in this judgment.
SAFEMA     targets   for   forfeiture   'illegally   acquired
property' of a person (defined as a convict or detenu
under specified enactments and relative or associate of
such convict or detenu (the expression relative or
associate also defined)). This is a 1976 enactment that
provides for forfeiture of illegally acquired properties of
smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators. <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_250">The
Act</a>, on the other hand, specifically targets the wider
pathology of money-laundering in relation to a large
number of scheduled offences enumerated from a
variety of specified legislations. In the context of the
objects sought to be achieved by the Act and the
specificity of the definitions of the expressions "money-
laundering" and "proceeds of crime"; the inherence of
the burden of proof on a person accused of an offence
under Section 3 (Section 24) and the presumptions
in inter-connected transactions (<a href="/doc/424628/" id="a_251">Section 23</a>), it is clear
that what is targeted for confiscation is proceeds of
crime in the ownership, control or possession of any
person and not all property or proceeds of all crime in
the ownership, control or possession of any person.

 Psychotropic substances Act, 1985, <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_253">(NDPS Act</a>, 1985),
 prior to its amendment by <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_254">Central Act</a> 9 of 2001 fell for
 the consideration of the Supreme Court. Dealing with
 the challenge the Supreme Court observed: "...The
 purported object for which such a statute has been
 enacted must be noticed in interpreting the provisions
 thereof. The nexus of huge amount of money generated
 by drug trafficking and the purpose for which they are
 spent    is    well   known   ...     Necessity    was    felt    for
 introduction of strict measures so that money earned
 from the drug trafficking by the persons concerned
 may not continue to be invested, inter alia, by
 purchasing moveable or immoveable properties not
 only in his own name but also in the names of his near
 relatives." In Heena Kausar (supra) interpreting similar
 provisions in Chapter VA of the NDPS Act, 1985, the
 Apex Court pointed out that the property sought to be
 forfeited must be one which has a direct nexus with
 the income, etc, derived by way of contravention of any
 of the provisions of the Act or any property acquired
 therefrom. The Court explained that the meaning of
 "identification of such property" (a phrase employed in
 <a href="/doc/1833560/" id="a_255">Section 68</a> - E of Chapter VA), is that the property was
 derived from or used in the illicit traffic.

The SAFEMA; <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_256">The NDPS Act</a>, 1985; The Prevention of
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_257">Psychotropic

targets the perceived evil of money-laundering. The
category of offences enumerated in Parts A, B and C of
the Schedule of the Act elucidate the legislative intent
that the several offences and the unlawful gains/wealth
derived therefrom by malfeasant(s) are targeted and
confiscated, including from others when the property
being the derivative of criminal activity is laundered
through one or more layered transactions and finds its
way to the ownership, control or possession of non-
offenders as well; but in respect of scheduled offences.

The object of the Act is to prevent money - laundering
and connected activities and confiscation of "proceeds of
crime" and preventing legitimising of the money earned
through illegal and criminal activities by investments in
moveable and immoveable properties often involving
layering of the money generated through illegal activities,
i.e., by inducting and integrating the money with
legitimate money and its species like moveable and
immovable property. Therefore, it is that the Act defines
the expression "proceeds of crime" expansively to sub-
serve the broad objectives of the Act. We thus do not find
any      infirmity    in     the       provisions         of       the
Act.*****************************

As we have observed earlier in this judgment in another
context, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_260">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/838793/" id="a_261">5</a>, <a href="/doc/449543/" id="a_262">8</a>, <a href="/doc/424628/" id="a_263">23</a> and
<a href="/doc/519998/" id="a_264">24</a> are   also   inter-related    provisions    and       must        be
considered as components of a statutory symphony that
elucidate the true scope of the onus probandi and the
burden of proof. ****************

In Raghavanna v. Chenchamma AIR 1964 SC 136 ,
Subba Rao, J (as his Lordship then was) again explained
the   distinction    between         burden   of      proof       and
onus:...There is an essential distinction between burden
of proof and onus of proof: burden of proof lies upon the
person who has to prove a fact and it never shifts, but
                                  82                                   Dr.SSRB,J

    the onus of proof shifts. The burden of proof in the
    present case, undoubtedly lies upon the plaintiff to
    establish the factum of adoption and that of partition.
    The said circumstances do not alter the incidence of the
    burden of proof. Such considerations, having regard to
    the circumstances of a particular case, may shift the
    onus of proof. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous
    process in the evaluation of evidence. *****************."

   Thus, but for <a href="/doc/54577816/" id="a_265">Section 45(1)(ii)</a> of the Act, where from the Public
Prosecutor on notice once opposes the application for bail, bail
cannot be granted to accused of the offence under <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_266">Section 3</a> of the
Act unless the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds
believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not
likely to commit any offence while on bail, is struck down to the
above extent by the Apex Court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah supra
as per law as on date, all other provisions of the Act with
amendments in 2005 and 2009 are held constitutionally valid.

   It is also made clear from the discussion supra that for the
offence under <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_267">Section 3</a> of the Act, mensrea is an essential
component from attribution of knowledge and there from burden to
prove his innocence and of acted in good faith and without

speaks         that   <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_271">Cr.P.C</a>.   provisions   are   applicable        to     the

proceedings before the Special Court. From what <a href="/doc/1724556/" id="a_272">Section 46</a>

reproduced supra, <a href="/doc/280593/" id="a_273">Section 46(1)</a> from the very wording supra

of save as otherwise provided in this Act the provisions of the

code in entirety which includes provisions as to bails or

bonds shall apply to the proceedings before the special Court

and for the purpose of said provisions the special Court shall

be deemed to a Court of Session. Thus <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_274">Cr.P.C</a>. is applicable

to the proceedings before the special Court save as otherwise

specifically provided in the Act if not inconsistent therewith in

the Act or anything inconsistent therewith to prevail to the

extent the Act provisions specifically provided as special law

taking away of the application of the <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_275">Cr.P.C</a>. provisions.

Thus, the Act provisions are applicable in addition to and not

in derogation to what is specially provided in the Act.

Cr.P.C. and the provisions of the SC &amp; ST (POA) Act that

<a href="/doc/1182345/" id="a_294">Section 4(2)</a> makes it clear that subject to provisions of other

enactment, all offences under other laws shall also be

investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with

under the provisions of the code to mean if any enactment

contained any provisions which is contrary to the code such

other provision would apply in place of particular provisions

of the code and if there is no such contrary provision in other

laws then the provisions of the code would apply to the

matters covered thereby as held in Para 16 by AR Antulay

supra by the Constitution Bench of the Apex court and also

as held in Para 128 of Deepak Mahajan supra by making

clear that it only relates to the extent application of the code

where there is no contrary provision in the special Act or any

special provision excluding the application of the code by the

special Act. Thus as referred supra of <a href="/doc/1573779/" id="a_295">Section 71</a> of the Act is

nothing new to <a href="/doc/1182345/" id="a_296">Section 4(2)</a> of the code and from the reading

application of the code in the PML Act from the provisions

the Act are inconsistent to the code to apply with reference to

<p id="p_264">     11. Before undertaking further discussion, coming back

to the other provisions of the Act, <a href="/doc/1970028/" id="a_299">Section 44(1)(b)</a> speaks that

notwithstanding anything contained in <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_300">Cr.P.C</a>. the special

Court may upon complaint made by an authority authorized

in this behalf by the Act take cognizance of the offence under

<a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_301">Section 3</a> without accused is committed to it for trial. The

special Court's power of taking cognizance without committal

is provided thereby irrespective of what is contained in

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_302">Cr.P.C</a>. and nothing beyond, much less to construe other

provisions of the code for taking cognizance no way

applicable.    In fact from the silence in the provisions for

nothing in the Act provisions inconsistent to the code from

the reading of <a href="/doc/1182345/" id="a_303">Section 4(2)</a> of the code with the provisions

supra, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_304">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. sanction for taking cognizance is a

pre-requisite to proceed against a public servant.           Thus it

specifically provided by <a href="/doc/1970028/" id="a_305">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the Act. Even from

the very wording of <a href="/doc/873452/" id="a_306">Section 45</a> no need to reproduce herein

supra only the non-absentee clause is in relation to

cognizance making the offence cognizable and non-bailable to

say <a href="/doc/1182345/" id="a_307">Section 4(2)</a> r/w schedule II of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_308">Cr.P.C</a>. cannot be looked

into because of the contrary specific provision herein. Even

from <a href="/doc/1001502/" id="a_309">Section 45(1)(a)</a> of the amended Act the non-absentee

clause is against police officers power to investigate under

<p id="p_265">     12. Now from this coming to the contention of the

under <a href="/doc/1852805/" id="a_311">Section 44</a> of the Act and not under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_312">Section 190</a>

the provisions of the code shall apply to mean must be

applied as applicable automatically to the extent indicated

that is in so far as they are not inconsistent with the

cognizance by the special Court referred supra requirement or

non-requirement of sanction is not inconsistent with the

provisions of this Act for there is no provision saying no

sanction is required. In view of that even <a href="/doc/962113/" id="a_316">Section 65</a> of the

Act made applicable for prosecution the provisions<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_317"> of the

Code</a> and prosecution includes particularly taking of

cognizance thereby what <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_318">Cr.P.C</a>. provides of mandatory

requirement of sanction to prosecute a public servant for

the acts done in discharge of or in the purported

discharge of official duties as the case may be.               What

<a href="/doc/1573779/" id="a_319">Section 71</a> of the Act at the cost of repetition once again

referred supra says is the Act provisions prevail over any

other law in force to the extent of inconsistent and not

other acts including the provisions of the code not at all

applicable even there is no any inconsistency and from

the above the Act is silent in that area and from this and

reading of <a href="/doc/962113/" id="a_320">Sections 65</a>, <a href="/doc/1573779/" id="a_321">71</a> of the Act in particular and

with reference to <a href="/doc/1697463/" id="a_322">Sections 43</a> to <a href="/doc/1724556/" id="a_323">46</a> of the Act in general

supra, the provisions<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_325"> of the Code</a> is applicable to the

under this Act in applying<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_326"> the Code</a> where the Act is

silent and not inconsistent with from its provisions is

very clear that the Act is not a complete code and

provisions of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_327">Cr.P.C</a>. apply where the act is silent in the

area from <a href="/doc/1724556/" id="a_328">Section 46</a> and even otherwise so far as the

prosecution and all other proceedings not specifically

provided in the Act the provisions of the code specifically

made applicable by virtue of this <a href="/doc/962113/" id="a_329">Section 65</a> of the Act.

Thus once there is no procedure specifically provided for

prosecution but for simply saying on the complaint to

take cognizance under <a href="/doc/1970028/" id="a_330">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the Act it

cannot be contended no sanction to take cognizance is

required if otherwise sanction is required from the

provisions<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_331"> of the Code</a> as taking of cognizance is part of

prosecution for which by virtue of <a href="/doc/962113/" id="a_332">Section 65</a> also to read

against the accused by placing the complaint before the Court

concerned and the prescription contained in the said Section

going by the heading of the Section it cannot be held that the

Magistrate can straightaway take cognizance of an offence

dehors the non-compliance with the requirements under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_348">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. is the contention of the learned counsel

of the offence concerned and <a href="/doc/1548593/" id="a_350">Section 60</a> of the Act speaks of

read with <a href="/doc/838793/" id="a_351">Section 5</a> of the code there is no specific provision

providing for sanction to be secured for proceeding against

the public servant under the Act and if one can visualize the

situation where <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_352">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. is made applicable in

expression confined to its own facts and mainly by placing

reliance upon <a href="/doc/1548593/" id="a_357">Section 60</a> of the Act and the same cannot be

equated with Sections 23 &amp; 24 of PML Act.             As per the

expression in VC Chinnappa Goudar supra there is a legal

fiction of committing the offence by the Head of the

Department of the Government to punish by <a href="/doc/1548593/" id="a_358">Section 60</a> of the

with reverse onus clause at best that too on showing the

accused got prima facie knowledge in money laundering to

constitute an offence under <a href="/doc/1283441/" id="a_359">Section 3</a> of the Act that to be

established by prosecution and as such the proposition has

no application to say by the learned counsel for the

learned counsel for the Directorate of Enforcement in

Subramanian Swamy Vs. Manmohan Singh20 in dealing

with the sanction to prosecute a public servant on private

complaint it was observed even a private party can apply for

according sanction to prosecute a public servant and that

must be decided as laid down in Vineet Narain within three

months with any consultation outer limit of one month if at

all to consult AG or other law officer of AG with reference to

CVC guidelines 2005 and the private party seeking sanction

must be informed of the decision on sanction application to

enable him to avail appropriate remedy if not satisfied with

the decision not according sanction.         The person against

whom the sanction is to be accorded need not be given any

opportunity of hearing for according sanction but for to take a

decision on the material placed by application of mind to the

material. What is observed of when sanction under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_405">Section

19</a> of PC Act applies not in dispute, however the scope of

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_406">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. is different to <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_407">Section 19</a> of PC Act

special provision is made on a certain matter that matter is

excluded from the general provisions in <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_409">Cr.P.C</a>. and the

provisions of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_410">Section 19</a> PC Act will not have an overriding

effect on general provision of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_411">Section 190</a> Cr.P.C. There is no

dispute on that so far as taking of cognizance, but for

what is discussed supra of mere private complaint to

take cognizance directly by special Court does not mean

from any such provision under the PML Act, exclusion of

the requirement of sanction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_412">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C.

that too <a href="/doc/962113/" id="a_413">Section 65</a> of the Act specifically says for

cognizance subject to sanction and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_414">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C.

requirement must be fulfilled.         What is the contention

referring to PK Pradhan supra of the sanction can be

required or not to be considered during trial and there is

nothing to find fault the cognizance taken by the special

Court under PML Act is also untenable from what is

discussed supra for not a case of any ambiguity on the

requirement of sanction or not to consider after some factual

aspects to be elicited from the evidence to be adduced.

     "prosecution" means "a proceeding either by way of
     indictment or information,, in the criminal courts, in
     order to put an offender upon his trial. In all criminal
     prosecutions the King is nominally the prosecutor."
     This very question was discussed by this Court in the
     case of <a href="/doc/1815080/" id="a_425">Maqbool Hussain v. The State of Bombay</a>(AIR
     1953 SC 325), with reference to the context in which
     the word " prosecution " occurred in <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_426">Art.20.</a> In the
     course of the judgment, the following observations,
     which apply with full force to the present case, were
     made:-"....... and the prosecution in this context
     would mean an initiation or starting of proceedings
     of a criminal nature before a court of law or a

     prescribed in the statute which creates the offence
     and regulates the procedure."</blockquote><p id="p_280">


</p><p id="p_281">     26. Thus initiation of criminal proceedings under PML

Act by the competent authority is by filing private complaint

before special Court to take cognizance by the special Court

and for that the accused once a public servant and his acts

constitutes the offence alleged when in discharge of official

duties, sanction must have been obtained and submitted by

them with the complaint before the special court for taking

cognizance of the offence under the act against said public

servant by then the accused. Otherwise the starting of

criminal proceedings under PML Act is from taking of

cognizance on the private complaint filed before special court,

for the offence under the act by the special court, for such

taking of cognizance of any offence on the private complaint

by the special court, it must be part of its duty to require

that institution of prosecution is a stage prior to taking

institution and they referred several expressions including the

Reddy26           where        it   was   held     that     institution        means

presentation of complaint before a Magistrate for taking

cognizance. Though mere presentation of complaint does not

tantamounts to taking of cognizance in saying particularly at

Para        44    of     the    expression      referring    to   several         other

expressions that prosecution starts at least when cognizance

of offence is taken by the Court though not from pendency of

investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_286">          30. In view of the above, it is crystal clear that for filing

of a private complaint to take cognizance before the special

court by the competent authority, obtaining and filing of the

orders granting sanction by the competent authority to

prosecute          the    public     servant     is   mandatory         and       more

particularly for the special court to take cognizance which is

lacking in the case on hand and for want of sanction the

cognizance orders respectively of the learned Special Judge

are no way sustainable and are liable to be set aside.

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_460">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. and it's marked difference with <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_461">Section

19</a> of PC Act, this Court in LV Subrahmanyam supra dealt

with in detail particularly at Paras 44 &amp; 45 and negated as

untenable the contention of the learned Special Public

Prosecutor for CBI of validity or otherwise of sanction and

requirement or not is a matter to be considered in trial, by

answering the scope of law in this regard from Paras 47 to 49

in saying once it is noticed about the sanction is required and

it is brought to the notice of the Court of the prosecution no

way sustains for want of sanction the continuation of the

proceedings is nothing but abuse of process and to sub serve

the ends of justice the inherent power or writ jurisdiction has

to be invoked in saying ends of justice are more important

and Court cannot shut its size when brought to the notice of

the Court any abuse of process leading to injustice, but for

invoking the inherent power or writ jurisdiction which have

no limitations but self imposed that too mainly to sub serve

the ends of justice having its roots in necessity and its

breadth thereby is co-extensive with necessity.

</p><p id="p_288">     32. Accordingly and in the result, all the three criminal

petitions   are   allowed   by   setting   aside     the      respective

cognizance orders of the learned Special Judge holding that

sanction to prosecute the respective petitioners in the

respective cases as public servants is mandatory and pre-

requisite to take cognizance and from its lacking the learned

Special Judge should not have been taken cognizance and the

cognizance orders thereby are unsustainable, by directing

further the learned Special Judge to return said complaints to

the complainant/s if at all to submit with necessary sanction

orders from the competent authority respectively. The other

defence raised by the accused on merits that is discussed

supra no way requires herein from the above to further dwell

into to give any specific findings for the time being but for left
