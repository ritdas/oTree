              pollution in the air caused by the bursting of fireworks was considered at an

              interim stage by this Court and a detailed order passed on 11th November,

              2016.1 The manufacturers and suppliers of fireworks primarily based in

              Sivakasi (Tamil Nadu) moved an application on or about 5th July, 2017 for

              modification of that interim order. The modification application is registered

              as I.A. No. 52448 of 2017 and we now propose to decide that application.

</p><p id="p_8">              4.             The background for the interim order passed on 11th November, 2016

              is that Diwali was celebrated in 2016 on 30th October. On the next day, it was

              discovered that PM2.5 levels in the air had crossed 700 µg/m3 being among the

              highest levels recorded in the world and about 29 times above the standards

              laid down by the World Health Organization (WHO). We need not

          delve into the details given in the order since there is no dispute that the air

          in Delhi and in most parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) was stiflingly

          polluted. This resulted in many falling sick and others having to purchase face

          masks for personal use and install air purifiers in buildings.

</p><p id="p_9">          5.         The conclusion that the air in the NCR and particularly in Delhi was

          polluted is not only based on the above information but is also based on the

          statutory standards or the National Ambient Air Quality Standards laid down

          in India. The standards are in Schedule VII of the Environment (Protection)

          Rules, 1986. Broadly stated the presence of PM2.5 should range between 40

          and 60 µg/m3 and the presence of PM10 should range between 60 and 100

          µg/m3. For the purposes of a lay person understanding this, it would be

          enough to say that air quality index or AQI is dependent on eight pollutants

          and the categorization based on the presence of these pollutants is as follows:

          rendered a decision on 10th November, 2016 in Original Application No.21 of

          2014 and other connected matters in which it is recorded that there are seven

<p id="p_12">           In other words, the submission of the applicant was that fireworks are not a

          major contributor of air pollution. We may, however, add that during the

          course of submissions, it was accepted by learned counsel for all the parties

          that whether or not the bursting of fireworks is a major cause of air pollution

          in the NCR, it is certainly one of the causes of air pollution, particularly in

          Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_13">          11.        The applicant also referred to and relied upon a study conducted by the

          Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) in January 2016. The study

          is titled “Comprehensive Study on Air Pollution and Green House Gases in

          Delhi”. The study was submitted in the form of a report to the Department of

          Environment of the Government of NCT of Delhi and the Delhi Pollution

          Control Committee. The study conducted by IIT-K suggests that the sources

          of PM2.5 are several but the bursting of fireworks is not one of them. We have

          not been informed whether any use has been made (if at all) of the study.

</p><p id="p_14">          12.        In addition to the aforesaid, the applicant also relied upon a view

          expressed by the CPCB before this Court to the effect that poor wind speed

          was one of the causes of smog over Delhi particularly in the winter months.

          It was also submitted that there are certain other geographical and

          meteorological conditions such as temperature, wind direction and boundary

          layer that contribute to the presence of smog in Delhi.

</p><p id="p_15">          13.        It was also submitted that the burning of crops or stubbles in Punjab

          and Pakistan also caused air pollution in Delhi and indeed this was the case in

          October-November 2016. A reference was made to a brief write up along

          with an image, released by the Earth Observatory of the National Aeronautics

          and Space Agency (NASA) and dated 2nd November, 2016, stating that,

          “Punjab ranks among the nation’s top wheat and rice producers. For a few

          weeks in October and November, Punjab also becomes a major producer of

          air pollution.” A reference was also made to a report in the New York Times

          by Geeta Anand on 2nd November, 2016 that an estimated 32 million tons of

          leftover straw from rice harvests were burnt in Punjab and Haryana, in spite

          of an NGT direction against this, and this led to plumes of smoke blackening

          the skies in the capital.
</p>
<p id="p_16">          14.        The applicant drew our attention to the poor air quality in Delhi on the

          days prior to Diwali 2016 and for more than a month thereafter. A comparison

          was drawn with the air quality recorded by the CPCB in Andhra Pradesh,

          Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal to suggest that on some days prior to

          Diwali, the air quality was not particularly healthy in select cities in these

          States thereby suggesting that the air is generally polluted in different parts of

          the country and the bursting of fireworks may marginally add (if at all) to air

          pollution. In this context it was submitted that the bursting of fireworks takes

          place only for a couple of days around Diwali and other festive occasions and

          that cannot by itself result in a substantial deterioration in air quality all over

          the country including Delhi. The bursting of fireworks around Diwali would

          have only a temporary and transitory impact and not any long lasting effect.

          Therefore, the bursting of fireworks around Diwali does not explain high

          PM2.5 levels in Delhi more than even a month after Diwali.

</p><p id="p_17">          15.        During the course of submissions it was pointed out that the Delhi

          Pollution Control Committee had issued a direction on 8th November, 2016

          under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

          1981 banning the bursting of fireworks at all times except on religious

          occasions. It was submitted that this ban is still in force and therefore it cannot

          be said that the terrible quality of air in Delhi in November 2016 and thereafter

          is attributable only to bursting of fireworks - there are several other factors. It

          was submitted that on an overall consideration of the issues, the ban and sale

          of fireworks in Delhi and in the NCR should be modified if not lifted.

</p><p id="p_18">          16.        Learned counsel for the petitioners gave us a Note on the harmful and

          deleterious effects of some of the chemicals used in fireworks. We have no

          doubt and indeed no learned counsel had any doubt that the excessive use of

          chemicals in fireworks could have serious and deleterious health effects,

          particularly among children. We are, therefore, proceeding on this basis

          without reference to the Note since there is no dispute on this aspect. With

          this agreement in mind (which has always been there), we had passed an order

          on 31st July, 2017 after hearing learned counsel as well as Dr. A.B. Akolkar,

          Member Secretary of the CPCB and Mr. K. Sundershan, Deputy Chief

          Controller of Explosives, Sivakasi to the effect that fireworks manufactured

          by the respondents shall not contain antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic and

          lead in any form whatsoever. We had also directed that it would be the

          responsibility of PESO to ensure compliance particularly in Sivakasi. We had

          noted that there was some doubt about the health hazards that could be caused

              Atom Bomb, (b) Chinese crackers (no reference to China at all), (c) Maroons

              and (d) Garland crackers. This study and research relates to the sound caused

              by the bursting of these fireworks and the light and colour emitted by them.

              No work has been done or study conducted at all with reference to pollution

              in the air caused by the bursting of these or other fireworks. We were

              informed (somewhat faintly) that this is really the job of the CPCB but the

              FDRC is willing to extend full cooperation to the CPCB in arriving at some

              definite standards.

                                            authorities have issued a circular dated 26.10.93 imposing certain

                                            on the ground that the cracker shops are adjacent to each other. We
                                            have also indicated to Mr. Lahiri that what was intended was that if

                                            authority. In view of the statement made by Mr. Lahiri, we do not
                                            think it necessary to issue any direction. The proceedings will stand

<p id="p_83">          What more needs to be done

</p><p id="p_84">          51.        What is necessary now is to correlate air pollution with the sale and

          bursting of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR. There is no doubt that the air we

          breathe gets polluted with the bursting of fireworks. The extent of air pollution

          caused by bursting fireworks is not clear in the absence of empirical data – it

          could be severe or it could be marginal, but it is there.

</p><p id="p_85">          52.        Have the steps already taken by the concerned authorities reduced air

          pollution during Diwali? It seems to us that the steps so far taken by the

          Government of NCT of Delhi are limited to issuing directions, which is

          merely paperwork. Only general directions have been given in the past to

          schools to sensitize the students and the staff as to the ill-effects and health

          hazards of bursting fireworks. No specific plan of action has been laid down

          by the Government of NCT of Delhi to make children aware of the hazards of

          bursting fireworks and the existing awareness campaigns have been allowed

          to drift over the last one year. There is no information on the success or failure

          of these campaigns.

</p><p id="p_88">          53.        The response of the Government of NCT of Delhi is lethargic with the

          absence of any keenness to take proactive steps. This is disconcerting. It is

          high time that governmental authorities realize that the cost of ill health

          (particularly among children) is far greater in psycho-social terms than in

          financial and economic terms. The adage that ‘prevention is better than cure’

          is fully applicable in the present circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_89">          54.        Similarly, the Delhi Police has issued directions that are difficult to

          enforce such as restricting the time during which fireworks can be burst. These

          are ad hoc measures that might be workable (if at all) only for the immediate

          future. We have not been informed of the impact of such directions or their

          implementation.
</p>
<p id="p_90">          55.        We must note that there has been no response from the States within

          the NCR giving the impression that air pollution is not a problem for the State

          Governments despite the ill-effects and health hazards of bursting fireworks.

</p><p id="p_91">          56.        There must be a concerted effort by the powers that be to ensure

          awareness and sensitization of the people in Delhi and NCR, particularly

          children, of the health hazards of indiscriminate use of fireworks. Unless

          urgent steps are taken, there could be an adverse impact on the health of

          children and this would be to nobody’s benefit but to everybody’s detriment.

          Anybody who lived in Delhi during Diwali in 2016 and soon thereafter would

          have experienced the choking effects of breathing in polluted air and the

          tremendous increase in the use and sale of face masks and air purifiers. In the

          absence of any concerted plan of action implemented by the governmental

          authorities, the residents responded in an ad hoc manner by purchasing face

          masks and air purifiers. There is no doubt that an effective and longer lasting

          solution is necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_92">          57.        What has really disturbed us is that the CPCB was directed on 11th

          November, 2016 to study and prepare a report within three months on the

          harmful effects of the materials used in the manufacture of fireworks. It is

          astonishing that the CPCB has not conducted the study and prepared a report

          as directed. Apart from the fact that the CPCB has not conducted any study,

          even otherwise, no standards have been laid down by the CPCB which could

          give any indication of the acceptable and permissible limit of constituent

          metals or chemicals used in fireworks and released in the air, beyond which

          their presence would be harmful or dangerous. There cannot be any doubt

          that the presence of certain metals or chemicals in the air beyond a particular

          limit would be inadvisable but that limit is not known to anybody including

          the CPCB. Therefore, any discussion on the subject of whether there is an

          excessive presence of a particular chemical in the air will not yield any result

          unless some authority lays down an acceptable standard of what is excessive

          and what is not. Dr. Akolkar, Member Secretary of the CPCB had informed

          us on 31st July, 2017 that the CPCB would be in a position to lay down the

          standards by 15th September, 2017. We do hope the CPCB does so – in any

          case as a part of the continuing mandamus principle laid down by this Court,

          the matter is required to be followed up.
</p>
<p id="p_93">          58.        What is also worrying, apart from the absence of standards or limits

          having been laid down by the CPCB, is that very little or no attention seems

          to have been paid by any of the governmental authorities to the possible health

          hazards faced by children due to exposure to chemicals in fireworks. The

          governmental authorities need to realize their responsibility regarding the care

          and protection of the health of the people in Delhi and NCR and the

          importance of launching a sustained campaign to reduce air pollution to

          manageable limits during Diwali and the period immediately thereafter. The

          health of children should be of foremost concern in this regard. It is, as

          submitted, only a matter of a few days of intense pollution but even that is

          capable of having long term health effects. There are also short-term adverse

          consequences of breathing in polluted air and even this cannot be overlooked

          by the governmental authorities, particularly in the case of children.

</p><p id="p_94">          59.        On 31st July, 2017 we had prohibited the use of five chemicals and their

          compounds in the manufacture of fireworks. These constituents are antimony,

          lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead. We had left open the issue of use of

          strontium and its compounds in the manufacture of fireworks. During the

          course of submissions on the issue of whether the use of strontium should be

          permitted in fireworks and the application for modification or vacation of the

          interim order, our attention was drawn to an article in the Swarajya magazine,

          by one Srikanth Ramakrishnan who reported that the National Environmental

          Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) along with researchers from an

          organization based in Austria, namely, International Institute for Applied

          Systems Analysis (IIAS) had conducted a study whose results revealed that

          the majority of the pollution in Delhi comes from outside the NCT of Delhi

          and from other areas in the NCR in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Therefore,

          no matter what air quality standards are adopted in Delhi, pollution would

          flow in from the neighbouring States in any case. The report prepared by

          NEERI and the IIAS has not been made available to us.
</p>
<p id="p_95">          60.        Be that as it may, the CPCB has now concluded that only strontium

          chromate is harmful or dangerous to human health. Therefore, we have no

          option but to prohibit the use of strontium chromate in the manufacture of

          fireworks.

<p id="p_96">          61.        It was submitted by Mr. P.S. Patwalia, learned counsel appearing for

          one of the respondents that the best possible solution to the problem of air

          pollution in Delhi, allegedly due to the bursting of fireworks, would be to

          constitute a Committee to advise this Court. It was submitted that when the

          issue of noise pollution had surfaced, the CPCB had set up the National

          Committee on Noise Pollution and Control in 1997 which led to noise

          pollution standards being set. It was suggested that a similar exercise may be

          undertaken to deal with the issue of air pollution due to bursting of fireworks

          in Delhi. This was precisely the purpose of issuing a direction to the CPCB

          on 11th November, 2016 but that was not taken seriously. Therefore, in our

          opinion, the suggestion deserves acceptance and it is necessary to set up such

          a Committee with the assistance and guidance of the CPCB and the FDRC.

          The Committee can quite effectively conduct a study along with assistance

          and inputs from other bodies or organizations and make recommendations. It

          may be appropriate to appoint a Committee including officers at the

          appropriate level from the National Physical Laboratory, Delhi, the Defence

          Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Timarpur, Delhi, the Indian

          Institute of Technology, Kanpur, scientists from the State Pollution Control

          Boards, the Fire Development and Research Centre, Sivakasi and Nagpur and

          the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).

</p><p id="p_97">          62.        It was submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that the poor air

              November, 2016 and there was no reason to vary that order. Virulent air

              pollution is a cause of concern and the only remedy to stop its ill effects is to

              continue the suspension of licences for the sale of fireworks in Delhi and in

              the NCR. It was submitted that if there is any doubt regarding the effect of

              bursting fireworks on air pollution, and in the absence of any standards to

              measure the same, the safer course would be to continue such suspension

              rather than risk the health of large sections of people in Delhi and the NCR,

              particularly children.

              and the human right to health of any other citizen of the country, particularly

                                Our legal system having been founded on the British common law the
                                right of a person to a pollution-free environment is a part of the basic

</blockquote><p id="p_103">          67.        The right to health coupled with the right to breathe clean air leaves no

          manner of doubt that it is important that air pollution deserves to be eliminated

          and one of the possible methods of reducing it during Diwali is by continuing

          the suspension of licences for the sale of fireworks and therefore implicitly,

          prohibiting the bursting of fireworks.
</p>
<p id="p_104">          68.        In our considered opinion, continuing the suspension of licences might

          be too radical a step to take for the present – a graded and balanced approach

          is necessary that will reduce and gradually eliminate air pollution in Delhi and

          in the NCR caused by the bursting of fireworks. At the same time it is

          necessary to ensure that injustice is not caused to those who have already been

          granted a valid permanent licence to possess and sell fireworks in Delhi and

          the NCR. The graded and balanced approach is not intended to dilute our

          primary concern which is and remains the health of everybody and the human

          right to breathe good quality air or at least not be compelled to breathe poor

          quality air. Generally speaking, this must take precedence over the

          commercial or other interest of the applicant and those granted a permanent

          licence to possess and sell fireworks.
</p>
<p id="p_105">          69.        But, from the material before us, it cannot be said with any great degree

          of certainty that the extremely poor quality of air in Delhi in November and

          December 2016 was the result only of bursting fireworks around Diwali.

          Certainly, there were other causes as well, but even so the contribution of the

          bursting of fireworks cannot be glossed over. Unfortunately, neither is it

          possible to give an accurate or relative assessment of the contribution of the

          other identified factors nor the contribution of bursting fireworks to the poor

          air quality in Delhi and in the NCR. Consequently, a complete ban on the sale

          of fireworks would be an extreme step that might not be fully warranted by

          the facts available to us. There is, therefore, some justification for modifying

          the interim order passed on 11th November, 2016 and lifting the suspension of

          the permanent licences.
</p>
<p id="p_106">          70.        At the same time, it cannot be forgotten that admittedly there is a huge

          quantity of fireworks in Delhi and in the NCR and the figure has been

          provided to us by the applicant.                           Similarly, there can be no doubt that the

          Delhi Police had issued a large number of temporary licences in 2016 and it

          would not be unreasonable to assume that around and during Diwali, there

          would have been some illegal temporary shops set up, whether known or not

          known to the police. We do not have the figures with regard to the NCR, but

          we assume that like in Delhi, a large number of temporary licences have been

          issued for the possession and sale of fireworks. Therefore, there is a need to

              or any of the permanent licensees and, therefore, a graded regulation is

              necessary which would eventually result in a prohibition. Taking all factors

              into consideration, we are of the view that the following orders and directions

              are required to be issued and we do so:

                     number of temporary licences should be capped at 500. Similarly, the

                     prohibiting the use of compounds of antimony, lithium, mercury,

                     arsenic and lead in the manufacture of fireworks is made absolute. In

<p id="p_117">                     (10) Fireworks containing aluminium, sulphur, potassium and barium

                     may be sold in Delhi and in the NCR, provided the composition already

                     approved by PESO is maintained. It is the responsibility of PESO to

                     ensure compliance of the standards it has formulated.

                     (11) Since there are enough fireworks available for sale in Delhi and

                     the NCR, the transport of fireworks into Delhi and the NCR from

                     outside the region is prohibited and the concerned law enforcement

                     authorities will ensure that there is no further entry of fireworks into

                     Delhi and the NCR till further orders. In our opinion, even 50,00,000

                     kg of fireworks is far more than enough for Dussehra and Diwali in

                     2017. The permanent licensees are at liberty to exhaust their existing

                     stock of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR and, if that is not possible, take

                     measures to transport the stocks outside Delhi and the NCR.

                     (12) The suspension of permanent licences as directed by the order

                     dated 11th November, 2016 is lifted for the time being. This might

                     require a review after Diwali depending on the ambient air quality post

                     Diwali. However, it is made explicit that the sale of fireworks by the

                     permanent licensees must conform to the directions given above and

                     must be fully in compliance with the Explosives Rules. We were

                     informed that the permanent licences were issued by PESO and

                     therefore the responsibility is on PESO to ensure compliance.

                     (13) While lifting the suspension on the permanent licences already

                     granted, we put these licensees on notice for Dussehra and Diwali in

                     2018 that they will be permitted to possess and sell only 50% of the

                     quantity permitted in 2017 and that this will substantially reduce over

                     the next couple of years. The permanent licensees are at liberty to file

                     objections to this proposed direction within 30 days from today and

                     thereafter the objections if any will be heard and decided. If no

                     objections are filed, this direction will become absolute without any

                     further reference to any licensee.

<p id="p_118">                     (14) Since there is a lack of clarity on the safety limits of various

                     metals and constituents used in fireworks, a research study must be

                     jointly carried out by the CPCB and the FDRC laying down appropriate

                     standards for ambient air quality in relation to the bursting of fireworks

                     and the release of their constituents in the air. While Schedule VII of

                     the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 does deal with several

                     metals, but as we have seen there are several other metals or

                     constituents of fireworks that have not been studied by the CPCB and

                     these metals or constituents in the ambient air. The CPCB has assured

                     us that it will complete the exercise by 15th September, 2017 but

                     keeping in mind its track record subsequent to the order dated 11th

                     November, 2016 this does not seem possible. Therefore, we grant time

                     to the CPCB to come out with definite standards on or before 30th

                     September, 2017.
