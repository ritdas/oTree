Union of India and others                                    ...Respondent(s)


                            Through:- Mr. Aijaz Lone, Dy. AG

Coram: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJEEV KUMAR, JUDGE

                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    Impugned in this petition is order No.97-PCB of 2019 dated

28.11.2019, whereby J&amp;K Pollution Control Board in exercise of powers

under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> (A) of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") has directed the District

Magistrate, Samba to get the Poultry Farm of the petitioner closed

immediately and has further directed the Chief Engineer, Electric &amp;

Maintenance (PDD) to snap the electric supply to the aforesaid unit.

</p><p id="p_2">2.    Learned counsel for the petitioner assails the impugned order

primarily on two counts, one that with the promulgation of the J&amp;K

Reorganization Act, 2019, the erstwhile State of J&amp;K has become Union

Territory and , therefore, by operation of <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_3">Section 6</a> of the Act, the State

Pollution Control Board has ceased to have jurisdiction over the matter and

the action, if any, required to be taken under the Act, can be validly taken by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2                        WP(C) No.4531/2019</span>




the Central Board only. He further submits that the poultry unit does not fall

within the expression "plant" as used in <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section 21</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_3">3.    Apart from elaborating his submissions on aforesaid two aspects,

learned counsel for the petitioner also sought indulgence of this Court to

consider taking some measure of protection with regard to the live stock

(poultry) on equitable consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    Mr. Lone, learned counsel appearing for the respondents has

vehemently opposed the writ petition and submits that the State Pollution

Control Board has all the jurisdiction to issue impugned order. He relied

upon Clause 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Removal of

Difficulties) Order, 2019.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.    Having heard learned counsel of the parties and perused the record, I

am of the view that so far as challenge to the impugned order is concerned,

same does not have any substance and, therefore, merits rejection. The

poultry unit is a plant as defined under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">Section 21</a> of the Act, therefore,

cannot operate unless, there is consent to establish and operate granted by

the State Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    The plea of the learned counsel for the petitioner that with the coming

into force of the J&amp;K Reorganization Act, 2019, the State Pollution Control

Board has ceased to have jurisdiction is also not tenable in view of issuance

of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Removal of Difficulties) Order,

2019 by the Government of India. However, I am inclined to accept the

request of the learned counsel for the petitioners for providing some

measures of protection so far as live stock in the poultry farm is concerned

purely on equitable considerations.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.    For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is disposed of in the

following manner:-

             will close the unit on its own, unless he gets no objection from the Pollution

             Control Board (consent to establish and to operate) and fulfils other requisite

             legal requirements.

             to this Court, besides that he will be liable to be proceeded against for

             contempt of this Court, the respondents shall also be at liberty to forcibly

             close the petitioner-unit.
