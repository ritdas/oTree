(BY SRI R.DEVDAS, AGA FOR R-1)

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
PRAYING TO DIRECT RESPONDENT NOS.2 AND 3 TO EITHER
REMOVE OR SHIFT THE CREMATORIUM, WHICH IS BEING
CONSTRUCTED IN THE BURIAL GROUND OF HEGDENAGAR

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:


                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, C.J. (Oral) :
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.   Leave granted to amend the cause title so as to join as

respondent No.4 the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.


</p><p id="p_4">2.   The petitioners have, by way of the present petition in

public interest, raised the issue of health hazard likely to be

posed by construction of a Crematorium in the vicinity of their

residences in Hegde Nagar, Bangalore.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 -4-</span>


</p><p id="p_5">3.    The petitioners have relied upon the advanced research

conducted     regarding   the      health     hazards   posed   by

Crematorium and on that basis it was submitted by learned

Senior Counsel Mr.Uday Holla, that the serious and genuine

concerns of the persons living in the vicinity of the proposed

Crematorium need to be seriously addressed by adoption of

scientific means or changing the location of the Crematorium.

It was, however, fairly conceded that the location of the

proposed Crematorium in the area nearby the residences of

the petitioners was per se not found to be illegal or in violation

of any Rules.    Under the circumstances, it was proposed on

behalf   of   the   petitioners,    to      make   an   appropriate

representation to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,

for ensuring prevention of air pollution which is presently in

the realm of the apprehensions of the petitioners. Therefore,

the petition is not pressed and not entertained at this stage,

with permission to the petitioners to make an appropriate

representation about the measures, if any, which may require

to be taken under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981 to prevent the health hazards apprehended on the

basis of relevant scientific research.        If and when such a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              -5-</span>


representation is made to the Karnataka State Pollution

Control Board, it may be duly examined by the authorities

concerned and necessary action may be taken in accordance

with law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.   With   these   observations,   the   petition   is   disposed,

without dealing with other contentions which are not pressed.
