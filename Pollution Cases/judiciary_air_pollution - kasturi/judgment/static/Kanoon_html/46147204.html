   glass   frosting   thereby   causing   pollution   in   the   locality.     The
   defenda n t   no.1   is   using   electricity   for   residential   and   indus trial
   purposes   without   paying   for   it   as   the   electric   meter   was     removed
   for non­ payme nt  of electricity  charges.

   premises     was   inspected     by   its   officials   on   24.05.04.     It   is   stated
   that   the   defenda n t   no.1   was   run ni ng   a   glass   frosting   unit   on   the
   ground   of   the   suit   property.     It   is   stated   that   the   said   Unit   was
   causing  emissions   of  dust   due   to   the   process   of  glass   frosting   and
   exha u s t   fan   for   the   discharge   of   the   emissions    was   provided

</p><p id="p_15"> 11. Ld.   Counsel   for   the   plaintiff   argued   that   the   suit   property   was
   jointly   purch a s e d   by   the   plaintiff   and   the   defenda n t   no.1   &amp;  2.     He
   argued  that  the   defenda n t  no.1  is  in  posses sion  of the  ground  floor
   of   the   suit   property.     He   argued   that   the   defenda n t   no.1   started
   una u t h o rized   constr u c tion   at   the   ground   floor   of   the   suit   property
   on   16.04.200 4   in   order   to   constr u ct   three   shops   on   the   front     side
   and   two   shops   on   the   rear   side   of   the   ground   floor   of   the   suit
   premises.     He   argued   that   the   defenda n t   no.1   intend s   to   sell   the
   said   shops   to   the   exclusion   of  the   plaintiff   and   the   defenda n t   no.2.
   He   argued   that   the   suit   property   is   undivided   and   the   plaintiff     as
   well as  the  defenda n t  no.2  are  also  co­ owners  of the  ground  floor   of
   the   suit   property.     He   argued   that   the   defenda n t   no.1     was
   constr uc ti ng  shops  at  the  ground  floor  of the  suit   premises  witho ut
   obtaining   any   sanction   plan.   He   argued   that   the   defenda n t   no.1
   should   be   restrained   from   carrying   out   any   una u t h o rised
   constr uc tion   in   the   suit   property   and   further,   alienating   and
   creating   third   party   interest   therein.     He   argued   that   the     plaintiff
   has   a  prima­ facie   case     as   the   defenda n t   no.1     is   carrying   out
   constr uc tion   in   the   suit   premises   without   any   sanction   plan.     He
   argued     that   the   defenda n t   no.1   is   intending   to   remove   the
   founda tion   of   the   building     and   the   plaintiff   would   suffer
   irrepara ble   loss   as   the   building   is   old   and   the     plaintiff   is     residing
   along  with  his  family  members  at  the  first  floor  of the  suit  property.
   He  argued  that  the  balance  of convenience   also  lies  in  favour  of the
   plaintiff   and   against   the   defenda n t   as   the     defenda n t   has   no   right
   to   carry   out   una u t h o rised   constr uc tion     thereafter,   create   third
   party   interest     in   the   suit   property   to   the   exclusion   of   the   plaintiff
   and  the  defenda n t  no.2.   He  prayed  for grant  for interim  injunctio n.
</p>

<p id="p_16">12. Ld.   couns el   for   defenda n t   no.4 / M CD   argued   that   the   defenda n t
   no.1   had   filed   a   suit   for   perma ne n t   injunction   against   the   plaintiff
   bearing  suit  no.156 / 0 4 .    He  argued  that    the  said  suit  was  decreed
   vide   judgme nt   dated   22.10.08   passed   by   the   Court   of   Ms.   Char u


Suit  no.  12 9 / 0 9      .                                                           Page  4 /6
    Aggarwal,  Ld.  CJ,  Delhi.    He  argued  that  the  defenda n t  no.1  herein
   was   restrained   by   the   said   Court   from   raising   any   constr u ction   in
   the   suit   premises   without   permission   of   the   competent   aut hority.
   He   argued   that   the   relief   prayed   by   the   plaintiff   in   the   prese nt   suit
   had   already  been  granted  in  the  said  suit.   
</p>

<p id="p_17">13. In   order   to   seek   interim     injunction,   the   plaintiff   must   show
   existence   of  prima­ facie  case,   irrepar able   loss   and   injury   resulting
   from   withholding   of  interim   injunction   and   balance   of  convenience
   in  his  favour  and  agains t  the  defenda n t.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">14. It   is   the   case   of   the   the   plaintiff   that   the   defenda n t   no.1   was
   raising   una u t h o rized   constr uc tion   on   the   ground   floor   of   the   suit
   property  in  order  to  constr u ct  three  shops  on  the  front  side  and  the
   two  shops    on  the  rear  side  at  the  ground  floor  of the  suit  property.
   The   plaintiff   has   not   placed   anythi ng   on   record   in   support   of   his
   case   that   the   defenda n t   no.1   was   carrying   out   any   constr u c tio n   in
   the   suit   property   for   the   constr uc tion   of   shops.   The   defenda n t
   no.4 / MCD   stated   that   no   una u t h orized   constr u c tion   was   carried
   out  in  the  suit  property  nor  any  constr u ction  activity  was  seen.   The
   defenda n t  no.  1  herein  has  already  been  restrained  by  the  Court   of
   Ms.  Charu  Aggarwal,  Ld.  CJ,  Delhi  vide  decree  dated  22.10.08  from
   raising     any   constr u ction   in   the   ground   floor   of   the   suit   property
   without   permis sion   of   the   competent   aut hority.     The   plaintiff     has
   failed  to  make  out  a  prima­ facie  case.
</p>
<p id="p_19">15. So  far  as  balance  of convenience  is  concerned,  the  plaintiff  has  not
   placed   any   material   on   record   that   the   defenda n t   no.1   was
   removing   the   founda tion   of   the   suit   property   on   14.04.20 0 4   or
   16.04.200 4.     The   defenda n t   no.1   has   not   constr uc ted   any   shop   as
   alleged   by   the   plaintiff,   his   appre he n sio n   that   the   defenda n t   no.1
   may  create  third  party  rights  in  the  said  shops  is  misplaced.
