<p id="p_3">1.The first among the captioned matters is filed by

 the Manimala River Protection Council. The other

 two are filed by different inhabitants around the

 area where a granite quarry and metal crushing

 unit of the private respondents situates.



</p><p id="p_4">2.A  quarrying   lease  was   granted  to   Sri.Anu

 T.George, Vadakkummuriyil Granites, Chunkappara

 for extraction of granite building stone from an

 area of 0.5755 ha. from Avolimala in Sy.No.446/1,

 2 of Kottangal Village in Mallappally Taluk in

 Pathanamthitta District for a period of 10 years

 as per Proceedings dated 18.8.2004 of Director of

 Mining &amp; Geology. That will expire on 12.9.2014.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases     -: 2 :-</span>

 Subsequently, another lease was also granted to

 him for extraction of granite building stone from

 an area of 8.7663 ha. in Sy.Nos.436/1, 443/1, 1-

 3, 446/3, 3-1, 4, 447/1, 1-2, 1-3 and 448/2 of

 the    same      village   as     per  Proceedings dated

 2.12.2005 of the Director of Mining &amp; Geology.

 That lease will expire on 18.12.2017. Anu T.

 George     transferred       the    leasehold  right  to

 M/s.Amity Rock Products Pvt. Ltd., Chunkappara on

 10.6.2008 and got that transfer registered as per

 the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules. As per

 the conditions of lease dated 18.8.2004, the

 lessee can extract 5000 MT of granite from the

 quarry     in    an   year.   As   per  the  lease dated

 2.12.2005, the lessee can extract 25000 MT in an

 year. Thus, the lessee can extract 30000 MT of

 granite from the two leasehold areas in an year.

 Anu T. George started quarrying operations during

 the   1st     of     April,   2007   and  continued till

 31.5.2008. He exercised option of compounding

 under Rule 48P of the Concession Rules during

 that period. Amity Rock Products Pvt. Ltd. also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases     -: 3 :-</span>

 followed      the     same  pattern    of  operation. To

 exclude     any     controversy    on  the  facts,  these

 statements are taken out from the affidavit sworn

 to on 16th February, 2012 by the Geologist,

 Mining &amp; Geology Department, District Office,

 Pathanamthitta in WP(C).No.12150 of 2007. The

 said affidavit discloses that Anu T.G eorge had

 recorded extraction of 8452 MT from 1.4.2007 to

 31.5.2008 and Amity Rock Products Pvt. Ltd. has

 recorded extraction of 39300 MT, 77928 MT and

 119463 MT respectively for the years 2008-2009,

 2009-2010, 2010-2011.

 Panchayat licence dated 7.4.2009 is granted by

 the Kottangal Grama Panchayat. Explosive licence

 with validity till 31.3.2012 is granted by the

 Joint Controller of Explosives, Chennai as per

 the provisions of the <a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_2">Explosives Act</a>. The firm

 has     appointed       a   qualified    person   holding

 quarrying operations are being done in accordance

 with the provisions of the Concession Rules,

 maintaining proper benches/step cuttings as per

 the Concession Rules. The said counter affidavit

 proceeds      to     state  that    Rule  29(i)  of  the

 Concession Rules provides for distance of 75

 metres     from     certain    landmarks,  however that,

 there     is    no    statutory    provision  prohibiting

 mining/quarrying operations near to forests and

 that there is no provision in the Concession

<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">4.When WP(C)Nos.8448 of 2008 and 218 of 2009 were

 considered by the Bench on 6.10.2009, it was

 noted that the issue involved relates to whether

 the quarry and crusher unit being run by Amity

 Rock Products Pvt. Ltd. at Chungappara within the

 limits of Kottangal Grama Panchayat are causing

 any environmental pollution posing threat to the

 local inhabitants. The Bench dissuading itself

 from    making       any elaborate   reference to  the

 various      allegations     and   counter  allegations

 recorded that the issue has been kept alive

 because apparently there has been some resentment

 among a section of the people of the locality.

 Noticing      that    the imbroglio   can  be given  a

 quietus if a committee of experts is asked to

 look into the entire aspects of the functioning

 of the above two units, the Bench accepted the

 suggestion of the learned Additional Advocate

 General that a committee could be constituted as

 suggested by him. Accordingly, a committee was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases     -: 6 :-</span>

 constituted with the Chairman of the Biodiversity

 Board or a nominee proposed by him, Conservator

 of    Forests,        Kollam,     Environmental  Engineer,

 Kollam     and      District     Geologist,   Kollam. The

 Conservator of Forests, Kollam was to be the

 Convenor       of     the  Committee.     That   Committee

 submitted report dated 15.12.2009, the original

 of which is along with the paper book in WP(C).

 No.218 of 2009. During course of arguments before

 us, that report including the procedure adopted

 by the Committee and also the contents drew

 criticism at the hands of the operator; the

 learned senior counsel appearing for them arguing

 that it is essentially a one-man report and

 contains only the particular views of the then

 Chairman of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board.

 Suffice for us to say that the said report is

 signed by all the Members of the Committee and

 the summary of it is that the study clearly shows

 that    the    quarry    and     crusher  unit  cause and

 continue      to     cause  damage    to   the  birds and

 wildlife in the forests lying close to the site,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases    -: 7 :-</span>

 affect the plants and health of people living

 around,       hamper    the      natural   springs  and,

 irrevocably       damage the      ecology  of  the  area,

 especially the micro water system.

<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">5.When the three writ petitions came up together

 for    consideration     on      10th  March,  2011, the

 aforesaid       order dated 6.10.2009 and the report

 of the Committee were noted.             Without stating

 anything about the contents and findings in that

 regard, the Bench noticed that the statements

 therein      require   clear      expression  of  opinion

 touching the facts mentioned in that report. With

 the materials on record, the Bench was of the

 view that the Executive has to first speak on the

 issue before any judicial intervention in that

 regard. It is apposite to quote the following

 from that order:
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "3. Government means, the institution
       of     governance,     meaning   thereby  an

</blockquote>



<p id="p_12">6.Thereupon, the Chief Secretary to the Government

 of Kerala filed an affidavit dated 2nd April,

 2011. That affidavit is a candid admission that

 there is differential emphasis in the views of

 the different departments regarding the impact of

 the mining operations on the environment. There

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases    -: 9 :-</span>

 is a clear cleavage of opinion noted by the Chief

 Secretary. The issues raised by the different

 departments and in particular, the Biodiversity

 Board,     pointing    out      the provisions of  the

 Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961 and the

 Environment Policy, 2009 of the Government of

 Kerala where quarrying is not             permitted in

 hillocks, appear to have gained the attention of

 the Chief Secretary. The Revenue Department had

 also reported to the Chief Secretary that the

 unit concerned is holding land in excess of the

 ceiling area under the provisions of the Kerala

 Land Reforms Act and that notice is being issued

 to   the     company   in    that  regard.  The Forest

 Department         has  indicated      that   quarrying

 operations have to be restricted to a minimum

 distance of 100 metres from the boundary of the

 forest. A reading of that affidavit appears to

 disclose that the anxiety of the Executive to

 ensure      availability       of  materials  for  the

 construction sector has apparently overtaken the

 more fundamental requirement to provide adequate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases    -: 10 :-</span>

 checks      and      balances     to  ensure   that the

 environmental impact of such operation is so

 minimized      that    it  conforms    to  the  required

 benchmarks to sustain the ecological balance vis-

 a-vis the need for resources. The petitioners in

 WP(C).No.218 of 2009 have along with I.A.No.2667

 of 2010 produced different precedents of the

 Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and of this Court

 containing the repeated statements as to law

 regarding       such   matters.     We  are  not  making

 elaborate reference to the legal issues in that

 regard,     having     regard     to the nature  of the

 directions that we will issue in these cases.



</p><p id="p_13">7.During the course of hearing before this Court

 thereafter, the effect of earlier judgments in

 favour of the operator was canvassed by its

 learned senior counsel as precluding any issue in

 that regard being raised by the petitioners. The

 learned     counsel     for   the   petitioners strongly

 relying on the aforesaid report of the Expert

 Committee, argued that the cause of action for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases   -: 11 :-</span>

 the earlier writ petitions and the result of

 those matters have no bearing on the issues that

 arise on the facts which disclose a continuing

 wrong to the public and the nature.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">8.In so far as the Mines and Minerals (Development

 and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_3">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment

 (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 are concerned, by now the

 law is well settled that quarrying and mining of

 minor minerals have to be done only by ensuring

 that there is no damage to the eco system. This

 has to be done with proper environmental impact

 assessment. <a href="/doc/60071241/" id="a_5">In Deepak Kumar v. State of Haryana</a>

 [(2012)      4    SCC  629],     Their Lordships after

 considering        the  views    of   the Ministry of

 Environment and Forest made particular reference

 to the constitution of a Core Group by the MoEF

 to look into the environmental aspects associated

 with mining of minor minerals. MoEF's attention

 got thus focused to the need to look into the

 environmental aspects associated with mining of

 minor minerals. The terms of reference to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases    -: 12 :-</span>

 Core Group dealt with matters not falling under

 the environmental impact assessment notification

 of 1994. The Ministry of Mines, Government of

 India    has     sent   communication   dated 16.5.2011

 called "Environmental Aspects of Quarrying and of

 Minor     Minerals-Evolving       of Model   Guidelines"

 along     with     a  draft    model guidelines.  Their

 Lordships, taking the view that all the State

 Governments/Union Territories have to give due

 weight to those recommendations, noticed that the

 Model Rules of 2010 issued by the Ministry of

 Mines are very vital from the environmental,

 ecological and biodiversity point of view. The

 State Governments were therefore to frame proper

 rules    in    accordance     with  the  recommendations

 under    <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_6">Section      15</a> of     the Mines  and Minerals

 (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_7">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957. By that

 judgment, all the States, Union Territories, MoEF

 and the Ministry of Mines are required to give

 effect to the recommendations made by MoEF in its

 Report of March 2010 and the model guidelines

 framed by the Ministry of Mines, within a period

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases    -: 13 :-</span>

 of six months from 27.12.2010, the date of the

 said order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The

 Central Government was also directed to take

 steps to bring into force the             Minor Minerals

 Conservation and Development Rules, 2010 at the

 earliest and the State Governments and the Union

 Territories were to take immediate steps to frame

 necessary rules under <a href="/doc/671947/" id="a_8">Section 15</a> of the Mines and

 Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_9">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957

 taking into consideration the recommendations of

 MoEF in its Report of March 2010 and model

 guidelines       framed  by     the  Ministry of  Mines,

 Government of India. In the meanwhile, it was

 ordered that leases of minor minerals, including

 their renewal for an area of less than five

 hectares       be     granted     by   the   States/Union

 Territories        only  after     getting  environmental

 clearance from MoEF. That direction was issued by

 Their Lordships obviously on the premise that the

 recommendations of MoEF included that the minimum

 size of mine lease should be five hectares [see

 paragraph      4.2    of  the     MoEF's  recommendation,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases    -: 14 :-</span>

 quoted at page 636 of the judgment - Deepak Kumar

 (supra)].
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">9.The aforesaid analysis of the fact situation and

 the efficacy of the Rules now in force would show

 the bargaining capacity of the local inhabitants

 of an area and the nature by herself, including

 the flora and fauna is comparably feeble when

 pitched       against     the      commercial   interest,

 including under the cover of developmental needs.

 We   say     so     because,    even  from   the  counter

 affidavit of the Chief Secretary, no anxiety is

 reflected        to    ensure     the    protection   and

 preservation of the environmental scenario and to

 recoup any loss to the ecological balance. The

 doctrines of sustainable development, including

 by operation and employment of the principles

 like polluter pay and the precautionary principle

 cannot be operated in the vacuum by the Executive

 merely       being      guided     by    the    so-called

 developmental needs. The statutory rules, though

 have a backing of the primary legislations, are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases    -: 15 :-</span>

 made principally on the basis of such advice,

 which have with the passage of time, demonstrated

 themselves         to   be     counter   productive   to

 sustainable development and preservation of the

 environment and ecological balance. Under such

 circumstances, also taking note of the different

 materials placed on record along with I.A.No.2667

 of 2010 in WP(C).No.218 of 2009, we are of the

 view that there has to be an audit of the

 environmental impact of the quarry and the metal

 crusher     unit      of the    establishment concerned,

 namely, Amity Rock Products Pvt. Ltd. This is all

 the more so because, the operations under the

 leasehold right and by virtue of the quarrying

 licences are near the forests, however near or

 far it may be. We cannot forget, as noted by the

 Chief Secretary in his affidavit dated 2.4.2011,

 that locating land for mining away from both

 human    settlement      and    forest boundaries  is  a

 difficult task. Therefore, though minerals and

 raw    materials       are  required   for   construction

 sector, a meaningful balance has to be struck.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases     -: 16 :-</span>

 Otherwise, there may not be anything to be left

 behind by this generation for those who are yet

 earnestly expected as the generations to come.



</p><p id="p_18">10.Contextually, we also deem it appropriate to

 point out that the provision in the Rules for

 paying     royalty     at  compounded    rates  does  not

 appeal. We say so because, unlike in the realm of

 tax, duties etc. the payment of consolidated

 royalty as now provided in the Concession Rules

 would be counter productive to the avowed efforts

 to    manage      the    environment,    maintaining  the

 ecological balance and providing for sustainable

 development. The Rules as they stand clearly show

 that    there       would  be      no regulation  by  the

 statutory authorities on the quantity of           rubble

 that will be removed by recourse to such payment

 of   royalty.        This  would,    obviously,  lead  to

 indiscreet quarrying. As already noted above,

 even according to the Chief Secretary, there is

 dearth of space in the State of Kerala and if

 excavated areas are available at random, that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases     -: 17 :-</span>

 would be dangerous. It is not out of place to

 recall     the      good  number    of   incidents where

 vehicles or people have fallen into such death

 traps.     The       geo-physical    challenges  to the

 terrains even at the onset of the monsoon would,

 obviously, have to be treated as an eye opener,

 subject of course to appropriate advice in that

 regard by scientists dealing with earth science,

 water management, forests etc. The effect and

 impact of mining activity on the environmental

 scenario is a matter on which there has to be a

 clear audit to prevent mishaps and calamities of

 larger order. As noticed by the Apex Court in

 Deepak Kumar (supra), though there may be need

 for building and construction materials, that is

 no excuse to override the larger need to sustain

 the environment. The principles of law stated in

 Deepak Kumar (supra) making reference to sand

 mining equally apply to all minor minerals since

 the law laid down therein, in its crux, is that

 the laws relating to minor minerals would apply

 to sand also.
</p>
<p id="p_19"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">WPC12150/97 &amp; con.cases     -: 18 :-</span>



 In the aforesaid circumstances, while we approve

 the views of the Chief Secretary in paragraph 10

 of his affidavit dated 2.4.2011 and direct that

 strict      obedience      in      compliance  to   those

 suggestions shall be immediately obtained, it is

 further ordered that renewal of any among the

 permits/licences/consents of the operator Amity

 Rock Products Pvt. Ltd. in the site in question

 shall be done only after a complete audit by the

 departments which are found to be relevant by the

 Ministry      of     Environment    and  Forests  in  the

 Government of India. The writ petitions ordered

 accordingly.
