                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.     This writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India is filed in public interest for challenging the

annexure to the Government Order dated 19th June 2020

(Annexure-B). Annexure-B contains guidelines for nomination,

the terms and Conditions of service of the Chairman, the

Members and the Member Secretary of the Karnataka State

Pollution Control Board (for short 'KSPCB').


</p><p id="p_3">      3.     The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

has strong objection to Clause (5) of the said guidelines which

provides that the Chairman shall be selected by a Search-cum-

Selection Committee consisting of the Hon'ble Chief Minister
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>



as the Chairman, the Hon'ble Minister for Forest, Ecology and

Environment as the Vice Chairman and Member, and the Chief

Secretary to the Government as the Secretary and Convenor of

the Committee.      He submitted that in what manner the

appointment of Chairpersons and Members of KSPCB is to be

made is laid down by the Apex Court in the judgment and order

dated 22nd September 2017 in Civil Appeal No.1359 of 2017 in

the case of <a href="/doc/97792257/" id="a_2">TECHI TAGI TARA vs RAJENDRA SINGH

BHANDARI AND OTHERS</a>. He further submitted that in many

cases like the Police Complaints Authority, Human Rights

Commission and other similar statutory bodies, there are

separate Search Committees and Selection Committees. His

submission is that in the present case, the Search Committee

and the Selection Committee are the same. His further

submission is that ideally, the Search Committee should be

entrusted with the job of shortlisting the eligible candidates and

the selection shall be left to another Selection Committee. He

submitted that paragraph 33 of the aforesaid decision of the

Apex Court lays down that if a person who is not qualified is

appointed as the Chairperson or a Member of a State Pollution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>



Control Board, any public spirited person can always approach

the Constitutional Court for seeking a writ of quo warranto. He

further submitted that if the Search Committee and the

Selection Committee are one and the same, there is every

likelihood that the person who does not meet the statutory or

constitutional   requirements      will   be   appointed     as   the

Chairperson or a member of the State Pollution Control Board.

He invited our attention to paragraphs 30 to 33 of the aforesaid

decision of the Apex Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      4.     We have carefully considered the submissions.

<a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_3">Section 4</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974 (for short '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water Act</a>') provides for constitution of

State Boards. <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_6">Section 4</a> of the Water Act reads thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "4.Constitution of State Boards -(1) The

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       (e) two persons to represent the companies or
       corporations owned, controlled or managed by

</p><p id="p_7">       [(f) a full-time member-secretary, possessing
       qualifications, knowledge and experience of
       scientific, engineering or management aspects
       of pollution control, to be appointed by the
       State Government]

      (3) Every State Board shall be a body
corporate with the name specified by the State
Government in the notification under sub-section(1),
having perpetual succession and a common seal with
power, subject to the provisions of this Act, to acquire,
hold and dispose of property and to contract, and
may, by the said name, sue or be sued.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   6</span><p id="p_8">



</p><p id="p_9">             (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
      section, no State Board shall be constituted for a
      Union territory and in relation to a Union territory, the
      Central Board shall exercise the powers and perform
      the functions of a State Board for that Union territory:

</p><p id="p_10">            Provided that in relation to any Union territory
      the Central Board may delegate all or any of its
      powers and functions under this sub-section to such
      person or body of persons as the Central Government
      may specify."
</p><p id="p_11">                    (underline supplied)

</p><p id="p_12">      5.       Hence, it follows that the power to appoint the

Chairman has to be exercised by the State Government by

nomination. The same is the case for the Members and the

full-time Member Secretary of KSPCB. Therefore, the power

to appoint the Chairman and the Members including the full-

time Secretary vests with the State Government.               At this

stage, we must refer to the aforesaid decision of the Apex

Court in the case of TECHI TAGI TARA (supra). Paragraphs

30, 32 and 33 of the said decision read thus:

</p><p id="p_13">               "30.     All    these     suggestions      and
           recommendations are more than enough for
           making expert and professional appointments to
           the SPCBs being geared towards establishing a
           professional body with multifarious tasks intended
           to preserve and protect the environment and
           consisting of experts.    Any contrary view or
           compromise in the appointments would render the
           exercise undertaken by all these committees
           completely irrelevant and redundant. Surely, it
           cannot be said that the committees were not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                          7</span>



constituted for the purpose of         putting their
recommendations in the dustbin.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       32. The concern really is not one of a lack
of professional expertise - there is plenty of it
available in the country - but the lack of dedication
and willingness to take advantage of the resources
available and instead benefit someone close to the
powers that be.        With this couldn't-care-less
attitude, the environment and public trust are the
immediate casualties. It is unlikely that with such
an attitude, any substantive effort can be made to
tackle the issues of environment degradation and
issues of pollution. Since the NGT was faced with
this situation, we can appreciate its frustration at
the scant regard for the law by some State
Government, but it is still necessary in such
situations to exercise restraint as cautioned in <a href="/doc/1879326/" id="a_7">State
of U.P. v. Jeet S. Bisht</a>.15.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       33.    Keeping the above in mind, we are of
the view that it would be appropriate, while setting
aside the judgment and order of the NGT, to direct
the Executive in all the States to frame appropriate
guidelines or recruitment rules within six months,
considering the institutional requirements of the
SPCBs and the law laid down by statute, by this
Court and as per the reports of various committees
and authorities and ensure that suitable
professionals and experts are appointed to the
SPCBs. Any damage to the environment could be
permanent and irreversible or at least long-lasting.
Unless (2007) 6 SCC 586 corrective measures are
taken at the earliest, the State Governments should
not be surprised if petitions are filed against the
State for the issuance of a writ of quo warranto in
respect of the appointment of the chairperson and
members of the SPCBs. We make it clear that it is
left open to public spirited individuals to move the
appropriate High Court for the issuance of the writ
of quo wattanto if any person who does not meet
the statutory or constitutional requirements is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 8</span>



           appointed as a Chairperson or a member of any
           SPCB or is presently continuing as such."


</p><p id="p_16">      6.      Hence, the Apex Court laid emphasis on the fact

that the State Pollution Control Boards must consist of suitable

professionals and experts. The Apex Court observed that any

compromise in the appointment would render the exercise

undertaken by the State Boards irrelevant and redundant. It is

further observed that due to the failure to appoint experts in the

field and professionals on the body like SPCBs, there is a

likelihood of damage to the environment which could be

permanent. The Apex Court made it clear that in the event the

Chairman or the Members of SPCBs appointed by the State

Government do not meet the statutory or constitutional

requirements, it is always open for a public spirited person to

seek a writ of quo warranto.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      7.      Perusal of the order dated 19th June 2020 passed

by the State Government shows that in the preamble, there is a

specific reference to the aforesaid judgment and order of the

Apex Court dated 22nd September 2017 which lays down the

requirement of the State Government framing appropriate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span>



guidelines. Clause (2) of the guidelines which are impugned in

this writ petition shows that the State Government is conscious

of the qualifications required for the post of Chairman

prescribed by Clause (a) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> of the

Water Act.       Even Clause (3) of the guidelines which

specifically lays down the qualifications shows that the

qualifications laid down in the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a> as well as in the

aforesaid decision of the Apex Court have been taken into

consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      8.     As stated earlier, the Chairman is to be appointed

by the State Government by nomination. There is nothing in

the statute which lays down that the Search Committee and the

Selection Committee cannot be one and the same. Therefore,

per se, there is no illegality in Clause (5) of the guidelines even

though the Search-cum-Selection Committee is headed by the

Hon'ble Chief Minister. It is obvious that the Committee will be

bound by the guidelines laid down in the aforesaid decision of

the Apex Court as well as the qualifications laid down in Clause

</p><p id="p_20">(a) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_10">Section 4</a> of the Water Act. We are

sure that the Search-cum-Selection Committee will select only
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                10</span>



those candidates who are well qualified and are possessing the

qualifications as laid down by the Apex Court as well as the

aforesaid provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Water Act</a>.       If the Committee

recommends appointment of a person who is not eligible in

terms of the order of the Apex Court or who does not fulfill the

qualifications laid down in Clause (a) of sub-section (2) of

<a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_12">Section 4</a> of the Water Act, as held by the Apex Court, a public

spirited person can always seek a writ of quo warranto. We,

therefore, do not find anything illegal in the guidelines laid

down by the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      9.    Subject to what is observed above, this is not a

case where interference can be made with the guidelines

issued by the State Government in terms of the decision of the

Apex Court. Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of.
