                           the SIDCUL to the extent of 50% each. Dispute of

          Rs.1 lakh as honorarium to the learned Amicus Curiae.
          Remaining amount may be spent on restoration of
          environment, as per norms and action plan.”

       These appeals are filed principally challenging the direction

No.4 under which, after assessing damage to the environment and

inhabitants at Rs.1 crore, further direction was passed directing

CETP    and the SIDCUL     to deposit the amount in question. One of the

submissions raised in the appeals is to the effect that                      before

passing      such   direction,    opportunity       was   not   afforded   to   the

appellants of hearing in connection with the report of the CPCB.
