            -------------------------------------------
                   W.P.(C) No.16708 OF 2007
           ----------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 17th day of June, 2011

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner and her family are residents of a house in

Ward No.1 of the 4th respondent Panchayat. In property adjacent

to the petitioner's residence, the 7th respondent is running an

auditorium. According to the petitioner, the pollution emanating

from the kitchen of the auditorium is so unbearable that the

petitioner and her family find it extremely difficult to reside in

their house.   The petitioner contends that as is evident from

Exts.P4 to P8 and P11 series, the 7th respondent was directed by

the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to apply for a consent

under the Kerala Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>

1974 and also to take appropriate measures to contain the

pollution caused by the kitchen of the auditorium, which the 7th

respondent has not cared to do so far.                  In the above

circumstances, the petitioner has filed this writ petition seeking

the following reliefs:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "i)    to issue a writ of mandamus directing the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C)No.16708/07                   2</span>

              respondents to take effective steps for shifting
              the kitchen in the unit owned by the 7th
              respondent from the present position to a
              position which is at least at a distance of 25
              meters from the petitioner's residential house;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              ii)   to issue a writ of mandamus directing
              the    respondents    to   take    appropriate
              proceedings for prosecution and levy of find
              against the 7th respondent.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">              iii)  to issue a writ of mandamus directing
              the respondents to close down the kitchen
              now operated by the 7th respondent"</blockquote><p id="p_2">



</p><p id="p_3">      2.    Except the 4th respondent, no other respondent has

filed any counter affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.    I have considered the contentions of the petitioner

as well as the contentions of the counsel for the                  4th

respondent, who only have chosen to present themselves for

arguments, apart from the learned Government Pleader.               In

the counter affidavit of the 4th respondent, they vaguely

submitted that certain directions have been issued to the 7th

respondent and the 7th respondent has informed the Panchayat

that he has complied with the said directions and therefore, in

the light of the subsequent developments there is no chance

for any pollution from the kitchen.       But, it is the definite case

of the petitioner in the writ petition that the Pollution Control

Board has specifically directed the 7th respondent to apply for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C)No.16708/07               3</span>

consent under the Kerala Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and that the 7th respondent has neither

applied for the consent nor complies with the directions of the

Pollution Control Board to take measures to contain the

pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.    Neither the 7th respondent nor the Pollution Control

Board has filed any pleadings in this writ petition controverting

the specific allegations raised by the petitioner. I specifically

asked the learned counsel for the 4th respondent as to whether

the Panchayat has verified as to whether the 7th respondent

has obtained consent from the Pollution Control Board.        He

could not give any definite answer. The counter affidavit of

the 4th respondent does not disclose that the Panchayat has

verified that the 7th respondent has obtained a consent from

the Pollution Control Board. In such circumstances, I have to

assume that the allegations of the petitioner in the writ

petition are true and that the 7th respondent has not complied

with the directions issued by the Pollution Control Board. The

vague statement of the 4th respondent unsupported by any

materials    on   record that   in the light     of  subsequent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C)No.16708/07               4</span>

developments there is no chance of any pollution from the

kitchen cannot be accepted on face value. As pointed out by

the learned counsel for the petitioner, the tenor of the counter

affidavit is that the Panchayat has simply accepted the version

of the 7th respondent. There is no averment in the counter

affidavit that pursuant to the letter stated to have been

received from the 7th respondent, an inspection of the premises

was conducted by the Panchayat and they found that there is

no pollution.    That being so, such vague statements of the 4th

respondent cannot be accepted on face value.        In the said

circumstances, I am satisfied that the Pollution Control Board

and the Panchayat had failed to perform their statutory duties

in taking appropriate action against the 7th respondent for not

complying with the pollution laws.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     Accordingly, this writ petition is disposed of with a

direction to respondents 2 to 4 to see that appropriate action

is taken against the 7th respondent for not complying with the

pollution laws and see that the 7th respondent complies with

the directions and statutory requirements, as expeditiously as

possible, at any rate, within one month from the date of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C)No.16708/07             5</span>

receipt of a copy of this judgment. Until the 7th respondent

complies with the Pollution laws the 7th respondent shall not

run the auditorium and the respondents 2 to 4 shall ensure the

same.
