                Dated this the 23rd July, 2015

                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Shaffique, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     This Writ Petition has been filed in the form of public

interest litigation seeking the following relief:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "To issue a writ, direction or order in the

     nature of mandamus or such other appropriate writ,

     direction or order commanding the respondents 1 to

     3 to take immediate steps to implement the

     Exhibits P6, P7, P8, P9, P19 and P13 in its letter and

     spirit and to prosecute the 4th respondent and other

     officers responsible for causing the said activities

     and recover them the damages caused on account

     of its illegal working."</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">     2. Exhibit P6 is a show cause notice issued by the

Kerala State Pollution Control Board dated 17.12.2014 to

the fourth respondent hospital, indicating that on

investigation by the Board officials on 15.12.2014 and

17.12.2014 it was noted that the sewage treatment plant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">   W.P(C).5364/15             2</span>

was not functioning and the untreated sewage was found

discharged into the nearby pond. Accordingly, the fourth

respondent was called upon to show cause why they shall

not be proceeded against under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_1">Section 33</a> of the Water

(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. Exhibit P7 is

a letter issued by the District Medical Officer (Health) to

the District Collector on 19.12.2014 with reference to the

very same sewage complaint           on account    of the

functioning of the fourth respondent hospital and giving

notice to comply with the suggestions stated thereunder.

It was indicated that excess sewage was pumped to the

pond called 'Arachikulam' in the ownership of the hospital

and to the public drainage situated on the southern side

of the hospital causing pollution to the wells in the

locality.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     3. Exhibit P8 is the notice issued by the Panchayat to

the Administrator of the hospital indicating the very same

issues. Exhibit P9 is another notice dated 26.12.2014

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">   W.P(C).5364/15             3</span>

calling upon the fourth respondent to stop admission of

new inpatients and discharge the admitted inpatients

within 15 days.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     4. Pursuant to similar complaints raised by the

people of the locality, action was taken by the District

Collector and after obtaining report from the Pollution

Control Board, direction was issued to stop new

admissions (inpatients) in the hospital until further orders.

It was further stated that considering the emergent

medical situation, the District Medical Officer was directed

to implement the order by giving 15 days time to the

hospital. In Exhibit P10 it was indicated that on a

reference to the reports of District Medical Officer and

Environmental Engineer and on inspection of the site, if

the Hospital is functioning in the present condition, it will

cause severe critical contamination problems and thereby

it will cause to public health problems. Further it is

observed that it will take atleast 4 months to solve the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">   W.P(C).5364/15            4</span>

problem by constructing a proper sewage plant. Hence, it is

highly necessary to take imperative action with respect to

this serious contamination subject. Exhibit P11 is the

consent refusal order issued by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_7">     5. Exhibit P13 is another order issued by the District

Collector by which it was directed that until the directions

are complied with, patients to the inpatient department

should not be admitted and new admissions shall be

started only after clearance is obtained from the Pollution

Control Board. It was also directed that the hospital

authorities    should  undertake   modern     infrastructural

developmental activities including sewage treatment plant

for treating the existing capacity of 275-300 inpatients in

the hospital and the same should be after the approval

and under the supervision of the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_8">     6. Counter affidavit has been filed by the fourth

respondent inter alia stating that pursuant to the

directions issued by the Pollution Control Board, the fourth

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">   W.P(C).5364/15             5</span>

respondent had taken appropriate steps to comply with

the conditions imposed by them. It was also stated that

the Pollution Control Board had given consent to operate

120 beds as per order dated 7.4.2015 with validity upto

30.6.2015 on certain conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     7. By an interim order dated 1.6.2015 this Court had

directed     the Pollution Control Board to carry on an

inspection of the hospital after due information to the

local authorities and submit a report before this Court.

Pursuant to the said direction, the Pollution Control Board

had submitted a report dated 2.7.2015 before this Court.

The said report reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "The 4th respondent hospital was inspected on

     24.6.2015 along with 3rd respondent. The Sewage

     Treatment Plant was functioning at the time of

     inspection. Board had issued Consent to Operate for

     120 beds on 7.4.2015 with validity up to 30.6.2015;</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">     a copy of which is produced herewith and marked

     Exhibit R2(a). They had not installed micro filtration

     system as per condition no.3.2(a) of the consent on

     24.6.2015. They are now reconstructing their

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P(C).5364/15               6</span>

 previous treated water collection tank without

 Board's approval. This respondent had directed the

 4th respondent to stop the above work vide letter

 no.PCB/KNR/ICO/282/2015 dated 27.5.2015; a copy

 of which is produced herewith and marked as Exhibit

 R2(b).     During   the   inspection  conducted    on

 24.6.2015,     the   construction  work   was   found

 progressing in spite of the direction by this

 respondent. The treated effluent sample collected at

 the time of inspection complies with the prescribed

 standards. Although the bed strength permitted is

 120 more than 120 IP is functioning.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        Based    on   the  inspection  conducted    on

 24.6.2015 direction was given to the hospital vide

 letter no.PCB/KNR/ICO/282/2015 dated 24.6.2015 to

 stop the modification work of the old treated water

 tank, a copy of which is produced herewith and

 marked as Exhibit R2(e). The hospital authorities

 vide their letter dated 29.6.2015 &amp; 30.6.2015

 reported that they have complied with the condition

 no.3.2(a) of the consent and hence inspection was

 again     conducted    on  2.7.2015   to  verify  the

 compliance.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        It was found that they have installed micro

 filtration system and is under trial run. The

 compliance of condition no.3.2 is as follows:

</p><p id="p_14">  a)      Micro filtration system installed. Treated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">   W.P(C).5364/15              7</span>

           effluent is stated to be reused for irrigation
           and balance into soak pits.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      b) Laundry is not operating.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      c) Sewage Treatment Plant sludge is stated to be
           disposed through bio gas plant.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      d) Both FABS are working."
</p>
<p id="p_18">     8. The main         apprehension    expressed by the

petitioner in the Writ Petition is regarding the pollution

that was being caused on account of the existence of the

sewage treatment plant. Going by Exhibit P13 order of the

District Collector, it is clear that the restriction had been

imposed based on an opinion expressed by the Pollution

Control Board. It is also stated in Exhibit P13 that the

restrictions have been imposed subject to opinion to be

expressed by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_19">     9. It is now stated in the aforesaid report that the

fourth respondent had complied with the requirements in

the consent to operate issued on 7.4.2015. The treated

effluent sample collected at the time of inspection also

complied with the prescribed standards. Under such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">   W.P(C).5364/15             8</span>

circumstances, it is evident that the fourth respondent

had taken appropriate measures to ensure that the

sewage treatment plant was functioning properly and in

accordance with the directions issued by the Pollution

Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_20">     10. It is not in dispute that as far as the consent to

operate is concerned, the consent was valid only upto

30.6.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     11. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf

of the fourth respondent submits that the application for

renewal of the consent to operate along with the required

amount has already been submitted to the Pollution

Control Board, which is pending consideration.

</p><p id="p_22">     12. Having regard to the fact that appropriate steps

had already been taken by the fourth respondent in the

light of the directions issued by the Pollution Control

Board, we do not think that as matters stand now,

direction to implement Exhibits P6, P7, P8, P9, P10 or P13

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">   W.P(C).5364/15            9</span>

is required as prayed for by the petitioner. However, it is

made clear that if there is any allegation of pollution on

account of the functioning of the fourth respondent

hospital, it shall always be open for the petitioner or any

other person to bring to the notice of the Pollution Control

Board or the District Collector as the case may be. It is

further made clear that the Pollution Control Board shall

make periodical visits and ensure that there is compliance

of the statutory requirements.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     With the above observations, the Writ Petition is

closed.
