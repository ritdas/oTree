No.277 of 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The revenue has filed an appeal to challenge orders passed by

the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (B), and the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), Ludhiana, holding that

expenditure incurred by the assessee in excavating a drain to discharge

effluents, is revenue in nature.

            The assessee runs a paper mill at Ahmedgarh, District Sangrur,

and, therefore, discharges effluents. During the previous year relevant to

the assessment year 1996-97, the assessee applied to the Pollution Control

Board and the Forest Department, for permission to discharge effluents

into the Tallewal drain. The Department of Environment and Forest vide

letter dated 11.09.1995, prepared a proposal to allow excavation of an open

drain, through forest land, to enable the assessee to discharge effluents into

the Tallewal drain, subject to the following conditions: -

             A perusal of the approval reveals that the assessee was allowed

to excavate a drain through forest land. The legal status and ownership of

forest land remained unchanged. The assessee was to pay Rs.1.62 lacs to

the Forest Department for raising compensatory afforestation on both sides

of drain. The forest land can only be used for the purpose for it is being

permitted.     The drain if required, is to be lined to avoid any

seepage/leakage of effluent and land transferred in lieu of the forest land

was to be declared a protected forest/reserved land.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">             The assessee filed a return of income, for assessment year

1996-97. The return was processed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Section 143(1)(a)</a> of the Income

Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') and thereafter selected

for scrutiny. After issuance of notices under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">Sections 143(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1650322/" id="a_3">142(1)</a> of

the Act, alongwith a detailed questionnaire particularly with respect to the

expenditure incurred, for excavating the drain the Assessing Officer after

referring to a large number of judgments recorded a finding that by

constructing the drain, a benefit of enduring nature has accrued to the

assessee and, therefore, Rs.70,79,862/- incurred as expenditure to excavate

the drain has to be treated as capital expenditure.

</p><p id="p_8">             The assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeals), Ludhiana, urging that as land diverted by the Forest

Department for allowing discharge of effluents into the Tallewal drain

continues to belong to Forest Department, the mere fact that the assessee

has transferred land in favour of the Forest Department, or that the assessee
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                            [5]



is allowed to use the land, cannot raise an inference that expenditure

incurred to excavate the drain is capital expenditure. The Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeals), reversed the order passed by the Assessing Officer

by holding that the expenditure is revenue in nature. A relevant extract

from the order, reads as follows: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">            "6.      The matter has been considered by me. It is an uncontroverted
            fact that the appellant had to somehow find a way to discharge its
            affluent in the Tallewaal drain and the only way to do so was
            construction of a drain through the forest department's land. The
            construction of the drain was carried out by the appellant and the
            documents relating to this show that even though the drain was being
            used by the appellant there were no exclusive rights which were given
            to the appellant. In fact the agreement is silent on the exclusive rights
            with the appellant. It is another matter that there is no other factory
            which existed in the vicinity which can make use of this drain.</blockquote><p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">            Therefore, just because the appellant is making use of the drain would
            not make it a capital asset of the company. The AO's objection that
            cases relied upon can be distinguished as in those cases only
            contribution had been made by various assessees for carrying out
            capital work would not be material to the issue. Whether the assessee
            carries out the work himself or whether it makes contribution to
            another agency would not be vary material and what has to be seen is
            whether any capital asset of an enduring nature had come into
            existence. In the case of the appellant, no such capital asset had come
            into existence as it cannot claim any proprietorship rights over the
            drain. I am also inclined to accept the plea of the appellant that the
            drain being KACHA in nature that is, mainly the side and base being
            of mud only requires extensive maintenance for its up-keep and did
            not constitute any capital asset. However this is not very material to
            the issue.    The fact remains that the appellant's claim would be
            covered by the judicial pronouncements relied upon by the appellant
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                                   [6]



            which are narrated above. Hence it is held that the appellant would be
            entitled to relief of Rs.70,79,862/-."
</p>
<p id="p_11">
            A perusal of above extract reveals that the Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeals), Ludhiana, has essentially held that a capital asset of

enduring nature has not come into existence and though the drain is being

used by the assessee, it does not have any exclusive rights to the drain.

</p><p id="p_12">            Aggrieved by this order, the revenue filed an appeal. The

Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (B), dismissed the

appeal by holding as follows: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">            "17.... Thus, we are of the opinion that by incurring an expenditure on the
            construction of drain on the forest land, the assessee has neither acquired any
            capital asset nor benefit of enduring nature in the commercial sense. The fact
            that assessee was allowed exclusive use of land for discharge of effluents was
            immaterial as the assessee can use such land only for a limited purpose. It is
            also not relevant whether the benefit for using the drain for discharge of
            effluents was to run for a number of years or for a short period.            The
            expenditure incurred has neither increased the profitability of the assessee not
            its production. The expenditure so incurred was necessarily for the purpose of
            its business and is allowable as revenue expenditure. We, therefore, confirm
            the order of Ld. CIT(A) and dismiss this ground of appeal of the revenue."</blockquote><p id="p_13">


</p><p id="p_14">            A perusal of the aforesaid findings reveals that the Income Tax

Appellate Tribunal, has held that as expenditure was incurred by the

assessee for its business, the fact that the assessee has exclusive use of the

drain and has transferred private land does not bring a capital asset of

enduring nature into existence. The expense incurred on excavating the

drain is, therefore, revenue in nature.
</p><p id="p_15"> ITA No.277 of 2004                                                           [7]



            The revenue filed ITA No.277 of 2004, which was allowed in

favour of the revenue by holding that the expenditure is capital in nature.

The assessee filed Civil Appeal No.5855 of 2008, which was allowed by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court, on 08.11.2006 by holding that the basic

question which the High Court was required to answer was "whether the

assessee had acquired assets of enduring benefit?", which is required to be

answered after examining terms and conditions on which the department

had permitted the assessee to construct an open drain which runs

approximately fourteen kilometers through forest land etc. The matter was

remitted to the High Court for adjudication afresh.             The appeal was

admitted on 06.04.2010 after framing the following substantial questions

of law: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">            "I. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal
            was justified in law in allowing the expenditure of Rs.70,79,862/-

            construction of drainage for disposal of effluents by treating the same
            as Revenue Expenditure, while ignoring the fact that the assessee had

<p id="p_19">            Counsel for the revenue submits that the assessee has

admittedly constructed a drain to discharge effluents into the Tallewal

drain and has shown expenditure in the building account. The terms and

conditions of the approval granted for diversion of forest land reveals that

the assessee has been granted unhindered access and exclusive use of

forest land. In lieu thereof, the assessee has transferred land to the Forest

Department. The mere fact that the transfer is not absolute or does not

refer to any time frame, or does not transfer proprietary rights, is irrelevant.

The assessee has incurred expense for excavating a fourteen kilometer long

drain, a capital asset. The fact that the drain may be necessary for the

assessee's business, is irrelevant as the assessee has created a capital asset

of enduring nature that would enable the assessee to discharge effluents

into the Tallewal drain, during each subsequent assessment year. The fact

that discharge of effluents is necessary for the assessee's business, does not

detract from the fact that the assessee has created an asset that would

confer benefit of an enduring nature. It is further submitted that though the

approval does not record that land is to be exclusively used by the

appellant but as no-one else has been granted permission to use forest land.

The land is used as a drain by the assessee alone.     The fact that land has

approval coupled with the admitted excavation of the drain clearly

indicates that a benefit of enduring nature has been brought into existence.

It is further submitted that ownership or title is irrelevant while considering

the controversy as what is of significance is whether the assessee has been

conferred benefit of an enduring nature. Counsel for the revenue places

<p id="p_27">            Counsel for the assessee/respondent submits that the land

provided for excavating the drain continues to vest in the Forest

Department. The appellant has not been conferred proprietary rights and is

merely allowed to use the land to excavate a drain for discharge of

effluents. The discharge of effluents is integral to the appellant's business,

thereby clearly proving the revenue nature of the expenditure. The control

of the Forest Department is established by the fact that it has charged
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                   [ 10 ]



money for plantation and maintenance of the embankment, thereby clearly

indicating that ownership and control of the land continues to vest in the

State of Punjab with a mere right of user being conferred upon the

assessee. In the absence of any proprietary rights or any right to use the

drain for any other purpose, the expenditure which is necessary for the

business of the assessee is a revenue expenditure. It is further submitted

that as approval can be withdrawn at any time, the assessee does not

possess exclusive rights of user. The mere fact that no other factory is

located in the vicinity, cannot raise an inference that the expenditure

incurred is capital in nature. The fact that a drain has been excavated,

would not raise an inference that a benefit of enduring nature has been

conferred upon the appellant. Counsel for the assessee relies upon the

</p><p id="p_44">            The question that lies at the base of this controversy and would

answer the substantial questions of law is nature of the benefit derived by

the assessee by constructing a fourteen kilometer long drain for discharge

of effluents. The question has to be answered in the context of rights

conferred upon the assessee by the permission granted to use forest land,

the nature of its business, the nature of the asset created, the relation

between the assessee's business and the asset and the nature of the benefit

derived by the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_45">            The question posed namely whether expenditure is "capital" or

"revenue" is a question that has vexed Courts and tax authorities alike but

in our endeavour to search for certainty and curtail discretion we tend to
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                             [ 12 ]



look for cast iron tests and infallible formulate, a course fraught with

danger of missing out a crucial factor peculiar to a case or curtailing the

exercise of bonafide discretion. The fine line that separates capital from

revenue expenditure is extremely porous as depending upon the facts and

circumstances of a case, an expenditure which may appear to be revenue in

one case may validly be held to be capital in another.

</p><p id="p_46">             The factors and tests enumerated in judicial precedents, are not

exhaustive but merely illustrative of what may or may not be relevant in

determining whether an expense is revenue or capital. No single precedent

or factor would fully answer the question whether an expenditure is

revenue or capital. A bundle of factors coupled with the peculiar facts of

each case that would necessarily be determinative of whether expenditure

is capital or revenue. To place the mode and manner of determining

whether an expenditure is "revenue" or "capital" into a straight jacket

formula is well nigh impossible.
</p>
<p id="p_47">             Before we record our final opinion, it would be necessary to

quote a paragraph from a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court i.e.

"Alembic Chemical Works Ltd." case (supra), so as to place the

predicament faced while determining whether expenditure is revenue or

capital: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">             "In the infinite variety of situational diversities in which the concept
             of what is capital expenditure and what is revenue arises, it is well
             nigh impossible to formulate any general rule, even in the generality
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                           [ 13 ]



            of cases, sufficiently accurate and reasonably comprehensive, to draw
            any clear line of demarcation. However, some broad and general
            tests have been suggested form time to time to ascertain on which
            side of the line the outlay in any particular case might reasonably be
            held to fall. These tests are generally efficacious and serve as useful
            servants; but as masters they tend to be over exacting."</blockquote><p id="p_48">


</p><p id="p_49">            In order to solve this riddle, whether an expense is revenue or

capital, it would be necessary to peruse relevant precedents so as to

ascertain whether any binding principle has been set down for determining

whether an expenditure is capital or revenue. A judgment of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, in "Assam Bengal Cement V/s Commissioner of Income

Tax", 1955 (27) ITR 34 (SC), may throw some light on this controversy as

it lays down a test to determine whether expenditure is capital or revenue,

in the following terms: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">            ".....The question however arises for consideration where expenditure
            is incurred while the business is going on and is not incurred either
            by extension of the business or for the substantial replacement of its
            equipment. Such expenditure can be looked at either from the point
            of view of what is acquired or from the point of view of what is the
            source from which the expenditure is incurred. If the expenditure is
            made for acquiring or bringing into existence an asset or advantage
            for the enduring benefit of the business it is properly attributable to
            capital and is of the nature of capital expenditure. If on the other
            hand it is made not for the purpose of bringing into existence any
            such asset or advantage but for running the business or working it
            with a view to produce the profits it is a revenue expenditure. If any
            such asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business is
            thus acquired or brought into existence it would be immaterial
            whether the source of the payment was the capital or the income of
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                                [ 14 ]



            the concern or whether the payment was made once and for all or was
            made periodically. The aim and object of the expenditure would
            determine the character of the expenditure whether it is a capital
            expenditure or a revenue expenditure. The source or the manner of
            the payment would then of non consequence."</blockquote><p id="p_50">


</p><p id="p_51">            In J.K.Cotton Manufactures Ltd. V/s Commissioner of Income

Tax, Lucknow, (1975) 101 ITR 221, while considering this issue, the

Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">            "Several tests that have been evolved over the years by this Court as also
            the other High Courts may be briefly formulated as follows: -
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">            (1)      Bringing into existence an asset or advantage of enduring nature
            would lead to the inference that the expenditure disbursed is of a capital
            nature. These terms, such as "asset" or "advantage of enduring nature"
            are, however, purely descriptive rather than definitive and no rule of
            universal application can be laid down. Ultimately, the question will
            have to depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, namely,
            quality and quantum of the amount, the position of the parties, the object
            of the transaction which has impact on the business, the nature of trade
            for which the expenditure is incurred and the purpose thereof, etc.

            (2)      An item of disbursement may be regarded as of a capital nature
            when it is relatable to a fixed asset or capital, whereas the circulating
            capital or stock-in-trade would be treated as revenue receipt.         Lord
            Haldane in John Smith &amp; Son V. Moore, (1921) 12 TC 266 (HL) has
            aptly and adroitly explained the terms "fixed capital" and "circulating
            capital" thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">                             Fixed capital is what the assessee turns into profit by
            keeping it in his own possession and circulating capital is what he make
            profit of by parting with it and letting it change masters."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">            (3)      Expenditure relating to framework of business is generally capital

            expenditure."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25"> ITA No.277 of 2004                                                        [ 15 ]



            Thus, while considering whether a particular expenditure is

capital or revenue in nature, we venture to hold that one would have to

consider (a) the nature of the business (b) the relationship of the asset bears

to the assessee's business (c) the nature and extent of expenditure (d) the

rights available to the assessee viz. the asset so created (e) the ownership

of the asset (f) whether the asset has resulted in an enduring benefit to the

assessee (g) the amount of expenditure incurred by the assessee, and (h)

whether the asset so created has relation to the profits of business, keeping

in mind that these factors are merely illustrative and not exhaustive, and no

one factor is conclusive or determinative of the nature of the expense.</blockquote><p id="p_52">

</p><p id="p_53">            A perusal of these factors and other precedents, cited by

counsel for the parties reveal that a test generally applied while

determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue, succinctly put, is if

the expenditure leads to acquiring or bringing into existence an asset or an

advantage of an enduring benefit to the business, it would be capital but if

the expenditure is to the contrary, it would be revenue expenditure. But

this test alone may also not be sufficient.
</p>
<p id="p_54">            We proceed to apply these factors and determine the nature of

the expense. The terms and conditions of the approval granted to the

assessee reveal that the assessee is allowed to excavate a drain through

forest land and in return is required to transfer non-forest land by getting a

mutation sanctioned in favour of the Forest Department.             The land

transferred to the Forest Department would then be declared as a protected
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                       [ 16 ]



forest. The land provided for excavation of the drain would continue to

vest in the Forest Department and can only be used for discharge of

effluents. The Forest Department shall raise compensatory afforestation on

both sides of drain with an amount of Rs.1.62 lacs to be paid by the

assessee. The approval can be withdrawn if the assessee is in breach of

any of the conditions. The assessee, in essence, is entitled to unhindered

and absolute use of the land for excavating a drain to discharge effluents

from its factory. The approval, however, does not transfer proprietary

rights to the assessee but transfers in its entirety possessory rights and

though it limits user for the purpose of discharge of effluents, does not

contain any clause that enables the State to interfere in the user of the land,

till such time as the assessee continues to comply with terms and

conditions of the approval. The assessee, thus, has complete and exclusive

control of the land for the purpose of discharging effluents. The assessee

has, admittedly, excavated a drain though on land given to it by the State

which will be used by the assessee from year to year. The question

whether the expenditure is capital or revenue, would have to be determined

on the touchstone of whether excavation of the drain has conferred benefit

of an enduring nature.
</p>
<p id="p_55">            The discharge of treated water within permissible level of

effluents is a statutory obligation required to be fulfilled by the assessee in

accordance with parameters set out by the Punjab Pollution Control Board.

The assessee has been allowed to excavate the drain through forest land in
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                                 [ 17 ]



order to meet these parameters. Failure of the assessee to provide for a

suitable means of discharge of effluents would necessarily result in the

shutting down of its factory for violation of provisions of the statue, rules,

regulations and norms framed by the Pollution Control Board.                         The

expense incurred by the assessee has brought into existence a capital asset

which the assessee shall use from year to year for discharge of effluents

and would, therefore, enure to the benefit of the assessee from year to year.

A Full Bench of the Kerala High Court, while considering a case where an

assessee was statutorily obliged to set up a water pollution treatment plant,

has held in "Commissioner of Income Tax V/s Glen View Rubber Co. (P)

Ltd., (2007) 291, ITR 1, held that a water treatment plant when installed in

compliance with statutory requirements, confers an enduring advantage

upon the assessee and as the advantage so conferred would enure for all

succeeding assessment orders, expenditure incurred on its operation and

maintenance may be revenue but expenditure spent on installation of the

plant confers benefit of an enduring nature and is, therefore, capital

expenditure. A relevant extract reads as follows: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">            "7. We are of the view, when water treatment plant is installed permanently
            in compliance with the statutory requirement, the same would attain the
            character of capital expenditure. Installation of water treatment plant of the
            permanent nature has come into existence with enduring advantage to the
            assessee. Water treatment plant is a chargeable asset installed to prevent
            pollution.   The question as to whether by installation of this plant,
            production of centrifuged latex has been increased or not is immaterial.</blockquote><p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">            Failure to comply with the statutory requirements of installation of water
            treatment plant would lead to closure of the factor and hence there is no
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                               [ 18 ]



            question of any increase in the manufacture or production in the plant. The
            water treatment plant installed by the assessee consists of various chambers
            namely equalisation tank, primary settling tank, mixing channel, aeration
            tank, secondary settling tank and drying bed.       The plant installed is a
            permanent tangible asset of enduring advantage to the assessee, of a free
            pollution-free atmosphere and environment. Benefit/advantage deprived by
            the assessee is not only for the year under consideration but for all
            succeeding assessment years.      Expenditure spent for its operating and
            maintenance costs may be revenue, but the expenditure spent for installation
            of plant which is of an enduring nature is always capital."


            We are inclined to concur with the ratio laid down in the

aforesaid judgment as any expenditure incurred in complying with

statutory requirements particularly where the asset concerned would enure

to the benefit of the assessee from year to year, would necessarily be an

asset of enduring nature and, therefore, categorised as capital expenditure.

The mere fact that the land is not owned by the assessee, is irrelevant as by

excavating the drain through forest land on the basis of approval granted

by the Forest Department, the assessee has been able to overcome statutory

requirements for release of effluents as prescribed under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Pollution

Control Act</a>, the rules and notifications etc. issued thereunder, thereby

conferring benefit of an enduring nature that would be available to the

assessee from year to year. The fact that the assessee has transferred land

to the forest department or has paid money for compensatory forestry does

not denude the assessee's rights vis-a-vis the asset created.

</p><p id="p_58">            A perusal of the approval granted to the assessee, consideration

of the nature of the expense incurred and the statutory obligations for
 ITA No.277 of 2004                                                            [ 19 ]



discharge of effluents, in our considered opinion, leave no ambiguity that

expense incurred upon construction of the drain for release of effluents

have conferred benefit of an enduring nature upon the assessee. We,

therefore, answer this question in favour of the revenue and against the

appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_59">             The second question need not detain us for long as even

otherwise, it was answered by the Division Bench in its earlier judgments.

It was not interfered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The second question

was answered in the following terms: -

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">                       93. It is also a fact that the assessee was not allowed credit

                       It is also a fact that inspite of best efforts, the assessee
                       could not obtain TDS certificates. Thus, it was a case of
                       loss which has arisen to the assessee during the course
                       of its business. In the case of Sutlej Cotton Mills Limited

                       loss and the true nature and character of loss. If the loss
                       occurred during the course of carrying on the business, it

                                         CIT</a> supports the case of the assessee. We do not find any
                                         infirmity in the order of Ld. CIT(A). Same is upheld and
