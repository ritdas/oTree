THIS WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON

 WP(C).No. 19555 of 2015

                                            2

                                     JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">Hrishikesh Roy, C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         Heard the learned counsel Sri.K.N.Sasidharan Nair appearing for the petitioner.

The respondents are represented by the learned Senior Government Pleader Sri.Surin

George Ipe.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       2. Claiming to be a conscious citizen, the petitioner has approached the court

with this Public Interest Litigation challenging the Government orders (Ext.P5 series) on

the River Bed Sand Mining permission, accorded under the Kerala Protection of River

Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001 read with the Rules 2002, framed

thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       3. The learned counsel for the petitioner refers to <a href="/doc/60071241/" id="a_1">Deepak Kumar and Others v.

State of Haryana and Others</a> reported in (2012) 4 SCC 629 to point out that the

Supreme Court had issued various directions for extraction of River Sand, including

securing of Environmental Clearance for any such mining activity. Mr.Sasidharan Nair

also refers to the Guideline issued on 24.12.2013 (Ext.P4) by the Ministry of

Environment and Forests, detailing the conditions under which sand mining projects are

to be sanctioned. According to the petitioner, the Government of Kerala has failed to

discharge its responsibility, by not insisting on the Environmental Clearance for River

Sand Mining.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       4. The learned Government Pleader Sri.Surin George Ipe on the other hand

adverts to the Government Order dated 21.2.2014 (Ext.R3(a)) and the follow up order

dated 19.3.2014 (Ext.R3(b)) to point out that the Kerala Government has taken

adequate precautionary measure to allow sand mining on the River Beds, in accordance

with the Kerala Protection of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001

read the Rules.   He specifically projects that only after Environmental Clearance is

secured, final sanction for sand mining is accorded by the authorities. According to
 WP(C).No. 19555 of 2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                             3</span>

him, river sand is allowed to be extracted only with adherence to the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment

(Protection) Act</a>, 1986, the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1984, the <a href="/doc/548841/" id="a_5">Biological Diversity Act</a>, 2002,

the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, 2008 and all the Statutory

Rules and Notifications.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       5.   In the above context, the Government's communication dated 16.7.2015

(Ext.R3(d)), addressed to the District Collector(s) indicates that obtaining the

Environmental Clearance is made mandatory, from the State Environment Impact

Assessment Authority, before the river sand mining is sanctioned by the authority. The

State Government appears to be following the direction in Deepak Kumar (supra) and

have regulated the River Bed Mining activities as per the statutory norms as also the

Guideline issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The impugned

Government order dated 6.6.2015 (Ext.P5) as can be noted was valid, for three years

and has spent its force by now.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       6. Considering the above and in the absence of any material warranting us to

issue any further direction, we deem it appropriate to close this case. However, liberty

is granted to the petitioner to highlight through appropriate measures, specific instances

of violation of the statutory norms as also the Supreme Court's directions, in the

conduct of River Sand Mining in the State of Kerala.

</p><p id="p_8">       7. With the above order, the case stands disposed of.
