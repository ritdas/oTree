<p id="p_1">Antony Dominic, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Petitioners are residents of Ward No.II of Kaduthuruthy

Grama Panchayat. They filed this writ petition styling itself as a

public interest litigation with the following three prayers:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          (i)    issue a writ of certiorari or any other writ or
          direction calling for the records leading to the issue of
          Ext.P1 consent and Ext.P2 licence in favour of 3rd
          respondent and quash the same;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          (ii)   issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate
          writ, orders or directions commanding the 1st
          respondent Panchayat to ensure that neither cement
          handling is permitted in building No KP III/341-A in
          Kaduthuruthy Panchayat owned by 3rd respondent nor
          it will be permitted to be used as a cement storage.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          (iii)  issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate
          writ,   orders   or  direction  commanding      the   1st
          respondent Panchayat to ensure that Building No KP
          III/341-A in Kaduthuruthy Panchayat owned by the 3rd
          respondent will be permitted to be used as only for
          commercial occupancy as per Ext.P4 permit and
          never for 'storage' or 'hazardous' occupancy in
          violation of the provisions of Kerala Municipality
          Building Rules, 1999.</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">     2.     First of all, we are not satisfied that the petitioners

have made out a case for entertaining this writ petition as public

WP(C) No.37948/2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 : 2 :</span>


interest litigation. The expression "public interest litigation" has

been understood as meaning legal action initiated in a court of

law for the enforcement of public interest or general interest in

which the public or a class of the community have pecuniary

interest or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities

are affected {vide <a href="/doc/1830927/" id="a_1">Janata Dal v. H.S.Chowdhary</a> (1992(4) SCC

</p><p id="p_5">305)}. Such litigation should be aimed at redressal of genuine

public wrong or public injury and shall not be publicity-oriented or

founded on personal vendetta (vide <a href="/doc/1107385/" id="a_2">Ashok Kumar Pandey v.

State of W.B</a> {(2004) 3 SCC 349}. It has been held by the Apex

Court that the public interest litigation is not a pill or panacea for

all wrongs and that it was essentially meant to protect basic

human rights of the weak and the disadvantaged and was a

procedure which was innovated where a public-spirited person

files a petition in effect on behalf of such persons who on account

of poverty, helplessness or economic and social disabilities could

not approach the court for relief (<a href="/doc/1737583/" id="a_3">BALCO Employees' Union

(Regd.) v. Union of India</a> (2002(2) SCC 333).

</p><p id="p_6">      3.    Applying these tests, we are clear in our minds that the

issue raised in this writ petition concerning the validity of Ext.P1

consent to operate issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control

WP(C) No.37948/2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                : 3 :</span>


Board or Ext.P2, the licence issued by the respondent Panchayat

on purely private disputes cannot form the subject matter of

public interest litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      4.   In so far as Ext.P1 consent to operate issued by the

Pollution Control Board in favour of the 3rd respondent is

concerned, <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_4">Section 31</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 provides for remedy of appeal. Similarly,

against Ext.P2, the licence issued under the Kerala Panchayat Raj

Act, 1994 is concerned also, if the petitioners are aggrieved, it is

open to them to seek statutory remedy of appeal. Therefore,

effective alternate statutory remedies are available to the

petitioners and it is for the petitioners to pursue those remedies.

However, in his endeavour to contend that the writ petition is

maintainable, learned counsel for the petitioners contended that

Exts.P1 and P2 were issued without jurisdiction, and therefore, it

is open to the petitioners to invoke the extra ordinary jurisdiction

of this Court without pursuing the alternate statutory remedies.

</p><p id="p_8">      5.   Admittedly, the respondent Panchayat has been

invested with the power to issue licence under the Kerala

Panchayat Raj Act. Similarly, the Pollution Control Board also has

been invested with such powers. Therefore, it is not a case where

WP(C) No.37948/2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 : 4 :</span>


these authorities are not without jurisdiction to issue the licenses.

Therefore, it cannot be contended that the licence and consent

were issued without jurisdiction to justify the filing of this writ

petition without taking recourse to the statutory remedies.

Therefore, for the aforesaid reasons, we hold that the writ petition

is not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6.   However, it is clarified that if the petitioners are

aggrieved, it will still be open to the petitioners to pursue the

statutory remedies and it is directed that if they file appeals

against the impugned orders within one month from today, the

respective appellate authorities will entertain the appeals and

deal with the same in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Writ petition is disposed of as above.
