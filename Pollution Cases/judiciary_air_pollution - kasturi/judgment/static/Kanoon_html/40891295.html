:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard both sides.
</p><p id="p_2">        2. To Avoid an avoidable delay, Notice to the Eighth Respondent is
dispensed with.
</p><p id="p_3">        3. By consent, the main Writ Petition itself is taken up for final
hearing.        
</p><p id="p_4">        4. No counter is filed on behalf of the Respondents.    
</p><p id="p_5">        5. According to the Petitioner, her representation, dated 31.05.2016,
addressed to Respondent Nos. 1 to 7, praying for stopping of unlawful
construction of brick kiln chamber, considering the fact that the lives of
Petitioner and the health must be protected, till date is not yet disposed of
by them.  Therefore, the Petitioner has filed the present Writ Petition
before this Court for passing of necessary orders.
</p>

<p id="p_6">        6. The grievance of the Petitioner is that the inaction of the
Respondent Nos. 1 to 7, in regard to the representation, dated 31.05.2016,
submitted by her suffers from mala fides and as such, this Court is to
interfere with the same in the interest of justice.
</p>        
<p id="p_7">        7. At this stage, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that
for better working and housekeeping in brick kiln industry, brick kiln should
be established atleast 2 k.ms., away from residential area and fruit gardens
and, as per Emission Standards for Brick kiln, minimum stack height of 22
meters is mandatory for optional dispersion.  Furthermore, the Respondent
Nos. 2 and 3, viz.,  Pollution Control Board, Chennai and the District
Environmental Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Tirunelveli,
should have seen that the Eighth Respondent brick kiln had not satisfied with
the norms prescribed by the National Emissions Standards Notified under the
Environmental Protection Act, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        8. Yet another submission made on behalf of the Petitioner is that, in
terms of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_2">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981,  no person shall, without previous consent of the State Board,
establish or operates any industrial plant in an air pollution control area
and inasmuch as the Respondent Nos.1 to 7 (Public Authorities) in terms of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of  India ought to have passed necessary
orders on the representation of the Petitioner, dated 31.05.2016 and stopped
the functioning of the brick kiln run by the Eighth Respondent.
</p>        
<p id="p_9">        9. At this stage, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner presses into
service the order of this Court, dated 23.10.2009 in W.P.No.1064 of 2009,
between V.K.Mani v. The Chairman, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Guindy, 
Madras ? 32 and two others, whereby and where-under, at paragraph No.7 it is
observed as follows:-

<p id="p_10">        Guidelines for Better Working and Housekeeping in Brick Kiln Industry
These are:
</p><p id="p_11">          "Maximum Coal feed size should be limited to 10 mm.
</p><p id="p_12">                Coal feeding cycle should not be more than 20 minutes.  Coal
feedingshould be done using mechanical feeder as this would ensure more 
efficient burning of coal and lower the emissions. Brick kiln should be
established preferably at least two km away from residential areas and fruit
gardens. Installation of brick kiln should not be allowed in sensitive areas
as notified by State Pollution Control Boards under National Air Quality
Standard.                   To avoid clustering of brick kilns in  a
locality, the distance between two kilns should be more than one km.  More
and more agro industrial wastes should be used to replace clay so as to
conserve good quality solid for agricultural purposes. Use of coal with more
than 35 percent ash content should be avoided.   There is no significant
noise pollution from manually operated brick kilns which form the bulk of
brick industry.  However, there are few semi mechanised brick making plants
which generate some noise.  Heavy machinery should be mounted on anti-  
vibration mounting.  Regular servising and maintenance of plant and machinery
should be ensured.  Ear muffs should be used by the workers.  The ash layer
on the top of kiln should be covered with a layer of fired bricks or special
tiles to check disposal of dust and for better thermal insulation which will
also reduce discomfort to the workers. Excess ash produced every day should
be removed daily to a close by disposal site.  A double wall should be
constructed around the kiln and the gap should be used to fill the ash
produced from the kiln. The brick works should be within covered space as far
as possible.  To minise generation of fugitive emissions, the passage around
the bricks should be paved with fired bricks.  A major source of heat loss in
the kiln is through steel covers placed over fire holes. These covers are
made of single layer steel plate. Thermal insulation should be provided to
these covered by making them double walled and packing with asbestos fibres.
To improve combustion efficiency and also to reduce source emissions,
properly graded coal should be used.   The following precautions need to be
taken to protect the workers though partially from the effect of heat and
high dust pollution prevailing on the brick kilns:  Covering of the kiln top
with a continuous layer of bricks or tiles.  A full face mask is to be
provided to workers to protect their eyes, ears and nose.  Hand gloves are to
be provided to workers to protect their hands from ill effects of coal
handling and also from hot flue gases coming out of fire hole during the
charging. Special coat/apron and shoes are to be provided to the workers for
their protection against these hazards."
</p>
<p id="p_13">        10. In response, the Learned Counsel for the Seventh Respondent brings
it to the Notice of this Court that the Petitioner's representation, dated
31.05.2016, is pending enquiry, on the file of the Inspector of Police,
Sankaran Koil Taluk Police Station, Sankarankoil, Tirunelveli District.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        11. Considering the fact that the Petitioner's representation, dated
31.05.2016, is pending on the file of the Respondent Nos.1 to 7, without any
progress or significant disposal in the subject matter in issue, at this
stage, this Court, without expressing any opinion one way or other about the
merits and contents of the representation of the Petitioner, dated
31.05.2016, simpliciter, directs the Respondent Nos. 1 to 7, to look into the
representation of the Petitioner, dated 31.05.2016 and to dispose of the
same, on merits, by passing a reasoned speaking order (outlining the process
of reasoning in a qualitative and quantitative fashion), within a period of
six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
</p>        
<p id="p_15">        12. It is needless for this Court to make a pertinent  mention that
Respondent Nos.1 to 7 shall provide adequate opportunity to the Petitioner
and others concerned, if any, by adhering to the principles of natural
justice.  It is abundantly made clear that if Respondent Nos.1 to 7 seek any
copy of records / documents concerned from the Petitioner, then, it is
incumbent on the part of the Petitioner to comply with the same before the
Respondent Nos. 1 to 7, without any loss of time and thereafter, it is open
to the Respondent Nos.1 to 7, to pass necessary order, within the time
determined by this Court, as stated supra.  Also, the Petitioner is directed
to lend her assistance to the Respondent Nos.1 to 7, so as to enable them to
do the needful in the subject matter in issue.
</p>        
<p id="p_16">        13.With the aforesaid observations and directions, the Writ Petition
stands disposed of. No costs.     Consequently, connected Miscellaneous 
Petition is closed.
