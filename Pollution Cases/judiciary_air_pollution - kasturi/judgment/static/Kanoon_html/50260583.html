<pre id="pre_1"> IN THE COURT OF SH. AMIT KUMAR, JSCC/ASCJ/GJ(NW), ROHINI COURTS, DELHI

S­137/08
                                        Virender Aggarwal
                                               Vs. 
                                         Sagheer Ahmed

                                               ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.          Vide this order, I will dispose of the application filed u/o XII rule 6 CPC 

   by   the   plaintiff   and   the   brief   facts   necessary   for   its   disposal   are   that   the 

   present suit was instituted by the plaintiff/landlord on the averments that the 

   defendant  No.1  is his  tenant  of a shop  in the  property  No.364,  Hansa  Puri 

   Road, Tri Nagar, Delhi  - 110035   whereas the defendant  No.2 is sub­tenant 

   and they are storing liquid and non­liquid chemicals in this premises without 

   a license and further they are also running a factory for sharpening scissors 

   through stone grinders which is also not permissible and are causing air and 

   noise   pollution   which   makes   it   impossible   for   the   plaintiff   to   live   in   the 

   premises   and   as   such   the   defendants   No.1   &amp;   2   should   be   restrained   from 

   running their factory or from storing liquid and non­liquid gases and further 

   the   defendant   No.3/MCD   should   be   directed   to   close   this   factory   and   the 

   defendant No.5/DPCC should be directed to take appropriate action against 

   the defendants No.1 &amp; 2. Similar was the prayer made against the defendant 

   No.4/DDA. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.         In the written statement filed by the defendant No.1 &amp; 2, it was stated 

   that   the   suit   is   not   maintainable   being   without   any   cause   of   action   and 

   further, the defendant No.2 is real brother of the defendant No.1 and is not a 

   sub­tenant   as   alleged   and   the   defendant   No.1   is   only   sharpening   scissors 

   which come for repair and is not using any liquid or non­liquid chemicals as 

   alleged and further,  the plaintiff himself is doing hazardous business  in the 
    premises and on equity, he is not entitled for any relief of injunction. It was 

   also stated that the defendant is not running any industry/factory as alleged 

   nor is creating any pollution as alleged and the suit is liable to be rejected. In 

   the written statement filed by the defendant No.3/MCD, it was stated that the 

   suit   is   not   maintainable   against   the   MCD   being   a   dispute   between   the 

   landlord and tenant and further, on inspection, MCD found running two units 

   in this property without any municipal license and therefore, defendant No.1 

   and another Mr. Shagun Welding Works were challaned as per DMC Act. In 

   the   written   statement   filed   by  the  DDA,  it  was   stated   that   the  show  cause 

   notice has been issued to defendant No.1 u/s 14 read with section 29 of the 

   DDA Act for contravention of the land used and the suit against DDA is not 

   maintainable.  In the  reply  filed  by DPCC,  it was  stated  that  the  suit  is not 

   maintainable against the DPCC, being barred <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_1">section 43</a> of the Air (Prevention 

   and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> and should be rejected and further the Hon'ble 

   Supreme Court of India in the case titled as "M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India" 

   has passed specific directions on 07.05.04 and Department of Industries has 

   been requested to take necessary action against the industrial units running in 

   violation of the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.        

</p><p id="p_4">3.        In   the   application   under   consideration,   it   has   been   stated   by   the 

   plaintiff that the defendants No.1 &amp; 2 admittedly are not having any license as 

   required u/s 416,417 of the DMC Act as in their written statement, they have 

   not specifically denied para No.2 of the plaint and further, defendants No.3, 4 

   &amp; 5 have admitted in their written statement that the the defendant No.1 has 

   already challaned for running a factory without proper license in residential 

   area and as such, the suit should be decreed u/o XII rule 6 CPC. 
</p><p id="p_5"> 4.        In reply to it, it has been stated by the defendants No.1 &amp; 2 that there is 

   no admission as alleged by the plaintiff in the written statement filed by the 

   defendants   No.1   &amp;   2   and   further,   the   concerned   SDM   had   conducted   an 

   inquiry u/s 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the complaint made by 

   the plaintiff against the defendants No.1 &amp; 2 and has dismissed the compliant 

   on the grounds that the dispute is between the landlord and tenant and the 

   complainant i.e. the plaintiff herein has a vested interested to get the premises 

   vacated and the business run by the respondent i.e. the defendant No.1 herein 

   is only a household industry and in view of this finding of the concerned SDM, 

   the application should be rejected.  It has also been argued that even if it is 

   considered  only for the  sake of arguments  that the  defendants  No.3,  4 &amp; 5 

   have   admitted   that   the   defendant   No.1   is   running   an   industry   in   a   non­

   conforming area, the suit cannot be decreed against the defendant No.1 on 

   the admission of the defendants No.3, 4 &amp; 5. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">    
</p><p id="p_7">5.        I have heard the submissions and have perused the record. It is settled 

   proposition of law that the suit can be decreed on admissions made expressly 

   or impliedly against the answering defendant, but certainly it is not the law of 

   land   that   the   suit   can  be  decreed  against  another  defendant  on admission 

   made by some other defendant.  For instance,  a suit for recovery cannot be 

   decreed against guarantor on the admission made by the principal debtor or 

   vice­versa   and   can   be   decreed   only   against   the   defendant   who   admits   the 

   liability to pay the suit amount. In the case before me, the plaintiff has sought 

   decreeing of the suit i.e. closure of the business run by the defendant No.1 on 

   the alleged admissions of the defendants No.3, 4 &amp; 5. It is also argued by the 

   defendants No.1 &amp; 2 that the defendants No.3, 4 &amp; 5 are acting in connivance 
     with   the   plaintiff   and   in   view   of   that   submission,   the   suit   otherwise   also 

    cannot   be   decreed   once   the   defendant   No.1   alleges   connivance   with   the 

    plaintiff and the defendants No.3, 4 &amp; 5. Otherwise also, the defendant No.1 

    has placed on record the list of roads which has now been permitted as mixed 

    land use as per MPD 2021 wherein Hansa Puri road where the suit property is 

    situated   is   mentioned.   Further,   as   per   order   of   the   concerned   SDM,   the 

    dispute prima facie appears to be between the landlord and tenant where the 

    landlord/plaintiff wants to get the premises vacated by any mode. Further, a 

    perusal of the written statement filed by the defendant No.5 shows that the 

    Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has directed reallocation of industrial units 

    that have come up in residential/non­residential area on or after 01.08.90 and 

    as  per   admitted   facts   and  the   documents  placed   on  record,  the  defendant 

    No.1 is running his shop since 1984 and also had valid license from Factory 

    Licensing   Department   of   the   defendant   No.3/MCD.   Further,   as   per   the 

    defendant No.1, he has already paid conversion charges with the defendant 

    No.3/MCD   alongwith   an   application   for   renewal   of   license   which   is   still 

    pending under consideration. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">        
</p><p id="p_9">6.          Another   important   fact   which   cannot   be   ignored   and   also   smacks 

    connivance  between  the plaintiff and the defendants  No.3 &amp; 4 is the status 

    report filed by the defendant No.3/MCD which says that the defendant No.1 is 

    running a machine of a power load of 4 HP whereas the NDPL bills placed on 

    record by the defendant No.1 shows that bi­monthly consumption of his shop 

    is around 350 units which means that he is only consuming about 175 units 

    per month which is highly inproportionate to the 4 HP motor alleged to be 

    installed there by MCD in its status report. 
</p>       
<p id="p_10">7.         In   view   of   the   aforesaid   and   considering   the   fact   that   there   is   no 

    admission as alleged in the written statement filed by the defendants No.1 &amp; 2, 

    the   suit   cannot   be   decreed   against   them.   The   application,   therefore,   is 

    dismissed.
