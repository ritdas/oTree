(Applns. For Intervention And Directions On Behalf Of Dr. Kaushal

Kant Mishra)

IN RE :    COMPLIANCE OF ORDER DATED 13.01.2020

DELHI

    We have considered the compliance affidavit filed by GNCTD

pursuant to the order dated 13.01.2020.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    With     respect   to   the   major   polluting   activities   on   the

identified Hot Spots, details have been furnished by the Government

of NCT of Delhi with respect to the job done so far.        The Hot Spots
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          7</span>

mentioned in the affidavit are Jahangirpuri, Rohini, Bawana, Ashok

Vihar    &amp;   Wazirpur,   Vivek   Vihar,       Anand   Vihar,   Punjabi    Bagh   and

Mundka, Narela, Okhla, Dwarka, Mayapuri and R.K.Puram.                      But it

lacks the aspect of what is the target and what more is required to

be done and the continuous process and the means available and

action taken so that the same do not remain as such.

    With respect to segregation of waste, it has been stated that

municipal bodies of NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board have achieved

the complete segregation waste and its handling.                 We require the

New Delhi Municipal Council and EDMC, SDMC, North Delhi Municipal

Corporation and Delhi Cantonment Board to file details as to what

they have done.     We also direct the Chief Secretary to the Govt. of

NCT of Delhi to provide in detail, on affidavit, about what has

been done for complete segregation of waste and its handling and

what is the basis of making this statement in the affidavit and the

facilities provided for the purpose of segregation of waste.

    With respect to Anti Smog Guns, the Chief Secretary has to

explain about what has been achieved so far and the concrete plan

of the Government of NCT of Delhi and what it proposes to do at its

own level to arrange them.        It cannot be said to be the compliance

of the order that certain correspondence has been exchanged by the

Government of NCT of Delhi and NHAI and NBCC etc.                        Needful is

required to be done forthwith.                Let it be done by all concerned

viz. NHAI, NBCC and Government of NCT of Delhi within a period of

15 days from today and action taken report be submitted to this

Court.

</p><p id="p_8">       With respect to Smog Tower, let the work be started forthwith

and a report be submitted to this Court on 06.03.2020.

it   has    been       stated       in   Paragraph        7    of    the    Affidavit      that       with

respect to the existing and proposed processing facilities, it is

expected      that       the        entire       Construction          and        Demolition         Waste

generated in Delhi will be managed properly, but details have not

been    given         within    how      much        time     the     proposed       expansion         for

additional waste processing capacity is going to be achieved and

what are the steps taken for that.                             Let details be furnished in

this regard on the next date of hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       With      respect       to    the     Solid        Waste     Management,       it       has    been

Solid Waste of 5250 TPD which is about 50% of the total solid waste

processing TPD, a Plant is proposed to be established at Tehkhand

and for 2000 TPD at Ghonda Gujran as Joint Venture between East

Delhi      Municipal       Corporation           and      NTPC.        Apart       from    that,       one

engineered sanitary landfil has been proposed to treat 2000 TPD of

waste at Tehkhand.              However, details have not been furnished what

steps have been taken to establish these two Plants.                                            Let the

details     be     submitted         with       respect       to    establishment         of    the    two

Plants as also with respect to the engineered sanitary landfill, by

the next date of hearing.

IN RE       :      PILING UP OF WASTE/GARBAGE BY THE SIDES OF RAILWAY

                   TRACKS IN DELHI

    We take judicial notice of the fact that by the sides of the

railway lines in outer Delhi region, heaps of plastic bags and

garbage are lying on both sides and people living in the slums.

The situation is pathetic.         We request EPCA, Government of NCT of

Delhi and various Municipal Corporations to make a concrete plan

for removal of the plastic bags, garbage and other waste materials

lying on both the sides of railway lines for several kilometers

together.       The same has to be taken care of on a war footing basis

and steps have also to be taken so that in future, no such garbage

is dumped/collected.      What steps are to be taken in this regard be

culled out within 15 days.        Let a joint meeting be held by all the

stakeholders and a comprehensive action plan and the time frame be

submitted to this Court.          It may also be considered whether any

incentive can be provided for collection of plastic bags as done in

Himachal     Pradesh.      They   provide   Rs.   75/-   per   kg   for   such

collection.

I.A.No. 181745 of 2019

      While considering the aforesaid I.A., with respect to bio-

medical waste, we find that the situation is extremely grave and

bio-medical waste may lead to several kinds of diseases and so many

other problems.     It is required to be taken care of at once.        The

bio-medical     waste has to be taken care of scientifically as per

rules.     There are various photographs from different sites, which

have been filed along with the application from Page 43 onwards.

The satellite images have also been annexed at pages 35 and 36.

that was about to land at Terminal 3 in New
Delhi.     Upon closer scrutiny, it emerged that
the    garbage       which       was    on       fire     was      in   a
settlement       called         Rangpuri     adjacent           to    the
