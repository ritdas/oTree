</pre><p id="p_1">                                24.02.2020

</p><p id="p_2">1.    Petitioner, claiming to be registered partnership firm registered under

</p><p id="p_5">2.    The petitioner claims that the building was heavily damaged in the

floods of 2014 and denied permission to repair the building. Additionally, an

order dated 01.04.2019 stand issued by the J&amp;K Pollution Control Board for

immediate closure of the operation of the hotel followed by an order dated

14.05.2019 by the District Magistrate, Srinagar.


</p><p id="p_6">3.    It is an admitted position that the Hotel stands sealed on 03.06.2019.

The petitioner has received the communication dated 03.06.2019 from the

Joint Director Tourism Kashmir and a notice dated 14.05.2019 from the

Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.    A challenge is laid by the petitioner to the aforesaid orders by way of

instant writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">5.    When the writ petition came up for consideration before this Court on

23rd of July, 2019, keeping in view the nature of impugned notices and the

location of the building of the petitioner, it was, inter alia, directed as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "...5. In our view, the issue raised by the petitioner with regard to the
      rehabilitation of hotels which are required to be closed down because
      of the polluted status as reported by the State Pollution Control Board
      is a matter which ought to be placed before the Committee of Experts
      appointed by us in PIL no.159/2002. Let a copy of this writ petition be
      furnished to Mr. Altaf Naik, who was appointed as an amicus curiae to
      assist the Committee..."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">6.    The order dated 01.04.2019 issued by the Jammu &amp; Kashmir

Pollution Control Board (page 17 of the paper book) shows that the

petitioner-hotel was set up and put up in operation in violation of the norms

as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

thereby adversely affecting upon the water quality of the lake. By this order,

the Pollution Control Board had directed as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ".....Now, therefore, is exercise of powers vested in the Chairman,
      Jammu and Kashmir State Pollution Control Board under Section-33A
      of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, immediate
      closure of M/s Hotel Heavan Canal Abi Nowpora, Srinagar is hereby
      ordered and in this behalf, the:-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      i.        Deputy Commissioner/District Magistrate Srinagar is directed
                to immediately close down the hotel M/s Hotel Heavan Canal

                revoke the registration of hotel in question.
      iii.      Chief Engineer, Electric f&amp; Maintenance (PDD), Kashmir with
                the direction to snap electric supply to the hotel immediately.
      iv.       Mohd. Shaban Chachoo Prop. M/s Hotel Heavan Canal Abi
                Nowpora, Srinagar is directed to cease the operation of the
                hotel forthwith.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                Issued with the approval of Competent Authority."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">7.    Pursuant to the directions made by us, the Committee of Experts on

Dal Lake (PIL No. 159/2002), has accorded a hearing to the petitioner in

which the Vice Chairman, LAWDA, Member Secretary, Pollution Control

Board and Director Tourism Kashmir had been requested to be present. The

Committee of Experts has noticed that the Hotel of the petitioner was

located on the Dal Lake without any sewage treatment facility and the only

sewage facility was through a soakage pit and the septic tank, both of which

were ineffective. The Committee of Experts has noticed that disposal of

sewage from the hotel was directly flowing into the Dal Lake.

</p><p id="p_13">8.    So far as further recommendations and actions are concerned, the

Committee of Experts has recommended as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              Since the hotel is located within Dal Lake area (within the Dal
               waters) and has been identified for being rehabilitated, the hotel
               has to be closed down and shifted. Govt of J&amp;K should
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>

                                                         OWP (c) No. 2493/2019
                                                            CM No. 4819/2019


             formulate a policy for rehabilitation of such commercial units.
             The said Hotel should not be allowed to continue at the present
             location, even if they establish a modern sewage treatment plant
             and its effluent conform to the latest standards set by the
             pollution control board. Being located within the Dal waters,
             the danger of pollutants leaching into the Lake will always
             remain.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           The Govt. of J&amp;K may most expeditiously devise a policy for
            rehabilitation of commercial units since it does not have one at
            present. The CoE advises that the Govt of J&amp;K may examine the
            policy in this regard available under the Right to Fair
            Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
            Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act. 2013. The Policy may
            cover all cases that fall in the category of commercial units to
            avoid complaints in future and should be devised urgently.
           The Petitioner is running a commercial unit that supports a
            number of families. In order to support Tourism, Srinagar
            requires good hotels. Hence, it is in the interest of the Govt and
            the people that whatever is possible is done for enabling such
            economic activities to continue but in a fair and open
            environment based on a transparent policy.
           At the same time provision for treatment and waste should be
            mandatory and pollution of the Dal Lake should not be
            permitted. The SPCB, LAWDA and Tourism Deptt should
            maintain a constant vigil to identify polluters and take strong,
            strict and punitive action."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">9.    No relief can be granted to the petitioner in this writ petition.

</p><p id="p_15">10.   It is submitted by Mr. Shuja-ul-Haq, learned counsel for the petitioner

that the petitioner has no intention of running the Hotel at the location

inasmuch as it adversely impacts the pollution content of the Dal Lake.

</p><p id="p_16">11.   Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that it is imperative

that an immediate policy decision is taken by the Government of Union

Territory of Jammu &amp; Kashmir to enable the petitioner to continue with the

trade and business to ensure availability of good hospitality to the tourists

who visit the valley. It is further submitted that the closure of the petitioner's

hotel adversely effects the livelihood not only of the petitioner but several

other persons who were employed by the hotel.

</p><p id="p_18">12.     We have observed that the Committee of Experts has noticed not only

the closure of petitioner's hotel but 17 other hotels have also been closed

down.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">13.     We also find that the matter involves a multiple departmental

consultation between the Tourism Department, Pollution Control Board,

LAWDA and also the Revenue Department.

</p><p id="p_22">14.     In view thereof, let the report of the Committee of Experts and this

order be placed before the Chief Secretary of the Government of J&amp;K for

examining the matter for the optimum solution of all the issues arising. It

shall be open for the Chief Secretary to appoint an appropriate Committee

for looking into the matter and making its recommendations keeping in view

the interest of the Union Territory, the residents as well as the land / business

owners and the various persons dependent for livelihood on the related

businesses.

directed above.

<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">16.     We are informed by Mr. Shuja-ul-Haq, learned counsel for the

petitioner that in view of the orders passed by the respondents, the insurance

companies are not insuring the property of the petitioner. We fail to see as to

how the insurance cover is denied inasmuch as it is the property of the

petitioner which has to be insured.
