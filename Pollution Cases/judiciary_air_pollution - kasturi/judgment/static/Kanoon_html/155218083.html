JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

      The applicant states that he is a citizen of India and is

concerned about the alarming rate at which environmental

degradation is taking place in the country.     It is the case of the

applicant that in the past he had filed various cases in respect of air

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>
 and water pollution in the Supreme Court of India for the protection

of cultural heritage of the country. The Supreme Court of India, in

those cases, has delivered landmark judgments/orders for the

protection of environment, people's lives, health and cultural

heritage of India.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   The applicant had instituted a writ petition being Civil Writ

Petition No. 860/1991 titled <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_1">M.C. Mehta v. Union of India</a> before the

Supreme Court of India which came to be disposed off by the

judgment of the Supreme Court of India dated 22nd November, 1991

whereby the Hon'ble Supreme Court gave various directions to the

Central and the State Governments for providing compulsory

environmental education to the students of schools and colleges

throughout the country.    Inter- alia, but importantly, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India had issued Direction No. IV in the said

judgment. Direction IV of the judgment dated 22nd November, 1991

reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      Direction IV. "We accept on principle that through the
      medium of education awareness of the environment and
      its problems related to pollution should be taught as a
      compulsory subject. Learned Attorney General pointed
      out to us that the Central Government is associated
      with education at the higher levels and the University
      Grant Commission can monitor only the under graduate
      and the post graduate studies. The rest of it, according
      to him, is a State Subject. He has agreed that University
      Grant Commission will take appropriate steps
      immediately to give effect to what we have said, i.e.
      requiring the Universities to prescribe a course on
      environment. They would consider the feasibility of
      making this a compulsory subject at every level in
      college education. So far as the education up to the
      college level is concerned we would require every State
      Government and every Education Board connected with
      education up to the matriculation stage or even
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>
       intermediate college to immediately take steps to enforce
      compulsory education on environment in a graded way.
      This should be so done that in the next academic year
      there would be compliance of this requirement. We have
      not considered it necessary to hear the State
      Government and the other interest groups as by now
      there is a general acceptance throughout the world as
      also in our country that protection of environment and
      keeping it free of pollution is an indispensable necessity
      for life to survive on this earth. If that be the situation,
      everyone must turn immediate attention to the proper
      care to sustain environment in a decent way."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">3.   As the above direction had not been complied with, the

applicant again filed an IA in the above writ petition upon which the

Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 18th December, 2003

reiterated the direction requiring the authorities to comply with the

same. The relevant extract of the order dated 18th December, 2003

reads as under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ".....we direct all the respondents- States and other
      authorities concerned to take steps to see that all
      educational institutions under their control implement
      respective steps taken by them and as reflected in their
      affidavits fully, starting from the next academic year,
      viz. 2004-05 at least, if not already implemented. The
      authorities so concerned shall duly supervise such
      implementation in every educational institution and
      non-compliance of the same by any of the institutions
      should be treated as a disobedience calling for
      instituting     disciplinary   action   against    such
      institutions."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">4.   The University Grants Commission (for short 'UGC') on 13th

July, 2004 submitted before the Hon'ble Supreme Court that they

have prepared a common syllabus and the same is being

implemented by various educational institutions.        The All India

Council of Technical Education on 6th August, 2004 informed the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>
 Supreme Court that it had already prepared a syllabus which

includes 'environmental science' and which is being updated and

would be introduced from the next academic year.       The syllabus

pertaining to environmental education has been prescribed and the

guidelines have been framed but according to the applicant, the

subject is being taught by teachers who are not qualified in terms of

the UGC Guidelines.       The teachers who have specialized in

Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Electronics, Political Science, Sociology,

Mathematics, Physical Education, Home Science, Computer Science

etc. have been assigned the task of teaching the subject of

environmental science; in the most cosmetic way, which is against

the letter and spirit of the judgment/orders passed by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India. It is also averred by the applicant that a

number of States like the State of Haryana, Punjab, Goa, Mizoram,

Delhi and the Union Territory of Chandigarh amongst others have

not complied with the directions of the Supreme Court of India, as

afore-noticed.    None of these States have taken any steps to

appoint   qualified   teachers   who   are   competent    to   teach

environmental science. The eligible teachers are the ones who have

qualified the National Eligibility Test (NET) in Environment Science

or Ph.D. in terms of UGC guidelines. The whole purpose of making

'Environment' as a compulsory subject, hence, stands defeated.

While referring to some of the States, the applicant makes a

particular reference to the States of Haryana and Jammu and

Kashmir. The applicant stated that except for holding the meetings,

the State Governments have not taken any concrete steps for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  5</span>
 compliance or for implementation of the above directions. In fact,

they have been exchanging letters on what should or should not be

the qualifications of the teachers who would teach the subject of

Environment Science.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   A number of States have been impleaded as respondents in

the present application along with the Ministry of Environment and

Forests. The applicant submits that the action of the respondent,

in not providing environment education properly in the Colleges,

Institutes and Universities is against the spirit of the order passed

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as the affidavit given

by the State Governments before the Apex Court. <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_2">Article 48A</a> of the

Constitution provides that the States should endure to protect and

improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of

the country. <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_3">Article 51A(g)</a> of the Constitution imposes as one of

the fundamental duties on every citizen to protect and improve the

natural environment, including forests, rivers, lakes and wildlife

and to have compassion for the living creatures. While referring to

these provisions the applicant submits that lack of education in

environment science would prejudicially affect the spirit of these

Articles and thus, the applicant has been compelled to approach

this Tribunal for redressal of his grievances. In this application, the

applicant has made the following prayers in paragraph 20 of the

application: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "Under the facts and circumstances, it is respectfully
      prayed that the Hon'ble Green Tribunal may be pleased
      to:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      I. issue direction/directions to the Respondents to
      ensure that compulsory subject of Environment studies
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   6</span>
       is taught by the qualified/eligible teachers/Astt
      professors having specialization in post graduate
      degree i.e. M.Sc Environmental Science with NET
      qualified or Ph.D. in terms of UGC guidelines in the
      State of Haryana and other States and union
      Territories  for   providing    proper  environmental
      education to the students at Under Graduate and Post
      Graduate level from Academic Session 2014 in both
      Government and Private Universities/ colleges in India.
      II. take appropriate Action against the Respondents
      for not implementing the judgments/ orders of the
      Hon'ble Supreme Court given vide Direction Number IV
      passed on 22.11.1991 in W.P.(C) No. 860 of 1991 and
      subsequent orders; and
      III. pass such other order/ orders as may be deemed
      necessary on the facts and circumstances of the case.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          And for this, the Applicant as duty bound shall
      ever pray.''

</blockquote><p id="p_7">6.   Different respondent States, besides taking up the plea of

substantial compliance of directions of the judgment of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court dated 22nd November, 1991 have primarily taken

the preliminary objection with regard to maintainability of this

application before the Tribunal.     It is contended that on true

construction of the provisions of Section 14 read with Section 18

and Schedule I of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (for short

'NGT Act'), this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain and

adjudicate the matters raised in the present application. According

to the learned counsel, it is a matter which relates to imparting of

education and does not raise any substantial question relating to

environment and in any case such question does not arise out of

the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I of the

NGT Act. Furthermore, it is also contended that the entire basis of

the application is alleged violation of the Order of the Supreme

Court dated 22nd November, 1991. The Tribunal can neither initiate


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>
 contempt proceedings against violator nor it can be an executing

court for the orders passed by the Supreme Court of India.

</p><p id="p_8">7.   In view of the above, the issue of the maintainability was

treated as a 'preliminary issue' by us and arguments were heard on

the maintainability of the petition without going into the merits of

the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.   The applicant responded to this objection by raising a

contention that the provisions of Section 14 read with Section 18 of

the NGT Act are wide enough to give cause of action to 'any person

aggrieved' to file any petition before this Tribunal, in relation to any

environmental issue.     Education in environmental science, thus,

would be within the ambit of these provisions and hence the

present petition would be maintainable. Furthermore, according to

the applicant <a href="/doc/1826116/" id="a_4">Sections 16(2)(e)</a> and <a href="/doc/1704758/" id="a_5">17(1)(e)</a> of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short 'the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a>') as well

as under <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_8">Section 16(2)(f)</a> of the Air Act, 1981 (for short 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>',

lays down a statutory function for the Central or the State Board,

as the case may be, to organize through mass media, a

comprehensive programme regarding the prevention and control of

water pollution, organizing the training of persons engaged or to be

engaged in programmes for the prevention, control or abatement of

water pollution and to organize mass education programmes

relating thereto. Thus, the Subject of environmental education,

would fall within the compass of these provisions and hence it

would be an 'implementation' of the Acts mentioned in Schedule I of

the NGT Act.     Being a 'person aggrieved' in its wider sense, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8</span>
 applicant is entitled to maintain the present application.         He

questions the averment that there is substantial compliance of the

directions, as even noticed in the application.         He has also

contended that in terms of Articles 141 and 142 of the Constitution

of India, the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India

are law of the land and are to be executed by all Courts and

Tribunals. The purpose and object of the provision in question

relates to the functions of the respective Boards and for ensuring

prevention and control of water pollution. The comprehensive

programme through mass media, even if it is deemed to include

education as a part of the programme, still the prescription and

enforcement of educational qualifications of the teachers who are

expected to teach environmental science, cannot be an area that

would squarely fall within the dimensions of <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_10">Section 16</a> <a href="/doc/379900/" id="a_11">2(e)</a> of the

Water Act. The Section elaborately states the functions of the

Board, which it is expected to perform in order to promote

cleanliness of the wells in the different areas of the State and

subject to the provisions of the Act. In the garb of invoking the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1826116/" id="a_12">Section 16(2)(e)</a> of the Water Act and <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_13">Section

16(2)(f)</a> of the Air Act, the applicant cannot require this Tribunal to

issue directions to the Board to perform functions or duties or issue

directions which, ex facie, are beyond the scope of the <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_14">Section 16</a> of

the respective Acts. Thus, we must dissipate the contention of the

Applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.   We have already noticed that we would not be examining any

other question of law or even merits of the application and would


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  9</span>
 confine our discussion to the maintainability of the present

application.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10. It is the contention before us that the application squarely

touches    and   falls   within   the   ambit    of   the   expression

'implementation' of the Scheduled Acts as mentioned in Section 14

of the NGT Act. Further, that it relates to the subject of

environmental sciences, raising substantial environmental issues

and therefore, such an application can be entertained and decided

by the Tribunal in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_12">11. This Tribunal is a creation of a statute and has to work within

the confines of that statute. If we treat the application as a petition,

requiring the Tribunal to enforce, execute or take any other

appropriate action for non-compliance or violation of the Direction

IV issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment

dated 22nd November, 1991, then there is no provision in the

statute, i.e., the NGT Act, by invocation of which such cognizance

could be taken by this Tribunal. It will not be appropriate for the

Tribunal either to invoke contempt jurisdiction for violation of the

orders passed by the Supreme Court of India or to issue appropriate

directions with regard to those orders, as it is for that Court alone

to deal with the matters of this kind. This Tribunal, thus, cannot

entertain such an application as it would squarely fall beyond the

provisions of <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_15">Section 14</a> read with <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_16">Section 18</a> and Schedule I of the

NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12. This Tribunal is vested with three different jurisdictions.

Firstly, it has the original jurisdiction in terms of <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_17">Section 14</a> of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   10</span>
 NGT Act to deal with all civil cases raising a substantial question

relating to environment and where such questions arise out of the

implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I of the

NGT Act. Secondly, it is vested with appellate jurisdiction against

the various orders/directions/decisions as stated in <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_18">Section 16</a> (a)

to (j) of the NGT Act. Thirdly it has a special jurisdiction in terms of

<a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_19">Section 15</a> to grant relief of compensation and restitution as per the

scheme contemplated under that provision. Admittedly, the present

application has been filed under Section 14 of the NGT Act. Thus, it

must plead and raise the following:
</p>
<p id="p_14">  a) It should be a civil case.
</p>
<p id="p_15">  b) Where a substantial question relating to environment or

     enforcement of any legal right relating to environment is

     involved.
</p>
<p id="p_16">  c) Such question arises out of implementation of enactment

     specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">13. Once these three ingredients are satisfied, then <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_20">Section 14</a>

does not appear to place any restriction on the locus or character of

the Applicant who wishes to move an application under <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_21">Section 14</a>

of the Act. Similarly, <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_22">Section 15</a> also does not describe the

description of an Applicant who can move the Tribunal for seeking

reliefs like compensation, restitution of the property and the

environment. In contradistinction thereto, <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_23">Section 16</a> restricts the

Applicant entitled to file an Appeal to be 'any person aggrieved'. In

other words, it is only a person aggrieved who can invoke the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_24">Section 16</a> and not any Applicant.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   11</span>
 <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_25">Section 18</a> deals with the procedure which has to be followed by an

applicant or appellant, who prefers to file an application or appeal

before the Tribunal. It deals with all the three jurisdictions specified

under Section 14, 15 and 16 of the NGT Act. However, <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_26">Section 18</a>

(2) of the NGT Act provides the details in regard to locus and

character of an Applicant who is entitled to move the Tribunal by

filing an Application for grant of relief or compensation or

settlement of dispute. <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_27">Section 18(2)</a> has been worded by the

legislature with wide amplitude besides covering any person

aggrieved and the legal representatives of the various categories. In

terms of <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_28">Section 16</a>, it includes various other persons as described

under clauses (a) to (d) and (f) of sub-Section 2 of Section 18. The

locus and character of an applicant specified under these provisions

has to receive liberal construction and would cover variety of

applicants. As far as <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_29">Section 14</a> (1) of the NGT Act is concerned, the

only restriction that appears to be imposed is that it must satisfy

the prerequisites stated in that Section.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">14. It is a settled position of law that the Tribunal must keep in its

mind and be guided by the statutory provisions of the Act and it

may not be appropriate for the Tribunal to take up the subjects

which do not squarely fall within the ambit and scope of its

jurisdictional provisions.    We may refer to a judgment of the

Tribunal in the case of <a href="/doc/180993556/" id="a_30">Goa Foundation v. Union of India</a> 2013(1) All

India NGT Reporter, New Delhi, 234, where the Court while dealing

with some facets of Tribunal's jurisdiction and the manner in which

they should be construed, explained the expression 'substantial

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   12</span>
 question relating to environment', 'any person aggrieved' and

'dispute.' The following paragraphs can be usefully reproduced at

this stage:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "23.Similarly,    'substantial    question    relating  to
      environment' also is an inclusive definition and besides
      what it means, it also includes what has been specified
      under Section 2(m) of the NGT Act. Inclusive definitions
      are not exhaustive. One has to, therefore, give them a
      very wide meaning to make them as comprehensive as
      the statute permits on the principle of liberal
      interpretation. This is the very basis of an inclusive
      definition. Substantial, in terms of the Oxford Dictionary
      of English, is of considerable importance, strongly built
      or made, large, real and tangible, rather than imaginary.
      Substantial is actual or real as opposed to trivial, not
      serious,    unimportant,     imaginary    or    something.
      Substantial is not the same as unsubstantial i.e. just
      enough to avoid the de minimis principle. In In re Net
      Books Agreement [1962] 1 WLR 1347, it was explained
      that, the term 'substantial' is not a term that demands a
      strictly quantitative or proportional assessment.
      Substantial can also mean more than reasonable. To
      put it aptly, a substantial question relating to
      environment must, therefore, be a question which is
      debatable, not previously settled and must have a
      material bearing on the case and its issues relating to
      environment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      24. Section 2(m) of the NGT Act classifies 'substantial
      question relating to environment' under different heads
      and states it to include the cases where there is a direct
      violation of a specific statutory environmental obligation
      as a result of which the community at large, other than
      an individual or group of individuals, is affected or is
      likely to be affected by the environmental consequences;</blockquote><p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      or the gravity of damage to the environment or property
      is substantial; or the damage to public health is broadly
      measurable. The other kind of cases are where the
      environmental consequences relate to a specific activity
      or a point source of pollution. In other words, where
      there is a direct violation of a statutory duty or
      obligation which is likely to affect the community, it will
      be a substantial question relating to environment
      covered under <a href="/doc/1265919/" id="a_31">Section 14(1)</a> providing jurisdiction to the
      Tribunal. When we talk about the jurisdiction being
      inclusive, that would mean that a question which is
      substantial, debatable and relates to environment,
      would itself be a class of cases that would squarely fall
      under Section 14(1) of the NGT Act. Thus, disputes must

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  13</span>
 relate to implementation of the enactments specified in
Schedule I to the NGT Act.
</p><p id="p_23">25. The very significant expression that has been used
by the legislature in <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_32">Section 18</a> is 'any person aggrieved'.
Such a person has a right to appeal to the Tribunal
against any order, decision or direction issued by the
authority concerned. 'Aggrieved person' in common
parlance would be a person who has a legal right or a
legal cause of action and is affected by such order,
decision or direction. The word 'aggrieved person' thus
cannot be confined within the bounds of a rigid formula.
Its scope and meaning depends upon diverse facts and
circumstances of each case, nature and extent of the
applicant's interest and the nature          and extent of
prejudice or injury suffered by him. P. Ramanatha
Aiyar's The Law Lexicon supra describes this expression
as 'when a person is given a right to raise a contest in a
certain manner and his contention is negative, he is a
person aggrieved' [<a href="/doc/1932635/" id="a_33">Ebrahim Aboodbakar v. Custodian
General of Evacue Property</a>, AIR 1952 SC 319]. It also
explains this expression as 'a person who has got a legal
grievance i.e. a person wrongfully deprived of anything
to which he is legally entitled to and not merely a person
who has suffered some sort of disappointment'.
</p><p id="p_24">26. Aggrieved is a person who has suffered a legal
grievance, against whom a decision has been
pronounced or who has been refused something. This
expression is very generic in its meaning and has to be
construed with reference to the provisions of a statute
and facts of a given case. It is not possible to give a
meaning or define this expression with exactitude and
precision. The Supreme Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/1553344/" id="a_34">Bar Council
of Maharashtra v. M.V. Dabholkar and Others</a> AIR 1976
SC 242 held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">    "27. Where a right of appeal to Courts against an
    administrative or judicial decision is created by
    statute the right is invariably con fined to a person
    aggrieved or a person who claims to be aggrieved.</blockquote><p id="p_25">
    The meaning of the words "a person aggrieved" may
    vary according to the context of the statute. One of
    the meanings is that a person will be held to be
    aggrieved by a decision if that decision is materially
    adverse to him. Normally, one is required to
    establish that one has been denied or deprived of
    something to which one is legally entitled in order to
    make one "a person aggrieved." Again a person is
    aggrieved if a legal burden is imposed on him. The
    meaning of the words "a person aggrieved" is
    sometimes given a restricted meaning in certain
    statutes which provide remedies for the protection of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                            14</span>
 private legal rights. The restricted meaning requires
denial or deprivation of legal rights. A more liberal
approach is required in the back ground of statutes
which do not deal with property rights but deal with
professional conduct and morality. The role of the
Bar Council under the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_35">Advocates Act</a> is comparable
to the role of a guardian in professional ethics. The
words "persons aggrieved" in <a href="/doc/546640/" id="a_36">Sections 37</a> and<a href="/doc/1964073/" id="a_37">38</a> of
the Act are of wide import and should not be
subjected to a restricted interpretation of possession
or denial of legal rights or burdens or financial
interests. The test is whether the words "person
aggrieved" include "a person who has a genuine
grievance because an order has been made which
pre judicially affects his interests." It has, therefore,
to be found out whether the Bar Council has a
grievance in respect of an order or decision affecting
the professional conduct and etiquette.
</p><p id="p_26">28. The pre-eminent question is: what are the
interests of the Bar Council? The interests of the
Bar Council are the maintenance of standards of
professional conduct and etiquette. The Bar Council
has no personal or pecuniary interest. The Bar
Council has the statutory duty and interest to see
that the rules laid down by the Bar Council of India
in relation to professional conduct and etiquette are
upheld and not violated. The Bar Council acts as
the sentinel of professional code of conduct and is
vitally interested in the rights and privileges of the
advocates as well as the purity and dignity of the
profession.
</p><p id="p_27">40. The point of view stated above rests upon the
distinction between the two different capacities of
the State Bar Council: an executive capacity, in
which it acts as the prosecutor through its
Executive Committee, and a quasi-judicial function,
which it performs through its Disciplinary
Committee. If we can make this distinction, as I
think we can, there is no merger between the
prosecutor and the Judge here. If one may illustrate
from another sphere, when the State itself acts
through its executive agencies to prosecute and
then through its judicial wing to decide a case, there
is no breach of a rule of natural justice. The
prosecutor and the Judge could not be said to have
the same personality or approach just because both
of them represent different aspects or functions of
the same State.
</p><p id="p_28">44. The short question is as to whether the State
Bar Council is a 'person aggrieved' within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1964073/" id="a_38">Section 38</a> so that it has locus standi to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                        15</span>
     appeal to this Court against a decision of the
    Disciplinary Tribunal of the Bar Council of India
    which, it claims, is embarrassingly erroneous and. if
    left unchallenged, may frustrate the high obligation
    of maintaining standards of probity and purity and
    canons of correct professional conduct among the
    members of the Bar on its rolls.
</p><p id="p_29">    47. Even in England, so well-known a Parliamentary
    draftsman as Francis Bennion has recently pleaded
    in      the      Manchester     Guardian      against
    incomprehensible law forgetting 'that it is
    fundamentally important in a free society that the
    law should be readily ascertainable and reasonably
    clear, and that otherwise it is oppressive and
    deprives the citizen of one of his basic rights'. It is
    also needlessly expensive and wasteful. Reed
    Dickerson, the famous American Draftsman, said: It
    cost the Government and the public many millions
    of dollars annually'. The Renton Committee in
    England, has reported on drafting reform but it is
    unfortunate that India is unaware of this problem
    and in a post-Independence statute like the
    <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_39">Advocates Act</a> legislators should still get entangled
    in these drafting mystiques and judges forced to
    play a linguistic game when the country has an
    illiterate laity as consumers of law and the rule of
    law is basic to our Constitutional order."
</p>
<p id="p_30">27. In the case of <a href="/doc/744830/" id="a_40">Maharaj Singh v. State of Uttar
Pradesh</a> (1977)1 SCC 155, the Supreme Court observed
that a legal injury creates a remedial right in the injured
person. But the right to a remedy apart, a larger circle of
persons can move the court for the protection or defence
or enforcement of a civil right or to ward off or claim
compensation for a civil wrong, even if they are not
proprietarily or personally linked with the cause of
action. The nexus between the lis and the plaintiff need
not necessarily be personal, although it has to be more
than a wayfarer's allergy to an unpalatable episode.
Further in the case of <a href="/doc/309358/" id="a_41">Dr. Duryodhan Sahu and Others v.
Jitendra Kumar Mishra and Others</a> (1998) 7 SCC 270,
the Supreme Court, held that although the meaning of
the expression 'person aggrieved' may vary according to
the context of the statute and the facts of the case,
nevertheless normally, a person aggrieved must be a
man who has suffered a legal grievance, a man against
whom a decision has been pronounced which has
wrongfully deprived him of something or wrongfully
refused him something or wrongfully affected his title to
something. <a href="/doc/1749406/" id="a_42">In Jasbhai Motibhai Desai v. Roshan Kumar</a>,
AIR 1976 SC 578 the Court held that the expression


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                            16</span>
       'aggrieved person' denotes an elastic, and to an extent,
      an elusive concept. It stated as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">          "It cannot be confined within the bounds of a rigid,
          exact, and comprehensive definition. At best, its
          features can be described in a broad tentative
          manner. Its scope and meaning depends on diverse,
          variable factors such as the content and intent of
          the statute of which contravention is alleged, the
          specific circumstances of the case, the nature and
          extent of the petitioner's interest, and the nature
          and extent of the prejudice or injury suffered by
          him."
</blockquote><p id="p_31">      35. The expression 'disputes' arising from the questions
      referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the NGT
      Act, is required to be examined by us to finally deal with
      and answer the contentions raised by the parties before
      us. The expression used in sub-section (1) supra is the
      expression of wide magnitude. The expression 'question'
      used in sub-section (1) in comparison to the expression
      'dispute' used in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_43">section 14</a> is of much
      wider ambit and connotation. The disputes must arise
      from a question that is substantial and relates to
      environment. This question will obviously include the
      disputes referred to in <a href="/doc/31992/" id="a_44">Section 14(2)</a>. It is those disputes
      which would then be settled and decided by the
      Tribunal. These expressions are inter-connected and
      dependent upon each other. They cannot be given
      meaning in isolation or de hors to each other. The
      meaning of the word 'dispute', as stated by the Supreme
      Court in <a href="/doc/594047/" id="a_45">Canara Bank v. National Thermal Power
      Corporation</a> (2001)1 SCC 43 is "a controversy having
      both positive and negative aspects. It postulates the
      assertion of a claim by one party and its denial by the
      other". The term dispute, again, is a generic term. It
      necessarily need not always be a result of a legal injury
      but could cover the entire range between genuine
      differences of opinion to fierce controversy. Conflicts
      between parties arising out of any transaction entered
      between them is covered by the term 'dispute'.



</p><p id="p_32">15. The above paragraphs are the precepts to the exercise of

proper jurisdiction by the Tribunal.     The provisions relating to

jurisdiction could be construed liberally so as to achieve the object

and purpose of the Act, where a narrower construction is likely to

defeat the same. According to the learned counsel appearing for the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  17</span>
 applicant, it is the implementation of the statutes stated in

Schedule I of the NGT Act that would fully justify entertainment of

this application by the Tribunal. It is contended that the word

'implementation' would have to be construed very widely so as to

include in its ambit even education in environmental sciences (as a

subject), thus, enabling the Tribunal to issue the prayed directions.

In his submission, it would be a dispute relatable to environment.

We are not able to find any merit in this submission.


</p><p id="p_33">16. The expression 'substantial question relating to environment'

or 'enforcement of any legal right relating to environment' cannot be

interpreted so generically that it would even include the education

relating    to   environment.      Furthermore,     the   expression

'implementation' understood in its correct perspective cannot be

extended, so as to empower the Tribunal to issue directions in

relation to service matters involving environmental sciences.

</p><p id="p_34">17. A phrase of significant importance appearing in Section 14 of

the NGT Act is 'arises out of the implementation of enactment

specified   in Schedule I'.     Even in this phrase, the        word

'implementation' is of essence.       'Implementation' in common

parlance means to take forward a decision or to take steps in

furtherance to a decision or a provision of law. It sets into motion,

the actions which are contemplated within the provisions of the Act

to which reference is made. It is not synonymous to 'execution'.

'Execution' in law, particularly under the Code of Civil Procedure,

1908 is a known and well-defined concept.         'Implementation' in

contradistinction thereto is a milder expression but again operates

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                 18</span>
 within the limitations prescribed by the law or the provision in

which such expression appears.          Concept of 'implementation'

cannot travel beyond the framework of law and in that sense it is

even similar to 'execution' as it must be executed in conformity to

the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. There are some

basic similarities between 'implementation' and 'execution' but they

differ in scope and enforcement.
</p>
<p id="p_35">18. We may now examine some of the definitions of the word

'implementation': -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      Oxford Dictionary, 3rd ed., 2010, "implementation"- the
      process of putting a decision or plan into effect; execution.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      Black's Law Dictionary, 9th ed., 2009, "implementation plan"
      in relation to environmental law means 'a detailed outline of
      steps needed to meet environmental quality standards by an
      established time.'

<p id="p_36">19. In the case of <a href="/doc/1932918/" id="a_46">Sanjay Gandhi Grih Nirman Sehkari Sansthan,

Indore    v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>, AIR 1991 MP 72, where the

High Court was concerned with the expression 'Implementation'

appearing in Section 54 of the M.P. Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh

Adhiniyam, 1973 (for short 'the Adhiniyam'), read in conjunction

with <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_47">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_48">6</a> and <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_49">17(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. It

was      contended    that   the   word    'implementation'   means


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   19</span>
 commencement or completion of a decision taken under the

Adhiniyam. The Court, after considering the meaning of the

expression 'implementation' took the view that 'implementation' has

to be construed liberally so as to ensure that the object is achieved

and not frustrated. Therefore, the Court held that 'implementation'

would mean that the steps under the Scheme have been taken and

not that they ought to have been completed within the period of

three years under Section 54 of the Adhiniyam so as to make the

scheme lapse.
</p>
<p id="p_37">20. One also finds use of the expression 'ímplement' in the very

Preamble of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 where it is stated

that 'it is considered necessary further to implement the decisions

afore-said' (the decision taken at the United Nations Conference on

the Human Environment held at Stockholm in June 1972). List I of

the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India in terms of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_50">Article

follows: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             13. Participation    in international conferences,
             associations and other bodies and implementing of
             decisions made thereat.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">21. The word 'implementing' as used above clearly indicates that it

is a direct reference to the decision taken in the international

conferences, etc. and which are sought to be implemented by taking

further action thereof. Thus, when we have to construe the word

'implementation' appearing in Section 14 of the NGT Act, with

reference to the Acts stated in Schedule I of the said Act, we must

confine it to the 'implementation' of the provisions contained under


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                 20</span>
 those Acts and that too with reference to a substantial question

relating to environment and not beyond that.

</p><p id="p_39">22. We have already stated the ingredients which an applicant

invoking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_51">Section 14</a> must

satisfy. The contention that the expression 'implementation' should

receive narrower interpretation in terms of Section 14 of the NGT

Act, would not be in consonance with the settled principles of

interpretation. Hence, it is difficult for us to accept this contention

advanced on behalf of the applicant.
</p>
<p id="p_40">23. Nexus between the dispute raised before the Tribunal for

determination and the environment has to be direct. When the

framers of law use the expression 'substantial question relating to

environment', it clearly conveys the legislative intent of ensuring

that the disputes determinable by the Tribunal have to relate to

environment and not allied fields thereto.       In the case of Goa

Foundation (supra), the Tribunal clearly held that the disputes

arising for decision or settlement before the Tribunal should arise

out of substantial question relating to environment. The violation

must be with regard to environment and it is not a generic term

used by the Legislature enabling the Tribunal to expand its

jurisdiction beyond the true construction of Section 14 of the NGT

Act. The character of the proceeding is clearly not in reference to

the relief that the Tribunal could grant, but upon the nature of the

right violated and the appropriate relief which could be claimed.

</p><p id="p_41">24. In the case of <a href="/doc/88347937/" id="a_52">Kehar Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, 2013 (1) All

India NGT Reporter, Delhi 556, the Tribunal held as under:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                  21</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       The NGT Act is a specific Act with a specific purpose and
      object, and therefore, the cause of action which is specific to
      other laws or other objects and does not directly relate to
      environmental issues would not be 'such dispute' as
      contemplated under the provisions of the NGT Act. The
      dispute must essentially be an environmental dispute and
      must relate to either of the Acts stated in Schedule I to the
      NGT Act and the 'cause of action' referred to under Sub-
      section (3) of <a href="/doc/186973/" id="a_53">Section 14</a> should be the cause of action for
      'such dispute' and not alien or foreign to the substantial
      question of environment. The cause of action must have a
      nexus to such dispute which relates to the issue of
      environment/substantial question relating to environment, or
      any such proceeding, to trigger the prescribed period of
      limitation. A cause of action, which in its true spirit and
      substance,     does    not    relate     to   the    issue   of
      environment/substantial question relating to environment
      arising out of the specified legislations, thus, in law cannot
      trigger the prescribed period of limitation under Section 14(3)
      of the NGT Act.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">25. Another way in which the present controversy could be viewed

is by reading the prayer of the applicant along with contents of the

application. The applicant has submitted that firstly in all colleges

and institutions, environmental science is not a subject and

wherever it has been introduced as a subject, it is not being taught

by qualified teachers. This is the substance of the application. It

clearly falls within the framework of the constitution and/or service

jurisprudence.   It does not raise any substantial question of

environmental jurisprudence understood in its correct perspective

within the provisions of the NGT Act and the Scheduled Acts

thereto. The contention that 'mass education' in <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_54">Section 16(e)</a> of

the Water Act and 16 (f) of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_55">Air Act</a> would come to the aid of the

applicant for issuance of such a direction, is again misconceived.

Organizing through mass media a comprehensive programme

regarding the prevention and control of water and air pollution,

would not take in its cover the education or service jurisprudence in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                 22</span>
 relation to environmental science as a subject of education.               The

programmes contemplated under these provisions must relate to

prevention and control of pollution and not what should be the

terms and conditions of appointment of teachers and how the

environmental      science    should     be    taught   in   an    educational

institution. An activity for prevention and control of pollution must

be   discernibly   distinguished        and   understood     as    such    from

education and conditions of service of teachers as enumerated

under the constitutional provisions or the notifications issued by

the UGC or the Universities. The applicant claims that a legal right

as envisaged under Section 14 of the NGT Act has accrued in his

favour as a result of the Order of the Supreme Court dated 22nd

November, 1991 referred supra. There cannot be a dispute to the

preposition that the orders and judgments declared by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court would be the law of the land and are enforceable

throughout the territory of India in accordance with law. However,

the direction of the Supreme Court in the above case, clearly falls

within the domain of constitutional or service law.               It is for the

applicant to approach the appropriate forum/court for enforcement

of that direction. In our considered view it would not fall within the

ambit of Section 14 of the NGT Act as neither does it raise any

substantial   question       relating   to    environment    nor    does    the

implementation of the Scheduled Acts arise.

</p><p id="p_43">26. Ergo for the reasons afore-recorded, we are of the considered

view that the present application filed by the applicant under

Section 14 of the NGT Act is not maintainable and the Tribunal has


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                        23</span>
 no jurisdiction to entertain and grant the reliefs prayed for by the

applicant.   The applicant is, however, at liberty to approach the

court of competent jurisdiction.      This order would in no way

prejudice the rights and contentions of the applicant. We, further

make it clear that we have neither examined the merits of the case

nor any other contention raised by the parties except to the extent

afore-stated.
</p>
<p id="p_44">27. This application is, therefore, dismissed as not maintainable.

However, we leave the parties to bear their own costs.
