<p id="p_7">        2.               The factual matrix of the case is that the

        petitioner was granted mining lease in respect of an area of

        112.4876 hectares for Pyrophyllite and Quartzite in village

        Tikarpada, Ambadahara, Dist- Keonjhar for a period of 20

years w.e.f. 07.11.1998 to 06.11.2018. The entire area was

a non-forest land. The Collector, Keonjhar granted surface

right in respect of 67.1390 hectares (over plot no. 1050 and

Plot No. 1142 under Khata No. 274) out of the granted

mining lease area of 112.4876 hectares. After obtaining

necessary statutory clearance and approval, the petitioner

carried on mining operation over the said                         67.1390

hectares, in respect of which surface right had been

granted.
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">3.                   Due     to   lack   of    market     demand,      the

petitioner        discontinued     the      mining      operation    w.e.f.

15.12.2004         after    informing    the    statutory       authorities

the provisions of Rule 22(1) read with Rule 25 of the Mineral

Conservation and Development Rules, 1998 (hereinafter

referred     to     as     "MCD    Rules,     1988").     The    statutory

notification for obtaining environment clearances, namely,

Environment          Impact       Assessment      Notification       dated

14.09.2006 was issued by the Ministry of Environment and

Forest (MOEF), Government of India for which mining

operation of the petitioner was kept in abeyance w.e.f.

08.10.2007, as the petitioner sought for environment

clearance from the MOEF in respect of 67.1390 hectares,

over which surface right had been granted by the competent

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.                  The Director of Mines, Odisha approved the

scheme of mining plan with projected annual production of

6500 M.T. of Pyrophyllite and 4000 M.T. of Quartzite on

08.07.2009. The petitioner also sought for consent to

operate      from    the   State       Pollution   Control   Board,

Bhubaneswar, Odisha in respect of the above approval. The

petitioner also submitted an application on 02.06.2010 for

surrender of an area measuring 45.3486 hectares, which

formed part of the original mining lease area of 112.4876

hectares. The said surrendered area was virgin/unbroken

and intact area and no mining operation was carried out by

the petitioner and more particularly the said 45.3486

which surface right had been granted.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.               At this point of time, the Divisional Forest

Officer (DFO), Keonjhar, opposite party no.4 vide Office

Order no. 220 dated 16.06.2010 declared the said 45.3486

hectares as District Level Committee (DLC)             land and

demanded payment of Rs. 2,83,88,224/- towards Net

Present Value (NPV) for the said area of 45.3486 hectares,

which had already been surrendered by the petitioner.

Thereafter, the DFO, Keonjhar vide Office Order no. 306

dated 09.07.2010 modified the Office Order No. 220 dated

16.06.2010 and issued a revised demand notice claiming

payment of Rs.3,31,04,478/- towards NPV for the said area

of 45.3486 hectares, which remained virgin/unbroken and

no mining operation was carried out by the petitioner. In

response to the same, the petitioner immediately on

13.07.2010 and 09.08.2010 intimated the D.F.O., Keonjhar

that the petitioner vide his letter dated 02.06.2010 already

submitted   an    application   for   surrender   of   the   said

virgin/unbroken area, where no mining operation was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 6</span>




carried out by him, which is under active consideration by

the State Government, and as such he is not liable to pay

the NPV in respect of the said area.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.                At this juncture, the Range Officer in the

office of the DFO, Keonjhar on 25.10.2010 submitted a

report to the DFO, Keonjhar in respect of the surrendered

area of 45.3486 hectares stating inter alia that there was no

illicit felling of trees and no encroachment. In the meantime,

the revised mining scheme in respect of the retained area of

67.1390 hectares out of 112.4876 hectares was approved by

the   statutory    authority   vide   letter   no.   2538   dated

19.08.2011 being valid up to 2015-16. In view of such

position, the opposite parties did not take any steps for

more than a period of two years, but all on a sudden in

2013, the DFO, Keonjhar vide Letter No.1956 dated

11.03.2013 intimated the Collector and District Magistrate,

Keonjhar stating, inter alia, that surrendered area of

45.3486 hectares had not been broken up/no mining

operation had been carried out and that the area was

intact. The Collector and District Magistrate, Keonjhar vide

letter no. 454 dated 02.04.2013 forwarded the application of

the petitioner in respect of the surrendered area of 45.3486

hectares to the Director of Mines, Bhubaneswar, Odisha

along with the report of Senior Surveyor in the office of the

Mining Officer,    Keonjhar, DFO,          Keonjhar,    Tahasildar,

Banspal as well as the Joint Survey Report along with the

Map    for   further   action.       The   Director     of    Mines,

Bhubaneswar,      Odisha    vide      Letter   No.     1106    dated

01.11.2013   forwarded     the     surrender proposal         of   the

petitioner in respect of the 45.3486 hectares to opposite

party no.1 for disposal on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.              In the meantime, MOEF, Government of

India vide letter dated 28.06.2013 granted environment

clearance to the petitioner in respect of the retained area of

67.1390 hectares. Consequently, the petitioner vide his

letter dated 12.08.2013 sought for reopening the mines and

to commence the mining operation in Form-C under the

provisions of Rule 22(1) read with Rule 25 of the MCD

Rules, 1988 over 67.1390 hectares of Plot No. 1050 and Plot

No. 1142 under Khata No. 274 in village Tikarpada,

Ambadahara, District Keonjhar. Since no response was

received,   the   petitioner     reminded   on   03.12.2013   for

granting    permission     for     commencement      of   mining

operation, as the consent to operate was valid up to

31.03.2014 and the approved mining plan for retention of

area of 67.1390 hectares was valid up to the period 2015-

</p><p id="p_13">16.

</p><p id="p_14">8.                When such permission regarding reopening

and commencement of mining operation was pending

consideration with the Director of Mines, Odisha, the

D.F.O., Keonjhar-opposite party no.4 on 01.02.2014 called

upon the petitioner to deposit NPV in respect of surrendered

area of 45.3486 hectares. In response to the same, the

petitioner communicated on 01.03.2014 stating that he has

already surrendered the area and, as such, he was not

holding any forest land within the retained area of 67.1390

hectares and, therefore, not liable to pay NPV as demanded.

But, the D.F.O. without considering the contention raised

by the petitioner directed vide letter dated 22.02.2014 to

deposit an amount of Rs.3,31,04,478/-.

</p><p id="p_16">9.              In the meantime, the State Pollution Control

Board, Bhubaneswar vide Office Order No. 606 dated

22.04.2015 granted consent to operate for a production

capacity of 6500 M.T. of Pyrophyllite and 4000 of Quartzite

till 31.03.2016. The mining operation of the petitioner was

kept in abeyance w.e.f. 17.09.2007 for want of statutory

clearance under the Environment Impact Assessment

Notification dated 14.09.2006. Instead of allowing the

petitioner to reopen and commence the mining operation

over 67.1390 hectares, opposite party no.1 initiated a

proceeding for lapsing, as envisaged under Rule 28(2) of the

Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (for short "MC Rules,

1960") and vide notice under Rule 28(1) of the said MC

Rules, 1960 called upon the petitioner to show-cause as to

why the lease shall not be declared lapsed. In response to

the same, the petitioner submitted his reply on 24.11.2014

and on consideration of his reply, opposite party no.1 vide

letter dated 02.06.2015 was pleased to hold that mining

lease was not liable to be lapsed and ordered that the surrender

proposal over the area of 45.3486 hectares was accepted,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               10</span>




but the petitioner was restrained from resuming mining

operation pending deposit of the NPV dues in respect of

45.3486    hectares.   In   compliance   of   the   same,   the

Tahasildar, Banspal vide Letter dated 07.07.2015 intimated

the Collector, Keonjhar regarding taking over the possession

in respect of 45.3486 hectares of surrendered area, which

has been accepted by the State Government. As the

petitioner did not deposit the NPV dues over the said

surrendered area of 45.3486 hectares in compliance of

letter dated 02.06.2015, he was not allowed to have the

mining operation over the area of 67.1390 hectares. Hence

this application.
</p>
<p id="p_17">10.        Mr. S. Nanda, learned counsel appearing for the

petitioner contended that the petitioner is not liable to pay

any NPV amount, as he has not diverted any forest land for

non-forest purpose under the <a href="/doc/1436914/" id="a_2">Forest (Conservation) Act</a>,

1980 (for short "FC Act, 1980"). He further contended that

as per the guidelines for diversion of forest land for non-

forestry purpose, the NPV can be levied and such demand

can be made only after 30.10.2002 and the same can be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               11</span>




realized before Stage-II (final) approval. As the petitioner has

surrendered an area of 45.3486 hectares and on the basis

of the report of the competent authority the same was intact

and was not utilized for any other purpose nor the said

forest land was diverted for non-forestry purpose under FC

Act, 1980, the demand so made pursuant to letter dated

22.02.2014 for an amount of Rs.3,31,04,478/- towards NPV

cannot sustain in the eye of law.        Consequentially, the

direction contained in letter dated 02.06.2015 that mining

operation would be allowed to resume after the lessee

deposited the pending NPV dues, being illegal, arbitrary and

contrary to the guidelines, is liable to be quashed.

</p><p id="p_18">11.        Mr. B.P. Pradhan, learned Addl. Government

Advocate for the State justifies the demand raised by the

authority and states that unless the petitioner deposits the

NPV dues he will not be allowed to resume mining operation

over the area of 67.1390 hectares where surface right has

been granted by the competent authority. It is stated that

NPV amount has been demanded on the basis of the order

dated 12.02.1996 passed by the apex Court in W.P.(C)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                              12</span>




No.202 of 1995 (<a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_3">T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union

of India</a>), and that the surrendered area of 45.3486

hectares being the integral part of the mining lease till it

was accepted on 02.06.2015, the petitioner is liable to pay

the NPV amount demanded by the authority. It is further

contended that the petitioner did not challenge the demand

to pay Rs.2,83,88,224/- towards the NPV over 45.3486

hectares DLC forest land vide office order no.220 dated

16.06.2010 of the opposite party no.4 as well as the revised

demand of Rs.3,31,04,478/- over the said area which was

raised on 09.07.2010, at the relevant time. Only when the

resumption of mining operation in respect of the area over

which surface right had been granted, i.e., 67.1390 hectares

was allowed subject to condition of payment of NPV dues

pursuant to letter dated 02.07.2016, the petitioner has

approached this Court by filing the present writ application

which cannot sustain in the eye of law.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               13</span>




counsel for the parties, the writ petition is disposed of at

this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_20">13.           Before addressing on the merits of the issue

involved in this case, it is apposite to bring on record the

object and reasons behind imposition of NPV. The natural

resources are the assets of the entire nation. Therefore, it is

the obligation of the Union Government as well as the State

Governments to conserve and not to waste these resources.

As per the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_4">Article 48A</a> of the

Constitution of India, States shall make all endeavour to

protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the

forest and wildlife of the country. Similarly, under <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_5">Article

51A</a> the duty has been cast on every citizen to protect and

improve the natural environment including forest, lakes,

rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living

creatures. Therefore, for the question with regard to

conservation, preservation and protection of forest and the

ecology, it is to be considered that if the forest land is used

for non-forest purposes what steps/measures are required
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                14</span>




to be taken to compensate for loss of forest land and effect

on the ecology.
</p>
<p id="p_21">14.       No doubt the forests are a vital component to

sustain the life support system on the earth. The national

development, if any, has to be in consistent with the

protection of environment not at the degradation of the

same. Therefore, policy or vision for over all development

has to evolve a systematic approach so as to balance the

economic development and environmental protection. The

economic development at the cost of degradation of

environment       would   be   ultimately   counterproductive.

Therefore, it is necessary to take a precautionary measure

when forest lands are diverted for non-forest use.      Thus,

before diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes and

consequential loss of benefit occurring from the forest

should not be the user-agency and such land be required to

compensate for the diversion. In this back-drop, the NPV

has to be determined.
</p>
<p id="p_22">15.       Being conscious of this position, the legislature to

provide for conservation of forest and for matters connected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               15</span>




therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto enacted FC Act,

1980, which postulates that no State Government or other

authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the

Central Government, any order directing that any forest

land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest

purpose. Therefore, the Central Government under the FC

Act has been empowered to constitute a committee to advice

it with regard to grant of approval. Therefore, contravention

of any of the provisions contained in Section 2 of the FC

Act, 1980 has been made an offence.
</p>
<p id="p_23">16.       Similarly,   to   protect   the   environment,   the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 (for short "EP Act,

1986") has been enacted. It has been done with an object

and reason that although there are existing laws dealing

directly or indirectly with several environmental matters,

but it is necessary to have a general legislation for

environment protection to prevent decline in environment

quality due to increasing population, loss of vegetal cover

and biological diversity, excessive concentrations of harmful

chemicals in the ambient atmosphere and in food chains,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                              16</span>




growing risks of environmental accidents and threats to life

support system. The Central Government has been given

wide powers to take measures to protect and improve the

environment as provided under <a href="/doc/1870616/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> including the

power to constitute an authority or authorities for the

purpose of exercising and performing such of the powers

and functions, including the power to issue directions under

<a href="/doc/1728291/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of the Act, and for taking measures, with respect

to such of the matters referred to in sub-section (2) of

<a href="/doc/1870616/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> as may be mentioned in the order and subject to

the prejudice and control of the Central Government. The

Parliament has also enacted enactments to prevent and

control water pollution and air pollution {The Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981}.


</p><p id="p_24">17.       To achieve the above objective, the Ministry of

Environment and Forests (MOEF) was also directed to

formulate a scheme providing that whenever any permission

is granted for change of use of forest land for non-forest
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                               17</span>




purposes and one of the conditions of the permission is that

there should be compensatory afforestation, then the

responsibility of the same should be that of user-agency and

it should be required to set apart a sum of money for doing

the needful. In such a case, the State Government will have

to provide or make available land on which reforestation can

take place and this land may have to be made available

either at the expenses of user-agency or of the State

Government, as the State Government may decide. It was

decided that the scheme shall ensure that afforestation

takes place as per the permission which are granted and

there should be no shortfall. Consequentially, MOEF had to

issue guidelines from time to time under the FC Act, 1980

and the procedure for receipt and utilization of funds for

compensatory afforestation, activities permissible under

compensatory afforestation, adequate compensation for loss

of forest land, recovery of NPV, funds for catchment area,

treatment   plant   and   involvement    of   user-agency   for

compensatory afforestation.        Thus, under the aforesaid

premises, the letter dated 17/18.09.2003 in Annexure-17

apex Court in <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_17">T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of

<p id="p_29">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     "26. First, we may consider the meaning of NPV
     and determine what is NPV.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     27. The NPV is the present value (PV) of net cash
     flow from a project, discounted by the cost of
     capital.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">     28. Forestry is a public project. It is important to
     bear in mind that a benefit received today is
     worth more than that received later. The benefit
     received today is in fact 'cost incurred' today.
     Time value of the cash inflow/outflow is
     important in investment appraisal. NPV is a
     method by which future expenditures (costs) and
     benefit are levelised in order to account for the
     time value of money. The object behind NPV is to
     levelise costs. What is the value of Rupee today
     would not be the value of Rupee say 50 years
     later. For example, let us have the starting point
     of value of Rupee in India in the year 2005 and
     analyse it with the value of Rupee that may be in
     the year 2050. Cost incurred or to be incurred in
     2050 have to be discounted by using appropriate
     parameters like rate of discount, gestation period,
     ratio of deflators to GDP. Therefore, expenses
     incurred in each year between say 2005 and
     2050 have to be brought down to their present
     values by using appropriate discount rate in the
     NPV."

<p id="p_30">21.          Applying the above meaning of NPV to the

present      context   and     considering    the        guidelines,   as

discussed above, there is no dispute that mining lease of an

area measuring 112.4876 hectares was granted in favour of

the petitioner in the year 1998 in respect of plot nos.1050

and 1142 under Khata No.274 in village Tikarpada,

Ambadahara in the district of Keonjhar for a period of 20

years from 07.11.1998 to 06.11.2018, but surface right was

granted in respect of 67.1390 hectares on 18.05.1999, over

which the petitioner has started the mining operation

awaiting     environment      clearance.     On     02.06.2010,        the

petitioner surrendered an area measuring 45.3486 hectares,

which forms part of the original mining lease area of

112.4876 hectares.          When the surrender application was

pending for consideration, the demand of NPV was made

over the said surrendered area of 45.3486 hectares by the

D.F.O., Keonjhar on 16.06.2010 and subsequently a revised

demand was made on 09.07.2010 for Rs.3,31,04,478/-.

But,   the     petitioner    communicated         vide     letter   dated

09.08.2010 that his application dated 02.06.2010 for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                               22</span>




surrendering of 45.3486 hectares of land is under active

consideration of the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_31">22.         At this point of time, Range Officer submitted

report to the D.F.O. on 25.10.2010 that there was no illicit

felling of trees or any encroachment over the surrendered

area of 45.3486 hectares. This fact was communicated to

the Collector and District Magistrate after two years, i.e., on

11.03.2013 that the said surrendered area was intact/

unbroken.      Consequentially, the Collector and District

Magistrate    on   02.04.2013      forwarded   the   surrender

application to the Director of Mines, Odisha on 02.04.2013.

When the matter stood thus, on 28.06.2013 the MOEF

granted environment clearance in respect of the retained

area of 67.1390 hectares with the finding that DLC forest

land of 45.3486 hectares has been surrendered.             On

01.11.2013, in compliance of Rule 29 of the MC Rules, the

Director of Mines forwarded the surrender application to

opposite party no.1 for final order, which was ultimately

accepted on 02.06.2015 vide Annexure-14.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                             23</span>




</p><p id="p_32">23.       In the meantime, even though steps for lapsing

were taken, but it was held that mining lease was not liable

to be lapsed and the petitioner was directed to deposit NPV

dues in respect of 45.3480 hectares of virgin/unbroken

area, which had been surrendered to the Government. As

the surrendered area was not diverted for non-forest

purpose under the FC Act, 1980 and it remained intact and

virgin as it was, the question of recovery/collection of NPV

for using forest land for being diverted for non-forest

purpose under the FC Act, 1980 does not arise. Laudable

consideration for recovery/collection of NPV has been well

discussed above. Therefore, the area of 45.3486 hectares,

which has been surrendered by the petitioner, as per the

report of the Range Officer and other competent authority,

having been remained intact and virgin and having not

diverted to non-forest purpose under the FC Act, 1980, the

petitioner is not liable to pay NPV, as demanded pursuant

to letter in Annexure-10 dated 01.02.2014 and consequent

revised demand made on 22.02.2014 in Annexure-12.

Annexure-14, though the petitioner has been communicated

that the mining lease is not liable to be lapsed since the

lessee has operated the mines from January, 2013 to April,

2014, as intimated by the Mining Officer, Keonjhar vide

memo no.749 dated 12.05.2015 in respect of 67.1390

hectares in respect of which surface right was granted, and

accepted the surrender proposal over an area of 45.3480

hectares, resumption of mining operation has been allowed

only after deposit of the pending NPV dues by the lessee.

The petitioner is aggrieved to the extent of direction given

therein with regard to payment of NPV dues demanded

against the surrendered area of 45.3480 hectares, as the

said forest land has not been diverted for any non-forest

purpose under the FC Act, 1980. In view of such position,

since the petitioner has not utilized the surrendered

45.3480 hectares of forest land by diverting the same to any

non-forest purpose under the FC Act, 1980, he is not liable

to pay the NPV dues, as demanded vide letter dated
