               ---------------------------------------
             Dated this the 11th of February, 2015

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Ext.P29 closure intention notice, followed by Ext.P30 closure

order passed under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, to stop all operations and

processes in the industry with immediate effect and Ext.P31

communication issued by the Electricity Board, whereby power

supply was disconnected on 09.01.2015, pursuant to the

direction given by the Pollution Control Board based on Ext.P13,

are under challenge in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The 2nd petitioner is the son of the 1st petitioner. The 1st

petitioner is running an industry styled as a 'Rubber Processing

Unit' in the Chemical Industrial Estate, Aroor in Alappuzha

District. The said unit was functioning under the licence issued by

the 4th respondent/Rubber Board as per Exts.P1 and P2 and that

the same is stated as in existence from 1983. The petitioners'

unit was being run on the basis of valid consent issued by the 1st

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) No.1670 of 2015          2</span>




respondent Pollution Control Board as per Exts.P3 and P4, licence

issued by the Department of Factories and Boilers vide Ext.P5

and the licence issued by the local authority vide Exts.P6 and P7.

</p><p id="p_3">       3. According to the petitioners, the latex and skim rubber

are processed to make skim crepe in the unit and that the special

licence has been issued by the 4th respondent to the said process.

Ext.P27 is the renewed licence issued by the Department of

Factories and Boilers, Kollam and Ext.P28 is the licence issued by

the local authority. In the course of operation as above, the

petitioners were served with Ext.P8 show-cause by the 3rd

respondent, referring to some incriminating circumstances, which

stands replied as per Ext.P9. Several further notices were issued

and the petitioners have responded to such notices, explaining

the facts and circumstances and pointing out that there was no

default or lapse on the part of the petitioners. Later, the

petitioners were served with Ext.P17 show-cause notice dated

23.03.2012 issued by the 3rd respondent, as to why directions

under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_3">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_5">Section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.1670 of 2015          3</span>




the unit closed down. The petitioners submitted Ext.P18

explanation dated 18.04.2012. However, without any regard to

the same and even without affording an opportunity of hearing to

the petitioners, Ext.P19 order dated 04.05.2012 was passed,

simply closing down the petitioners' unit quite abruptly, which is

allegedly based on a Circular issued by the 2nd respondent as

Ext.P21. The petitioners approached this Court by filing WP(C)

No.12763 of 2012 challenging Ext.P19 order and Ext.P21

Circular. This Court observed that, there was infringement of the

fundamental principle of 'audi alteram partem' and that the

petitioners were entitled to have an opportunity of hearing,

before any order was passed. It was also observed by this Court

that, under what circumstances was it felt necessary to have

issued Ext.P21 Circular, was not discernible from the same.

Accordingly, the writ petition was disposed of as per Ext.P25

judgment dated 31.01.2013, whereby both Exts.P19 order and

Ext.P21 Circular were quashed and the Pollution Control Board

was directed to reconsider the matter and pass a proper order,

after affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_4">       4. In furtherance to the above verdict, the matter was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.1670 of 2015          4</span>




considered by the 2nd respondent, who passed Ext.P26 order

dated 06.04.2013. As per Ext.P26 order, the 2nd respondent

found that serum was the effluent, generated during latex

centrifuging and the creamed latex separated from latex and that

disposal of untreated serum from latex industries into water

bodies caused contamination of water bodies in the State.

Consents were being issued to Latex Centrifuging Units with strict

condition to treat the serum generated during the process, along

with other waste water generated in the units, in their own

effluent treatment plant, to achieve the effective quality standard

before discharge and that, if the latex centrifuging units dispose/

sell serum to an external agency, there was environmental threat

and that the same was not a permissible activity. That apart,

serum contained only 3% or below rubber content and the rest

was waste water with High BOD and hence was not economical to

process such huge volume of waste water in a tiny unit, as a raw

material. It was also observed that, at present, there was no

scope of getting serum from centrifuged latex units, since the

Board had not issued consent under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Water Act</a> to dispose the

serum through any other external units, as it had to be disposed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) No.1670 of 2015          5</span>




only through the 'own effluent treatment plants' of the agencies.

It was accordingly that, the application with fee was ordered to

be returned with specific remarks regarding the raw material

(serum).
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5. However, on the basis of the requests of the unit's

representative, an opinion was sought to be obtained from the 4th

respondent Rubber Board and the Central Pollution Control

Board, whether the serum generated from latex centrifuging units

could be used/considered as a raw material for further processing

in other units, rather than the same processed in the centrifuged

latex units, where it is generated.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       6. The petitioners contend that, by virtue of the nature of

the order passed by the 2nd respondent vide Ext.P26, the matter

has not become final. While so, the 3rd respondent issued Ext.P29

show-cause notice as to the order proposed to be issued under

<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_8">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974 for closure of the unit, directing the petitioners to

submit objections, if any, within fifteen days. The said notice was

issued only on 31.12.2014. But even before expiry of the period

of fifteen days to submit the objections, the unit was ordered to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) No.1670 of 2015          6</span>




be closed down as per Ext.P30 order dated 06.01.2015, followed

by disconnection of electricity effected on 09.01.2015 as evident

from Ext.P31, which in turn are under challenge.

</p><p id="p_7">       7. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that, the

proceedings pursued by the respondents are per se wrong and

illegal in all respects, also in violation of the fundamental

principles of natural justice, having denied an opportunity to

submit objections and further that, abrupt closure of the unit has

quite adversely affected the survival of the petitioners and the

workers, also causing huge loss, which hence is sought to be

intercepted by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       8. The learned Standing Counsel appearing for the

respondent Pollution Control Board submits that, there is

absolutely no merit or bonafides in the case projected by the

petitioners and that the unit was being run quite unauthorisedly,

without any valid consent/licence. It is also pointed out that

Exts.P2 and P3 consents issued by the Board expired long back

and after issuance of Ext.P8 show cause notice to the petitioners

on 19.03.2010, further steps were taken and the unit was

ordered to be closed down in the year 2010 itself. The said order

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C) No.1670 of 2015            7</span>




was never challenged by the petitioners and it was without

getting any further consent, that the unit was being run quite

unauthorisedly; thus in violation of all relevant provisions of law,

causing much threat to the environment, on diverting the

untreated serum to the water bodies. It is also pointed out that,

the unauthorised running of the unit was taken up by the

aggrieved parties of the locality, by approaching the National

Green Tribunal, Southern Zone, Chennai, by filing application

No.371/2013 (SZ) (THC). It is stated that the Pollution Control

Board has already filed a detailed Counter Affidavit dated

06.01.2015 in the said case, also producing copies of all the

relevant documents.

Board made available copies of the extracts of the orders passed

               The counsel for the respondents are present. They
        seek further time for filing reply. In view of the fact that
        there was no representation for the application in the
        last few hearings, the matter is posted for dismissal.
        Even this day also there is no representation for the
        applicant. However, it is brought to the notice of the
        Tribunal in the last hearing that a closure order was
        served upon the Unit and hence it has to be recorded.
        This day the learned counsel for the Board would submit
        that though a closure Notice which was followed by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.(C) No.1670 of 2015              9</span>




        closure order was served on the Unit in the year 2010, it
        was found subsequently that the Unit was operating.
        Under the circumstances, the matter has got to be kept
        pending. After hearing the counsel for the Kerala State
        Pollution Control Board (Board), it would be quite
        evident that despite the closure order that too served in
        the year 2010, the Unit has been functioning. Hence the
        District Environmental Engineer concerned is directed to
        inspect the Unit on the facts as to when the closure
        order was served and subsequently from which period
        the Unit has been functioning/ operating and if so, what
        action was taken thereon by the Board and file a report
        in the next hearing before this Tribunal. All the
        respondents are directed to file their reply on that day.
        The matter is posted to 09.01.2015.

               No representation for the applicant. It was
        brought to the notice of the Tribunal in the last hearing
        that a closure order was served upon the 1st respondent
        industry in the year 2010 despite the same, 1st
        respondent industry was carrying on its operation. After
        recording the statement, the Tribunal made an order
        directing the Kerala State Pollution Control Board,
        District Environmental Engineer concerned to file a
        report whether the 1st respondent industry carried on its
        operation despite the closure order and if so, what
        action was taken against the industry. The counsel for
        the Board this day would submit an order of closure is
        again served on the industry that would clearly
        indicative of the fact that the industry has been
        operating despite the closure order in the year 2010.
        Hence, it becomes necessary to issue a direction to the
        Chairman, Kerala Pollution Control Board to personally
        look into the matter and see the provisions of law
        strictly enforced in order to give effective closure order
        and report before the Tribunal in the next hearing. The
        matter is posted to 09.03.2015."</blockquote><p id="p_10">

that the respondent Board implemented closure of the unit as per

Ext.P30 order dated 06.01.2015 followed by disruption of the

electricity supply vide Ext.P31 order dated 09.01.2015. The

petitioners have not produce any document before this Court to

show that they are having the valid consent to operate as on

date.
