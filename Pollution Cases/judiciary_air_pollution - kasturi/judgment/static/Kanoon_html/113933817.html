opposite parties (OPs) on the averments, OPs floated a scheme for

Hamlet', SAS Nagar, Mohali. The complainant was desirous of

purchasing a plot within the vicinity of Tricity. The complainant

approached OPs for this purpose. He was allotted plot no.80 of 250

square yard, vide provisional allotment letter dated 26.05.2011, in

Sector   98,   Mohali   for   basic   sale   price   of   Rs.62,64,750/-

(@Rs.25,000/- per square yard). External development charges

@Rs.1275.10 per square yard of plot area were also charged over

and above the basic sale price by OPs from him. He also paid IFMS

charges of 350 square yard. Plot buyer's agreement was executed

between the parties on 27.06.2011. Till February 23 2015, he

deposited total payment of Rs.63,58,756/- under applicable payment

plan and few receipts are Annexured as C-3 and C-12. Balance

payment was to be paid by complainant to OPs at the time of

delivery of possession and registration of sale deed. It is further

averred that OPs failed to deliver the possession of the said plot

within the stipulated period to him. The complainant has alleged

deficiency in service on the part of OPs. As per clause no.11.1 of the

plot buyer's agreement, OPs were bound to handover the physical

possession of residential plot no.80 within a period of 24 months

from the date of execution of the agreement. OPs were entitled to an

additional period of six months (grace period) after expiry of 24

months, as per clause 11.1 of the agreement i.e. 27.12.2014, but

OPs failed to deliver the possession within scheduled time. The

complainant received notice of possession, vide letter dated

04.05.2015 from OPs to the effect that plot was ready for possession
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                     3</span>


subject to fulfillment of certain conditions i.e. payment of all amounts

due, payment of stamp duty, registration charges and incidental

expenses, submission of duly filled in and signed registration form,

execution of indemnity bond-cum-undertaking and signing of

tripartite maintenance agreement. It is further averred that as per

payment plan, 5% of BSP and 50% of IFMS amounting to

Rs.3,57,091/- was to be paid at the time of possession. Vide letter

dated 26.09.2011, OP changed the payment plan from Time linked

payment plan to Development linked payment plan and also

annexed schedule-I for payments. As per the new schedule, 5% of

BSP and 100% stamp duty and registration fee amounting to

Rs.3,13,238/- was to be paid at the time of possession. The

complainant    deposited   Rs.2,90,873/-    on   06.07.2015     through

cheques. In December 2015, OP called complainant for signing of

some documents and for completion of formalities for execution of

conveyance deed and assured for execution of conveyance deed

shortly, but to no effect. In February 2016, complainant visited the

site and found that there was no development and even the roads

dividing Sectors 97-98 and approach road for reaching the site were

not there. The complainant approached OPs immediately and asked

about the progress of the project, but OPs intimated verbally that

process of mobilization would take some time. It is further averred

that OPs have no necessary permission/approval with regard to

development of the project, as the documents sent by them to

GMADA were having various deficiencies. He asked OPs to provide
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                    4</span>


the necessary approvals/permissions, but they did not bother to give

reply. The service layout plan has got sanctioned on 18.05.2015 by

OPs, after issuance of possession letter to him. Even the completion

certificate/partial completion certificate in respect of above project

has not been issued by competent authority to OPs for this project,

hence notice of possession issued by OPs to complainant on

04.05.2015 was baseless. The complainant has alleged deficiency in

service and unfair trade practice on the part of OPs and prayed that

OPs be directed to refund the amount of Rs.66,49,619/- alongwith

interest @10.5% per annum from the actual date of deposit; further

to pay compensation of Rs.1,50,000/- for mental harassment and

Rs.50,000/- as litigation expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.         Upon notice, OPs appeared and filed their joint written

reply and contested the complaint of the complainant vehemently by

raising preliminary objections that complaint is false and frivolous.

The complainant is under an obligation to receive the final

possession of the plot in terms of notice of possession issued by

OPs. The complainant admitted the development on the spot, vide

letter dated 27.10.2015 and asked OP no.1 to bear the cost of stamp

duty, registration charges and incidental expenses. The allegations

of complainant are after-thought only. There is an arbitration clause

no.33 in the agreement and hence consumer complaint is not

maintainable. The relationship of consumer and service provider

between the parties has been denied by OPs. The complainant

booked the plot for commercial purposes and for investment and is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                    5</span>


not consumer of OPs. The complaint is alleged to be barred by time.

Any deficiency in service on the part of OPs has been vehemently

denied. The compensation can be awarded under Act only, as

described in <a href="/doc/1650356/" id="a_3">Section 14(1)(d)</a> of the Act. The complaint is without any

cause of action available to the complainant. This Commission has

no pecuniary jurisdiction to try the complaint. The complaint is also

contested even on merits by OPs. The report of Local Commission

dated 24.10.2015 has been sidetracked by the OPs showing

development and existence of basic amenities in the project. It has

been denied that OP no.1 has not been granted the requisite

sanctions   and   approvals   by    the   competent   authorities   for

development of this project. OP no.1 has been exempted from

certain conditions including the completion certificate, as per

notification issued by Punjab Government in the year 2008. The OPs

have controverted the other averments of the complainant by

denying any deficiency in service and unfair trade practice on their

part. OPs have prayed for dismissal for the complaint.

</p><p id="p_11">3.          The complainant tendered in evidence his affidavit

Ex.C-A alongwith copies of documents Ex.C-1 to Ex.C-24 and

closed the evidence. As against it, OPs tendered in evidence

affidavit of Sumit Kumar authorized representative of OPs Ex.OP-A

alongwith copies of documents Ex.OP-1 to Ex.OP-37 and closed the

evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.          We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and

also examined the record of the case. The complainant seeks
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                    6</span>


amendment by filing an application seeking reduction of his claim in

this complaint. The complainant seeks to reduce his claim of interest

from 18% to 10.5% and litigation expenses from Rs.80,000/- to

Rs.50,000/- and compensation from Rs.10,00,000/- to Rs.1,50,000/-.

The counsel for OP contested it by contending that there is no such

provision to allow it. In view of law laid down by the National

Commission in "S.D. Enterprices Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd.

&amp; others" 2017(I)CPJ-527 (NC), this type of amendment in reducing

the claim by complainant can be allowed. On the basis of law laid

down by the National Commission, this application is allowed and

amended complaint is taken on the record. The further point raised

by OPs is that there is an arbitration clause in the buyer's agreement

between the parties and hence consumer complaint is not

maintainable. We find no force in this submission of OPs. The matter

has been settled by larger bench of Hon'ble National Commission in

consumer complaint no.701 of 2015, decided on 13.07.2017 titled as

"Aftab Singh Vs. EMAAR MGF Land Limited and another". The

National Commission has held in this authority that an arbitration

clause in the afore-stated kind of Agreements between the

complainants and the builder cannot circumscribe the jurisdiction of

a Consumer Forum, notwithstanding the amendments made to

<a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_4">Section 8</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Against this order of the

National Commission, Civil Appeal nos.23512-23513 of 2017 titled

as EMAAR MGF Land Limited and another Vs. Aftab Singh" was

filed by OP before the Top Court, which has since been dismissed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                        7</span>


by the Apex Court, vide order dated 13.02.2018. Consequently, the

existence of an arbitration clause is not a bar to resolution of this

dispute by the Consumer Forum. Even otherwise, the Apex Court

has also so held in "National Seeds Corporation Limited Vs. M.

Madhusudhan Reddy and another" 2012(2)CLT-382/383 and in

<a href="/doc/803209/" id="a_5">Fair Air Engineers (P) Ltd. vs. N. K. Modi</a> (1996) 6 SCC 385 that

Section 3 of C.P. Act gives additional remedy to consumers to avail

of his remedy as per his choice. In view of Section 3 of C.P. Act

conferring the additional remedy on the consumers, we find no force

in this submission of OPs and repel the submission of OPs on this

point.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.          The next submission of counsel for OPs is that

complainant is not consumer and complainant has purchased the

unit for investment purposes. On hearing the submission of counsel

for parties and on perusal of record, we find no force in it as OPs

developed the residential project wherein complainant purchased the

plot. The complainant has pleaded and stated in his affidavit on oath

that he was desirous of residential plot within the vicinity in the tricity

and opted for it. There is nothing on the record that complainant

owned any other properties somewhere else. The OPs failed to

discharge the onus on this point that complainant is property dealer

and deals in sale and purchase of the property. Consequently, the

complainant is held to be consumer by repelling the contention of

OPs in this regard. The next point urged by counsel for OPs is that

consumer complaint is not maintainable as there is no relationship of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                    8</span>


consumer and service provider between the parties. We are not

impressed with this submission. Housing construction is a service

under the Act and complaint is maintainable in this regard. There is

relationship of consumer and service provider between the parties

and it is so held by us in this complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_14">6.          We have perused the documents on the record. Ex.C-1

is provisional allotment of plot in above project allotted to

complainant by OPs on 26.05.2011. Agreement was executed

between the parties on 27.06.2011, vide Ex.C-2 on the record

recording the terms and conditions of this allotment. Clause 11 of

this agreement deals with possession and holding charges and is re-

produced as under :
</p>
<p id="p_15">"11. POSSESSION AND HOLDING CHARGES

      11.1 Subject to Force Majeure as defined herein, and further

      subject to the Allottee having complied with all its obligations

      under the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and not

      being in default of any provision(s) of this Agreement including

      but not limited to the timely payment of all dues and charges

      including the total Sale Consideration, registration charges,

      stamp duty and other charges, and also subject to the Allottee

      having complied with all formalities or documentation as

      prescribed by the Company, the Company proposes to hand

      over the possession of the said Plot to the Allottee within a

      period of 24 (Twenty Four) months from the date of execution

      of this Agreement ("Commitment Period"). The Allottee further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                      9</span>


     agrees and understands that the Company shall additionally be

     entitled to a period of 6 (six) months ("Grace Period"), after the

     expiry of the said Commitment Period.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     11.2 Subject to Clause 11.1, if the Company fails to offer

     possession of the said Plot to the Allottee by the end of the

     Grace Period, it shall be liable to pay to the Allottee

     compensation calculated at the rate of Rs. 50/- (Rupees Fifty

     only) per sq. yd. of the area of the said Plot ("Delay

     Compensation") for every month of delay until the actual date

     fixed by the Company for handing over of possession of the

     said Plot to the Allottee. The Allottee shall be entitled to

     payment against such 'Delay Compensation' only after

     completion of all documentation including registration of the

     Conveyance Deed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     11.3 Subject to Clause 11.1, in the event of delay by the

     Company in handing over the possession of the said Plot

     beyond a period of 12 months from the end of the Grace

     Period (such 12 months period hereinafter referred to as the

     "Extended Delay Period"), then the Allottee shall become

     entitled to opt for termination of the Allotment/Agreement and

     refund of the actual paid up installment(s) made against the

     said Plot after adjusting the interest / penalty on delayed

     payments along with Delay Compensation for 12 months. Such

     refund shall be made by the Company within 90 days of receipt

     of intimation to this effect from the Allottee, without any interest
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                  10</span>


     thereon. For removal of doubt, it is clarified that Delay

     Compensation payable to the Allottee who is validly opting for

     termination, shall be limited to and calculated for the fixed

     period of 12 months only irrespective of the date on which the

     Allottee actually exercised the option for termination. This

     option of termination may be exercised by the Allottee only up

     till dispatch of the Notice of Possession by the Company to the

     Allottee whereupon the said option shall be deemed to have

     irrevocably lapsed. No other claim, whatsoever, monetary or

     otherwise shall lie against the Company nor be raised

     otherwise or in any other manner by the Allottee."

The OP was to complete the development within 24 months with

further grace period of six months at the most within 2½ years period

from the date of execution of agreement dated 27.06.2011. The

complainant paid the amounts to OPs and this fact is reflected on the

record vide Ex.C-3 to C-12 and the statement of account coupled

with it. Ex.C-13 is copy of notice of possession dated 04.05.2015

sent by OPs to complainant. The plan was changed vide Ex.C-14 on

26.09.2011 from time linked payment plan to Development linked

payment plan in this case. The complainant paid cheques to OPs

vide Ex.C-15 and C-16 for Rs.2,87,964/- and Rs.2909/-. The

grievance of the complainant is that OP have not completed the

project and there is no completion certificate with OPs as well,

despite the receipt of most of the substantial amounts of sale

consideration. The complainant relied upon Ex.C-18 addressed to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                   11</span>


Executive Engineer PSPCL under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_6">RTI Act</a> for obtaining information.

Ex.C-23 is copy of letter bearing memo no.2614/CTP dated

13.05.2013 issued by Chief Town Planner Punjab to M/s Puma

Realtors for approval of revised layout plan. Affidavit of complainant

is Ex.C-A on the record to this effect. The OPs also led evidence by

tendering affidavit of Sumit Kumar Authorized person of OPs

Ex.OP-A on the record. He proved the copy of resolution Ex.OP-1 to

pursue the case. He relied upon notice of possession dated

04.05.2015. He stated that OP tendered the possession to

complainant on 04.05.2015, but he has not received the possession

allotted property. This witness further stated that complainant wrote

letter dated 27.10.2015 expressing his willingness for execution of

conveyance deed of the plot in question in his favour. This witness

further stated that amenities have been provided in the project by

OPs. He testified that complainant has not received the possession

despite provision of amenities by OPs therein.

</p><p id="p_18">7.         From careful appraisal of entire evidence on the record,

we have come to this conclusion that plot no.80 was allotted to the

complainant in the above project by OPs. The complainant had paid

the total amount of Rs.63,58,746/- out of total sale consideration of

Rs.66,71,984/- to them. The OPs mainly relied upon notice of

possession dated 04.05.2015 to the effect that they have provided

amenities in the project, but complainant has not received the

possession of the allotted plot. The complainant testified in his

not developed and found the below noted deficiencies therein:

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     6.    It seems that the company is in the hurry to offer the

</blockquote><p id="p_19">OPs relied upon the sale deeds, which have been executed by the

OPs in favour of some other allottees, but this fact ipso facto has not

proved this fact that development work has been carried out thereat

and the above allottees might have waived the objection of lack of

development on the spot and proceeded to seek execution of the

conveyance deed in their favour. From perusal of documents and

evidence on the record, we find that there is no boundary wall except

the adjoining of the entrance gate. The submission of counsel for

OPs is that the project has been exempted under Section 44 of

PAPRA Act, 1995 by the Punjab Government, but the development

work was to be carried out in accordance with layout plan sanctioned

by the Chief Town Planner Punjab and the guidelines issued by the

Department of Housing and Urban Development and the promoter

shall be responsible for obtaining the final NOC from the Punjab

Pollution Control Board. No doubt that the Project of OPs was

exempted    from   certain   conditions   including   the   completion

certificate, but later on there is letter No.4966-CTP(Pb)/SP-458

dated 02.09.2014 issued by Govt. of Punjab, Department of Housing

and Urban Development (Housing II Branch) under which it has

been stated that Mega Housing Project has been approved under

PAPRA, 1995, however, the present frame work does not provide

the clear procedure to issue completion or partial completion

certificate to such projects, which causes hardships to promoters

and residents of such projects for the maintenance and upkeep of

public utilities and services. Despite exemption of the project, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                  14</span>


developer cannot deliver the possession without completing the

basic amenities. The OPs were not competent to issue offer of

possession without completion or partial completion certificate. Here

no such completion certificate or partial completion certificate has

been placed on record by OPs to prove the entire development in

the project. The possession was to be delivered within a period of 24

months with further grace period of six months from the date of

execution of agreement dated 27.06.2011, which came to an end on

December 2013. As per clause 11.3 of agreement, if possession is

delayed by the company beyond 12 months from the end of grace

period, then allottee shall become entitled to seek termination of

allotment and seek refund of the actual paid up installments after

adjusting the interest/penalty on delayed payment. The possession

was to be given to complainant by OPs in December 2013 but the

development work was not completed by and as such possession

letter issued by OPs in 2015 is inconsequential. Clause 11.3 of the

buyers agreement entitles the complainant to seek refund beyond 12

months from the end of the grace period in case of non development

of project and non delivery of possession. The permanent electricity

connection was not granted to the project of OPs vide Ex.OP-24.

Vide Ex.OP-26 Punjab Pollution Control Board Zonal Office-I, Patiala

dated 05.01.2016 granted the consent to operate an outlet under

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_7">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_8">26</a> of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control of Pollution Act</a>,

1974 for discharge of effluent. The partial completion certificate

Ex.OP-29 is dated 20.06.2017, whereas scheduled date of delivery
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                    15</span>


of possession was December 2013 in this case, and OPs obtained

the partial completion certificate after lapse of 3½ years from the

scheduled date of delivery of possession. Even the partial

completion certificate has not fully established that project has been

clearly completed by OPs. Report of Local Commissioner is

Ex.OP-33 on the record pointing out certain discrepancies left by

OPs.
</p>
<p id="p_20">8.          We have come to this conclusion that offer of possession

by OP in 2015 without completion certificate, which has been

obtained subsequently in the year 2017, is paper possession only.

Even in partial completion certificate certain conditions have been

incorporated to get NOC from Govt. of India, Ministry of Finance of

Environment and Forest and so on. The report of Local

Commissioner on the record has established that main gate of the

project is situated in front of Sector 97 and in front of the main gate,

there is no metalled road. The sewerage pipe lines have been laid

and connected to Sewerage Treatment Plant, but have not been

connected with the main service lines of the GMADA. Storm water

pipelines inside the project have been laid and connected with rain

water harvesting wells, but have not been connected with the main

service lines of GMADA. There is no boundary wall to the project,

therefore, even on the basis of report of the Local Commission, the

amenities in the project are not complete.
</p>
<p id="p_21">9.          The submission of counsel for OPs is that even if there is

some delay in delivery of possession, the complainant is entitled

penalty of Rs.50/- per square yard, under clause 11 of the

agreement. It has been held by the Hon'ble National Commission in

"Ankur Goswami versus Supertech and another" 2017(3) CLT

520 (NC) that this clause in the allotment letter would be applied to

the case where allottee is seeking possession of the flat and where

allottee is not seeking refund of the amount. However, in the present

case, the allottee is seeking the refund of the deposited amount,

therefore, the penalty @ Rs. 50/- per sq. yards will not be applicable,

where allottee seeks refund of the amount.
</p>
<p id="p_22">10.         As per clause 11.3 of agreement Ex.C-2 executed

between the parties, in case possession is not delivered by the

promoter to the allottee, beyond a period of 12 months from the end

of grace period, then allottee shall become entitled to seek the

termination of allotment and further seek refund of the deposited

amounts with interest on delayed payment. The complainant is

entitled to seek refund of the deposited amount, because OPs failed

to deliver the possession to complainant even beyond a period of 12

months after the end of the grace period i.e. 27.12.2013 and the right

of the complainant accrues to seek refund of the deposited amount

by seeking cancellation of the allotment, as per this contractual

relationship as well.

<p id="p_23">11.         As a result of our above discussion, we accept the

complaint of the complainant with following directions to OPs:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16"> Consumer Complaint No.303 of 2017                                     17</span>
