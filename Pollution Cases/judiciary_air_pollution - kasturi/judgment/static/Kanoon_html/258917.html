    matter has been pending in Court for a long time and when the matter was
    



    taken up by this Bench on 30th  January, 2008 we had directed the Chief

    Secretary Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.5 Corporation to file their





    respective  affidavits  for   the  reasons  given  in the  order  itself.   There  are

    many reliefs claimed by the petitioners. We have heard petitioner No.2 in

    person and the learned Counsel appearing for the respondents. Some of





    the reliefs claimed are the reliefs which could not be granted because they

    relate   to   geographical   areas   which   are   outside   the   jurisdiction  of   this

    Court. Therefore, the petitioner made a submission that he will confine

    this petition to the reliefs claimed for the areas which fall within the State

<p id="p_2">    2.     The first relief claimed is that this court should ban the practice of

    immersion   of   any   idols   of   gods,   goddesses,   tajia   or   otherwise   under

    religious   rituals   or   under   any   other   pretext   in   natural   streams.   The

    petitioner has taken us to various religious scriptures to canvass that the

    immersion of idols in river cannot be justified on any count. According to




                                                              
    the petitioner in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region alone about 1,50,000

    Ganesh idols are immersed in rivers, wells, lakes and sea every year during




                                                             
    10 days Ganpati festival in the month of September. Out of these 1,50,000

    Ganesh idols about 1,00,000 come to the share of the Mumbai beaches.

<p id="p_3">    These idols measure from 2 ft. to 20 ft. in height which are made of plaster

    of paris mixed with several ingredients and paints  which are poisonous
                               
    and fatal to marine life.   Then he has contended in his petition that all
                              
    religions   preach   love,   compassion   and   non-violence,   particularly   Hindu

    and Jain religions. The ban on cow slaughter is the state policy and due to
       


    intense agitation and fasting by some Jain munis against new slaughter
    



    houses   the   Union   Government   had   to   shelve   the   project.   He   also

    contended   that   Ganpati   Bappa,   so   merciful   and   kind   will   hate   a   pooja





    destroying marine life.

<p id="p_4">    3.     So   many   reliefs   have   been   claimed   as   is   pointed   out   above.   The

    petitioner   appears   to   be   mainly   concerned   with   the   immersion   of   the





    Ganesh idols during Ganpati festival days. Then he has taken quotations

    from Mahabharat and Ramayan and according to the shloka no. 95:17-18

    excerpted from Ramayan in Sanskrit and as per the translation in English

    given by the petitioner it appears to be a conversation between Lord Ram

    various   other   religious   authorities   to   suggest   that   the   pollution   of
                               
    atmosphere   and  water   bodies  was   against   every   religion,   particularly
                              
    Hinduism.  He  also   quoted  the  scripture,  which  says:   "On  arrival  at   the

    sacred  waters   of   the  Ganga,  thirteen  practices   are  forbidden.  They  are:

<p id="p_5">    defecation, washing of person, hands or sacred vessels, ablution, discharge

    offering   inappropriate   hymns/praises,   discarding   garments,   beating   and

    swimming across".
</p>
<p id="p_6">    4.     The counter affidavit filed by the Chief Secretary says, nobody can





    justify the pollution of atmosphere or of water bodies.  This court will not

    be   in   a   position   to   decide   about   what   a   religion   permits   and   what   a

    religion does not permit. But the public sentiments and the public interest

    submitted in his  affidavit  that the pollution caused by the immersion of




                                                
    idols is not disputed. He has further stated that the Central Government is

    seized  of   the  matter   and   is  taking  further  steps   to  evolve guidelines at
                               
    National level for the immersion of idols and other pooja materials during

    his   affidavit   has   answered   point   by   point   the   assertions   made   in   the
       


    petition and has also stated in his affidavit that after the court passed an
    



    order on 30th  January, 2008 directing him to file an affidavit   a meeting

    was held with concerned departments to put up a report to him. On the





    basis of the said reports the affidavit was filed by the Chief Secretary. With

    regard to the ill effects of water and noise pollution, the Chief Secretary

    has maintained that creating public awareness would be as important as





    implementation   of   laws.   But  unfortunately  the   Chief   Secretary   has   not

    given any details about its programme of creating public awareness about

    the pollution of water bodies and the environment in general. It is merely

    stated   that   for   creating   public   awareness   print   and   electronic   media   is

    the  petitioners   claimed   that   there   should   not   be   mass   or   community
