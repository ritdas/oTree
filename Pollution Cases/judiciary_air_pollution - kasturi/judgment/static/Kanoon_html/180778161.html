DR. A.S. ANAND &amp; B.N. KIRPAL &amp; V.N. KHARE

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">JUDGMENT

1998 (1) SCR 398

The following Order of the Court was delivered :
</p>
<p id="p_2">An additional affidavit of Undertaking has been filed in Court today by Mr.
P Natarajan on behalf of the Industry, respondent No. 6,

We have heard learned counsel for respondent No, 6, the learned Amicas
Curiae as also the learned counsel apperaing for Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_3">From a perusal of the affidavit filed by the Member Secretary, Tamil Nadu
Pollution Control Board on 12-1-1998, it transpires that certain directions
were issued by the Borad in exercise of the powers conferred under Section
33 A of the water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, as
amended in 1988 to respondent No. 6. These directions were inter alia aimed
at ensuring proper storage of effluent in lagoons and for ensuring proper
storage of effluent in lagoons and for proper treatment and disposal of the
treated effluent. As many as 11 directions, as detailed in the affidavit,
were given. Para 5 of the said affidavit discloses that the Industry
(respondent No. 6) has not complied with direction Nos. 6. 7, 8 and 9, It
is also stated that during the inspection of the Industry on 23rd of
November, 1997, it was noticed that the seepage of effluent from lagoon 'C'
joined the drain and ultimately reached river Bhavani thereby contravening
the conditions imposed in the directions by the Board. The affidavit goes
on to say that show cause notice was also issued by the Board to the
Industry calling upon it to state why penal action for offences punishable
under <a href="/doc/151283829/" id="a_2">Section 44</a> read with <a href="/doc/149719937/" id="a_3">Section 45</a> (a) of the Act should not be
initiated for violating the conditions imposed by the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Respondent No. 6 in its affidavit filed on 27 th of January, 1998 has not
denied that 11 directions had, been issued to it by the Board and that some
of those directions have not been complied with. It is stated in para (d)
as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_5">"In respect of the direction of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board at
Para (viii) that the Company shall give progress report on disposal of
accumulated effluent in lagoons every fortnight and also fortnightly
progress report on the actions taken to comply with the conditions
stipulated in the Consent Order issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
Board, it is submitted that the Company has furnished daily statements
giving complete particulars of the effluent generated, effluent utilised
for compositing and for concentration, inflow into lagoons, outflow from
the lagoons and other detailed particulars. The receipt of these daily
statements by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board is acknowledge in
their Affidavit filed before this Honourable Court. Apart from the daily
statements, the Company has also furnished consolidated and fortnightly
reports to the Joint Chief Environmental Engineer of the Tamil Nadu
Pollution: Control Board."
</p>
<p id="p_6">In the affidavit of Undertaking filed on behalf of respondent No. 6 today
it is stated that since 16th of January, 1998. the production capacity of
the Industry has been reduced and ferti-irrigation has been completely
stopped. It is also stated that the entire effluent is being untilised
within the premises for bio-compositing and that there is no discharge of
water of effluent on land or water

With -regard to the two unlined lagoons, it is stated if para 7 (a) of the
affidavit of undertaking filed today that effluent has been stored in the
two unlined lagoon and it is reiterated that no further discharge of
effluent is being made into the unlined lagoons,

As already noticed, according to the Board, the seepage from the unlined
lagoons in which effluent had been stored joins the drain and ultimately
reaches river Bhivani thereby polluting the river water. This is a serious
matter and shows that pollution is continuing because of actions of
respondent No. 6 and remedial steps have not been taken to prevent
pollution and contamination of the river water. Respondent No. 6, had
obviously failed to arrest the unabated pollution, which has become a
health hazard and environmental enemy. Enough time has been given to the
Industry (respondent No, 6) to take the remedial steps: It has failed to do
so. We arc, therefore, left with no other option but to direct the closure
of the operation of the Industry (respondent No, 6) on or before 2nd
February, 1998 and we direct accordingly, The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
Borad still submit a report regarding compliance of this direction to the
Industry within ten days;
</p>
<p id="p_7">We clarify that the direction herein above given by us to close the
Industry (respondent No. 6) will not come in the way of the Industry: to
empty the two unlined lagoons, otherwise than through ferti -irrigation or
discharge on land or in river, or to do compos it work.
</p>
<p id="p_8">From the affidavit of Undertaking of respondent No. 6 filed today, we also
find on admission that there are eleven small inter-mediary transit tanks
used for transferring the effluent from the concentration plant to the
lagoons, which are also unlined at the bottom. Respondent No. 6 shall not
be put to use those transit tanks unless the lining is complete in all
respects,

After the effluent from the two unlined lagoons have been removed and those
lagoons lined and the eleven small inter-mediary transit tanks are also
lined it shall be open to the Industry (respondent No. 6) to approach the
Court for appropriate orders regarding restarting the operations of the
Industry,

In the mean time we also consider it appropriate to direct inspection of
the Industry and the site adjoining it: We request NEERI to conduct an
inspection of the Industry and to submit a report to this Court disclosing
whether the pollution control devices have been fixed by the Industry and
proper steps taken to control pollution in accordance with the provisions
of the Act or not, NEERI shall also inspect the surrounding area with a
view to assess damage, if any caused due to discharge of effluent by the
Industry and to indicate the cost of restitution. NEERI shall submit its
report to this Court within six weeks. The directions with regard to
payment Of NEERI shall be made on receipt of the bill from NEERI. The
directions be conveyed to NEERI together with the necessary details
forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_9">List the special leave petition after seven weeks.
