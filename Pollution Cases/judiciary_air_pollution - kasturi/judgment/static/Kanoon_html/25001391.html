ORAL
ORDER</pre>
 


<p id="p_1">  (PER
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)
 

 


 


 


 


</p><p id="p_2">1.	Revenue is in appeal
against the judgment of the Tribunal dated 4.9.2009 raising following
questions for our consideration:-
</p> 


<p id="p_3">"[A]	Whether the
Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts in confirming the
order passed by CIT(A) in deleting the disallowance of Rs.15,31,581/-
made on account of Revenue Expenses for Repairs to building?
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_4">[B]	Whether the Appellate
Tribunal is right in law and on facts in confirming the order passed
by CIT(A) in restricting the disallowance (@50%) of Rs.91,722/- made
on account of Earth Quake Relief Fund Expenses?"
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_5">2.	First question pertains
to expenditure of Rs.15,31,581/-  directed by the Assessing Officer
to be treated as capital expenditure. The assessee carried the issue
in appeal. The CIT(Appeals) allowed the appeal of the assessee only
in part and restricted the addition of Rs.13,48,336/-. The issue went
further in appeal before the Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the claim
of the assessee in its entirety. Thereupon the Revenue has approached
this Court in the present Tax Appeal.  
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_6">3.	From the impugned
judgment we find that the assessee had to incur certain expenditure
towards repair of its building including replacing of the floor
tiles, re-plastering of the building and compound wall, replacing
broken doors, windows and glass, replacing electric wiring, assuring
to conform to the standards specified in various statues such as
<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_1">Factories Act</a> and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution Control Act</a> as well as to meet with the
requirements imposed by the foreign buyers. The Tribunal, therefore,
was of the opinion that the expenditure incurred by the assessee for
renovation should be treated as revenue. The Tribunal, therefore,
deleted the additions made by the Assessing Officer as sustained by
the CIT(Appeals).
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_7">4.	Though we agree with the
learned counsel that the Tribunal did not examine the question
whether the expenditure incurred by the assessee resulted into
enduring benefits, in the instant case, when the Tribunal found that
the assessee had compulsorily to incur such expenditure to conform to
the statutory requirements contained in <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_3">Factories Act</a>, <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Pollution
Control Act</a> etc., we do not find any reason to interfere with the
view of the Tribunal. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_8">5.	With respect to second
question we find that the assessee had claimed deduction of
Rs.91,722/- expended towards Earth Quake Relief Fund. The assessee
could not furnish full proof and details of such expenses. Thereupon,
the CIT(Appeals) reduced the relief to 50% of the claim made. The
Tribunal confirmed the view of the CIT(Appeals). Entire issue is
based on facts. It does not give rise to any question of law. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_9">6.	In the result, Tax Appeal
is dismissed. 
</p>
