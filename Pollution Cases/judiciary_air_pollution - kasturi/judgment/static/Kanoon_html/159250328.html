JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

     Petitioner No. 1, 'Kalpavriskha' claims to be a reputed

environmental non profit organisation working since 1979.

Amongst other subjects, the key focus area of this petitioner is

stated to be research and advocacy on environmental governance

aspects of developmental infrastructure projects and activities in

the country. In legal and policy action this petitioner has given

inputs on content and implementation of laws, impacting

conservation and livelihoods under different laws. This petitioner

participated in the preparation of Draft of National Biodiversity

Strategy and Action Plan. Various investigation and research

projects have been undertaken by this Petitioner. The petitioner

claims to have raised various issues in the field of environment

and is also raising issues of public interest in the application in

hand. Similarly, petitioner No. 2, 'Goa Foundation' was founded in

the year 1986 by a group of Goan environmentalists, each fighting

his or her own individual environmental battles. The work of this



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                  2</span>
 petitioner spans in different areas and fields, all related in some

way or another with the conservation of the Goan environment.

Petitioner No. 3, Mr. Manoj Mishra claims that he is a former

member of Indian Forest Services and retired as the Chief

Conservator of Forest, State of Chhattisgarh. He has been

involved   in   many      civil   society    initiatives      relating    to     the

conservation of environment. The said petitioner is the Convenor

of the 'Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan', an awareness and advocacy

campaign for the revival of River Yamuna.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.   According to the petitioners, Ministry of Environment and

Forest (for short 'MoEF') is the nodal agency of the Central

Government      with     the    primary     objective    of    protecting        the

environment and all its constituents, to conserve the natural

resources of the country and to undertake measures for

prevention and control of pollution. To meet these objectives, the

MoEF has made it mandatory for certain specified categories of

projects   to   obtain     an     Environmental         Clearance        prior    to

commencing any project work. The decision whether or not to

grant Environmental Clearance to a project depends mostly on the

impact of the project on the environment as well as the potential

implications of the project on the people. The decision making

process surrounding the Environmental Clearance process is

complex, as it requires the consideration of several factors which

are spread across various disciplines and are not restricted only

to environmental considerations. The social impacts of projects


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                   3</span>
 are equally crucial as projects often cause displacement of

thousands    of   persons   along-with   destruction    of   important

cultural, historical and religious sites and symbols. The MoEF for

taking decision in this regard relies upon the contribution of

various experts in the field of environment. The MoEF appoints

Expert Appraisal Committees (for short 'EAC') to assist it in this

decision making process. Members of the EACs represent various

areas of expertise and are expected to contribute towards a

holistic decision making process. The MoEF while exercising its

powers under <a href="/doc/105902756/" id="a_1">Section 3(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/83271499/" id="a_2">3(2)(v)</a> of the Environment

(Protection) Act, 1986 (for short 'Act of 1986') and Rule 5(3)(a) of

the Environment (Protection) Rules,1986 (for short 'Rules of

1986') has issued several Notifications with regard to prohibition

and restrictions on the locations of industries and the carrying on

of processes and operations in different areas. In exercise of these

powers various notifications have been issued inter alia specifying

the projects which require Environmental Clearance under

different categories and the procedure for obtaining such

clearance.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.   In exercise of the above powers, the Central Government

framed    Environment       Clearance    Regulations,    2006     vide

Notification No. S.O. 1533(E) dated 14th September, 2006. This is

also known as EIA Notification, 2006 (for short 'the Notification of

2006'). The Notification of 2006, in Paragraph 7 stipulates four

stages in the process of obtaining Environmental Clearance. Stage



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                     4</span>
 (1) is screening. At this stage the EAC or the State Expert

Appraisal Committee (for short 'SEAC') takes the decision whether

Environmental Impact Assessment (for short 'EIA') Report has to

be prepared for the proposed projects. Stage (2) is Scoping. At this

stage, the EAC for category 'A' projects and the SEAC for category

'B' projects determines detailed and comprehensive Terms of

Reference (for short 'TOR') addressing all relevant environmental

concerns for the preparation of an EIA Report in respect of the

proposed project or activity for which the prior environmental

clearance is sought. Then the detailed environment impact study

is carried out at proposed site by a team of experts from all the

relevant fields, addressing all the Terms of Reference and

thereafter a report, predicting all positive and negative impacts

and their magnitude is prepared. This is followed by preparation

of Environment Management Plan (for short 'EMP') which details

out various measures to be taken to minimise the impact to an

acceptable level. Such report along with EMP is submitted to the

MoEF. Stage (3) relates to Public Consultation and has two

components - 1) a public hearing, which is conducted by the

concerned State Pollution Control Board at the project site or in

its close proximity, explaining all the possible environment

impacts and measures proposed in EMP. This is done for

ascertaining the concerns of the locally affected persons. The

procedure prescribed for public hearing is described in Appendix

IV to the Notification and 2) obtaining written responses from



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                   5</span>
 other concerned persons who have a plausible stake in the

environmental aspects of the project or activity. Lastly, Stage (4)

relates to Appraisal of the Project. Under para 7(i) of the

Notification of 2006, 'appraisal' has been defined as the detailed

scrutiny by the EAC or the SEAC of the application and other

documents like the Final EIA Report and the outcome of the

public   consultations   including   public   hearing   proceedings,

submitted by the Project Proponent to the regulatory authority

concerned for grant of environmental clearance. In terms of the

Notification of 2006 read in conjunction with its Appendices, the

Project Proponent is expected to file documents and additional

information, including possible alternative sites for the project,

studies on the cumulative impact of the project due to proximity

of other projects and the impact of the project on the local

communities, disturbance to sacred sites etc. The EAC or the

SEAC concerned has to make categorical recommendations to the

regulatory   authority   concerned   either   for   grant   of   prior

environmental clearance on stipulated terms and conditions, or

rejection of the application for prior Environmental Clearance,

together with reasons for the same. The Regulatory Authority will

be the MoEF or State Environment Impact Assessment Authority

(for short 'SEIAA') depending upon the category in which such

project falls. Appraisal of the project is one of the most important

steps to be taken in the entire process of grant or refusal of the

Environmental Clearance to a proposed project or activity.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                     6</span>
 Appendix V to the Notification 2006 provides the procedure for

Appraisal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.   Appendix    VI   to   the   Notification   of   2006   details   the

composition of the sector/ project specific EAC for Category 'A'

projects and the SEACs for Category B Projects. These committees

are to be constituted by the Central Government in consonance

with the qualification and experience stated under this very

Appendix. It is clear from the cumulative reading of the

Notification of 2006 along-with its Schedule and Appendices that

the recommendation made by the EAC or SEAC as the case may

be are critical in the whole Environmental Clearance process

thereby making it imperative that those who are Members of the

EAC are well qualified and experienced persons so as to further

the cause of environment and ensure appropriate consideration of

the applications for grant or refusal of Environmental Clearance of

projects. It is the case of the applicant that the MoEF had issued

various Notifications and in all of them, the Government had

stated that it would evaluate and assess an application for

Environmental Clearance in consultation with a Committee of

experts. The composition of the Committee of experts, as per the

Notification of 2006, includes persons from various disciplines

including eco-system management, air/water pollution control,

water   resource      management,      ecologists,    social   sciences

particularly rehabilitation of project oustees and representatives

from other relevant fields.

</p><p id="p_9"> 5.    While Paragraph 3 of Notification of 2006 deals with

Constitution of the SEIAA, Paragraph 5 of the same deals with the

Constitution of EAC and SEAC. Appendix VI to the Notification of

2006 provides the eligibility criteria for the Chairperson and

Members of EAC or SEAC. It is further averred by the applicant

that in the EIA Notification of 1992, a different criteria, relevant

for   the   purpose     of   considering     Environmental     Clearance

application was stated by MoEF. This criteria came to be varied in

the EIA Notification of 1994 to some extent, but in the EIA

Notification of 2006, dated 14th September, 2006, the criteria was

considerably varied. According to the applicant, this defeats the

very purpose, object and attainment of environmental protection

under the provisions of the Act and Rules framed thereunder. We

may refer to all the three relevant provisions of the three

Notifications to enable us to deal with the contentions raised by

the applicant.</p><pre id="pre_2">

THE WRIT PETITION]



</pre><p id="p_10">6.    MoEF had issued the first Notification on 29th June,

1992 while the second was issued on 4th May, 1994 and the

third on 17th September, 2006. Variation of eligibility criteria

in these three Notifications according to the petitioners is not

only disadvantageous to the interest of the environment but

is also in contradiction to the qualifications provided in

Appendix VI to the Notification of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.    According to the applicant, the MoEF has failed to

appreciate the significance of the appraisal process as part of

the     Environmental   Clearance     procedure    under    the

Notification of 2006 and has been appointing persons as

Chairperson and members of the EAC who do not have the

requisite expertise on the necessary issues of environmental

significance. Given the complex nature of environment issue,

it is essential that the EAC should have been composed of

people who are well versed with social and environmental

context of development related decision making. Since the

Notification of 2006 recognizes the need to obtain expert

opinion on the environmental impact of a proposed project,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                              10</span>
 before an Environment Clearance is granted to the project,

hence it requires the impact assessment agency to consult

with a Committee of Experts. The composition of the

Committee as laid down in both the Notifications of 1992 and

1994, reflected the inter-disciplinary approach required to

analyse the impact of a project. Under the Notification of

1992, the Chairperson/members had to be outstanding and

experienced ecologists or environmentalists or technical

professionals in the relevant development sector having

demonstrated interest in environment conservation and

sustainable development. The Notification of 1994 removed

the requirement for demonstrating interest in environment

conservation and sustainable development.          Chairperson

could be an outstanding and experienced ecologist or

environmentalist   or   technical   professional   with   wide

managerial experience in the relevant development sector.

The technical professional or any person with managerial

experience in the relevant development sector was no longer

required   to   have    any   relation   with   environmental

conservation or sustainable development. The Notification of

2006 modified the requirements even further with regard to

the Chairperson.    The Chairperson now has to be an

outstanding expert with experience in environmental policy,

management or public administration with wide experience in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                            11</span>
 the relevant development sector. The words 'environmentalist'

and 'ecologist' were entirely left out in this Notification and

the emphasis has shifted from environment to management

and public administration


</p><p id="p_13">8.   According to the applicant, the result of this deletion and

change in qualification of the Chairperson of EAC has led to

conflict of interest.   This conflict of interest has attained

serious dimensions in the working of the EAC, as persons

from either public administration or managerial posts are

being appointed as Chairperson of EAC. This is prejudicial to

the whole purpose of Environmental Clearance. With this

background, the grievance of the applicant further extends to

certain appointments of the Chairperson and members of the

EAC. The applicant states that he moved an application

under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a>, 2005 on 27th September

2010 for seeking information with regard to the qualification

and appointments of the Chairperson and members of the

EAC. The replies to the said application and the file noting

furnished therewith shows that persons who were not

qualified to hold the position of the Chairperson and

Members of the EAC were being appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">9.   According to the applicant on 14th June 2010, MoEF

reconstituted three EAC on River Valley and Hydro Electric


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                              12</span>
 Projects;   Thermal     and    Coal    Mining    Projects    and

Infrastructure Building Construction Projects.         One Mr.

Rakesh Nath was appointed as Chairperson of EAC on River

Valley and Hydro Electric Projects and another Mr. V. P Raja

for Thermal and Coal Mining Project. Representations were

filed on 19th June, 2010 by various groups against the above

two appointments but no response was received from MoEF.


</p><p id="p_16">10. It is the case of the applicant that these persons were

not best suited for the job and they do not have any special

qualification and experience vested in these persons to justify

their appointment as Chairpersons. Conflict of interest is

clear from the fact that Mr. V. P Raja who has been appointed

for the Thermal Project and Coal Mining Project is also the

Chairperson     for   Maharashtra      Electricity   Regulatory

Commission and his previous experience does not evidence

any exposure to ecological or social issues relating to thermal

power projects and coal mining, etc.


     Conflict of interest also arises from the bias that such

members may have, as a result of their interests in private or

other sectors. Bias has to be inferred on a reasonable ground. In

other words, whether there is substantial possibility of bias

animating the mind of the member against the aggrieved party, is

to be examined with reference to the facts of the case, position



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                               13</span>
 and participation of the member in the process in question (<a href="/doc/198890/" id="a_4">Dr. G.

Sarana v. University of Lucknow and others</a>, (1976) 3 SCC 585).

The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1619801/" id="a_5">J. Mohapatra and Co. and

another v. State of Orissa and another</a>, (1984) 4 SCC 103, held

that the possibility of bias cannot be excluded where the members

of the committee set up for selecting books for educational

institutions are themselves authors of the books which come up

for selection.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">11. The applicant has placed great emphasis on the growing

conflict of interest in the appointment of members of EAC.

Highlighting the disadvantages of appointing persons from private

sector/industry or public administration to EAC, it has also been

averred that two persons namely Mr. P. Abraham and Mr. M.L.

Majumdar had to resign from the Chairpersonship of the

concerned EACs because they were on the Board of Power or

Mining companies; for the reason of conflict of interest. On the

above premises, the contention of the applicant before us is that

in order to protect the environmental interests, in order to avoid

conflict of interest in examination of such application and to apply

the settled principles of fairness, precautionary principle and

substantial and effective compliance to the provisions of the

Notification of 2006, it is necessary that Appendix VI to the

Notification of 2006, should be struck down as being contrary to

the Notification of 2006       and the provisions of the Act.

Furthermore, the eligibility criteria stated under the Notification of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                    14</span>
 1994 should be read and applied by MoEF for appointing

Chairperson and Members of the EAC or SEAC.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">12. The respondent, particularly, the MoEF has raised a

preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition

(application) as well as on merits of the case. On behalf of the

MoEF, it has been contended that Appendix VI to the Notification

of 2006, which prescribes qualifications for members and the

Chairperson of the EAC/SEAC is a subordinate legislation and no

jurisdiction has been vested in this Tribunal to entertain and

adjudicate upon vires of statutory provisions and subordinate

legislations within the ambit of Section 14 of the NGT Act.

Therefore, the application before the Tribunal is misconceived. It

is also contended that the validity of a regulation made under the

delegated legislation can be decided only in judicial review

proceedings before the court and not by way of appeal before the

Tribunal. Reliance in this regard is placed upon the judgement of

the Supreme Court in the case of PTC India Ltd. v. CERC, 2010 (4)

SCC 603.
</p>
<p id="p_21">13. The respondents have also raised a contention that the

Notification of 2006 has been issued on 14th September, 2006 that

is much prior to the coming into force of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_6">National Green

Tribunal Act</a> (for short 'the NGT Act') which came into force on

18th October, 2010. Hence, the provisions of Section 16 of the

NGT Act does not get attracted and the present application is

untenable.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                15</span>
</p><p id="p_23"> 14. On merits, it is the case of the respondents that the

notification in question was issued after due procedure and

challenge to the same after almost seven years is highly belated,

misconceived and frivolous. Further, challenging the jurisdiction

of the Tribunal in terms of Section 14 of NGT Act, the contention

is that there is no substantial question of environment and as

such the present application would not be maintainable, even if

the above objections are not accepted by the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_24">15. In view of the above stated facts and the contentions raised,

the following questions arise for consideration of the Tribunal:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    (1)   Whether the Tribunal has power of judicial review

    wherein it can examine the validity and legality of notification

    issued by the authorities in exercise of the power of

    subordinate/delegated legislation?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">    (2)   Whether the Notification issued under Environment

    Clearance Regulations, 2006 (for short 'Notification of 2006')

    in relation to prescribing the eligibility criteria for the

    Chairperson and members of the EAC/SEAC Committee

    would fall within the scope of Section 14 of the NGT Act?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">    (3)   Will it be a substantial question relating to environment

    (including   enforcement   of   any   legal   right   relating   to

    environment) and such question would arise out of the

    implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I of

    the NGT Act?
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                     16</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (4)     Whether the applicant cannot invoke the provisions of

    <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_7">Sections 16</a> and/or 14 of the NGT Act and thus this

    application is not maintainable on the ground that the

    Notification of 2006 was issued on 14th September, 2006

    much prior to 18th October, 2010, the date on which NGT Act

    came into force? It is only the order passed on/or after the

    commencement of NGT Act that can be assailed before the

    Tribunal?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">    (5)     What directions, if any, can be issued in the present
    case?
</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">Discussion on issue no. 1: "Whether the Tribunal has power of
judicial review wherein it can examine the validity, and
legality of notification issued by the authorities in exercise of
the power of subordinate/delegated legislation."

</p><p id="p_26">16. As far as this issue is concerned, it need not detain us any

further in view of the judgment of the Tribunal pronounced today

in the case of Wilfred J. and Anr. v. MoEF and Ors., Application

No. 74 of 2014 and Appeal No. 14 of 2014. The learned counsel

appearing for the MoEF had fairly stated that this Tribunal being

a judicial tribunal with the trapping of a court and keeping in view

the complex cases that come up for hearing before the Tribunal, it

will be appropriate for the Tribunal to exercise limited power of

judicial review, of course, as supplementary to the higher courts

and not supplanting them. According to her, still the question of

maintainability as discussed above would arise for consideration

of the Tribunal. This statement is in consonance with the law as

noticed in the case of Wilfred J. and Anr (supra).


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                  17</span>
</p><p id="p_27">      In that judgement after considering the law at great length,

the Tribunal took the view that this Tribunal is a judicial Tribunal

having   the   trappings    of   a   Court,   with   complete   judicial

independence, being manned by the judicial and expert minds in

accordance with the procedure prescribed and keeping in view the

legislative scheme of the NGT Act and Rules framed thereunder.

For proper administration of environmental justice, the Tribunal

has to examine the correctness or otherwise of Rules and

Notification made in exercise of delegated legislation.             The

Tribunal is vested with the power of judicial review to a limited

extent which it would exercise only as supplementing and not

supplanting to the jurisdiction of the higher courts in accordance

with law. In exercise of the power of judicial review, the Tribunal

can examine the validity, vires, legality and reasonableness of the

rules, provisions or notifications, made or issued in exercise of the

powers vested in the concerned Government or authority by way

of subordinate or delegated legislation, but only in relation to the

Acts enumerated in Schedule I to the NGT Act. This power of

judicial review would not extend to examination of provisions of

the NGT Act or the rules framed thereunder; NGT being the

creation of that statute.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">17. For the reasons stated above and the fact that the matter is

squarely covered by the judgment of the Tribunal in the case of

Wilfred J. &amp; Anr. (supra), we answer the question in the

affirmative and as detailed above.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                      18</span>
 Discussion on issue no. 2: "Whether the Notification issued
under Environment Clearance Regulations, 2006 (for short
'Regulations of 2006') in relation to prescribing the eligibility
criteria for the Chairperson and members of the EAC/SEAC
Committee would fall within the scope of Section 14 of the
NGT Act."
</p><p id="p_31">                              and

Issue No. 3: "Will it be a substantial question relating to
environment (including enforcement of any legal right
relating to environment) and such question would arise out of
the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I
of the National Green Tribunal Act."
</p>
<p id="p_32">18. As there is inter-relation between issue no. 2 &amp; 3 and

common arguments have been addressed by the learned counsel

appearing for the parties, it will be appropriate for us to deal with

both these questions together.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">19. Before we proceed to examine the merit of the contentions

raised by the Learned Counsel appearing for the parties on this

issue, we must notice a very important fact. As already noticed,

the whole challenge in the Application was to the prescription of

eligibility criteria and parameters for appointment of Chairperson

and members of the EAC/SEAC. This challenge was relatable to

the amendment of the Notification of 2006 which substituted or

superseded the Notification of 1994. Paragraph 4 of Appendix VI

to this Notification of 2006 was a matter of concern for the

applicants. The paragraph 4 of Appendix VI has to be read in light

of other paragraphs of the said Appendix. The relevant extract of

unamended Appendix VI reads as under:-

<p id="p_38">20. The real challenge by the Applicants was to paragraph 4 of

the unamended Appendix VI on various grounds that we have

afore-noticed. Either side argued the matter at great length and

on the premise that said paragraph 4 of Appendix VI was in force

and continued to be part of the rule book. It is only at the time of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                   21</span>
 dictating the judgment that it came to the notice of the Tribunal

that above said Paragraph 4 of the Appendix VI was omitted vide

Notification No. S.O. 1737(E) dated 11th October, 2007. Thus,

after 11th October, 2007, Paragraph 4 no longer remained part of

the Notification of 2006 and the entire challenge of the Applicant

falls to the ground in view of the subsequent omission of the said

paragraph. The Learned Counsel appearing for MoEF thus, was

notified of that position to which the counsel agreed. However,

learned    counsel    stated    that    the    Ministry      was    passing

administrative   orders   for   constituting     EAC/SEAC          including

nomination of the Chairperson for these Committees. As far as

challenge to paragraph 4 of Appendix VI is concerned, it has been

rendered infructuous and inconsequential.


</p><p id="p_39">21. As it is evident from the above referred paragraphs of the

amended Appendix VI, certain specific fields of expertise were

added in relation to risk assessment, life science (flaural and

faunal    management)     forestry     and    wild   life,   environmental

economics with experience in project appraisal and public

administration   or   management.        Though,      the    challenge    to

paragraph 4 does not subsist but the expression 'public

administration or management' in paragraph 2 is, according to

the applicant, still an offending requirement. According to them,

persons with experience in public administration or management,

without any reference to environment in particular, cannot be

appointed as members of EAC, much less as its Chairperson.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                          22</span>
 MoEF cannot by virtue of its administrative powers violate the

statutory provisions or act contra to the spirit of the legislation

and defeat the very purpose and object of the law. If persons

having experience only in the administrative and management

fields are appointed as members of the expert bodies who are to

examine or appraise and recommend grant and/or refusal of

Environmental Clearance in accordance with law, they would

hardly be able to contribute in arriving at a proper decision in

accordance with law. Furthermore, such persons can hardly be

appointed to the EAC/SEAC keeping in view the provisions of the

statutes, i.e. the Act of 1986 and the Notification of 2006. Such

expert body is expected to examine all the four stages afore-stated

and has to carry out the environmental impact assessment of the

project not only on environment simplicitor, but even on

rehabilitation, resettlements and the surroundings of the project

sites. Thus, it is a specialised job and it will be appropriate that

people with experience in the specialised field are appointed

rather than persons with experience of general administration or

management, whose contribution to such process would be

negligible and would not effectively serve the ends of environment.


</p><p id="p_40">22. The Appendix VI of the Notification of 2006 in turn refers to

paragraph    5   of   the   said   Notification   which   provides   for

composition of EAC's and SEAC's. The expression 'shall consist of

only professional experts fulfilling the following eligibility criteria'

in Paragraph 1 of Appendix VI clearly suggests that it is only the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                      23</span>
 persons fulfilling the criteria according to Appendix VI, who would

be eligible for being considered as members of the EAC. This

essence of appointment as Members of the EAC certainly gets

diluted by amendment of Paragraph 2. The professionalism

referred to in Appendix VI has to be in the field of environment

and not in connection with non environmental sciences. Even the

amended Paragraph 2 has to be read in conjunction with

Paragraph 1 of Appendix VI. By virtue of omission of Paragraph 4,

the appointment of chairperson remains in vacuum as no specific

criteria has been provided in Appendix VI. It may be possible for

the   MoEF   to   act   by   administrative   order   as a   stop   gap

arrangement, but certainly cannot make it as a permanent

feature. It must amend Appendix VI and provide the eligibility

criteria for the Chairperson of EAC/SEAC in accordance with the

Notification of 2006, the provisions of the Act of 1986 and in the

best interest of the environment. It will not be in the interest of

any of the stakeholders to leave such a significant appointment

(Chairperson) in vacuum, when eligibility of other appointments

are provided by exercise of subordinate legislation. Improper

exercise of administrative power for such a vital aspect of

Environmental Clearance is likely to give rise to arbitrariness.

This may even result in avoidance of the prescribed eligibility

criteria. Thus, we are of the considered view that it will neither be

permissible nor in the interest of the environment, or any of the

stakeholders, to appoint persons from only administrative or



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                     24</span>
 management field, without having specific experience in the field

of environment.   Therefore, under the legislative scheme of the

referred Acts, Notification of 2006 and Appendix VI to the said

Notification, an appointment contrary to or against the spirit of

these statutory provisions, would certainly lead to adverse

impacts on environmental issues, which are to be dealt with by

these specialized bodies in accordance with the provisions of the

relevant Acts. However, the contention of the Respondents as to

whether the Tribunal can examine the validity of such Notification

or not, and whether it falls within the ambit of Section 14 of the

NGT Act is a question that still remains to be answered.


</p><p id="p_41">23. Section 14 of the NGT Act reads as under:

      certainly acts as a precept to gather the legislative
      intention and how the object of the Act can be achieved.
      It is an instrument that helps in giving a prudent
      legislative interpretation to a provision.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">           In light of this language of the Preamble of the NGT
      Act, now let us refer to some of the relevant provisions.
      Section 14 of the NGT Act outlines the jurisdiction that is
      vested in the Tribunal. In terms of this Section, the
      Tribunal will have jurisdiction over all civil cases where a
      substantial question relating to environment arises. The
      Tribunal will also have jurisdiction where a person
      approaches the Tribunal for enforcement of any legal
      right relating to environment. Of course, in either of
      these events, a substantial question arises out of the
      implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I
      to the NGT Act. Section 15 of the NGT Act provides for
      awarding of relief and compensation to the victims of
      pollution and other environmental damage, restitution of
      property damaged and restitution of the environment for
      such area(s) as the Tribunal may think fit, in addition to
      the provisions of <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_10">Section 14(2)</a> supra. <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_11">Section 16</a> provides
      for the orders, decisions or directions that are appealable
      before the Tribunal. Any person aggrieved has the right
      to appeal against such order, decision or direction, as the
      case may be. This Tribunal, thus, has original as well as
      appellate jurisdiction. This wide jurisdiction is expected
      to be exercised by the Tribunal in relation to substantial
      question relating to environment or where enforcement of
      a legal right relating to environment is the foundation of
      an application. In terms of Section 14(2) of the NGT Act,
      the Tribunal shall hear disputes relating to the above
      matters and settle such disputes and pass orders
      thereupon.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">      20. The expression 'civil cases' used under Section 14(1)
      of the NGT Act has to be understood in contradistinction
      to 'criminal cases'. This expression has to be construed
      liberally as a variety of cases of civil nature could arise
      which would be raising a substantial question of
      environment and thus would be triable by the Tribunal.
      P. Ramanatha Aiyar's The Law Lexicon, 3rd ed. 2012,
      explains 'civil cases' as below:</blockquote><p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">      "In the short sense, the term 'civil case' means cases
      governed by the Civil Procedure Code (5 of 1908). It is

 used in a large sense so as to include proceedings in
income-tax matters...".
</p><p id="p_45">21. The word 'case' in ordinary usage means, 'event',
'happening',      'situation',  and    'circumstance'.  The
expression 'case' in legal sense means a 'case', ' suit', or
'proceedings' in the Court or Tribunal. Civil case,
therefore, would be an expression that would take in its
ambit all legal proceedings except criminal cases which
are governed by the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12"> of the Criminal Procedure
Code</a>. The legislature has specifically used the expression
'all civil cases'. Reference to Section 15 of the NGT Act at
this juncture would be appropriate. The legislature has
specifically vested the Tribunal with the powers of
granting reliefs like compensation to the victims of
pollution and other environmental damage, for
restitution of property damaged and for restitution of the
environment for such area or areas. Once <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_13">Section 14</a> is
read with the provisions of <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_14">Section 15</a>, it can, without
doubt, be concluded that the expression 'all civil cases' is
an expression of wide magnitude and would take within
its ambit cases where a substantial question or prayer
relating to environment is raised before the Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_46">22. The contents of the application and the prayer thus
should firstly satisfy the ingredients of it being in the
nature of a civil case and secondly, it must relate to a
substantial question of environment. It could even be an
anticipated action substantially relating to environment.
Such cases would squarely fall within the ambit of
<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_15">Section 14(1)</a>. Next, in the light of the language of <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_16">Section
14(1)</a>, now we have to examine what is a substantial
question relating to 'environment'. Section 2(1)(c) of the
NGT Act explains the word 'environment' as follows:
"'environment' includes water, air and land and the inter-
relationship, which exists among and between water, air
and land and human beings, other living creatures,
plants, micro-organism and property."
</p><p id="p_47">    <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_17">Section 2(m)</a> defines the term 'substantial question
relating to environment' as follows:
</p><p id="p_48">"It shall include an instance where, --

environmental obligation by a person by which, -
(A) the community at large other than an individual or

      activity or a point source of pollution"."

</p><p id="p_52">24. The jurisdiction vested in the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_18">Section 14</a>,

which is a very wide jurisdiction, is in addition to the appellate

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_19">Section 16</a> and the special jurisdiction under

Section 15 of the NGT Act. Under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_20">Section 14</a>, it is not only that

Tribunal can try all civil cases where a substantial question

relates to environment and arises out of the implementation of the

enactments specified in Schedule I of the Act but also where

enforcement of any legal right relating to environment arises.

<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_21">Section 14</a> specifically refers to a substantial question relating to

environment which itself has been defined and accepted in

Section 2(m) of the NGT Act. The definition under <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_22">Section 2(m)</a> is

an inclusive definition and thus, it has to be construed in a liberal

manner in order to give it a wider connotation.         In the case

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      "13. The NGT Act has been enacted with the object of
      providing for establishment of this Tribunal for the
      effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to
      environmental protection and conservation of forests
      and other natural resources including enforcement of
      any legal right relating to environment and for giving
      other contemplated reliefs and even dealing with matters
      incidental thereto. The Tribunal thus, has original
      jurisdiction in terms of Section 14 of the NGT Act. This
      wide jurisdiction is expected to be exercised by the
      Tribunal in relation to substantial questions relating to
      environment or enforcement of legal rights relating to
      environment, when it arises from the implementation of
      one or more of the Acts specified in Schedule I to the
      NGT Act. The pre-requisite for the applicant to invoke
      original jurisdiction of the Tribunal, subject to other
      limitations stated in Section 14 of the NGT Act, is that
      the application must raise substantial question relating
      to environment. This Tribunal, in the case of <a href="/doc/161378671/" id="a_24">Goa

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">          "24. Section 2(m) of the NGT Act classifies
          'substantial question relating to environment' under
          different heads and states it to include the cases
          where there is a direct violation of a specific
          statutory environmental obligation as a result of
          which the community at large, other than an
          individual or group of individuals, is affected or is
          likely to be affected by the environmental
          consequences; or the gravity of damage to the
          environment or property is substantial; or the
          damage to public health is broadly measurable. The
          other kind of cases are where the environmental
          consequences relate to a specific activity or a point
          source of pollution. In other words, where there is a
          direct violation of a statutory duty or obligation
          which is likely to affect the community, it will be a

 would squarely fall under Section 14(1) of the NGT
Act. Thus, disputes must relate to implementation
of the enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT
Act. At this stage, reference to one of the scheduled
Acts i.e. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_26">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 may be
appropriate. The object and reason for enacting that
law was primarily to address the concern over the
state of environment that had grown the world over.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">The decline in environmental quality has been
evidenced by increasing pollution, loss of vegetal
cover     and     biological     diversity,    excessive
concentrations of harmful chemicals in the ambient

environmental accidents and threats to life support
systems. These were the considerations that
weighed      with    the    legislature     to   ensure
implementation of the UN Conference on the Human
Environment held at Stockholm in June, 1972 to
take appropriate steps for protection and
improvement of human environment. The essence of
the legislation, like the NGT Act, is to attain the
object of prevention and protection of environmental
pollution and to provide administration of
environmental justice and make it easily accessible
within the framework of the statute. The objects and
reasons of the scheduled Acts would have to be read
as an integral part of the object, reason and
purposes of enacting the NGT Act. It is imperative
for the Tribunal to provide an interpretation to
<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_27">Sections 14</a> to <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_28">16</a> read with Section 2(m) of the NGT

aggrieved person from raising a substantial question
of environment from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

 connected and dependent upon each other. They
cannot be given meaning in isolation or de hors to
each other. The meaning of the word 'dispute', as
stated by the Supreme Court in Canara Bank v.
</p><p id="p_57">National Thermal Power Corporation (2001)1 SCC
43 is "a controversy having both positive and
negative aspects. It postulates the assertion of a
claim by one party and its denial by the other". The
term dispute, again, is a generic term. It necessarily
need not always be a result of a legal injury but
could cover the entire range between genuine
differences of opinion to fierce controversy. Conflicts
between parties arising out of any transaction
entered between them is covered by the term
'dispute'.
</p><p id="p_58">36. The counsel appearing for the respondents,
while referring to this expression, relied upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/20683/" id="a_31">Inder
Singh Rekhi v. DDA</a> , (1988) 2 SCC 338 to support
the contention that the dispute, as referred under
the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_32">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 arises where there is a
claim and there is a denial and repudiation of such
claim.
</p><p id="p_59">37. The judgment relied upon by the respondents is
not of much help to them inasmuch as the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_33">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 operates in a different field
and the meaning to the expression dispute
appearing in that Act has to be understood with
reference to the provisions of that Act specifically.
The said Act is only intended to resolve the disputes
between two individuals arising out of a transaction
under the Arbitration law. However, the present
case, the NGT which relates to environment as
such. It is not individual or a person centric but is
socio-centric, as any person can raise a question
relating to environment, which will have to be
decided by the Tribunal with reference to the
dispute arising from such a question. It is not
necessary that such a question must essentially be
controverted by other person or even the authority.
The essence of environmental law is not essentially
adversarial litigation. To give an example, could any
authority or person deny the question relating to
cleanliness of river Yamuna? Any person could
approach the Tribunal to claim that the pollution of
Yamuna should be controlled, checked and even
prevented. None of the parties or authorities may be
able to dispute such a fact may even contend that
steps are required to be taken to control, prevent
and ensure restoration of clean water of Yamuna.

</p><p id="p_60">          Thus, dispute as understood to be raising a claim
         and being controverted by the other party is not
         apparently the sine qua non to invocation of
         Tribunal's jurisdiction under the scheme of Sections
         14 to 16 of the NGT Act. This approach is further
         substantiated from the use of the expressions 'cases
         relating    to    environmental    protection    and
         conservation of forests and other natural resources
         including enforcement of any legal right relating to
         environment and giving relief and compensation for

     environmental problems and would adversely affect the
     public health. It will result in pollution of underground
     water besides causing emission of obnoxious gases and
     creating public nuisance, owing to being adjacent to
     residential colony and religious places. Thus, it would
     certainly involve a question relating to environment
     arising from the implementation of Acts specified in
     Schedule I to the NGT Act. Thus, the present case

case has nexus with the environment or the laws relatable

thereto, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal can be invoked. Not only

the cases of direct adverse impact on environment can be brought

within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, but even cases which have

indirect adverse impacts can be considered by the Tribunal. At

this stage, we may refer to the judgment of the Rajasthan High

<p id="p_65"> disciplinary issues involving environmental cases was
set up vide the Act with the objective of expeditious
disposal of cases relating to environmental protection
and conservation of forests and other natural resources
including enforcement of any legal right relating to
environment. The National Green Tribunal Bill, 2009
followed which provided for establishment of the
National Green Tribunal consisting of Chairperson and
Judicial and Expert Members as The Central
Government would notify. A person either an expert in
physical sciences or life sciences or engineering or
having administrative experience in dealing with
environmental matters, was considered to be qualified
for appointment as Expert Member. The comprehensive
jurisdiction of the learned Tribunal commensurate to
the task entrusted was outlined as well. This Bill having
been passed by both the Houses of Parliament and on
receiving the assent of the President of India, was
integrated in the Statute Book as the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_37">National Green
Tribunal Act</a>, 2010. The preamble thereof proclaims that
it has been enacted to provide for the establishment of a
National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious
disposal of cases relating to environmental protection
and conservation of forests and other natural resources
including enforcement of any legal right relating to
environment and for giving relief and compensation for
damages to persons and property and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto. The recital
following the preamble amongst others demonstrates
that in order to eventuate the resolutions adopted in the
aforestated     conferences    and    to    fructify  the
comprehension of right to healthy environment as an
integrant of life envisaged under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_38">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India, the National Green Tribunal has
been set up to settle the disputes involving multi-
disciplinary issues relating to environment. <a href="/doc/70356524/" id="a_39">Section 2(c)</a>

A bare perusal of Schedule-III authenticates the
amendments       introduced    in    the    legislations
contained in Schedule I of the Act pursuant to
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_41">Section 36</a> thereof. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_42">Section 33</a> of the Act in no
uncertain terms assigns an over- riding effect
thereof over any other Act inconsistent therewith for
the time being in force or any instrument having the
effect by virtue of any law and inconsistent
therewith. A plain reading of <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_43">Section 14</a> of the Act
would irrefutably justify that thereby the learned
Tribunal has been conferred with the jurisdiction
over all civil courts where a substantial question
relating to environment including enforcement of
any legal right relating to environment is involved
and where such question arises out of the
implementation of the enactments specified in
Schedule I, the learned Tribunal is to hear the
dispute arising from such question and settle the
same and pass order thereon. Considering the ambit
and expanse of the definition of the expressions
"environment" and "substantial question relating to
environment" as engrafted in <a href="/doc/70356524/" id="a_44">Section 2(c)</a> and <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_45">2(m)</a>
respectively, we are unable to persuade ourselves to
conclude that any constricted approach to scuttle
the otherwise attributed wide jurisdiction of the
learned Tribunal is either envisaged by the
Parliament or is intended. Not only the environment
includes water, air and land as defined and their
inter- relationship alongwith human beings, other
living creatures, plants, micro-organism and
property, the substantial question relating to
environment      includes    amongst     others      the
eventualities set out in clauses (i) and (ii) of <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_46">section
2(m)</a> of the Act. The definition "substantial question
relating to environment" as provided in <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_47">section 2(m)</a>
is an to limit inclusive one and by no means can be
ascribed a connotation the scope and sphere
thereof.       Apropos the factual backdrop of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                           35</span>
 legislation and the salubrious accomplishments
thereof as intended, any endeavour to muzzle the
legislatively intended contour thereof would be
antithetical thereto and cannot receive judicial
imprimatur. A purposive interpretation has to be
essentially provided to the relevant 14 provisions of
the Act so as to facilitate the wholesome
implementation of its enjoinments lest the same is
rendered otiose. The words contained in <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_48">Section 14</a>
delineating the jurisdiction of the learned Tribunal
therefor have to be assigned the desired flexibility
and amplitude to achieve the objectives thereof.
<a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_49">Section 16</a> by no means ousts or regulates or
circumscribes the ambit of <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_50">Section 14</a>. The reliefs
grantable by the learned Tribunal and enlisted in
<a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_51">Section 15</a> are also couched in compendious terms
with adequate discretion to the learned Tribunal to
mould the same within the framework thereof. The
reliefs contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/51829346/" id="a_52">Section
15(1)</a> therefore do not admit of literal interpretation
to circumvent the otherwise intended wide ambit
thereof. Though the Act does not contain any
provision in particular mandating transfer of any
pending case or proceeding otherwise within the
purview of the jurisdiction of the learned Tribunal to
it, having regard to the framework thereof and the
interplay of the relevant provisions, with the
Tribunal as the envisaged fora to settle the disputes
involving     substantial    questions    relating    to
environment, in our view, the non-existence thereof
(provision     of    transfer)   is    suggestive      of
impermissibility of such transfer.
</p><p id="p_71">        To reiterate, the Act has been given an over-
</p><p id="p_72">riding effect. Though the same per se would not oust
the jurisdiction of the superior courts contemplated
by the Constitution of India, the plea of inadequacy
or inefficacy of the remedy provided by the Act does
not weigh with us. The reference of Articles 323A
and 323B of the Constitution of India and the
enactments made thereunder ipso facto also do not,
in    our    estimate,    outweigh     the    otherwise
unmistakable edict of the Act and the inbuilt
exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil courts in
matters within the purview of the learned Tribunal
for its adjudication. The contention that this Court
is beyond the concept of civil court and thus, the
provisions of the Act do not apply to the proceeding
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_53">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is to
be recorded only to be rejected. There is no
repugnance or conflict between the provisions of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                            36</span>
           Act and the jurisdiction of the learned Tribunal
          outlined thereby with that of the superior courts
          under the Constitution of India. No ouster of the
          writ jurisdiction of this Court as well is either
          conceived of or intended. This, however, does not
          detract from the necessity of transfer of the
          proceedings also under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_54">Article 226</a> of the
          Constitution of India to the learned Tribunal in view
          of the avowed mission of the Act and for the
          settlement of disputes relating to environment with
          suitable reliefs as a corollary thereof. It has been
          contended on behalf of the Board in its pleadings
          that the facts involved pertain to water pollution due
          to discharge of sewage and untreated trade effluent
          by the industries involved. Not only these outrages
          are due to conscious violations of the Act of 1974
          and other environmental laws, remedial actions
          taken by it (Board) form the subject matter of
          challenge in the instant writ proceedings as well.
          Accusation     of   environmental     pollution    and
          ecological damage has been made. Having regard to
          the definitions of "environment" "substantial
          question relating to environment" as adverted and to
          hereinabove, we are thus of the unhesitant opinion
          that substantial questions relating to environment
          and arising out of the implementation 16 of the
          enactments amongst others the Act of 1974 is
          involved in the proceedings in hand warranting
          transfer of the cases to the learned Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_73">27.   The jurisdiction of the Tribunal thus, would extend to all

civil cases which raise the substantial question of environment

and arise from the implementation of the Acts stated in Schedule I

of the NGT Act. There has to be thus, a direct nexus between the

cases brought before the Tribunal and a substantial question

relating to environment. The 'cause of action' as contemplated

under the provisions of the NGT Act would be complete only when

the stated three ingredients, i.e. firstly, civil cases, secondly,

concerns or raises a substantial question of environment or an

enforcement of a legal right relating to environment and lastly that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                                                   37</span>
 such question arises in regard to implementation of the Schedule

Acts, are fulfilled. In the case of Kehar Singh (supra), the Tribunal

unambiguously stated the principle that there has to be a direct

nexus or link between the case advanced by the applicant and the

substantial question relating to environment. It has to be a civil

dispute raising an environmental issue and arising from any/or

all of the Scheduled Acts.
</p>
<p id="p_74">
</p><p id="p_75">28. However,    the   Tribunal     may    not    have   jurisdiction   to

entertain and decide such proceedings even when above nexus is

established, as there is still another sine qua non for exercise of

the jurisdiction by the Tribunal, that is, it must arise or be

relatable to the implementation of the Acts specified in Schedule I

of the NGT Act. Thus the most significant expression in this entire

gamut of law is the expression 'implementation'. The legislature

in its wisdom has specified different class of civil cases that would

fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The first class of cases

may per se raise a substantial question relating to environment

while others may relate to enforcement of legal right relating to

environment.    These    classes   of    cases   must    arise   out   of

implementation of enactment specified in Schedule I. Thus, now

we should examine the meaning of the word 'implementation'.

The expression 'implementation' appears under different Acts even

under environmental laws. The Preamble as well as <a href="/doc/172134797/" id="a_55">Section 22A</a>

of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_56">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 uses the

word 'implement'. In the Preamble, it is stated that, 'whereas it is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                       38</span>
 considered necessary to implement the decisions' while <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_57">Section

22A</a> states, 'where the Board is competent to direct the person to

implement the direction in such a manner as may be specified by

the Court'.   The Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, in its

Preamble as well as <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_58">Section 3</a> (2) (xiv) uses the word 'implement'

and 'implementation' respectively.    The expression 'implement'

has been used in the Preamble while 'implementation' in <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_59">Section 3</a>

(2) (xiv) relates to whether the Central Government vested with the

power to take such measures in relation to matters as the Central

Government deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of

securing effective implementation of the provisions of the Act

under <a href="/doc/561480/" id="a_60">Article 243G(b)</a> of the Constitution of India which vests

powers in the Panchayats and Authorities in relation to various

matters. The State can vest the Panchayat with the power to

exercise the Authority to implement the schemes for economic

development and social justice as may be entrusted to them

including those in relation to the matters listed in the Eleventh

Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">29. The above provisions clearly show that the expression

'implement'/'implementation'    has   been    used      differently   in

different contexts. It will derive its meaning from the context in

which it has been used, but in every context this expression has

been used liberally and would be construed accordingly. There is

no reason for us to constrain or limit unnecessarily the meaning

of   'implementation'.   'Implementation'    has   to    be   read    in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                      39</span>
 conjunction with the provisions of the Acts, the Rules, the

Regulations and the Notifications issued under those Acts. The

expression, 'implementation' should be construed reasonably

upon the cumulative effect of these provisions and the attending

legislative   intent.   The   Tribunal   while   giving   it   a   liberal

construction has to also ensure that it does not travel beyond the

accepted norms of interpretation.

the date pronounced by the Tribunal in the case of M.C. Mehta v.

       Even in this phrase, the word 'implementation' is of
       essence. 'Implementation' in common parlance means
       to take forward a decision or to take steps in furtherance
       to a decision or a provision of law. It sets into motion,
       the actions which are contemplated within the
       provisions of the Act to which reference is made. It is

       law or the provision in which such expression appears.

<p id="p_85">31.   'Implementation', therefore, within the provisions of Section

14 of the NGT Act would relate to implementation of the various

provisions, rules, regulations and the notifications issued in

exercise of subordinate or delegated legislation with regard to any

or all of the Acts stated in Schedule I of the NGT Act. It is not

only implementation of the enactments, but even the questions

which arise out of such implementation that would clearly fall

within the ambit of Section 14 of the NGT Act. 'Implementation',

would therefore cover all questions relating to application,

enforcement and regulations under these enactments.          There

should be a nexus between the pleaded cause of action and the

environment, making it a substantial question of environment.

This may be in relation to environment or even enforcement of any

legal right relating to environment.   The word 'implementation'

thus, has to be understood in its wider perspective and

connotation.   The interpretation should be one which would

further the cause of effective implementation of the provisions of

the Scheduled Acts.      Any matter in relation thereto would

 squarely fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The nexus

with environment could be direct or even indirect. The present

case is one, which would fall in the latter category.         It will be

obligatory   to   constitute   appropriate   expert   committees       in

consonance with the provisions of the scheduled Acts and the

Notifications issued thereunder otherwise this is bound to have

adverse effects on effective prevention and control of pollution.

has been given an inclusive definition in terms of <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_67">Section 2</a> (c) and

</p><p id="p_87">(m) respectively of the NGT Act. In other words, this expression

would have to be given wider connotation as they are generally

understood but would also include what is specifically stated in

these Sections. If any activity or action of any authority under

various   provisions   of   the   Acts,   would   directly   affect   the

environment, then it would be a matter which would come within

Notification of 2006 would have an impact on environment. It

would also involve an enforceable legal right of the project

proponent and even public at large in relation to environment.

Hence, they will have an enforceable legal right that EAC/SEAC

 should be constituted in accordance with law to consider their

case for Environmental Clearance. Thus, examined from either of

the point of views stated above the present case would fall within

the ambit and scope of Section 14 of the NGT Act.


</p><p id="p_88">33. The expression, 'implementation' appearing in different

statutes has been discussed by us in some detail above. At this

stage, we must notice that under the Statement of Objects and

Reasons of the Act 1986, the primary concern was over the

existing state of environment, that is the decline in environmental

quality, increasing pollution, loss of vegetal cover and biological

diversity, excessive concentrations of harmful chemicals in the

ambient atmosphere and in food chains, growing risks of

environmental accidents and threats to life support systems.

Thus, to prevent and control these pollution related problems and

to preserve wholesome environment for the community at large,

the provisions of the Act of 1986 Act were enacted. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_69">The Act</a> of

1986, provided both for procedure as well as regulatory regime for

protection of environment thereto.      In exercise of the powers

conferred under <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_70">Section 6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_71">25</a> of the Act of 1986, the Central

Government had framed the Rules of 1986. Under Rule 5 of the

said Rules, the Central Government is empowered to pass certain

prohibitory or restricted directions in relation to the fields stated

under that Rule. In terms of Rule 5(3)(d), it is empowered to issue

prohibition or restriction on location of such industry and the

manner in which the process is to be carried on. The grant or



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                   44</span>
 refusal of Environmental Clearance/Authorization is, thus, the

most important aspect of environmental jurisprudence in as much

as   it   is   only   after   grant       and   refusal      of    Environmental

Clearance/Authorization that any project or activity can be

carried on in that area. As already noticed, this process is to be

completed by an expert body i.e. the EAC/SEAC. Therefore, to

implement      effectively    the     provisions   of     environmental         law,

EAC/SEAC        performs      the     most      important         and    significant

functions.     If the members of this expert body are non-

environmentalists and do not fall within the eligibility criteria of

Appendix VI, then besides violation or infringement of such

provisions, its direct impact would be on the environment. If

people who are not strictly qualified and eligible and who do not

professionally belong to this field, are selected as members of

EAC/SEAC, the obvious result would be improper application of

mind to the project reports and the application moved by the

Project        Proponent        for        grant        of         Environmental

Clearance/Authorization.            The    EAC/SEAC          has        to   perform

functions of a very scientific and technical nature and has to

analyse comprehensive terms of reference and environmental

impact assessment report in respect of the project activity and

then submit its report and recommendations to the Government

for grant/consideration of the appropriate authority. Persons who

are not eligible or are not having requisite expertise and

experience in relation to the various fields of environment and the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                                                  45</span>
 process involved therein, would cause serious prejudice to all the

stake-holders and more particularly to the environment and

ecology of the country.      It is an accepted social norm that

prevention is better than cure. If the projects are cleared by class

of the persons afore-stated then such projects when made

operational,   may   have    serious   adverse   impacts    on   the

environment and cause environmental hazards.           It would be

better to prevent participation of such persons in the process of

appreciation and grant of consent/clearance/authorization rather

than to find remedies to the problems of pollution resulting from

improper exercise of powers by such persons. Appendix VI to the

Notification of 2006 issued in furtherance to the powers vested by

the Act and is subordinate/delegated legislation and thus, would

be an integral part of the Act. Therefore, compliance and proper

implementation of the provisions falling under and arising from

the specified Acts in Schedule I would be matters raising

substantial questions of environment, hence covered under

Section 14 of the NGT Act.

duly provided under Appendix VI. It states the eligibility criteria

in that regard. Satisfying the eligibility criteria is a sine qua non

legal requirement for selection of the EAC members, on the other

it gives a legal right in rem to ensure that appointments are made

in accordance with law. The exercise of jurisdiction by these

Proponent and as such the Project Proponent would have an

enforceable legal right to claim that EAC/SEAC members are

appointed in accordance with the specified criteria in the interest

of environment. This matter cannot be left to the discretion of the

authorities.   Even   examined   from   this   point   of   view,   the

application would be maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_91">     The Chairperson or Members who are to deal with complex

environmental issue while considering grant of Environment

Clearance or otherwise to the proposed projects must be

possessed of appropriate qualification and experience in that field.

They are expected to discharge functions of an expert body that

has serious ramifications not only on the rights of the parties

before it but even upon the development of the country. The

appointment of appropriate people with desired qualification thus

would be of concern and within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

The Supreme Court in the case of State of Assam v Sristikar

Dowerah &amp; Ors AIR 1957 SC 414 was concerned with the question

of excessive delegation where, while referring to the desirability of

requisite qualifications of the members of the Tribunal, the Court

observed as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      It is clear that the Tribunal was to sit in appeal over the
      decision of the Excise Commissioner and that by itself
      gives some indication that the person or persons to be

      capacity and competency to deal with appeals from such
      high officials. We do not consider that there has been an
      excessive delegation of legislative power.

powers conferred by Sub-Section (1) and clause (v) of the Sub-

Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 5 of the Rules of 1986. As already noticed,

the Central Government is vested with the power to take all such

measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of

protecting   and    improving     the    quality    of environment     and

preventing, controlling and abating pollution. <a href="/doc/68770664/" id="a_73">Section 3(2)</a> of the

Act of 1986 specifies inter-alia the matters in relation to which

measures could be taken by the Government. All the clauses of

residual power is of a very generic nature but has only one object,

i.e. such other matters as the Central Government deems

necessary or expedient for the purpose of securing the effective

implementation of the provisions of this Act. This clearly

demonstrates       the   legislative    intent     of   ensuring   effective

implementation of the provisions of the Act.

</p><p id="p_94">     In view of the above reasoning, we have no hesitation in

coming to the conclusion that providing of eligibility criteria under

the Regulations of 2006 would be a matter that would squarely

fall within the ambit and scope of Section 14 of the NGT Act.

be permitted to raise objections of maintainability in face of the

order of the High Court aforenoticed. We may also notice here

that appointments as Chairperson of EAC were made by MoEF by

passing administrative orders because Para 4 of Appendix VI has

been omitted in the year 2007. This process does not appear to

be strictly in consonance with law. The relevant materials were

circumstances of this case, issuance of certain directions have

become necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the

provisions of the various environmental Acts, particularly with

reference to the grant or otherwise of Environmental Clearance.

Appendix VI, as it exists today, is silent with regard to the

eligibility criteria and qualifications for appointment as Chairman

of EAC. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1203995/" id="a_81">Vineet Narain &amp; Ors.

v. Union of India and Another</a>, (1998) 1 SCC 226, has held that in

and directions have been issued in large number of cases. Thus,

an exercise of providing guidelines by the court was stated to be

well-settled    practice,   which    has    taken   firm   roots   in    the

constitutional jurisprudence. This exercise is essential to fill the

void in absence of suitable legislation to cover the field.             This

principle was also followed by the Supreme Court in the case of

Tribunal held as under: -

          express provision in the Act or the rules framed
          there under giving the Tribunal jurisdiction to do
          so.    But it is a well-known rule of statutory
          construction that a Tribunal or body should be
          considered to be endowed with such ancillary or
          incidental powers as are necessary to discharge its
          functions effectively for the purpose of doing justice
          between the parties. In a case of this nature, we
          are of the view that the Tribunal should be
          considered as invested with such incidental or
          ancillary powers unless there is any indication in

(1983) 4 SCC 293, the Supreme Court held that in the exercise of

jurisdiction by the Tribunal, neither the High Court nor the

Supreme Court is required to be too astute to interfere with the

exercise of jurisdiction by special Tribunals at interlocutory

stages and on preliminary issues. The approach of the Courts is

to permit the Tribunals to exercise their jurisdiction to the fullest

 so as to ensure that the Tribunals do complete and effective

justice. While examining the ouster of jurisdiction of the

Tribunals or the appellate authorities under a statute, the

Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1548537/" id="a_88">Hakam Singh vs M/s. Gammon

(India) Ltd</a>, 1971 1 SCC 286 noticed that in common law it is well

accepted that unless Parliament/legislature expressly ousts the

jurisdiction of the Court, the law must be interpreted in a manner

of conferring jurisdiction. The ouster of Court's jurisdiction -

whether express or implied must be clear and unambiguous. The

assumption of jurisdiction cannot ordinarily be negatived by

implying limitations. If the language is not clear, the Court must

interpret the legislative clause in a narrow manner and sustain

the jurisdiction of a Court.
