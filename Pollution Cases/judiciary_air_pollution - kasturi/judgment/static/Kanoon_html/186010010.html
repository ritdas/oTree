                                     JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">       These Writ Petitions filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India are

in challenge of orders passed by the learned Enquiry Commissioner and Special

Judge, Thiruvananthapuram (for short, "the Special Judge") under Sec. 156(3)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short, "the Code") directing the Vigilance

and Anti Corruption Bureau (for short, "the V&amp;ACB") to conduct a preliminary

enquiry and register a case if materials indicating commission of offences as

alleged in the private complaints are disclosed and if not, report the matter to the

learned Special Judge. The following questions of law are urged for a decision:



</p><p id="p_2">       I.    Whether, in view of Sec. 68A of the Kerala Co-operative Societies

Act,1969 (for short, "the Act") it was within the power of learned Special Judge

to direct the V&amp;ACB to conduct an enquiry/investigation and the V&amp;ACB to

enquire/investigate into matters relating to a Co-operative Society registered

under the Act?

      II.      Whether, it was within the power of      learned Special Judge to

direct a preliminary enquiry to be conducted by the V&amp;ACB before registering a

case while passing an order under Sec. 156(3) of the Code?



</p><p id="p_4">      2.       Some facts are necessary for appreciation of the contentions and

decision of the questions raised.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">      3.       In W.P.(C) No.8472 of 2011, respondent No.4           filed Ext.P2,

complaint against petitioners and two others.       Gist of the allegations is that

manipulating the admission register of Vanchinadu Housing Co-operative

Society (for short, "the Society"), names of certain persons were incorporated in

the said Register to make it appear that they were duly enrolled as members of

the said Society and      to facilitate that, applications preferred by the    real

members of the Society were           manipulated.    Petitioners (public servants

connected with the Society) and others did so, for illegal gratification.

Respondent No.4 alleged that petitioners and others committed offences

punishable under Secs.120B, 465, 468, 470 and 471<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>

(for short, "the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>") and Sec.13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for

short, "the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_4">PC Act</a>"). On receipt of Ext.P2, complaint learned Special Judge

passed Ext.P3, order dated March, 30, 2010. Ext.P3, order reads as follows:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "This complaint is forwarded u/s.156(3) crlpc to

              the Director, Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau for

              conducting a Vigilance Enquiry into the allegations

WP(C) Nos.8472 &amp; 9174/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3</span>

             raised in the complaint.     If materials are collected

             warranting investigation, a case shall be registered and

             FIR forwarded to this court and then proceed with

             investigation. If no materials are available to conduct

             investigation, a report shall be submitted within three

             months."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">

</blockquote><p id="p_7">Pursuant to Ext.P3, order a Vigilance Officer conducted a quick verification (or

enquiry, as it is called) and submitted Ext.P4, report to the Director, V&amp;ACB

through proper channel (Superintendent of the V&amp;ACB). In that report, the

Vigilance Officer stated that his enquiry revealed commission of offences

punishable under Secs.465, 468, 471 and 120B of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> (regarding fake

membership of the Society) but, no evidence could be obtained for commission

of criminal misconduct (punishable under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">PC Act</a>) against petitioners. Other

accused in Ext.P2, complaint were exonerated in that report.                The

Superintendent of the V&amp;ACB forwarded the said report to the Director, V&amp;ACB

vide Ext.P5 reiterating the conclusions in Ext.P4, report and recommending that

the local Police may register a case against petitioners for offences punishable

under the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>. The Director, V&amp;ACB forwarded the report to the Additional

Chief Secretary to the Government vide Ext.P5(a), report dated 16.11.2010 with

copy to the Superintendent of Police, Southern Range, Thiruvananthapuram.

Based on the said report, the Vanchiyoor Police registered Ext.P6, FIR against

petitioners for offences punishable under Secs. 468, 471 and 120B read with

Sec. 34 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>.      The suo motu report prepared by the Sub Inspector,

WP(C) Nos.8472 &amp; 9174/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4</span>

Vanchiyoor is appended to Ext.P6, FIR. There, he has stated that report of

quick verification (preliminary enquiry) was forwarded to the Commissioner of

Police, Thiruvananthapuram which ultimately reached the Vanchiyoor Police and

accordingly Ext.P6, FIR is registered. Following registration of Ext.P6, FIR,

Vanchiyoor Police started investigation into the offences punishable under the

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a> referred to in Ext.P6 against petitioners. In W.P.(C) No.8472 of 2011,

prayer is to call for records leading to Exts.P4, P5 and P6, quash the same and

declare that the Act being a self-contained special statue which governs the

administration of a Society registered under the said Act and provides for an

enquiry and investigation by a competent Police Officer          appointed under

Sec.68A of the Act into allegations of misappropriation, etc., a parallel enquiry or

investigation is without authority and hence is illegal.



</p><p id="p_8">       4.     In W.P.(C) No.9174 of 2011 the Society involved is the

Thiruvananthapuram Taluk Integrated Silk Handloom Weaver's Co-operative

Society Ltd (again for short, "the Society") .     Respondent No.4 filed Ext.P1,

complaint before learned Special Judge against petitioner (accused No.2 in the

complaint) and four others. There, offences alleged are under Secs.120B, 403,

406, 409, 420, 465, 468 and 471 read with Sec.34 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a> and Secs.5, 7, 8,

11 and 13 of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_11">PC Act</a>. Learned Special Judge passed Ext.P2, order under

Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12"> of the Code</a> (which is similar to Ext.P3, order in W.P.(C) No.8472 of

2011 and extracted above). The vigilance Officer has started the preliminary

enquiry.   In W.P.(C) No.9174 of 2011, it is prayed that Ext.P2, order may be

WP(C) Nos.8472 &amp; 9174/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        5</span>

quashed. A declaration as to illegality in the parallel enquiry/investigation as

prayed for in W.P.(C) No.8472 of 2011 is      prayed for in W.P.(C) No.9174 of

2011 also.

</p><p id="p_10">       Point No.I



</p><p id="p_11">       5.    It is argued by the learned counsel for petitioners that a parallel

enquiry or investigation by the V&amp;ACB is barred in view of the special provision

contained in Sec.68A of the Act. It is contended by the learned counsel that

when the special statute (i.e., the Act) is      self-contained and has in-built

provision   for enquiry or investigation into any misappropriation or other

malpractices   which has allegedly occurred in a Society coming within the

purview of the Act, such enquiry or investigation has to be conducted         in

accordance with the said provision and hence a parallel enquiry or investigation

by the V&amp;ACB is not contemplated.

             Vigilance Officer with powers to enquire into and

             investigate the cases of misappropriation, corruption

             and any other major irregularities in the society as may

             be referred to him by the Registrar.</p><pre id="pre_2">

              inquiry and investigation in such manner, as may be

              prescribed.



                     (3)   The Vigilance Officer shall be under the

              Societies.

              conferred on any other person."
</p>
<p id="p_20">

Sec.68A was inserted by Act 1 of 2000 and was given effect by SRO No.526 of

2007 from 05.06.2007. As per the said provision, the Government shall appoint

an Officer who is not below the rank of the Deputy Inspector General of Police

as Vigilance Officer to enquire into and investigate cases of misappropriation

and corruption and any other major irregularities in the Society as may be

referred to him by the Registrar. Such Vigilance Officer shall conduct the enquiry

and investigation in such manner as may be prescribed and he shall be under

the administrative control of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. Learned

Public Prosecutor opposing the argument of learned counsel for petitioners

contends that Sec.68A of the Act operates in an entirely different field and has

nothing to do with the investigation which the local Police or V&amp;ACB is to

conduct in accordance with the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13"> of the Code</a>. It is contended that there

is no provision in the Act which either expressly or impliedly repealed       the

WP(C) Nos.8472 &amp; 9174/2011


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                          7</span>

provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14"> of the Code</a> relating to investigation of offences committed by office

bearers of the Society who are public servants.        It is also pointed out that the

Act does not contemplate any trial or conviction for any offence as may be

detected in the enquiry or investigation        conducted by the Vigilance Officer

under Sec.68A of the Act. Learned Public Prosecutor contended that Sec.100

of the Act it is only the jurisdiction of civil and revenue courts that is expressly

barred in respect of any matter for which provision is made in the Act.



</p><p id="p_21">       7.     Chapter XII of the Code deals with information to the Police and

their powers to investigate into cognizable offences. When information is given

to a Police Officer regarding commission of a cognizable offence he is to record

such information into writing and get it signed by the person giving such

for discovery and arrest of the offender.      Sec.156<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17"> of the Code</a> deals with the

power of an Officer in charge of a Police Station to investigate a cognizable

case. Under Sub-sec.(3), any Magistrate empowered under Sec.190 also may

order such an investigation.      Chapter XIV of the Code deals with the conditions

requisite for initiation of proceedings. Sec.190<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18"> of the Code</a> coming in the said

Chapter states that subject to the provisions of the said Chapter, any Magistrate

of the first class and any Magistrate of the second class specially empowered in

that behalf under Sub-sec.(2) may take cognizance of any offence - (a) upon

receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence; (b) upon a police

report of such facts and (c) upon information received from any person other

than a police officer or upon his own knowledge that such offence has been

committed. Chapter XV of the Code deals with power of the Magistrate to take

cognizance of an offence on a complaint.         Thus,     the     procedure     for

investigation of cognizable offence by the Police, initiation of proceeding before

the Magistrate and the manner of taking cognizance by the Magistrate are

provided in Chapters XII, XIV and XV of the Code.

Court of Judicial First Class Magistrate, Ananthapur and others (1973

Madras Law Journal (Cri.) 728), Alladi Kuppuswami, J. with reference to the

provisions of the District Police Act (V of 1861) held that though the said Act

contained certain machinery for punishing the Police Officers in regard to certain

matters, there is no provision in the said Act which ousted jurisdiction of the

court under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21"> the Code</a> and that          Police Officers are also amenable to the

jurisdiction of the courts as any other citizen under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22"> the Code</a>. Though, in

relation to a proceeding under Sec.133<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_23"> of the Code</a> in the light of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 this Court had the occasion to

deal with implied repeal of provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25"> of the Code</a> in view of the provisions of

the said Act.     There, the question     considered was whether in view of the

provisions of the said Act, powers of the Sub Divisional Magistrate to act under

Sec.133<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26"> of the Code</a> stood impliedly repealed. This Court held that repeal like

an enactment is essentially a legislative exercise          properly left with the

Legislature in the separation of powers envisioned by the Constitution of India, it

is for the Legislature to enact a law, or repeal a law and that implied repeal is not

presumed easily because the Legislature which enacts a law is presumed to be

aware of the existence of earlier laws on the subject.       Plurality of legislation

does not suggest repeal by implication. Often, conflict between two statues is

only seeming; their objects being different and the language of each being

restricted to its object. The Division Bench also made reference to the words of

Maxwell that such legislation could "run on parallel lines without meeting". The

Division Bench observed that even when there is a seeming conflict, if possible

effect should be given to both. Division Bench referred to various authorities on

interpretation of statutes and implied repeal and came to the conclusion that the

provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

Chapter X of the Code operated in different fields and hence no question of

implied repeal of Chapter X of the Code could be presumed.



</p><p id="p_24">       9.     Applying the above principles as to interpretation of statute I am to

decide    whether in view of Sec.68A of the Act, enquiry/investigation by the

Police/V&amp;ACB under provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28"> of the Code</a> is barred even impliedly in respect

of offences allegedly committed by        public servants attached to a Society

registered under the Act. Sec.68A of the Act provided for appointment of an

Officer not below the rank of the Deputy Inspector General of Police            as

Vigilance Officer to conduct enquiry/investigation into cases of misappropriation,

corruption and other major irregularities in the Society as may be referred to him

by the Registrar and submit report to the Registrar.        The Vigilance Officer

appointed under Sec.68A of the Act cannot also enquire/investigate the offence

Society. Nor could the Registrar take any action against such co-accused. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_29">The

independent right on the Vigilance Officer to enquire/investigate.        He is to

enquire/investigate only if the mater is referred to him by the Registrar.     The

investigation under Chapter XII of the code is to culminate in a final report to be

submitted before the appropriate court as provided under Sec.173(2) of the said

Code. If such report discloses commission of an offence, the appropriate court

is to proceed against the offender as provided in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30"> the Code</a>. The report of

enquiry/investigation as per Sec.68A of the Act is not for the purpose of putting

the offender on trial. It could be for the purpose of a departmental enquiry or

other action as provided by the Act. It is pertinent to note from Sec.100 of the

Act that the bar of jurisdiction referred to therein in respect of matters required

to be dealt with under the Act is only of civil and revenue courts.     Sec.100 of

the Act does not apply to the jurisdiction of criminal courts.     It is relevant to

note that even when Sec.68A was brought into the Act by way of amendment, no

provision excluding enquiry/investigation/trial under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31"> the Code</a> was made.

Learned Public Prosecutor has brought to my notice certain Government Orders

relating to investigation of cases involving misappropriation in Co-operative

Societies as well. It is pointed out that cases involving misappropriation above

Rupees Five lakhs are to be investigated by the V&amp;ACB and that in W.P(C)

No.9174 of 2011, the amount involved is much more than Rupees Five lakhs.

funds of Co-operative Societies above Rupees Five lakhs shall be investigated

by the V&amp;ACB. That also is an indication that Sec.68A of the Act was not

intended to do away with the investigation, enquiry and trial as provided in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_32"> the

Code</a>. These circumstances persuade me to hold that the vigilance enquiry

contemplated under Sec.68A of the Act and          the    investigation that  the

Police/V&amp;ACB is to initiate in exercise of their power under Chapter XII of the

Code and on completion of investigation to put the offender on trial in

accordance with the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33"> of the Code</a> operate in different fields, with

different objectives.  Sec.68A of the Act cannot        override    power of the

Police/V&amp;ACB to investigate into offences concerning a Society under Chapter

XII of the Code or power of Court to initiate proceeding under Chapter XIV of

the Code, much less to say about taking cognizance under Chapter XV of the

Code In that view, contention advanced by the learned counsel that in view of

Sec.68A of the Act, an enquiry/investigation by V&amp;ACB, submission of a final

report and trial of petitioners before the criminal court is barred, cannot be

accepted.

conducted while ordering investigation under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_35"> of the Code</a>.

According to the learned counsel, when an order is passed under Sec.156(3) of

the code, the V&amp;ACB is bound to register a case and investigate. The V&amp;ACB

could not, in view of the order under Sec.156(3), proceed to conduct a

preliminary enquiry and decide whether a     case is to be registered or not.

Learned counsel submitted that the decision of the Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/1147392/" id="a_36">P.Sirajuddin v. State of Madras</a> [(1970) 1 SCC 595) has been

misconceived     and misinterpreted by the learned Special Judge to order a

preliminary enquiry even while acting Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37"> of the Code</a>. Learned counsel

contended that P.Sirajuddin's case (supra) related to a complaint which was

preferred to the Chief Minister    which in turn, was sent to the V&amp;ACB for

investigation.  It was not a case where the Special Judge exercising power

under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_38"> of the Code</a> ordered to register a case and investigate.

Learned counsel     made heavy reliance on     the decision of this Court  in

<a href="/doc/398257/" id="a_39">Madathil Marakar Haji v. Vakkom B. Purushothaman</a> [2007 (4)

KLT 659]. It is contended that it is overlooking the said aspects that the

learned Special Judge has passed Exts.P2 and P3, orders and directed the

V&amp;ACB to conduct a preliminary        enquiry before registering the   cases.

According to the learned counsel, though P.Sirajuddin's case (supra) was


relied  on   by a Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/650157/" id="a_40">Satheesh      v. Enquiry

whether a preliminary enquiry could be ordered by the Special Judge        when a

private complaint is forwarded to the V&amp;ACB invoking power under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_41">

of the Code</a> was not raised before, or decided by the Division Bench and

hence that decision is no authority to hold that even a when private complaint is

forwarded to the V&amp;ACB under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_42"> of the Code</a>, it is within the power of

the Special Judge to direct a preliminary enquiry before registration of the case.

Learned counsel argued that every decision has to be understood on the facts of

the case it decides and has placed reliance on Padma Sundara Rao

(dead) and <a href="/doc/1355693/" id="a_43">others v. State of T.N. and others</a> [(2002) 3 SCC 533].

It is also pointed by the learned counsel with reference to the decision in <a href="/doc/10239019/" id="a_44">Lalita

Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others</a> [(2008) 14

SCC 337] that the question whether upon receipt of information regarding

commission of a cognizable offence it is imperative for the Police Officer to

register a case or a discretion lies with him to make some         enquiry before

registering the case has been referred to a larger Bench of the Supreme Court

in view of conflicting decisions on the point.     Learned Public Prosecutor in

response contended that<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_45"> the Code</a> does not prohibit the learned Special

Judge from directing a preliminary enquiry to be conducted before registering a

case while issuing an order under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_46"> of the Code</a> and that such a

course is adopted by the learned Special Judge as a precautionary measure, in

the light of the decision in P.Sirajuddin's case (supra) to ensure that any

frivolous complaint intended to wreak vengeance          does not result in the

registration of a case even against an honest public servant,   thereby affecting

the morale of not only the public servant concerned but the department as well.

According to the learned Public Prosecutor the Division Bench in <a href="/doc/650157/" id="a_47">Satheesh v.


Enquiry Commissioner &amp; Special Judge</a> (supra) relying on the decision in

P.Sirajuddin's case (supra) has upheld the order of learned Special Judge

directing preliminary   enquiry by the V&amp;ACB while issuing an order        under

Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_48"> of the Code</a>. It is pointed out that though reference has been made

by the learned Single Judge in <a href="/doc/398257/" id="a_49">Madathil Marakkar Haji v. Vakkom

B.Purushothaman</a> (supra) to the decision of the Division Bench in <a href="/doc/650157/" id="a_50">Satheesh v.

V&amp;ACB was upheld by the Division Bench in view of the decision in

P.Sirajuddin's case. In the light of the decision of the Division Bench, it is

contended that the view taken by learned single Judge in <a href="/doc/398257/" id="a_52">Madathil Marakar

Haji v. Vakkom B. Purushothaman</a> (supra) to the extent it concerned

the power of Special Judge to direct a preliminary enquiry before registration of

the relevant provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_53"> of the Code</a>.      Chapter XIV of the Code dealt with the

conditions requisite for initiation of proceedings while Chapter XV of the Code

dealt with the power of the Magistrate (in the present case, the Special Judge)

to take cognizance. Initiation of proceedings is one thing and, taking cognizance

is entirely different. The Magistrate (in the present case, Special Judge) while

initiating proceedings under Chapter XIV of the Code is entitled to act on a police

report submitted under Sec.173(2)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_54"> of the Code</a>. Chapter XII of the Code deals

with    power of the   Police to investigate into commission of      a cognizable

offence. Sec.157<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_55"> of the Code</a> states that an officer in charge of a Police

Station upon receipt of information regarding commission of a cognizable

offence shall investigate into the matter if he has reason to suspect commission

of such offence. What the Supreme Court has referred to a larger Bench in

<a href="/doc/10239019/" id="a_56">Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others</a> (supra)

is the question whether the Police Officer, on getting information under Sec.154<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_57">

Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_60"> of the Code</a> for investigation the V&amp;ACB is bound to register a case

and investigate. It is observed that even if the V&amp;ACB conducts a preliminary

enquiry into the allegations made in the complaint, it could not say that there is

no need for registering a case. As per the decision of the Supreme Court (in

P.Sirajuddin's case) the Vigilance Cell can conduct a preliminary enquiry

when information is given to the vigilance Cell regarding commission of offence

that case challenge was to the procedure adopted by the V&amp;ACB in registering

a case without conducting a preliminary enquiry (there was no order to conduct a

preliminary enquiry before registering the case). Learned Judge     held that the

V&amp;ACB cannot       be     faulted for registering a case  without conducting    a

in cases    where the complaint prima facie discloses      a cognizable offence.

reliance was placed on the decision in    <a href="/doc/945713/" id="a_75">Reghunathan v. State of Kerala</a>

placed in <a href="/doc/398257/" id="a_80">Madathil Marakar Haji v. Vakkom B. Purushothaman</a>

(supra) the fact situation was that learned Special Judge directed registration of

a case and investigation (without any direction to conduct a preliminary enquiry)

and accordingly the V&amp;ACB registered a case and investigated. That was


called in question (in         <a href="/doc/945713/" id="a_81">Reghunathan v. State of Kerala</a> - supra)

contending that before registering the case, a preliminary enquiry ought to have

been conducted to find whether a prima facie case is made out. This Court held

that the V&amp;ACB could not be faulted for registering a case without conducting

a preliminary enquiry. Of course it was also observed that the V&amp;ACB is bound

to register a case on the basis of      complaint forwarded to it for investigation

             to, in general.     If the Government had set up a

             done in the State of Madras and the said department

             was entrusted with enquiries of this kind, no

             this department but any such enquiry must proceed in

             a fair and reasonable manner. The enquiring officer

             must not act under any preconceived idea of guilt of

             the person whose conduct was being enquired into or

             pursue the enquiry in such a manner as to lead to an

             inference that he was bent upon securing the

prima facie case is made out, learned Special Judge made observations on the

merit of the case (as seen from paragraph 14 of the decision of the Division

(supra) and held in paragraph 15:

<p id="p_55">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                    "................We are of the opinion that in the

             light of the direction issued by the Supreme Court,

             the Special Court cannot simply act as a post office

             and issue without proper application of mind a

             direction to the Vigilance Police to conduct enquiry or

             time we are not satisfied that the impugned order is

             free from legal infirmities. The Special Court ought

             to have taken special care to see that it does not

             enter into any finding which has got the potential to

             cause impediment in the free and fair enquiry or

             investigation, as the case may be, by the Vigilance

             Police.    The Special Court has to examine the

             complaint which is baseless or frivolous or vexatious

             is not forwarded to the Vigilance Police for enquiry or

             investigation. This is to see that innocent public

             without recording any finding with respect to the truth

             of the facts mentioned in the complaint. Unless the

             Special Court refrains from making observations or

             findings touching the merit of the allegations, any

             enquiry or investigation by the Vigilance Police will

             become a farce. As already stated by us, we have

             noticed that such infirmities have crept into the

             are liable to be expunged.       We do not, however,

             think that the direction issued by the Special Court

             ordering enquiry by the Vigilance Police into the

             allegations, calls for interference. We think that it will

Cri.L.J. 274] to contend that the power to order investigation under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_114">

of the Code</a> cannot be delegated to the Police for making a preliminary enquiry

before starting investigation. But   that was not a case involving charge of

corruption against a public servant.   Nor was there any       reference to the

decisions in <a href="/doc/1033637/" id="a_115">State of Haryana and others v. Bhajan Lal</a> and <a href="/doc/1256432/" id="a_116">others,

nothing in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_119"> the Code</a> which prohibits the learned Special Judge from directing a

preliminary enquiry (which was in the interest of public servant concerned) into

the allegations contained in the complaint to find whether there is a prima facie

evidence of guilt of the public servant before registering a case.



</p><p id="p_65">       24.    Learned counsel     requested that in view of the conflict in the

decisions the matter may be referred to a Larger Bench. I do not consider that

such course is necessary in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this

Court (supra) and the directions contained therein (extracted above) which were

not considered in <a href="/doc/398257/" id="a_120">Madathil Marakar Haji v. Vakkom B. Purushothaman</a>.

Having regard to the decisions of the Supreme Court and the decision of the

Division Bench of this Court referred supra where specific direction was given to

the V&amp;ACB to conduct an enquiry before registering a case (on a complaint

which was forwarded by learned Special Judge to the V&amp;ACB under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_121">

of the Code</a>) I am unable to agree with the view expressed by the learned Judge

in <a href="/doc/398257/" id="a_122">Madathil Marakar Haji v. Vakkom B. Purushothaman</a> (supra) that

the Special Judge has no power to direct an enquiry to be conducted before

registration of the case and investigation is started.    In the absence of any

prohibition in that regard, it was well within the power of learned Special Judge

to issue such a direction as done by Exts.P2 and P3, orders involved in these

cases.     In view of the decision of the Division Bench in <a href="/doc/650157/" id="a_123">Satheesh v. Enquiry

Commissioner &amp;         Special Judge</a> (supra) I cannot also agree with the

distinction made in <a href="/doc/945713/" id="a_124">Reghunathan v. State of Kerala</a> and <a href="/doc/398257/" id="a_125">Madathil Marakar Haji

v. Vakkom B.Purushothaman</a> that the decision of the Supreme court in

P.Sirajuddin's case (supra) cannot apply to cases where a           Special Judge

issues an order under Sec.156(3) of the code. I therefore do not find any

illegality in Exts.P2 and P3, orders passed by the learned Special Judge.



</p><p id="p_66">        25.    It is the further contention of  the learned counsel that learned

Special Judge has not applied mind while passing Exts.P2 and P3, orders (under

Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_126"> of the Code</a>) and instead, merely forwarded the complaints to the

V&amp;ACB. It is also pointed out from Exts.P2 and P3 that stereo typed orders

have been passed by learned Special Judge.

<p id="p_67">

</p><p id="p_68">        26.    I have extracted the order passed by learned Special Judge . It is

true that learned Special Judge has merely stated that the complaint is

forwarded under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_127"> of the Code</a> to the Director, V&amp;ACB. But, I find

that learned Special Judge has observed in Exts.P2 and P3, orders that the said

orders are       passed upon hearing       arguments advanced by counsel for

complainants      and the legal adviser.   Though not specifically referred to in

Exts.P2 and P3, orders I must bear in mind that when the learned Special Judge

heard counsel for complainants and the legal adviser, that hearing was on the

allegations contained in the respective complaints. In other words, it is after

referring to the allegations contained in the respective complaints that learned

Special Judge has passed Exts.P2 and P3, orders. In the circumstances, I

reject the contention that it was without application of mind the said orders have

been passed by learned Special Judge.

</p><p id="p_70">       27.    It is lastly argued by learned counsel that while conducting the

preliminary enquiry pursuant to Ext.P3, order in W.P.(C) No.8472 of 2011, the

Vigilance Officer has conducted a detailed enquiry, recording statements of

witnesses and suspects and even getting it signed which is prohibited by Sec.

162<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_128"> of the Code</a> even in a full fledged investigation. According to the learned

counsel, that would prejudice the investigation following Ext.P4, report (in W.P

(C) No.8472 of 2011). Learned counsel has invited my attention to the decision

in P.Sirajuddin's case (supra)       where the officer who conducted     enquiry

committed illegalities which were directed to be eschewed by the trial court while

framing charge.

<p id="p_71">

</p><p id="p_72">       28.     Sec.162<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_129"> of the Code</a> applies in the matter of statement of persons

acquainted with the facts of the case recorded by the Investigating Officer in the

course of investigation of the case. What the Vigilance Officer has done

pursuant to Ext.P3, order (in W.P.(C) No.8472 of 2011) is an enquiry. I am not

going into the question whether it was lawful for the Vigilance Officer to have

obtained signed statements (if any) from witnesses and even suspects. That is a

matter which petitioners could point out before the court concerned at the

appropriate stage as provided under law.        Learned counsel would draw a


distinction that in   P.Sirajuddin's case (supra), the illegal practice of the

Vigilance Officer conducting the vigilance enquiry was commented upon after

investigation unlike in the present case where investigation is going on in one

case and hence the illegality committed in the preliminary enquiry is sufficient to

quash that investigation. I am unable to accept that argument as well. Even in

the course of investigation if signed statement is obtained from witnesses, that

by itself does not vitiate the investigation or trial. It is only that the court must

be more cautious while appreciating the evidence of such witnesses in that their

signed statement were obtained by the Investigating Officer in the course of

investigation. These are matters which the trial court has to look into, be it at

the stage of framing charge or in the course of trial of the case.



</p><p id="p_73">       In the light of what I have stated above, questions raised are answered in

the following lines:

<p id="p_74">

</p><p id="p_75">       i.     Sec.68A of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act,1969 does not

affect   or   take    away    the  right  of   the    Police/V&amp;ACB       to  conduct

enquiry/investigation in accordance with the provisions of Chapter XII of the

Code     into a cognizable offence said to be committed by a public servant

connected with a society registered under the said Act on receipt of information

regarding commission of such offences, or the power of Special Judge to direct

enquiry, registration of the case, investigation and proceed in the matter as

while   issuing an order under Sec.156(3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_131"> of the Code</a> the Police/V&amp;ACB is

directed to hold some enquiry to find whether there is prima facie evidence of
