<p id="p_2">       2.      From the tenor and terms of the pleadings, it is

       evident that, what is concerning the petitioner is the

       operation of flour mill by the 7th respondent without

       securing consent from the Pollution Control Board.                             It

       is an admitted case that, Ext.P11 D &amp; O license is

       issued to the 7th respondent for conducting a flour

       mill,    however,    according        to    the   petitioner,              taking

       advantage    of     Ext.P11        order,   the    7th    respondent           is

       carrying on with the powdering of chilli etc, which is

       not guided by Ext.P11 D &amp; O license.

</p><p id="p_3">       3.      When this matter came up for hearing during the

       last    occasion,     Standing        Counsel     for     the    Pollution

       Control Board was directed to ascertain whether any

       consent was issued by the Pollution Control Board.



</p><p id="p_4">       4.      Today,    when   the       matter   is    taken        up,     learned

       Standing Counsel submitted that no consent is issued by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> WP(C).No. 28483 of 2018             5</span>

       the Pollution Control Board.             Even though, notice is

       served on the 7th respondent, there is no appearance

       also.    Therefore, having heard learned counsel for the

       petitioner, learned Government Pleader and the Standing

       Counsel for the Pollution Control Board, there will be

       a direction to the 2nd respondent, ie, Secretary of the

       Kootickal Grama Panchayat to take appropriate action

       against the 7th respondent, if the 7th respondent is

       carrying on the operation without securing consent from

       the     Pollution     Control     Board       and       exceeding      the

       conditions      contained    under   D    &amp;    O    license        namely,

       Ext.P11 at the earliest, and at any rate, within a

       month    from   the   date   of   receipt     of    a    copy   of    this

       judgment.
