</p>
<p id="p_26">2. The legality and correctness of the above order is challenged by the

appellant in the present application, inter alia, but primarily on the

following grounds:
</p>
<p id="p_27">(i) The impugned order is violative of the principles of natural justice.

The appellant was not provided hearing and in any case adequate

hearing, by the Board. Thus, the order is violative of the principles of

natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                        5</span>
</p><p id="p_29"> (ii) There are a number of other units in the same vicinity (residential

area) which are carrying on similar or other polluting businesses but no

action   has   been   taken   against   them.     The   appellant   has   been

discriminated. As such, the order is arbitrary.

</p><p id="p_30">(iii)    The appellant falls in the exempted category and is not required

to take consent of the Board for carrying on its industrial activity.

The Board, in exercise of its powers, had issued a notification on 28 th

April, 1998 declaring the list of tiny small scale industries of 63 different

types which were exempted from obtaining consent of the Board. The

appellant falls under Entry No.39 of the list and the entire action of the

Board and passing of the impugned order is without jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_31">3. The above contentions arise out of the factual matrix, that the

appellant claims to have established a small scale industry in the name

and style of Panesar Products, which was carrying on the business of

manufacturing of cycle parts. Amongst others, these parts included side

supports, round and channel with clip to be used for kids' cycles. The

appellant applied to the Board for obtaining its consent. Along with that

the appellant also applied to the Municipal Corporation of Ludhiana for

obtaining a no objection certificate. The officers of the Board advised the

appellant that there was no necessity to grant no objection certificate to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                            6</span>
 him in view of the notification dated 28th April, 1998. It is also averred by

the appellant that his unit was a non-polluting unit, not emitting any air

or water pollutant, and even on that score, he was not required to obtain

the consent of the Board. As far as the submission of the appellant to

Ludhiana Municipal Corporation was concerned, the appellant claims to

have submitted all necessary documents with affidavits and the said

Corporation finally granted no objection certificate vide their letter dated,

23rd May, 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_32">Vide its notification, the Board has also categorised industries with

reference to the investments made by the industry. The industries having

investments of less than Rs.10 lakhs and not causing any pollution did

not require consent of the Board. This also was further clarified by the

Board vide its letter dated, 1st June, 1998 wherein the Board divided the

industries under three different categories:

</p><p id="p_33">1) Red industries which were causing pollution and were industries of

hazardous nature.
</p>
<p id="p_34">2) Green industries, and

</p><p id="p_35">3) Exempted industries.
</p>
<p id="p_36">4. The industries which fell in green category were the industries which

were causing marginal pollution. Electrical connections to the industries,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                           7</span>
 which were marginally polluting, were granted without insisting upon the

consent/no objection certificate from the Board. In furtherance to this

decision, the appellant had applied for electrical connection from Punjab

State Electricity Board. Subsequently, an electrical connection in favour

of the appellant was released by the Electricity Board.

</p><p id="p_37">5. The industrial unit of the appellant is situated at House No. 4256/3,

Street No.4, Shimlapuri, Gill Road, Ludhiana, which is a residential area.

Near and around the unit of the appellant, a number of other industrial

units are also functioning. The appellant has filed a copy of the site plan,

showing other industrial units working in the same area, as Annexure

P.3.   The appellant's unit was neither emitting any pollution nor any

complaint was made against the appellant though he was carrying on the

business for almost 4-5 years.      Because of personal differences, one

Sohan Singh, Respondent No.3, herein, filed a false complaint against

the appellant for causing noise pollution. Though the said respondent is

also having an industrial unit, manufacturing locks and the said unit, it

is contended, is causing more pollution than that of the appellant, still

no action had been taken by the Board against Respondent No.3 while

the appellant, vide notice dated, 9th June, 2003 was asked to appear

before the Board on 10th June, 2003 on which date he appeared and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                          8</span>
 submitted an application that according to the order, the level of noise

pollution is 64.3 db against the permissible limit of 55 db and prayed for

more time to comply with the directions and to bring the noise level

within the permissible limits. However, the Board was adamant and

ordered the appellant to close the unit by 13th June, 2003. In the event

of the appellant not complying with this order, the Electricity Board was

directed to disconnect the electricity supply to the unit. In this manner,

the appellant was neither granted adequate opportunity by the Board

and their action was arbitrary and malafide.
</p>
<p id="p_38">6. It is also the case of the appellant that on 28th May, 2003, the officials

of the Board visited his premises and found that only small machines

like power press, small press, surface grinder, press grinder and drill

machine were working and there was no machinery in operation which

was creating extraordinary noise. The appellant claims that for the above

reasons, the impugned order is arbitrary, violative of the principles of

natural justice, that the Board has passed the order dated 13 th June,

2003 at the behest of Respondent No.3 and that the appellant's industry

falls in the exempted category. Therefore, the impugned order ought to be

set aside and directions issued by the Board as well as other

Departments need to be quashed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                           9</span><p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40"> 7. First and foremost, we may deal with the contention in regard to

violation of principles of natural justice. From the above narrated facts, it

cannot be disputed that the Board had issued a notice to the appellant

on 9th June, 2003 requiring him to appear before the Board on 10th June,

2003. In that notice, it was specifically stated inter alia that the industry

was visited by the officers on 25th March, 2003 and the noise level of the

industry was monitored. It was observed that the noise level was beyond

the limits prescribed by the Board for the residential area. The notice

clearly stipulated that the industry should obtain the consent of the

Board in terms of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_12">Section 21</a> of the Act and it was mandatory for the

appellant to provide adequate and appropriate air pollution control

devices to control the noise/air emissions from its industrial premises so

as to bring them down within the permissible limits prescribed by the

Board. Even reference to the complaints made against the appellant was

mentioned. This itself provided an opportunity to the appellant to file

objections, if any, and also stated as to what directions were

contemplated to be passed against the appellant. The appellant appeared

before the Board on that date and even filed objections. In his

application, the appellant raised the above ground and in fact admittedly

prayed for time to install air and noise pollution control devices to bring
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                          10</span>
 down the respective pollution levels. This case is even pleaded by the

appellant in his application afore referred. In the impugned order, the

Board had specifically noticed that during the hearing, all the reports on

noise pollution as well as averments made in Writ Petition No.3802/2003

were shared with the owner of the unit. During the hearing, the appellant

had admitted to shift only the pollution generating machinery from the

premises in question but not wholly as other similar units were also

operating in the area. The principles of natural justice are certainly

applicable to such proceedings.       In fact, the provisions of the Act

specifically require and contemplate that an opportunity shall be

provided to the appellant before any order adversely affecting his rights

are passed by the Board. Natural justice does not have absolute

application. It is to be examined on the facts of a given case.

</p><p id="p_41">        In the case of <a href="/doc/1134697/" id="a_13">Union of India v. Tulsiram Patel</a> (1985) 3 SCC 398,

a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court stated:

"that the question whether requirements of natural justice have been met

by the procedure adopted in a given case must depend to a great extent

on the facts and circumstances of the case in point, the constitution of

the Tribunal and the rules under which it functions."



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                       11</span>
</p><p id="p_42"> 8. Thus, we have to examine whether the principles of natural justice

have been violated in the present case. The premises of the appellant

were inspected on 25th March, 2003 which means that the appellant

knew that his unit was violating the prescribed parameters of noise

pollution. Thereafter, the notice dated 9th June, 2003 was served upon

him to appear before the Board on 10th June, 2003 when he admittedly

appeared and filed his objections. From the objections filed and from the

record before us, it is clear that the appellant practically admitted the

violation of the prescribed standards of noise pollution. It was expected of

the appellant to install air and noise pollution control devices from the

month of March, 2003 when it was detected by the officers of the Board

on 25th March. However, he took no steps. We are not prepared to hold

that in the facts of the present case, the appellant was not granted

appropriate opportunity to put forward his case. On the contrary, he has

practically admitted the case of the Board and wanted time to rectify the

defects. There is nothing on record to show that even upto the present

date, the appellant has installed noise and air pollution control devices.

Such inaction on the part of the appellant, despite the benefit of being

granted interim stay, even reflects on the conduct of the appellant. It is a

settled rule of principles of natural justice that one who claims relief in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                         12</span>
 equity must not only do equity himself but should also discharge his

statutory obligations and comply with the requirements of law. Thus, we

reject the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that there is any

violation of natural justice.
</p>
<p id="p_43">9. Now, we would proceed to take up the third contention afore-

referred, as advanced by the applicant, before deliberating upon the

second contention.      For its proper appreciation it will be more

appropriate to dissect this contention into the following two parts:

a. Whether the Board has power and authority in law under the

provisions of the Act to exempt any Unit from the applicability of

<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_14">Section 21</a> and other provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_44">b. If the above is answered in the affirmative, even then, whether the

unit of the applicant falls under any of the entries of the stated

'exempted list'.
</p>
<p id="p_45">10.     With the increasing industrialization and the tendency of the

majority of industries to congregate in areas which are already

heavily industrialized, the impact of the problem of air pollution has

begun to be felt in the country. The presence in air, beyond certain

limits, of various pollutants discharged from certain human activities

including industrial emissions as well as traffic, heating, use of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                         13</span>
 domestic fuel, incinerations etc. obviously had a detrimental effect on

the health of the people and even on animal life, vegetation and

property. Air pollution is more serious than any other form of

pollution due to the following facts:
</p>
<p id="p_46">(i) All living creatures, including human beings, consume much

larger quantity of air than any other resources from nature. For

example, on an average an adult man consumes about 17 kg. of air

in a day. No other matter, in such a high quantity is consumed by

man in a day. Thus, even very little contamination of air will expose

the living beings to a high dose of air pollutants.

</p><p id="p_47">(ii) If air is polluted, nobody can escape it. However, if water is dirty,

one can easily avoid to drink it and similarly if food is contaminated,

one can avoid consuming the same. But if air is polluted, no one can

avoid inhaling it, even if one knows that he is going to die if he

breathes such contaminated air. As happened in Bhopal during the

famous gas episode, large number of animals, birds, plants and

human beings died during that tragedy.
</p>
<p id="p_48">   Thus, air pollution has to be viewed more seriously in order to

protect the environment and all living beings. With these objects in

mind, the legislature in its wisdom had enacted the Act to provide for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                             14</span>
 prevention, control and abatement of area pollution. India was also

bound by its participation in the United Nations Conference on the

Human Environment, Stockholm, 1972 to take appropriate steps for

the preservation of the natural resources of the earth which, among

others things, include the preservation of quality of air and control of

air pollution. Once the object and preamble to the Act are examined

with interpretative objectivity, it is obvious that every industrial unit

which caused emissions was required to take consent of the Board.

Not only this, the framers of law used explicit language to show that

there was an imposed restriction on establishing or operating any

industrial plant in the air pollution control area.          The State

Government, after consultation with the State Board, was required to

notify and declare the air pollution control areas for the purposes of

this Act. These areas were subject to extension or reduction in terms

of the provisions of <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_15">Section 19</a> of the Act. The Board, under <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_16">Section

22</a> of the Act, was specifically empowered to lay down standards of

emission as well as to issue such instructions as may be necessary

for any person operating an industrial plant.        This power, more

particularly, in relation to automobiles was conferred upon the Board

in terms of <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_17">Section 20</a> read with <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_18">Section 17</a> (1)(g) of the Act. At this

<p id="p_78">11.      <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_23">Section 17</a> of the Act declares that subject to provisions of

the Act and without prejudice to the performance of its functions

under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_24">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, the

functions of the State Boards are stated in clauses (a) to (j) of sub-

Section (1) to <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_25">Section 17</a>. It is apparent that none of these clauses

specify the functions to be performed by the Board while specifically

empowering it to exempt an industry from being established or

operate without consent of the Board.      Reliance has been placed

upon <a href="/doc/126995116/" id="a_26">Section 17(1)(j)</a> of the Act. This is a kind of residuary power

that is vested in the Board to do things or to perform such other acts

as it may think necessary for the proper discharge of its functions

and generally for carrying into effect the object of this Act. By the

plain language of this provision it is clear that the functions or

powers vested in the Board by virtue of the residuary clause can be

exercised only for two purposes, i.e. for the purposes of proper

discharge of its functions and for carrying into effect the purposes of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                          20</span>
 this Act. Performance of any act by the Board, thus, must fall within

these two clauses, otherwise the Board will have no power to perform

that act.   The residuary power clause can be brought into service

only in consonance with the above purposes and in any case it

cannot be exercised to perform an act, which will be in conflict with

the provisions, purpose or object of the Act itself.   No act can be

performed and no power can be exercised which would lead to a

conflict with any of the provisions of the Act. Like, it is a settled

tenet of civil jurisprudence that a court cannot exercise inherent

powers in derogation to the specific provisions of a statute/Code. It

is always with the intention to aid the implementation of the specific

provisions of an Act that such inherent or residuary powers can be

resorted to.
</p>
<p id="p_79">12.     In the present case, <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_27">Section 21</a> opens with the negative

language, 'no person shall, without the previous consent of the State

Board, establish or operate, any industrial plant in an air pollution

control area'.   This restriction is complete in itself except to the

extent that the existing industries were permitted to continue for a

limited period to enable them to obtain consent of the Board and till

such applications were pending. Rest of the provisions of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_28">Section 21</a>

 deal with the procedure, manner and imposition of conditions, while

granting or refusing the consent. The legislature in its wisdom has

carved out no exception to the rule that there could be no

establishment or operation of the industrial units in the air pollution

control areas except with the consent of the Board.           Once the

substantive provisions provide for no such exceptions and <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_30">Section 20</a>

does not specifically empower the Board to carve out exceptions by

providing exemptions, it is impermissible to contend that with the

aid of the residuary clause, <a href="/doc/126995116/" id="a_31">Section 17(1)(j)</a>, such statutory

restrictions could be relaxed or exceptions could be carved out

thereto by implication.    The doctrine that general things do not

derogate from specific things (generalia specialibus non derogant),

clearly implies that the general power contained under <a href="/doc/126995116/" id="a_32">Section

17(1)(j)</a> cannot be taken to have an overriding effect over specifically

stated functions of the Board and thus, is in clear derogation to

<a href="/doc/195059463/" id="a_33">Section 21(1)</a> of the Act. It is equally a settled preposition of law that

special provisions will control the general provisions while vice versa

is not true. To see it in the light of our Constitutional scheme, we

may refer to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_34">Article 14</a> which is a general provision relating to all

kinds of laws and all kinds of persons while <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_35">Article 310</a> deals with a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                            22</span>
 special or particular matter namely 'government servants and their

termination of services' thus, <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_36">article 310</a>, being specific, would

override the provisions of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_37">Article 14</a>, as far as possible. It is clear

that <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_38">Section 21</a> is the soul of the Statute and is the most significant

provision keeping in view the preamble, objects and reasons of the

Act. Thus, to further the cause of the Act, it is absolutely essential

to permit operation of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_39">Section 21</a> without any legal impediments

resulting from exercise of residuary powers under the provisions of

the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_80">13.        While interpreting the statutory provisions, the courts

normally avoid to adopt an interpretation which would tantamount

to adding words to the language of a provision.         The courts or

tribunals generally refrain from entering into the realm of legislation.

By interpretation they would not read such words into the

provisions, which would result in defeating the very scheme of the

Act and its very object. Such a proposition can be examined from

another point of view that whenever there is an omission by the

legislature of a word or language in a provision, it is also for a

reason.      Normally, such omission can be remedied only by a

legislative act unless the very purpose of the Act and the provisions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                           23</span>
 would stand defeated but for adding or reading into the provisions of

such Act. Under the principle of casus omissus, that which should

have been but has not been provided for in a statute, cannot be

supplied by the courts, as to do so will be 'legislation' and not

'construction'.   Of course, such a rule is not free of exceptions

(<a href="/doc/1155660/" id="a_40">Unique Butyle Tube Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. U.P. Financial Corporation

and Ors</a>. (2003) 2 SCC 455).
</p>
<p id="p_81">14. More than often, courts and tribunals adopt the principle of plain

interpretation.   The intention of the legislature is primarily to be

gathered from the language used which means that the attention

should be paid to what has been said as also to what has not been

said. (<a href="/doc/926715/" id="a_41">Gwalior Rayon Silk Mfg. (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. v. Custodian of Vested

      Act, if any, cannot be provided by the court particularly
      when the language is plain and simple and the assumed

<p id="p_84">"But there is one principle on which there is complete
unanimity of all the courts in the world and this is that
where the words or the language used in a statute are
clear and cloudless, plain, simple and explicit unclouded
and unobscured, intelligible and pointed so as to admit of
no ambiguity, vagueness, uncertainty or equivocation,
there is absolutely no room for deriving support from
external aids. In such cases, the statute should be

      of the statement made, can be pressed into service in order
      to ascertain the real purport, intent and will of the
      legislature to make the constitutional provision workable.
      We might make it clear that such aids may neither be
      decisive nor conclusive but they would certainly assist the

      avowed object of the Act or the Constitution as the case
      may be. (para 271 (2))."
</p><p id="p_87">      33. On the principles of interpretation, we have no
      difficulty in accepting the contentions of Mr. Jethmalani
      but the question is about the applicability thereof."

</p><p id="p_88">16.     While framing and elaborating the powers and functions of

the Board under <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_45">Section 17</a> of the Act, the legislature in its wisdom

has dealt with even minute details of the functions to be performed

by the Board, like the power of inspection, to collect and disseminate

information, to advice the Government and to collaborate with the

Central Government on various issues to lay down the guidelines.

Thus, it cannot be said that an omission to empower the Board with

a significant power to exempt industries from operation of the

provisions of the Act was an unintended omission on behalf of the

Legislature.   It can be illustratively dealt with by reference to the

provisions of <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_46">Section 19</a> of the Act where it is the duty of the State

Government to declare air pollution control areas and then a specific

 power is further vested in the Government to extend or reduce this

area by exercise of such power.      In contradistinction to this, the

provisions of the Act are completely silent in regard to the vesting the

Board with the authority to exempt units from the operation of

<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_47">Section 21</a> of the Act. The Board is not vested independently with

any legislative power, except the ones specified in the Act. The power

to exempt or exclude has to be specifically provided. It is incapable

of being simply inferred.     In the case of implied exclusion, the

legislative intent has to be definite and certain. In that case, it must

be held by the court that any other view would frustrate the object or

purpose of the Act. In the case of <a href="/doc/199187165/" id="a_48">Union of India vs. Alok Kumar</a>

(2010) 5 SCC 349, the Supreme Court while dealing with service

rules relating to the railway employees clearly took the view that

exclusion has to be specific while holding as under: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      "41.     It is a settled principle of interpretation that
      exclusion must either be specifically provided or the
      language of the rule should be such that it definitely
      follows by necessary implication. The words of the rule,
      therefore, should be explicit or the intent should be
      irresistibly expressed for exclusion. If it was so intended,
      the framers of the rule could simply use the expression
      like 'public servant in office' or 'an authority in office'.
      Absence of such specific language exhibits the mind of the
      framers that they never intended to restrict the scope of
      'other authority' by limiting it to the serving

       officers/officials. The principle of necessary implication
      further requires that the exclusion should be an
      irresistible conclusion and should also be in conformity
      with the purpose and object of the rule.

      clear, unambiguous, explicit and specific terms or

      some cases, as it may be, such exclusion could be read
      with reference to irresistible implicit exclusion. In our
      opinion the language of Rule 9(2) does not support the
      submission of the respondents. Application of principle of
      exclusion can hardly be inferred in absence of specific
      language. Reference in this regard can be made to the
      judgment of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1069885/" id="a_49">New Moga Transport

</blockquote>

<p id="p_89">17.     The power to exempt from the operation of the provisions of the

Act must be specifically provided in the statute itself or it must arise as a

result of implied power which indisputably emerges from the scheme of

the Act. Besides this, it should be in conformity with the purpose and

objects of the Act. We have no doubt in our mind that the power to

exclude or exempt any unit or industry is specifically neither provided

under the provisions of the Act nor does it flow impliedly. On the

contrary, exercising such power of exemption in relation to the provisions

of the Act, particularly in face of the language of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_50">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_51">17</a> of

 the Act would neither be permissible nor possible. It would hamper, and

even frustrate, the object of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_90">18.      Similar provisions under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and

Control) Rules, 2000 have been framed under the powers vested in the

proper   authority/Government      under   <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_52">Sections   6</a>   and   <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_53">25</a>   of   the

Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The noise pollution is regulated by

Rule 4 of the said rules, which states that the noise level in any

area/zone shall not exceed the ambient air quality standards in respect

of noise, as specified in the Schedule. There is no provision in the Act

that empowers the Board to exempt any industry or unit from the

operation of the Act. Absence of such specific power necessarily implies

that every industry or unit, before it is established or becomes operative

must obtain consent of the Board in terms of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_54">Section 21</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_91">19.      In the light of this position of law, the Board could not have

issued the notification dated 28th April, 1998, which, in fact, is only a

resolution passed by the Board in its 97th meeting held on 3rd April,

1998. A bare reading of the resolution shows absence of authority or

power to pass such resolution. This resolution does not refer to any

provision of law of the Act or even the rules framed thereunder in

exercise of which the Board is competent to prescribe for such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                          29</span>
 exemption. If the statute has not provided any provision in compliance to

which a unit or industry could be granted exemption or falls outside the

ambit of the provisions of the Act, then the Board cannot do so by an

administrative instruction or resolution. Quando aliquid prohibitur ex

directo, prohibitur et per obliquum.
</p>
<p id="p_92">If an industry is neither discharging any trade effluent nor emitting

pollutant in the air or atmosphere including noise, then the Board can

grant its consent without conditions, but the Board is not vested with the

power of exempting industries from the operation of the Act. The limit of

financial investment by a unit on its establishment, including plant and

machinery, cannot, in any case, be a fair criterion for providing the

stated exemption. This criterion appears to be without any application of

mind. For instance, an electroplating unit may hardly have any

investment in its plant and machinery but still can be a very highly

polluting industry. Thus, an embargo relating to an investment of less

than Rs.10 lakhs does not have any nexus to the object of the Act, i.e.,

prevention and control of pollution. As such, we must conclude that the

notification dated 28th April, 1998 issued by the Board is without the

authority of the law and, in fact, is in the teeth of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_55">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_56">17</a> of

 the Act. Thus, we do hereby quash and set aside this notification for

being contrary to law.
</p>
<p id="p_93">20.        Still, another aspect of this case is that even if for the sake of

arguments, it is presumed that the notification dated 28th April, 1998 is

a valid notification in the eyes of law, even then the appellant does not

fall within the ambit of the notification. This notification emanates from

the resolution of the Punjab Pollution Control Board, whereby a list of 63

types of tiny/small industries, were exempted from obtaining the consent

of the Board under the provisions of the Act. Firstly, we must notice that

NOC is not a concept applicable to the provisions of the Act. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_57">The Act</a>

under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_58">Section 21</a> provides for obtaining consent of the Board to establish

or operate an industrial unit. These industries or units should make an

application for obtaining the consent of the Board. The Board has the

discretion to grant consent, conditional consent or even refuse the

consent. However, it is not vested with the power of exempting industries

from complying with their statutory obligations under the provisions of

the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_94">According to the appellant, he is covered under Entry No.39 of the list,

which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_95">"39. Lathe and welding sets (only electrical) without casting."

</p><p id="p_96"> 21.     It is now an undisputed case before us that the appellant does

not carry on the business of lathe and welding sets (only electrical)

without casting. In fact, the industry being run by the appellant causes

noise as well as air pollution. The industry was inspected on two different

occasions, i.e. on 25th March, 2003 and 10th June, 2003. It was noticed

that the industry was causing noise pollution at a level beyond the limits

prescribed by the Board for the residential area. It is also an admitted

fact that the industry is located in a residential area.

</p><p id="p_97">22.     Even as per the inspection conducted on 1st April, 2013, and the

report submitted thereof, it was inter alia noticed that the industrial unit

of the appellant, Mr. Gurdev Singh, was engaged in manufacturing of

cycle parts. The relevant part of the said report reads as under:

appellant is not only having a lathe machine but also has presses,

grinder and even a diesel generator set of 7 KVA capacity. All this is

bound    to   result    in   air       and   noise   pollution.   The   appellant   is

manufacturing cycle parts and thus cannot fall under Entry No.39 of the

afore-referred list. Thus, in any case, the appellant has no case even on

merits keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the present case.

cannot drive any benefit even if the allegations were taken to be correct.

If others are polluting, that does not give right to the appellant to pollute.

The industry of the appellant, on various occasions, has been found to be

a polluting industry and causing annoyance and disturbance to the

people living in the colony. Discrimination is no defence to an offence.

However, the Board must take action against other air and noise

polluting industries located in the same residential area. If Mr. Sohan

Singh, the complainant, is running an industry, which is causing

pollution, we direct the Board to take immediate steps to inspect the said

the appellant, we are left with no option but to dismiss the application of

the appellant. The impugned order was served upon the appellant on 13 th

June, 2003. He had filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of Punjab and

Haryana, which came up for hearing before that Court. Vide its order

dated 24th June, 2003, the High Court stayed the operation of the

impugned order dated 13th June, 2003. The said stay order continued till

2013 when the matter was ordered to be transferred to this Tribunal.

During the pendency of the matter before the Tribunal, the said stay

order was not specifically vacated. In these circumstances, while

dismissing the application of the appellant, we would grant a period of

two months to the appellant to shift his industry from the residential

area in question or in the alternative to bring the air and noise pollution

parameters strictly within the permissible limits and obtain consent of

the Board within the said period. In the event of default of the aforesaid

conditions, the impugned order dated 13th June, 2003 shall become
