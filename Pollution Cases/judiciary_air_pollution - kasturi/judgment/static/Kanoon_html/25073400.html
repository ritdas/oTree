                                  ---

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO
QUASH THE ORDER DATED 15.11.2018 ISSUED BY R-1
[ANNEXURE-E]; DIRECT THE R-1 TO OBTAIN A REPORT
ABOUT THE CRUSHER OF THE PETITIONER AFTER NOTICE
TO THE PETITIONER; AND ETC.,

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       By way of this writ petition, the petitioner has

questioned    the order dated           15.11.2018,    whereby the

respondent-Karnataka          State     Pollution    Control    Board

('KSPCB') has purportedly withdrawn the consent issued

under <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_1">Section 21(4)</a> of          Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       It is rather an admitted position that the said order has

been    passed   by     the    KSPCB       without    extending   any

opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and only with reference

to the recommendation made by the Hon'ble Upa Lokayuktha.
</p><p id="p_3">                                                  W.P.No.52615/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -3-</span>



With grant of the consent, specific civil rights came existing in

favour of the petitioner; and it remains elementary that any

order proposing to take away the existing rights cannot be

passed without extending a reasonable opportunity of hearing

to the petitioner. On this ground itself, this petition is required

to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      In fact, learned counsel appearing for the KSPCB has

also frankly submitted that the petitioner deserves an

opportunity of hearing and that the KSPCB shall pass fresh

order after extending an opportunity of hearing to the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Taking note of the submissions so made, while the

impugned order dated 15.11.2018 (Annexure-E) issued by

respondent No.1 is set aside, in the interest of justice, it is

provided that if any order adverse to the interest of the

petitioner is proposed to be passed, it would be required of

the KSPCB to serve a specific show cause notice to the

petitioner with the specific ground, which the petitioner is

required to meet.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The petitioner shall be required to submit his reply

within three weeks of receipt of such notice and thereafter, it
                                               W.P.No.52615/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              -4-</span>



would be open for the respondent to pass appropriate orders

in accordance with law while dealing with the submissions of

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       The petition stands disposed of accordingly.
