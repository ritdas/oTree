S. N. Prasad, J.         Since the issue pertains in both the writ petitions are similar in

            this common order.

            memorandum of charge dtd.12.3.2008, Enquiry Report dtd.3.11.2008,

order passed on 26.2.2010 whereby and where under the petitioner has been

inflicted with the punishment of compulsory retirement             which     has

been confirmed by the higher authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">               W.P.(C) No.22133 of 2010 has been filed challenging the show-

<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">3.              The petitioners who were working in the ING Vysya Bank Ltd.,

Bhubaneswar assailed the charge-sheet, enquiry report and the order of

punishment inter alia on the ground of violation of principle of natural justice,

thereby invoked the jurisdiction of this court conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of

the constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">4.              The opposite party - Bank has appeared and raised serious

objection regarding maintainability of writ petitions by putting reliance upon

the judgment rendered by Hon‟ble Apex court in the case of Federal Bank

Ltd. Vrs. Sagar Thomas and Others, reported in AIR 2003 Supreme Court

4325.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">5.              This court, while hearing the matter on 16.5.2018, has passed

an order providing an opportunity to the learned counsel for the petitioners to

argue on maintainability of the writ petitions, pursuant to the same, learned

counsel for the petitioners has argued out the case by submitting that the writ

petitions are maintainable since there is violation of principle of natural

justice and the ratio laid down in the case of Federal Bank Ltd. (supra) is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3</span>

applicable in the facts and circumstances of their cases since according to

them, the aforesaid judgment has been rendered in            the       context    of

provision of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India but here the question of

maintainability is to be tested on the basis of the principles as to whether the

opposite party - Bank is coming under the fold of other public authorities or

not.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">            According to them, the bank is coming under the fold of other

public authority and since the Constitution mandates that before taking any

action which is having its civil consequence, the principle of natural justice is

to be followed and since in these writ petitions the principle of natural justice

has not been followed, as such the writ petitions are maintainable.


</p><p id="p_25">6.            This Court, after hearing learned counsel for the parties, thinks

it proper to first decide the issue of maintainability since this fact has been

taken by way of preliminary objection by the opposite party by putting

reliance upon the judgment rendered by Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of

Federal Bank Ltd. (supra)


            This court, prior to going into the factual aspect involved in the

Federal Bank Ltd., has also thinks it proper to discus about the scope of

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, vis-à-vis definition of „State‟ within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_6">Article 12</a> of the constitution of India and other public authorities

as stipulated under the provision of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the constitution of India.


</p><p id="p_26">7.            This Court has examined the judgment rendered by the

constitution Bench of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court rendered in the case of Ajay

Hasia vrs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi reported in 1981 (1) SCC 722, wherein

this tests were culled out from its earlier judgment in the case of Ramana
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                              4</span>

Dayaram Shetty vrs. International Airport Authority of India, (1979) 3

SCC 489, in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra) at para-9 it has been held as

follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "(1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the corporation is
             held by the Government, it would go a long way towards indicating that
             the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet
             almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some
             indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental
             character.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             (3) It may also be a relevant factor ...whether the corporation enjoys
             monopoly status which is State conferred or State protected.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             (4)Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication
             that the Corporation is a State agency or instrumentality.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">             (5) If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely
             related to governmental function, it would be a relevant factor in
             classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of the
             Government.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             (6) Specifically, if a department of the Government is transferred to a
             corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of this inference of the
             corporation being an instrumentality or agency of the Government."</blockquote><p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">             In the judgment rendered in the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas

vrs. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, (2002) 5 SCC 111, wherein at

para-40, it has been laid down that the picture that ultimately emerges is that

the tests formulated in Ajaya Hasia (supra) are not rigid set of principles so

that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex hypothesis, be

considered to be a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_8">Article 12.</a> The question in

each case would be - whether in the light of the cumulative facts as

established, the    body is     financially, functionally       and administratively

dominated by or under the control of the Government. Such control must be

particular to the body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found, then

the body is a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_9">Article 12</a>, on the other hand, when

the control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would

not serve to make the body a State.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               5</span><p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">            In the case of Zee Telefilms Ltd. vrs. Union of India,(2005) 4

SCC 649, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court while dealing with the issue as

to whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is "State" within

the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_10">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. After detailed discussion on the

functioning of BCCI, the Constitution Bench of Hon‟ble Apex Court concluded

that it was not a "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_11">Article 12</a> and made following observations at

para-30;
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "30. However, it is true that the Union of India has been exercising
             certain control over the activities of the Board in regard to organizing
             cricket matches and travel of the Indian team abroad as also granting of
             permission to allow the foreign teams to come to India. But this control
             over the activities of the Board cannot be construed as an administrative
             control. At best this is purely regulatory in nature and the same
             according to this Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra) case is not a
             factor indicating a pervasive State control of the Board."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">8.           It   is   evident   from   the       aforesaid   judgments   as   referred

hereinabove that if the authority/body can be treated as "State" within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_12">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, indubitably a writ petition

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> would be maintainable against such an authority/body for

enforcement of fundamental and other rights. <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_14">Article 12</a> appears at Part III of

the Constitution or it pertains to fundamental rights. Therefore, the definition

contained in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_15">Article 12</a> is for the purpose of application of the provisions

contained in Part-III. <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, which deals with

powers of the High Courts to issue certain writs, inter alia, stipulates that

every High Court has the power to issue directions, orders or writs to any

person or authority, including, in appropriate cases, any Government, for the

enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other

purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">             Provision of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_17">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, as per the definition

contained therein, the "State" includes the Government and Parliament of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          6</span>

India and the Government and legislature of each State as well as "all local or

other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the

Government of India". The word "other authority" in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India needs to be appreciated by this Court and the

tests/principles which are to be applied for ascertaining as to whether a

particular body can be treated as "other authority" or not is to be assessed, if

an authority violates the fundamental right or other legal rights of any person

or citizen, which has already been dealt with in the judgment referred

hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">9.             There is no confusion about the settled position of law that if

such an authority violates the fundamental right or other legal rights of any

person or citizen, as the case may be, a writ petition can be filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of the High

Court seeking appropriate direction, order or writ. However, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226</a>

of the Constitution of India, the power of the High Court is not limited to the

Government or authority which qualifies to be a "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_21">Article 12.</a>

Power is extended to issue directions, orders or writs "to any person or

authority".
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">               The expression "any person or authority" is to be taken in the

wider meaning as has been held in the case of Anadi Mukta Sadguru Shree

Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust vrs.

V.R. Rudani, (1989) 2 SCC 691, wherein dispute arose between the Trust

which was managing and running science college and teachers of the said

college. It pertained to payment of certain employment related benefits like

basic pay etc. The matter was referred for its decision before the Chancellor of

Gujarat University, who passed an order which has been accepted by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            7</span>

University as well as the State Government and a direction was issued to all

affiliated colleges to pay their teachers in terms of the said award. However,

the aforesaid Trust running the science college did not implement the award.

Teachers filed the writ petition seeking mandamus and direction to the Trust

to pay them their dues of salary, allowances, provident fund and gratuity in

accordance therewith. It is in this context an issue arose as to whether the

writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226</a> of the Constitution was maintainable against

the said Trust which is admittedly not a statutory body or „authority‟ under

<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_23">Article 12</a> of the Constitution as it was a private Trust running an educational

institution. The High Court held that the writ petition was maintainable and

the said view was upheld by this Court in the aforesaid judgment.


</p><p id="p_40">           In the aforesaid judgment, observation made by the Hon‟ble

Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment as contained in Paras 15 to 20, are

relevant for the present, as such the same are being reproduced herein

below:-
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             "15. If the rights are purely of a private character no mandamus can
             issue. If the management of the college is purely a private body with no
             public duty mandamus will not lie. These are two exceptions to
             mandamus. But once these are absent and when the party has no other
             equally convenient remedy, mandamus cannot be denied. It has to be
             appreciated that the appellant Trust was managing the affiliated college
             to which public money is paid as government aid. Public money paid as
             government aid plays a major role in the control, maintenance and
             working of educational institutions, The aided institutions like
             government institutions discharge public function by way of imparting

             the affiliating University. Their activities are closely supervised by the
             University authorities. Employment in such institutions, therefore, is not
             devoid of any public character. So are the service conditions of the
             academic staff are, therefore, not purely of a private character. It has
             super-added protection by University decisions creating a legal right-
             duty existence of this relationship, mandamus cannot be refused to the
             aggrieved party.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">             17. There, however, the prerogative writ of mandamus is confined only
             to public authorities to compel performance of public duty. The „public
             authority‟ for them means everybody which is created by statute-and
             whose powers and duties are defined by statute. So government
             departments, local authorities, police authorities, and statutory
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                              8</span>

             undertakings and corporations, are all „public authorities‟. But there is
             no such limitation for our High Courts to issue the writ „in the nature of
             mandamus‟. <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> confers wide powers on the High Court to
             issue writs in the nature of prerogative writs.       This     a   striking
             departure from the English law. Under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a>, writs can be
             issued to „any person or authority‟. It can be issued „for the enforcement
             of any of the fundamental rights and for any other purpose.‟

             relevant. What is relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on the body.
             The duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the
             persons or authority to the affected party. No matter by what means the

             denied."</blockquote><p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">               It is evident from the aforesaid judgment that Hon‟ble Supreme

Court has spelled out two exceptions to the writ of mandamus; (i) if the rights

are purely of a private character, no mandamus can issue; and (ii) if the

management of the college is purely a private body "with no public duty",

mandamus will not lie. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case has

clarified that since the Trust in the said case was an aiding institution, and

due to that reason, it discharges public function, like government institution,

by way of imparting education to students, more particularly when rules and

regulations of the affiliating university are applicable to such an institution,

being an aided institution. In such a situation, it has been held therein that

the service conditions of academic staff were not purely of a private character

as the staff had super-aided protection by university‟s decision creating a legal

right and duty relationship between the staff and the management.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                          9</span>

there is an interest created by the Government in an institution to impart

education, which is a fundamental right of the citizens, the teachers who

impart the education get an element of public interest in performance of their

duties. In such a situation, remedy provided under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> would be

available to the teachers. The aforesaid two cases pertain to educational

institutions and the function of imparting education.


</p><p id="p_45">             In the case of Binny Ltd. vrs. V. Sadasivan, (2005) 6 SCC 657,

the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has clarified that though writ can be issued

against any private body or person, the scope of mandamus is limited to

enforcement of public duty. It is the nature of duty performed by such

person/body which is the determinative factor as the Court is to enforce the

said duty and the identity of authority against whom the right is sought is not

relevant. Such duty can either be statutory or even otherwise, but, there has

to be public law element in the action of that body.

on Irrigation &amp; Drainage, (2015) 4 SCC 670, the International Commission

on Irrigation &amp; Drainage (in short ICID) since was not funded by the

Government nor was discharging any public duties any function under any

statute, as such the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has scrutinized the only question

therein as to whether it is discharging public duty or positive application of

public nature and the Hon‟ble Supreme Court agreeing and biased that it has

not discharged public duty which is not amenable under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                              10</span>

redressal of their grievance.

Federal Bank Ltd. (supra) is also need to be discussed herein since the same

has been relied upon by the Opposite Party - Bank. The factual aspect in that

case is that the Federal Bank being a private company carrying on banking

business as a schedule bank, can it be termed as an institution or company

carrying on any statutory or public duty.

<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">              The Hon‟ble Apex Court, by dealing with the constitution of the

Federal Bank and its control by the Reserve Bank of India, has been pleased

to hold by taking aid of the judgments rendered in the case Sukhdev Singh

Vrs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi reported in (1975) 1 SCC 421,

Ramana Dayaram Shetty Vrs. International Airport Authority of India

              maintainable against (i) the State Government; (ii) Authority; (iii) a

             amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.
             But in certain circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or
             persons as there may be statutes which need to be complied with by all
             concerned including the private companies. For example, there are
             certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_36">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_37">Minimum Wages
             Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_38">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper environment say Air

             <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_40">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes of the like nature which
             fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such private
             bodies which they are bound to comply with. If they violate such a
             statutory provision a writ would certainly be issued for compliance of
             those provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispense with the
             service of its employee in violation of the provisions contained under the
             <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_41">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable cases the High Court interfered
             and have issued the writ to the private bodies and the companies in that
             regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where there may not
             be any non-compliance of violation of any statutory provision by the

             remedies, as may be available, may have to be resorted to."</blockquote><p id="p_57">

</p><p id="p_58">             Thus it is evident that the Hon‟ble Apex Court in the aforesaid

judgment, has been pleased to laid down that the private companies like the

Federal bank, would normally not be amenable to the writ jurisdiction under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_42">Article 226</a> of the constitution of India, but in certain circumstances a writ

may issue to such private bodies or persons as there may be statutes which

need to be complied with by all concerned including the private companies, for

example, there are certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_43">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the

<a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_44">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_45">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper environment

say Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_46">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_47">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes of the like nature which

fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies

which they are bound to comply with. If they violate such a statutory

provision a writ would certainly be issued for compliance of those provisions.

For instance, if a private employer dispense with the service of its employee in

violation of the provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_48">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in

innumerable cases the High Court interfered and have issued the writ to the

private bodies and the companies in that regard, but the difficulty in issuing a

writ may arise where there may not be any non- compliance of violation of

any statutory provision by the private body. In that event a writ may not be

issued at all. Other remedies, as may be available, may have to be resorted to.

             government-aided schools. This is because the salary and allowances of

the observation made at paragraph 26 of the aforesaid judgment for the

reason that there it has been held that the writ can lie in case of non-

compliance or violation of any statutory provision by the private body but it is

not the case of the petitioners that there is violation of any statutory rule as

provided under any statutory provision, rather their cases are that there is

violation of principle of natural justice while from the pleading made in the

writ petitions, specifically from the enquiry report, it is evident that not only

the petitioners have given their defence reply but also cross-examined

witnesses, hence it is not understandable to the court as to how the finding of

principle of natural justice.

case of violation of principle of natural justice, rather the petitioners want to

assail the aforesaid orders on its merit.

lie since there is absence of any public element and further in view of the ratio

laid down by Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of Federal Bank Ltd.
