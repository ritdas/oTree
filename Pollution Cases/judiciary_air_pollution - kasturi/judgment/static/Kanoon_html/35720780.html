            the court to act according to its whim or caprice."</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">            The point in controversy in the present case is only to the

effect that whether the petitioner got     the Environment Clearance

Certificate before starting the work or thereafter.

</p><p id="p_11">            In the present case, notification was issued by the

Ministry of Environment and Forests dated 14.9.2006, whereby the

company was required to get the prior          Environment Clearance

Certificate before starting its business. Admittedly, the petitioner was

granted the clearance certificate by        the Government of India,

Ministry of Environment and Forests vide letter dated 17.10.2007

(Annexure P-7).

<p id="p_12">            A perusal of the complaint (Annexure P-1) reveals that its

contents are vague. It has not been mentioned in the complaint as to

when the work was started by the company and how the offence

under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_17">Section 15</a> of the Act was made out in the present case. The

complaint was filed against the petitioner and others on the allegation

that the petitioner had started new construction project without

obtaining any prior Environment Clearance Certificate from the

Ministry of Environment and Forests. The complaint has been filed in

October, 2008, whereas, the clearance certificate has been issued to

the petitioner    on 17.10.2007.        The petitioner    was granted

Environment Clearance Certificate by the Government of India,

Ministry of Environment and Forests vide letter dated 17.10.2007.

Thereafter, the petitioner was also granted 'Consent to Establish' by

the Haryana State Pollution Control Board vide letter dated

13.12.2007 (Annexure P-8).       The petitioner-company was already

having Environment Clearance Certificate and thus, could not be

criminally prosecuted on vague allegations levelled in the complaint.

Hence, the continuation of the criminal proceedings against the

petitioner would be nothing but an abuse of process of law.

</p><p id="p_13">           Accordingly, the present petition is allowed. Complaint

No.56 dated 6.11.2008 (Annexure P-1) under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_18">Section 15</a> of the Act,

as well as summoning order dated 11.11.2008 (Annexure P-5), and

all the subsequent proceedings arising therefrom, are quashed.
