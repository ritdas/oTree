      S.RAVINDRA BHAT, J. (ORAL)
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.    These Writ Petitions were heard together, with consent of the counsel

for the parties as they involved common questions of fact and law.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP (C) 7516, 7517 &amp; 7605/07                                          Page 1 of 13</span>
</p><p id="p_2"> 2.    All the petitioners claim to be aggrieved by the directions issued by the

Joint Commissioner of Industries acting on behalf of the Commissioner (the

2nd respondent and 3rd respondent, hereafter referred to collectively

as 'the Commissioner'), requiring them to furnish bank guarantees for

specified amounts.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">3.    Briefly the facts are that the petitioners are industrial units engaged in

manufacture.     In one case (WP (C) 7605/07), the petitioner is involved in

garment manufacture; in the other two cases, the petitioners deal in

automotive parts. All of them claim that the respondents are an "appropriate

authority" for the purpose of collecting apportionment cost of Common

Effluent Treatment Plant (hereafter referred to as „Plant‟). Their averments

are that a Common Effluent Treatment Plant Society was formed in 1996 to

achieve the objective of setting up of plants and their administration. The

Society sets up plants in various industrial areas and apportions costs from

its members. The petitioners contend that the measures taken by the

respondents are part of the cleaning up process of the environment including

cleaning effluents in the Yamuna River.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.     As a result, the National Capital Territory of Delhi enacted the Delhi

Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act, 2000 (hereafter „the Act‟) with the

object of recovering dues towards setting up of such plants in Industrial

estates.   The petitioners refer to various provisions of the Act concerning

setting up of an appropriate authority, its functions and the powers vested in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP (C) 7516, 7517 &amp; 7605/07                                           Page 2 of 13</span>
 it to issue orders and directions. They also refer to Rules framed in 2001

(hereafter   „the   Rules‟)   under   the   Act   prescribing   the   formula    for

apportionment of plants and their maintenance.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.    The petitioners complain that the costing method adopted by the

authority is never transparent and has been arbitrary. Thus the Society has

been charging Rs. 100/- per sq. mt. together with ad hoc amounts depending

on the size of the industrial unit. It is alleged that the petitioners have made

complete payment towards apportionment of costs and have also complied

with all further demands by the society. They advert to installation of effluent

treatment plants in view of their business activities.      They contend about

various inspections by the Commissioner from time to time; and that as and

when any deficiency in regard to maintenance of the plant was pointed out,

they were rectified. In the circumstances, they now impugn the order dated

27.9.07, which refers to a visit by a joint inspection team on 10.8.2007 to

their premises and further alleges that irregularities were noticed in regard

to the observance of parameters and norms for polluting industries. After

giving notice, to which the petitioners replied, the respondents directed them

to furnish bank guarantees for various sums.          In W.P. (C) 7605/07, the

amount of bank guarantee sought for is Rs. 5 lakhs; in W.P. (C) 7517/07 it is

Rs. 3 lakhs and in W.P. (C) 7516/07, it is Rs. 5 lakhs.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.    The petitioners contend that the directions to furnish bank guarantees

for specific amounts are without any legal authority and in any event based

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP (C) 7516, 7517 &amp; 7605/07                                              Page 3 of 13</span>
 on utterly vague premises. It is submitted that if there was violation of any

norms, they could have been visited with consequences spelt out under the

Act or under other laws such as, Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>; Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>; or the Hazardous Wastes

Act. The petitioners contend that the provisions of the Act do not empower

the CEPT Society or the respondents to issue vague or open-ended directions

of the kind impugned in this case. All that the respondents are empowered

to do in case of non-compliance with the provisions, is to levy penalty upon

the errant unit, after holding appropriate enquiry as is deemed necessary. It

is claimed that the power to issue directions has to be exercised reasonably

and not contrary to express provisions of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.    The respondents contend that the Act empowers the authorities to

seek information under <a href="/doc/74798551/" id="a_3">Section 8</a> of the Act; the authorities are also enabled

to enter and inspect the premises by virtue of <a href="/doc/106204869/" id="a_4">Section 9</a>.         <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_5">Section 16</a>

prescribes that the authority can give appropriate directions. It is contended

that these provisions are sufficient pointers to the respondents‟ amplitude of

powers, which extend to issuing directions to the concerned Unit, to furnish

bank guarantees.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">8.    It was contended during the hearing that the surveys conducted by the

Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) showed that many Units were

discharging effluents directly in to the conveyance system without pre-

treatment resulting in high Bio-Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WP (C) 7516, 7517 &amp; 7605/07                                         Page 4 of 13</span>
 Demand. This was also corroborated in the analysis report of the CETP Plant.

A joint inspection team visited the premises of various units. This inspection

and survey of 25 units disclosed that 17 of them were operating without

plant and the sludge they were supposed to maintain were missing. Those

plants were given show cause notices, replies to which were found

unsatisfactory.    On account of these facts, the impugned directions were

issued.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">9.    The above discussion would show that the controversy between the

parties pertains to the impugned directions issued by the respondents,

requiring the petitioners to furnish bank guarantees for various determined

amounts. The impugned orders are in identical format except so far as the

amounts are concerned.        One such order made in the case of petitioner in

W.P. 7605/07 is extracted below: -

empower the respondents to issue such directions; the respondents assert

that it does. It would, in the circumstances, be necessary to discuss some of

its provisions and also extract the relevant provisions of the Act. The Delhi

Common Effluent Treatment Plants Act was enacted in the year 2000. Its

avowed objects are to provide for recovery of dues - in respect of capital and

recurring cost of Common Effluent Treatment Plants set up in industrial

estates - as arrears of land revenue. <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_7">Section 2</a> (2) defines "appropriate

authority" as Commissioner of Industries or such other officer not below the

rank of Joint Director; <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_8">Section 2</a> (3) states that „CETP‟ means Common

Effluent Treatment Plant. By <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> an obligation is cast on the industrial

estates, either themselves or with one or more industrial estates in Delhi, to

constitute a registered CETP Society, duly approved by the appropriate

authority, to set up and operate a CETP Plant for the participating Units.

      provision, which confers a power should be construed in its own terms,

      enabling the authority the full range of options, which may naturally

      fall within it. (Asstt. <a href="/doc/6759/" id="a_25">Collector of Central Excise, Calcutta -vs- National

      Tobacco Co of India</a> AIR 1972 SC 2563; Jamaluddin Ahmad -vs-

      certain kind of power implies, in cases, exclusion of other powers. This

      rule also iterates that everything necessary to carry out the purposes

      of the grant can be done by the authority entrusted with the power

      (Ref. <a href="/doc/841465/" id="a_26">State of U.P. -vs- Poosu</a>, AIR 1976 SC 1750; <a href="/doc/925018/" id="a_27">State of Karnataka -

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">      15.    The petitioners‟ contention, though attractive that the power to

      issue directions cannot comprehend the issuance of directions to

      furnish guarantees, cannot be accepted. The power to issue directions,

      under <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_28">Section 16</a> extends to "regulate" the industry or unit. The

      expression "regulate" in the context, wherever used, has to be given

      the widest meaning. In a remedial or regulatory enactment, as the Act


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">WP (C) 7516, 7517 &amp; 7605/07                                           Page 11 of 13</span>
       undeniably is, this expression acts as a crucial power conferral on the

      authorities - the extent of such power is even closure of the industry or

      unit. Such being the case, the court cannot limit the options available

      to statutory authorities to meet emerging challenges, towards ensuring

      compliance with the provisions. In given cases, the Commissioner may

      not deem it appropriate to take the extreme step of closing down the

      unit; yet, to ensure that good practices are put in place, he may issue

      specific directions, and as a measure to ensure compliance, require

      furnishing of guarantee, valid for a period, or as to enable him to

      invoke it, to remedy the harm, which is sought to be addressed by the

      Act or rules framed under it. In arriving at this conclusion, the

      overriding nature of <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_29">Section 16</a>, which begins with a non obstante

      clause, cannot be lost sight of.

      The authorities, in these cases, though clothed with the power to direct

      the petitioners to furnish guarantees, have however, not shown how

      and why such action was necessary. The show cause notice issued in

      each case, is stereotypical; it does not reflect what are, according to

      the authorities, infraction of standards or directions, which had to be

      remedied by the units. Crucially, the show cause notices, preceding the

      impugned orders did not even mention about the possibility of

      issuance of orders requiring bank guarantees to be furnished. Again,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">WP (C) 7516, 7517 &amp; 7605/07                                         Page 12 of 13</span>
       similarly in the case of the impugned order, the list of matters to be

      done by unit(s) is general, not specific to the individual activity. Nor

      does it indicate application of mind to what exists on the site, and what

      is the standard required to be, but not complied. Although a meticulous

      and exacting standard cannot and should not be insisted by courts,

      while considering the validity of such orders, yet, the authority should

      point to some thinking vis-à-vis what exists at the unit, which requires

      remedying that in turn has to be conditioned by furnishing of a bank

      guarantee.

      allowed. The challenge, on the ground of lack of power of the

      respondents, must fail; however, the impugned orders cannot, for

      reasons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, be sustained. They are

      accordingly quashed. No costs.</blockquote><p id="p_20">
