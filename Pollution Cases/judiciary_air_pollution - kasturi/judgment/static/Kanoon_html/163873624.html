                  W.P.(C) No. 14393 of 2015

         Dated this the 29th day of September, 2015


                             O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The writ petitioner is in review.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   The petitioner filed the writ petition for

quashing Exts.P1 &amp; P6 in the writ petition and to declare

that Exts.P4 &amp; P7 are illegal and unsustainable and also

for issuing a writ of mandamus, directing the 3rd

respondent to dispose of the appeal filed by the petitioner

and others within a time frame and to stay Exts.P1 &amp; P6

till the appellate authority is appointed/constituted by the

Government.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   In the review petition, the petitioner alleges

that the judgment under review is the result of apparent

errors on the face of records and against the provisions of

law. It is also pointed out that the respondents in the writ

petition made a false statement in the counter affidavit

R.P. No. 657 of 2015

                             ..2..
</p>
<p id="p_4">that the appellate authority under the Air (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a> was constituted and the

petitioner has approached this Court as a short cut to see

that the unit of the 5th respondent is stopped.

</p><p id="p_5">      4.     The party respondent has filed a detailed

counter affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      5.     Arguments have been heard.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6.     In the counter affidavit filed by the party

respondent, it is contended that though it is true that the

higher appellate authority was not functioning at the time

of filing of the writ petition,the same has started

functioning recently; and therefore, there is no error in

relegating the petitioner to approach the higher appellate

authority to invoke the appellate remedy. The case of the

5th respondent is that M/s. Vijaya Metal Crusher, which is

the erstwhile owner of the unit of the 5th respondent, had

obtained necessary consent to establish the primary

crusher unit from the 1st respondent much prior to the

purchase of the unit by the party respondent herein. His

R.P. No. 657 of 2015

                            ..3..
</p>
<p id="p_8">definite case is that he had already started construction

of the unit in time; and the same was obstructed by the

petitioner and his family members, which resulted in

non-completion of the same in time. These facts were

brought to me at the time of hearing the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_9">      7.     It could be seen from Exts.R5(a) and R5(b)

judgments that the unit of the party respondent was

functioning from 1991 onwards without any interruption

and even the petitioner also does not have a case that the

said unit was not functioning from 1991. The learned

counsel for the petitioner relied on Annexures I and II

circulars to substantiate his case. However, as the said

unit was functioning from 1991 onwards, what is

applicable is Ext.R5(d) circular dated 05.09.2012 issued

by the 1st respondent, on the basis of which, the party

respondent is entitled to establish a primary crusher

without any distance criteria if the secondary crusher

unit is functioning from 14.07.2003.         The anxiety

expressed by the petitioner is that the production

R.P. No. 657 of 2015

                            ..4..
</p>
<p id="p_10">capacity of the unit could be increased by establishing the

primary crusher is out of place as the capacity of the

secondary crusher unit of the party respondent is only 25

HP. It is relevant to note that the local authority, which

issues D&amp;O licence, calculated the horse power of

ancillaries and the difference in the run capacity is shown

in the D&amp;O licence issued to the petitioner. The only

error in the impugned judgment is the observation that

the air appellate authority was functioning at the time of

the writ petition.    Apart from that, there is no error

apparent on the face of the record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Therefore, the review petition is disposed of deleting

para 9 of the impugned judgment. In all other respects,

the impugned judgment shall stand.
