                  appearing for the petitioner, Mr. Ashok Kr. Choudhary, learned

                  A.A.G.13 for the State and Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned

                  senior counsel for the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and

                  its authorities assisted by Ms. Binita Singh.

</p><p id="p_2">                           Let a copy of this writ petition be also served on Mr.

                  Rajendra Prasad who normally appears for the Mining

                  Department, by tomorrow.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                           The petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 12.1.2016

                  passed by the Chairman, Bihar State Pollution Control Board

                  (hereinafter referred to as 'the Board') whereby the petitioner

                  has been directed to stop the operation of its brick kiln situated

                  in the district of Madhubani inter alia on grounds that it was

                  operational without obtaining the 'consent to operate' from the

                  'Board' as well as without seeking 'Environmental Clearance'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.8665 of 2016 (2) dt.22-06-2016                              2</span>




              from the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority.

</p><p id="p_4">                        Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner has

              submitted that the 'Environmental Clearance' has since been

              granted by the authority concerned, to the petitioner as well as

              several other brick kilns as is manifest from the document dated

              11.4.2015 placed at Annexure-8 and the 'consent to establish'

              has been granted by the 'Board' vide order passed on

              17.12.2015 placed at Annexure-9 subject to obtaining 'consent

              to operate' under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

              of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act')

              within 6 months. He further with reference to Annexure-6 series

              submits that an application seeking 'consent to operate' under

              <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">section 21</a> of 'the Act' has been submitted by the petitioner on

              13.3.2016 in compliance of the directions given in the order

              granting 'consent to establish' present at Annexure-9 but which

              has remained pending with the respondent-Board. He admits to

              the position that the brick kiln is awaiting the permission of

              'consent to operate'.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                        Mr.     Shivendra        Kishore,   learned   senior   counsel

              representing the 'Board' in response to the argument advanced

              by Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted

              that even if the 'Environmental Clearance' has been given to the

              petitioner accompanied with the 'consent to establish', but until
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Patna High Court CWJC No.8665 of 2016 (2) dt.22-06-2016                            3</span>




              such time that the permission granting 'consent to operate' is

              granted to petitioner under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">section 21</a> of 'the Act', the brick kiln

              cannot be operated. He submits that the petitioner has operated

              the brick kiln without an order granting 'consent to operate',

              which is illegal warranting the order present at Annexure-2

              which is followed by the order of the District Magistrate, present

              at Annexure-1 dated 15.3.2016. He, however, admits that the

              Chairman of the 'Board' has since resigned and there has not

              been any fresh appointment to the said post which has delayed

              the disposal of the application filed by the petitioner for

              obtaining the 'consent to operate'.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                        Annexure-2 which is the order of the 'Board' puts a

              restraint on the operation of the brick kiln of the petitioner inter

              alia on three grounds set out above of which two grounds are

              misplaced since the petitioner has 'Environment Clearance' as

              well as the 'consent to establish' and has also filed a proper

              application for obtaining 'consent to operate' which remains

              pending with the respondent-Board. The laches are not on the

              part of the petitioner rather it is attributable to the absence of the

              authority concerned i.e. the Chairman of the 'Board' who is

              requires to dispose of such application. However since the legal

              prescriptions provided for operating the brick kiln are not

              satisfied, the restraint order issued by the 'Board' followed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">             Patna High Court CWJC No.8665 of 2016 (2) dt.22-06-2016                       4</span>




                          the order of District Magistrate, Madhubani present at

                          Annexures 1 and 2 would call for no interference at the present

                          stage.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                    Nonetheless, the application of the petitioner for

                          obtaining 'consent to operate' requires a disposal by the 'Board'

                          but in absence of the Chairman of the 'Board' it remains in a

                          limbo. The answer to the issue requires to be provided by the

                          State and this Court would require Mr. Choudhary, learned

                          AAG-13 representing the State to inform this Court as to within

                          the shortest possible time in which a Chairman would be

                          provided to the 'Board'.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                    On suggestion of Mr. Choudhary, learned Additional

                          Advocate General let the Chief Secretary and the Principal

                          Secretary concerned be added as respondent nos. 12 and 13

                          respectively during course of the day.
