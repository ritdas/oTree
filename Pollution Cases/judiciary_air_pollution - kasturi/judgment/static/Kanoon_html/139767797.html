The learned Tribunal, considering the inspection

down is that the power of writ jurisdiction available
to the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India is not taken away and in a
case where the State Arbitration Tribunal or
statutory appeal is found to have exercised
jurisdiction which is not available or acted in excess
of jurisdiction, the High Court can still exercise its
extraordinary jurisdiction.
