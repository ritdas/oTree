                               order, he is directed to abstain from a certain act, or to take

                               his management, disobeys such direction,

                               extend to one month or with fine which may extend to two

                               disobedience as likely to produce harm. It is sufficient that he

                               knows of the order which he disobeys, and that his

                               disobedience produces, or is likely to produce, harm.

           of the above, the Director Mines and Geology, Haryana, had, vide order

           dated 29.8.2012, cancelled the application of the petitioner for grant of

           licence also.
</p>
<p id="p_9">           5.                  On 21.1.2013, the checking staff of the Assistant Mining

           Engineers' Office submitted a report, that the petitioner has again started

           crushing activities, in violation of the Haryana Regulation and Control of

           Crushers Act, 1991. Thus the order of the Division Bench, dated 2.8.2012

           (Annexure P-2 with the petition), had been violated.

</p><p id="p_10">           6.                  Consequently, the complainant requested for registration of an

           FIR, upon which the police made out an offence under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_4">Section 188</a> of the

           IPC, as also, (without mentioning the specific provision) of the Haryana

           Regulations and Control of Crushers Act, 1991.

</p><p id="p_11">           7.                  Mr. Hemant Saini, learned counsel for the petitioner, on

           12.08.2013, had submitted that the same Division Bench, as had passed the

           order dated 2.8.2012 in CWP No.19634 of 2010, had also, while dismissing

           the petition filed by the petitioner (CWP No.18708 of 2012), on 20.09.2012,

           granted liberty to the petitioner to file an appeal against the order impugned

           in that petition. That order was the same one as was referred to in the FIR,

           "cancelling the application for grant of licence to the crusher". He had

           further submitted that the Appellate Authority {Appellate Authority under

           the water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, AIR (Prevention

</p>
<p id="p_12">                               The argument, therefore, was that when the unit itself had been

           allowed to run by a competent authority, there was no question of any

           disobedience to an order. However, Mr. Saini further submitted that an

           assurance had been given to the Division Bench, in CWP No.19634 of

           2010, on 31.1.2013, that despite the permission given by the Appellate

           Authority, the crusher would not function and, consequently, it was not

           functioning even now.
</p>
<p id="p_13">           8.                  He had further submitted that there was also no violation of any

           provision of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_7">Environment Protection Act</a> and that the Special

           Environment Court had specifically exonerated the proprietor of the

           petitioner-firm, of any violation of the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_8">Indian Forest Act</a>, vide its judgment

           dated 25.07.2012 (Annexure P-5).
</p>
<p id="p_14">           9.                  In view of the above contentions, not refuted by the State,

           coercive action against the petitioner had been stayed by this Court,

           pursuant to the FIR registered.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           10.                 At the time of final arguments, Mr. Saini had again reiterated

           the above, as also the contents of the pleadings which are, in essence, the

           same as what has been noted above and further state that, in any case, any

           violation of the High Court order dated 2.8.2012 was only on account of a

           misinterpretation /          misunderstanding, as the Appellate Authority had

           specifically allowed the petitioner to run its stone crusher, vide order dated

           17.10.2012. Thus, the running of the crusher could not be treated to be a

           violation of any order duly promulgated, so as to attract <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_9">Section 188</a> of the

           IPC.

           stated that, firstly, the petitioner was in violation of the order of the Division

           Bench and secondly, since there is no licence issued to the petitioner to run

           a stone crusher, he was in violation of statutory requirements and

           consequently, for both these reasons, the FIR was registered.

</p><p id="p_17">           12.                 It has also been stated that the licence was not issued because,

           as per the Haryana Regulation Control of Stone Crushers Rules 1992, a no

           objection certificate was required to be obtained by the petitioner from the

           Haryana State Pollution Control Board, which had not been so obtained.

           a normal way by the Police and filing of the challan, but the complaint has

           to be presented directly to the concerned Court".

</p><p id="p_24">           16.                 Thus, it is obvious that the complaint itself was made in a

           wrong forum (Police), which has been held to be debarred from taking

           cognizance of an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_17">Section 188</a> IPC. As such, the

           FIR is not maintainable and thus necessarily has to be quashed.

           of 2012 was filed by the petitioner and the other two stone crushers, taking

           shelter of the order of the Special Environment Court, Faridabad, dated

           25.7.2012, to say that they were not in violation of any <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_22">Environment Act</a>

           and, as such, could not have been refused a licence.

</p><p id="p_29">           20.                 As already stated earlier, that petition was dismissed with

           liberty        to avail of the remedy of appeal. The Appellate Court having

           specifically allowed the petitioner to run its stone crusher vide order dated

           17.10.2012, obviously the petitioner was not in disobedience of the order of

           a public servant, i.e. Director Mines &amp; Geology, so as to come within the

           purview of <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_23">Section 188</a> IPC.

           provision, on account of violation of the order of this Court dated

           12.08.2012?
</p>
<p id="p_31">           22.                 In my opinion that also cannot be so, for the same reason as has

           been noticed above. It is obvious that the Division Bench of this Court had

           allowed the petitioner to approach the Appellate Authority against the order

           passed subsequent to 2.8.2012, i.e. the order dated 29.8.2012 of the

           Director, Mines &amp; Geology, and the Appellate Authority had allowed the

           petitioner to run the unit. It was only on January 31, 2013, thereafter, that

           an assurance was given to the Division Bench, that despite the order of the

           Appellate Authority, the crusher would not run, which order, admittedly, is

           not being violated.

<p id="p_32">           23.                 Thus, <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_24">Section 188</a> IPC could not have been invoked against the

           petitioner, for alleged violation of the order of the Division Bench, dated

           2.8.2012, in the above given circumstances.

           obviously there is no violation thereof also, in view of the stay of that order,

           specifically, by the Appellate Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_34">           25.                 On the same analogy, there cannot be any violation of the

           provisions of the Haryana Regulation of Crushers Act, 1991, due to non-

           obtaining of a licence, at least between 17.10.2012 and 31.1.2013, as the

           order of the Appellate Authority, allowing the unit to run, remained in

           operation till an assurance was given before the Division Bench that, despite

           the said order, the unit would not run.

<p id="p_35">           26.                 In view of the above, this petition is allowed and FIR No.25

           punishable under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_25">Section 188</a> of the IPC and under the provisions of the

           Haryana Regulation and Control of Crushers Act, 1991, registered at Police

           Station Khaidki Daula, Tehsil and District Gurgaon, along with all

           consequential proceedings arising therefrom, is hereby quashed.

</p><p id="p_36">           27.                 However, allowing of the petition, even holding that on merits

           the petitioner is not in violation of the Haryana Regulation Control of

           Crushers Act, 1991 or <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_26">Section 188</a> IPC, will not be construed to mean that

           the petitioner can operate its crushing unit, either without proper licences

           and permissions as are required by any provisions of law, or in

           contravention of any judicial order.
</p>
<p id="p_37">                               The above observations are given in view of the fact that the

           running of the petitioners' unit after 2.8.2012, up-till 31.1.2013, was

           obviously only in view of the stay granted to it by the "Appellate Authority

           under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_27">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, Air

           (Prevention and Control of Pollution)Act, 1981 and Bio Medical Waste
