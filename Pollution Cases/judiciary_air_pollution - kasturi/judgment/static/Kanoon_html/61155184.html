            THIS WRIT APPEAL HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 01-02-2016, ALONG
WITH WA. 78/2016, THE COURT ON 02/3/2016 DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:



                      ASHOK BHUSHAN, C.J.                  "C.R."

<p id="p_1">Shaffique, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      These appeals have been filed challenging the judgment

dated 17/11/2015 in WP(C) No. 19503/2015. Writ Appeal

No.2760/15 is filed by the Ramapuram Grama Panchayat, the 1st

respondent in the writ petition and WA No. 78/2016 has been filed

by respondent Nos.2 to 4 in the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_3">      2.    The writ petition has been filed by the 1st respondent in

these appeals challenging Exts.P6 and P7 and for a direction to

the respondent Panchayat to grant licence in favour of the

petitioner's quarry. The parties are referred to as shown in the

writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.    The short facts involved in the writ petition would

disclose that the petitioner, a Private Limited Company, had

obtained quarrying lease from Government of Kerala for quarrying

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -:2:-</span>

granite building stones from a property having an extent of

4.1341 hectares which is situated in Ramapuram Grama

Panchayat. Petitioner obtained Environmental Clearance from the

State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (for short SEIAA)

as per proceedings dated 7/4/2013. Ext.P2 dated 26/9/2013 is

the quarrying lease by which permission has been granted for

quarrying for a period of twelve years commencing from

26/9/2013.    Petitioner obtained consent to operate from the

Pollution Control Board, permit from the Controller of Explosives,

District Medical Officer etc,.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.   However,     when   the   petitioner approached    the

Panchayat for licence in terms of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act,

1994 (hereinafter referred as the Act) and the Kerala Panchayat

Raj (Issue of Licence to Dangerous and Offensive Trades and

Factories) Rules (hereinafter referred as the D&amp;O Rules), their

application was rejected as per Ext.P6 order dated 14/3/2014.

The resolution passed by the Panchayat stating the reasons for

rejecting the permit is produced as Ext.P7.

</p><p id="p_6">      5.   Petitioner filed WP(C) No. 8123/2014 challenging the

rejection of permit by the Panchayat on the ground that the

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                -:3:-</span>

petitioner had obtained a deemed licence. The said claim was

rejected by this Court. However, petitioner was permitted to

challenge the validity of Ext.P6 order before the Tribunal for Local

Self Government Institutions. An appeal was filed, along with a

petition to condone delay, by claiming exclusion of the period

during which the writ petition was pending before this Court in

terms of <a href="/doc/409538/" id="a_1">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act. The Tribunal condoned

the delay. However, the said order came to be challenged by

certain persons in the locality by filing WP(C) No. 35078/2014.

This Court held that the Tribunal did not have the power to

condone the delay. Accordingly, the Tribunal's order was set

aside. Under these circumstances, this writ petition has been filed

inter alia contending that when the petitioner has all necessary

licence/permission from all competent authorities, there was no

reason for the Panchayat to have refused the licence on the very

same grounds on which the statutory authorities had granted

permission. The main contention urged by the petitioner was that

when environmental clearance was granted by the competent

authority, the question of environmental degradation could not

have been considered by the Panchayat. When the consent to

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 -:4:-</span>

operate had been issued by the Pollution Control Board, the

allegation of pollution cannot be taken up by the Panchayat. The

District Medical Officer has given a positive report in the matter

and therefore the health of the people in the locality will not be

affected by the grant of such licence. Therefore, all necessary

precautionary measures which are required to be enquired into by

the Panchayat have been made available and under such

circumstances, the reasons stated in Exts.P6 and P7 have no

relevance at all for rejecting the licence.

</p><p id="p_7">      6.   Counter affidavit has been filed by the Panchayat

supporting the stand taken by them.          It is stated that after

receiving the application, site inspection was conducted and a

report was prepared on 15/2/2014. It was found that necessary

documents like the No Objection Certificate issued by the District

Medical Officer and the Fire and Safety Certificate which are

necessary for considering such an application under Sec.233 of

the Act were not produced along with the documents submitted

by the petitioner.      Hence, letters were issued to the said

authorities. Certain clarification was also sought with reference to

the blaster licence. It is stated that subsequently the petitioner

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                -:5:-</span>

under cover of letter dated 19/2/2014 submitted the study report

of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF). The Panchayat

Committee considered the matter and decided to conduct a site

inspection.    Site inspection was conducted and a report was

prepared. In the report it was stated that though the petitioner

was not permitted to conduct quarrying operations in areas

having slopes of more than 45o in the land in question, in so far as

the slope is more than 70o, the clearance of MoEF was issued

without seeking opinion from the Panchayat and without

conducting any site inspection, but based on Google map. The

Panchayat Committee found that if quarrying operations are

permitted, it will pollute natural water sources, cause ecological

imbalance to the area which is prone to earth quake, land sliding

etc,. Therefore, it was decided not to grant permit or licence to

the petitioner in terms of Ext.P7 decision and the same was

communicated by letter dated 14/3/2014.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      7.   It is further contended that in so far as the judgment in

WP(C) No. 8123/14 has become final, it is not open for the

petitioner to reagitate or reopen the matters involved in or the

questions that had arisen for consideration. The Panchayat

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               -:6:-</span>

therefore supported the stand taken in the matter.

</p><p id="p_9">     8.    Respondents 2 to 4 were not originally parties to the

proceedings and they were impleaded in the case. They filed a

counter affidavit supporting the stand taken by the Panchayat.

According to them, the decision was taken by the Panchayat in

terms of Ext.P7 to secure the well being of the people in the area

and that apart, there is no mining plan which is mandatory in

terms of the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015. They

also contended that the writ petition is not maintainable in view of

the earlier judgment in WP(C) Nos. 8123/14 and 35078/14. The

learned Single Judge after considering the entire legal and factual

issues involved in the matter allowed the writ petition, quashed

Exts.P6 and P7 and the respondent Panchayat was directed to

reconsider the issue and grant licence on the basis of Ext.P1

environmental clearance and to issue formal orders granting

permit within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a

copy of the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     9.    Heard   learned    counsel     Sri.Philip T.   Varghese

appearing on behalf of the appellant Panchayat, Sri.Georgekutty

Mathew appearing on behalf of the appellants in WA No.78/2016

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  -:7:-</span>

and Sri.P.K.Suresh Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of the writ petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      10. The main contention urged on behalf of the appellants

is that when the Panchayat has taken a conscious decision to

reject the licence on various grounds, there was no reason for the

learned Single Judge to have overlooked the said reasons merely

for the reason that the petitioner had obtained all other

licence/permission from other statutory authorities. It is argued

that as per the Act, it is for the local authority to consider whether

an industrial unit can be permitted to operate in a particular

Panchayat. When the Sub committee of the Panchayat has after

conducting a site inspection formed an opinion that permitting

operation of the quarry will be disadvantageous to the people in

the locality and it will affect the water source in the locality, the

learned Single Judge should not have interfered with the said

findings made by the Panchayat Committee. That apart, the writ

petition is not maintainable on account of the fact that in an

earlier proceeding, the petitioner was relegated to challenge

Exts.P6 and P7 by preferring an appeal. Though the delay in filing

the appeal was condoned by the Tribunal, the appellate authority,

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 -:8:-</span>

the said order was set aside by this Court in WP(C) No. 35078/14.

It is contended that even in WP(C) No. 8123/14, the petitioner had

challenged Exts.P6 and P7. But, the learned Single Judge did not

consider the same and therefore when the said judgment had

become final, another writ petition for the same relief is not

maintainable. Hence, the writ petition is barred by the general

principle of res judicata. It was also argued that obtaining

environmental clearance was not at all a substitute for the

Panchayat to take a decision in the matter when the Panchayat is

given the right to issue permit for establishing a unit, the said

right cannot be taken away by another authority granting

permission for setting up the unit. The consideration made by the

Panchayat for permitting establishment of the unit under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_2">Section

233</a> of the Act is totally different from the manner in which issues

are considered by the other authorities. It is stated that pollution

and density of population are matters which are to be considered

by the Panchayat in terms of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_3">Section 233</a> of the Act and when a

decision is taken based on the materials made available, there

was no reason for the learned Single Judge to have interfered in

the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_12">W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               -:9:-</span>

</p><p id="p_13">      11. The learned counsel for the appellants also placed

reliance on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/83792141/" id="a_4">Gem

Granites v. Deputy Superintendent of Police</a> (2008 (1) KLT

</p><p id="p_14">937). That was a case in which the petitioner sought for police

protection to carry on quarry operations in his property for which

he obtained a quarrying lease.       It was contended by the

respondents that the petitioner did not have the statutory

licences/clearance under the relevant statutes and therefore he

cannot carry on the quarrying activity. The question that was

considered was whether a person who obtained permission under

the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules to extract granite is

entitled to operate the quarry without licence from the Grama

Panchayat under the provisions of the Panchayat Raj Act and the

Rules framed thereunder. After considering the said issue, it was

held that the provisions of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and the

Rules framed thereunder and the provisions of the Mines and

Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_5">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and the Rules

framed thereunder operate in different fields. It was therefore

held that permit/licence is required under the Panchayat Raj Act

notwithstanding the lease granted under the provision of the

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  -:10:-</span>

Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_6">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and

the Rules framed thereunder. Relevant portions in the judgment

read as under:

Panchayat also ascribed four reasons for rejecting the licence.

circumstances of the case, Panchayat was justified in refusing to

grant licence to the entrepreneur.

<p id="p_18">      13. The learned counsel also relied upon a Constitution

Bench judgment in <a href="/doc/557586/" id="a_10">Municipal Corporation, Ahmedabad v. Jan

Mohammed</a> (AIR 1986 SC 1205). The Supreme Court in that case

was considering whether closure of slaughter houses for seven

days in terms of the standing orders, amounts to an unreasonable

restriction on the fundamental right guaranteed to a beef dealer.

While considering the said issue, Supreme Court held at para 15

as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "15.    Before proceeding to deal with the points

           urged on behalf of the appellants it will be

           appropriate    to  refer  to   the   well-established

           principles in the construction of the constitutional

           provisions. When the validity of a law placing

           restriction on the exercise of a fundamental right in

           <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_11">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> is challenged, the onus of proving to

           'the satisfaction of the Court that the restriction is

           reasonable lies upon the State. If the law requires

           that an act which is inherently dangerous, noxious

           or injurious to the public interest, health or safety

           or is likely to prove a nuisance to the community

           shall be done under a permit or a licence of an

           executive authority, it is not per se unreasonable

           and no person may claim a licence or a permit to

          do that act as of right. Where the law providing for

          grant of a licence or permit confers a discretion

          upon an administrative authority regulated by rules

          or principles; express or implied, and exerciseable

          in consonance with the rules of natural justice, it

          will  be    presumed    to   impose   a  reasonable

          restriction. Where, however, power is entrusted to

          an administrative agency to grant or withhold a

          permit or licence in its uncontrolled discretion the

          law ex facie infringes the fundamental right under

          <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_12">Art. 19(1)(g).</a> Imposition of restriction on the

          exercise of a fundamental right may be in the form

          of control of prohibition. But when the exercise of a

          fundamental right is prohibited, the burden of

          proving that a total ban on the exercise of the right

          alone may ensure the maintenance of the interest

          of general public lies heavily upon the State. In this

          background of legal position the appellants have to

          establish    that  the    restriction put   on    the

          fundamental right of the respondents to carry on

          their trade or business in beef was a reasonable

          one. The Court must in considering the validity of

          the impugned law imposing prohibition on the

          carrying on of a business or a profession attempt

          an evaluation of its direct and immediate impact

          upon the fundamental rights of the citizens

          affected thereby and the larger public interest

          sought to be ensured in the light of the object

          sought to be achieved, the necessity to restrict the

          citizen's freedom, the inherent pernicious nature of

          Tax Officer and Others reported in 12 STC 272,

          which held that "although, as far as the appellate

          authority   is  concerned    under  the   Tamilnadu

          General Sales Tax Act, 1959, its jurisdiction and

          power to condone delay is limited to a period of 30

          respect, we are unable to persuade ourselves to

appellant to invoke power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a> and bypass statutory

</p><p id="p_25">       15. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the

writ petitioner submitted that the learned Single Judge was

justified in setting aside Exts.P6 and P7 and sufficient reasons

have been stated by the learned Single Judge in invoking the

jurisdiction of the Court.       When the learned Single Judge has

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                 -:18:-</span>

exercised the jurisdiction and had set aside Exts.P6 and P7, in the

absence of any perversity or illegality in the judgment, there is no

reason for this Court to exercise the appellate jurisdiction. It is

also contended that the appellants have in fact challenged the

decision of the Panchayat in WP(C) No. 8123/2014. However, the

learned Single Judge who considered the matter did not consider

the contentions on merit, whereas only the question relating to

the petitioner's claim for deemed licence has been considered.

The petitioner was therefore given liberty to challenge the

impugned decision by approaching the statutory appellate

authority. It is contended that there was no decision on merits as

far as the challenge to Exts.P6 and P7 were concerned. Though

the Tribunal allowed the application to condone delay, in another

judgment of this Court in WP(C) No. 35078/2014, this Court had

set aside the said order by forming an opinion that the Tribunal

has no power to condone delay. It is therefore contended that

there could not be a situation where the person is without any

remedy at all and therefore, only a Constitutional Court can

interfere in the matter. It is argued that this case has no similarly

to the judgment in Krishna Poduval (supra) as that was a case

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

relating to a separate set of facts where a penalty had been

imposed for non payment of service tax. In this case, the Court

was concerned with rejection of an application for permit/licence

and not with reference to any imposition of service tax/penalty.

The petitioner had obtained quarrying permission for quarrying

lease for a period of twelve years from 26th September, 2013. A

decision of this Court with reference to a fiscal statute, where

there is an adjudication of rights, cannot be made applicable to

the fact situation. The learned Single Judge was therefore right in

relying upon the judgment in         <a href="/doc/1463985/" id="a_25">Chandi Prasad v. Jagdish

Prasad</a> (2004 (3) KLT 654) and <a href="/doc/1165118/" id="a_26">State of Kerala v.

Kondottyparambanmoosa</a> [2008 (3) KLT 730 (SC)]. It is further

argued that the question of res judicata does not apply in so far

as the issues raised by the petitioner was not decided on merits.

This question was considered by the learned Single Judge by

relying upon <a href="/doc/1925707/" id="a_27">Paul Industries (India) v. Union of India &amp;

Others</a> [(2004) 13 SCC 340], <a href="/doc/525629/" id="a_28">Mool Shankar Singh v. Regional

</p><p id="p_29">      18. WP(C) No. 8123/2014 was filed by the petitioner

challenging Exts.P6 and P7. The contention urged was that the

petitioner has a deemed permit to establish the unit. Ext.P17 in

the said case is Ext.P6 in the present writ petition, by which the

Secretary of the Panchayat had informed the petitioner that

permit cannot be granted and that his application is rejected. The

petitioner challenged Ext.P17 on the ground that it is a futile

order. The judgment in WP(C)No. 8123/2014 is Ext.P8 wherein the

learned Single Judge, in fact did not consider the validity or

otherwise of Ext.P17. The only question considered was whether

the petitioner has a deemed licence or not. Having found that the

claim for deemed licence was not justified, it is held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                 "Under the above mentioned circumstances,

           the writ petition deserves no merit. However, liberty

           of the petitioner is reserved to challenge the

           impugned decision by approaching the statutory

           appellate authority. The writ petition is dismissed

           reserving such liberty."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">Therefore, it is clear that this Court did not consider the validity of

Ext.P17 decision of the Panchayat. Hence, the proceedings in WP

(C) No. 8123/2014 cannot be treated as a judgment on merits by

which the present writ petition can be rejected on the principle of

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

res judicata.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      19. Coming to the next question, the facts disclose that the

Tribunal had allowed IA No. 2503/2014 in Appeal No.798/2014

which was a petition to condone delay seeking exclusion of 12

days from the period of limitation. The same came to be

challenged before this Court by filing WP(C) No.35078/2014 by

the respondents 2 to 4 in the present writ petition. The learned

Single Judge in that case did not consider the claim of the

petitioners on merits. However, it was found that the Tribunal had

no jurisdiction to condone the delay. It was held at para 58 as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           "58.   All through the conduct of the second

           respondent cannot be termed as blameworthy, or

           remiss in any sense. He has, indeed, prosecuted his

           case   with   due    diligence,   albeit  before   a

           constitutional court, when he has an efficacious

           alternative remedy. On that ground alone has he

           been non-suited. He was, in fact, given liberty to

           approach the appellate forum. The fact, however,

           remains that this Court's direction in WP(C) No.8123

           of 2014 of granting liberty, does not, to me, appear

           to have the potential of nullifying a statutory

            deprived    of  ordinary   remedies,   statutory  or

            otherwise,    against    Ext.P6   order.   In    the

            circumstances,     the  petitioner has    no   other

            challenge of Exhibit P6 order and the decision

            statutory remedy does not mean that the petitioner

            has lost his constitutional remedies. Ext.P6 order is

            therefore amenable to judicial review by this

            Hon'ble Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

            of India on the following among other:-"</blockquote><p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">      21. The learned Single Judge considered the matter in

great detail. In Thomas Thomas (supra), in fact this Court was

considering an almost similar issue. That was a case in which

petitioners filed an application for building permit at a stage when

they were issued with notices for demolition of the structure. They

filed appeal before the Tribunal for Local Self Government

Institution challenging the notice of demolition. As per directions

of the Tribunal, again an order was passed by the Municipality

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                -:24:-</span>

which was again challenged in appeal before the Tribunal. Again

the matter was remitted back and again the Municipality passed

an order to demolish the structure. The petitioner submitted a

representation to the Municipality to recall the order of demolition

which was not considered. The petitioner preferred a writ petition

before this Court which was disposed holding that his remedy is

to prefer an appeal before the Tribunal. Petitioner therefore

preferred an appeal before the Tribunal with an application to

condone delay which came to be rejected on the ground of delay.

It is seeking to quash the said order that the present writ petition

was filed. The learned Single Judge placing reliance on Krishna

Poduval (supra), which was followed in Krishnan T and Others

v. State of Kerala (ILR 2007 (1) KER 233), held that the writ

petition has to be dismissed. But in this case, the learned single

Judge found that the petitioner was seeking to enforce his

fundamental right to carry on business as provided under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_36">Article

19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India. Petitioner's contention is that

the rejection of the permit/licence was not on account of any valid

reason which would have come to the aid of the Panchayat in

terms of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_37">Section 233</a>, whereas they have virtually entrenched into

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                -:25:-</span>

the area which are to be considered by other competent

authorities and had rejected the application. Therefore, this is a

case where the petitioner was not challenging the rejection of

licence on factual material but taking a contention that the

Panchayat has rejected the licence based on matters extraneous

for consideration by the Panchayat and therefore, it violates

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_38">Art.19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India. Viewed in that manner,

and as rightly held by the learned Single Judge placing reliance on

the judgment in Olga Tellis (supra), there was justification in

entertaining the writ petition. The petitioner has taken a specific

ground in the writ petition, clearly indicating the manner in which

the Panchayat has rejected the licence, ignoring the expert

opinion given by the competent authorities. The learned Single

Judge therefore having found that this is an extra ordinary

circumstance which requires consideration by a Constitutional

Court, we do not think that a different view is to be taken in the

matter and therefore, we are of the view that the writ petition was

rightly entertained by the learned Single Judge and cannot be

dismissed merely for the reason that the appeal was dismissed on

the ground of delay. In fact, each case will have to be decided on

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                               -:26:-</span>

its own facts. Thomas Thomas (supra) was decided on its own

facts. It is trite that power of Constitutional Court cannot be

denuded merely for the reason that, alternate remedy could not

be availed by the suitor.
</p>
<p id="p_36">     22. This question has been considered in another Division

Bench judgment in <a href="/doc/252798/" id="a_39">Panopharam v. Union of India</a> (2010 (3)

KLT 149), wherein this Court had occasion to consider the

question whether a party, whose remedy by way of an appeal

under the Statute is barred by limitation, can invoke the

extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">Article 226.</a> That was a case in

which the petitioner was imposed with penalty under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_41">Section 78</a>

of the Finance Act, 1994. The petitioner could not file an appeal

within the prescribed period of three months or within the period

for which the authority has power to condone delay. The Division

Bench after considering the law laid down in Krishna Poduval

(supra) and various other judgments on the point, laid down the

proposition that though a party whose remedy by way of appeal

under the statute is barred by the period prescribed thereunder,

which by itself is not a reason to invoke the extraordinary

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_42">Art.226</a> of the Constitution of India, if the writ

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    -:27:-</span>

petition raises issues on which ordinarily relief could not be given

by the statutory authority, the writ petition is maintainable. It is

held that the question would be whether there exists such

circumstances warranting interference in a writ petition either

because the statutory remedy is effective or there is violation of

the principles of natural justice or when there is an infringement

of the fundamental right. In such situations, it is held that the

remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_43">Art.226</a> is not ousted. Para 23 is relevant, which

reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">           "23. When we read the entire judgment, we have

           no doubt in our mind that the principles stated in

           the said decisions is in conformity with the earlier

           decisions of this Court as also that of the Supreme

           Court referred to therein. That a party whose

           remedy by way of an appeal under the statute is

           barred by the period prescribed thereunder is no

           reason by itself to invoke the extraordinary

           jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">Art.226</a> of the Constitution of

           India. If the Writ Petition raises issues on which

           ordinarily relief could not be given by that statutory

           authority then the fact that a Writ Petition is filed

           beyond the period prescribed under the statute is

           not liable to be dismissed on that ground. In other

           words, he will be similarly placed with the person

           who invoke the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Art.226</a> even where

           the period of limitation as prescribed under the

           statute is not over. So, the question is whether

           there    exists  such    circumstances    warranting

           interference in a Writ Petition, either because a

           statutory remedy is not effective or because there

           is a violation of the statute or principles of natural

           justice or when there is an infringement of the

           fundamental right. In such situation, it cannot be

           said that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_46">Art.226</a> remedy is ousted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">In the said case, of course, the Division Bench did not interfere in

the matter on a finding that the claim made could have been

adjudicated by the appellate authority. As already held by the

learned Single Judge, in this case, the petitioner seeks

enforcement of his fundamental right to carry on business which

cannot be denied on account of the reasons stated in the

impugned order. That apart, it is evident that none of the reasons

stated in Ext.P7 have been sought to be explained by the

petitioner. In such circumstances also, exercise of jurisdiction by

the learned Single Judge is justified.
</p>
<p id="p_38">      23. Now coming to the factual issue involved in the matter,

the question is whether Exts.P6 and P7 warrant interference. In

fact, the learned Single Judge only observed that all the reasons

stated by the Panchayat was in regard to the environmental

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                  -:29:-</span>

issues which is already covered by the environmental clearance

granted in favour of the petitioner. Perusal of Exts.P6 and P7

would be relevant to consider whether the Panchayat had

exceeded its powers or not. Ext.P6 is a communication by which

the Secretary had informed the petitioner regarding the rejection

of the permit. Ext.P7 is the decision of the Grama Panchayat. In

fact, they have stated 20 reasons. It is useful to extract the said

resolution of the Panchayat. The English translation as provided

in the writ appeal reads as under:

Department of Environment and Climate Change though it is

referred to as MoEF. Reasons 1 to 4 relate to the environmental

clearance granted by the State Environment Impact Assessment

any competent authority has been relied upon by the Panchayat

Apparently, Panchayat Sub Committee was not constituted with

expert bodies nor have they taken the assistance of any experts

Secretary has to enquire and report to the Village Panchayat as to

whether the establishment of the factory, workshop or workplace

or other installation of machinery or manufacturing plant is

objectionable by reason of density of population in the

neighbourhood and the possibility to cause nuisance or pollution.

The report has to be submitted to the Village Panchayat. The

Village Panchayat will have to consider the report of the Secretary

and such other authorities as specified under sub section (4). Sub

section (4) of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_55">Section 233</a> indicates that the Village Panchayat

shall obtain and consider a report of the Inspector of Factories or

of an officer of the Industries Department if it comes within the

produces a declaration recommended by an officer of the

Industries Department or Kerala State Pollution Control Board to

the effect that such industry would not cause pollution. In terms

of Sub section (5), the grant of permission will be subject to such

restrictions and conditions as may be prescribed.

</p><p id="p_80">      25. It is pertinent to note that as far as <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_57">Section 233(4)</a> is

concerned,    the   petitioner  himself   has   produced     various

documents which includes consent to operate from the Kerala

State Pollution Control Board. The consent is granted on certain

conditions, as per the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_58">AIR (Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981 as well. The consent was valid till 31/12/2015. The very

fact that the consent has been issued under AIR (Prevention and

Control of Pollution), Act, 1981 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_59">Environment Protection Act</a>,

1986, by itself indicate that the allegation of the Unit causing

pollution is baseless. First of all, unless the Unit is established

and functioning, it may not be possible for the Panchayat to come

to a conclusion that the Unit causes pollution. If after establishing

the Unit, any pollution is caused, it is always open for the

Panchayat or the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, as the case

may be, to take appropriate preventive measures or even revoke

or suspend the licence if there is non compliance of the statutory

provisions. Further, if any nuisance is caused, by reason of noise,

vibration effluent discharge, smoke or dust, <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_60">Section 233A</a>

provides for sufficient precautionary measures that could be

taken by the Panchayat in that regard. <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_61">Section 233A</a> reads as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">           "233A:Abatement of nuisance caused by

           factory, workshop etc.-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">           (1) Where any factory, workshop, workplace or

            the person concerned takes necessary step to the

            satisfaction of the Secretary for the abatement of

            the nuisance."
</p>
<p id="p_83">Further, the report of the Medical Officer produced as Ext.P5

dated 24/4/2014 clearly indicates that the property is lying in a

slanting position and there are no buildings or religious

institutions or Government Offices within a distance of 300

metres. It is also opined that there is no cause for any nuisance to

the public, provided, the Unit functions in terms with the

specifications stipulated by the District Medical Officer. The very

fact that the Panchayat is called upon to consider the report of

the Secretary as well as the authorities specified in sub section (4)

of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_62">Section 233</a>, is to enable the Panchayat to arrive at a proper

decision. When all the authorities had confirmed that the Unit will

not cause any environmental problems and that there would not

be any pollution or nuisance to the people at large, provided it

functions as per the conditions and restrictions imposed by the

said authorities, the question is whether in the absence of any

other material available with the Panchayat, it could reject a valid

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                 -:42:-</span>

application. In fact, in the present case, there is no material to

indicate that the rejection has been made on account of the fact

that it is objectionable by reason of density of population in the

neighbourhood and the possibility to cause nuisance or pollution

as provided under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_63">Section 233</a> of the Act. If there has to be a

finding that it is objectionable on account of density of population

in the neighbourhood, the District Medical Officer ought to have

taken such a view. That apart, no such material is relied upon by

the Panchayat. A perusal of Ext.P6 refers to a report of the

Panchayat Secretary and also an enquiry by the Committee

directly. It is stated in Ext.P6 that if the permit is granted to the

petitioner, it will cause harm to the life and property of the people

in the locality and affect the environment as such. As already

indicated, this is an instance where the petitioner had obtained an

environmental       clearance  from    the   appropriate    authority.

Therefore, the same can never be a reason for denial of permit.

An expert body like the SEIAA had vide their proceedings dated

7/4/2013 granted clearance on certain conditions.         If there is

failure to comply with the said conditions, it is a different issue

which can be taken up by the Panchayat at a later stage after

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                               -:43:-</span>

establishment of the Unit and when it is found that there is non

compliance of the conditions imposed therein. But the finding that

SEIAA had not properly evaluated the grant of environmental

clearance is not a good reason for rejection of a licence. It is

relevant to note that it is by virtue of judgment of the Supreme

Court in Deepak Kumar v State of Haryana [(2012) 4 SCC

629] that environmental clearance was insisted for quarrying of

minor minerals having an area of less than 5 hectares. When a

competent authority like the SEIAA having considered and

granted environmental clearance in terms of the judgment of the

Supreme Court and permitted mining activities enumerating

about 22 conditions, there was no reason for interfering with the

discretion exercised by the said authority by rejecting the

application for the very same reason for which environmental

clearance had been granted. Same is the situation with reference

to the expert opinion given by the Pollution Control Board, District

Medical Officer and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and

Petroleum Explosives Safety Organization. All these authorities

are concerned with the grant of licence/permission and they have

stipulated various conditions. In such a situation, the question is

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                               -:44:-</span>

whether the Panchayat can take a different view from what has

been stated by the competent authorities. <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_64">In Act</a>ion Council

(supra), the Supreme Court had set aside the judgment of a

Division Bench of this Court reported in <a href="/doc/1314958/" id="a_65">Action Council v.

Benny Abraham</a> (2001 (2) KLT 690). Supreme Court felt that

four conditions ascribed by the Panchayat need not be interfered

with. A perusal of para 11 of the Division Bench judgment of this

Court would indicate that the main reason stated for rejecting the

application for permit is that there was scarcity of water in the

area and therefore it will not be possible to use sprinkler as

directed by the Pollution Control Board during summer season

and the agricultural properties might be adversely affected and it

would include the members belonging to scheduled caste around

the locality and there was a road around 100 metre of the

premises. It is therefore clear that Action Council (supra) was

decided on its own facts which is also clear from the judgment of

the Supreme Court and cannot be treated as a binding precedent

to form an opinion that in all cases such a view is to be taken.

That apart, this is an instance where, in addition to the

permission/licence obtained from various statutory authorities,

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                 -:45:-</span>

environmental clearance also has been obtained wherein the

competent authority viz., SEIAA has clearly imposed general

conditions as to how the quarrying operation has to be carried out

and the precautionary measures that are to be taken in the

matter.    In Gem Granites (supra), the issue was whether

permission from the Panchayat was required for the purpose of

functioning quarrying unit having licence under the Minor Mineral

Concession    Rules.    Such   a   question does   not   arise  for

consideration in the present appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_84">     26. What is to be considered is whether the licence can be

rejected on the ground of reasons 5 to 8, 18 and 19. It is relevant

to note that the mining lease has been granted with reference to

a property which does not either belong to the Government or the

Panchayat. It is a private land and the owner or holder of the land

is entitled to utilize the land in accordance with his wish and of

course subject to reasonable restrictions. Being a private

property, Panchayat cannot take a view that they have a right to

prevent any activity in the property for public purposes. A

permit/licence can be rejected only if there is possibility for

pollution and if it affects the neighbourhood in any manner due

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                               -:46:-</span>

to density of population. No such contingency is highlighted, nor

has any material been relied upon to form such an opinion.

Learned counsel for the Panchayat submits that quarrying licence

has been given to four other institutions in the very same

Panchayat. Therefore, it is clear that this Panchayat is not averse

to quarrying operations in the Panchayat area. Learned counsel

for the petitioner however argued that there are even unlicenced

quarries functioning within the Panchayat area. We do not

propose to go into such details in the present case.

</p><p id="p_85">      27. The question is whether the decision taken by the

Panchayat in terms of Exts.P6 and P7 is in accordance with the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_66">Section 233</a> read with <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_67">Section 232</a> of the Act so that

it infringes the right of the petitioner to carry on business of

quarrying in terms of <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_68">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_86">      28. As already indicated, under the present scenario,

substantial provisions had been made to prevent quarrying

activities without environmental clearance and mining plan in

terms of the Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015. As on date

when the quarrying permit was granted and when the

environmental clearance and other reports were obtained by the

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                -:47:-</span>

petitioner, there was no requirement for a mining plan. The Minor

Mineral Concession Rules, 2015 had come into effect only on

7/2/2015. Under Rule 66, the mining plan can be submitted within

one year from the commencement of Rules which period can be

further extended for a period of one year. Thus, there is still time

for the petitioner to submit the mining plan and on that ground,

rejection cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_87">      29. Now that substantial provisions are made for ensuring

that the mining activity is being done in an environmental friendly

manner, it is not open for the Panchayat to take a different view

from what has been stated by the expert authorities. In the light

of such an expert view, we do not think that the reasons stated by

the Panchayat were justified nor can it be said that the Panchayat

has obtained other expert opinion for denying permission on such

grounds. Even in Ext.P7, ultimately the decision was to request

the Environment Ministry to reconsider the action of issuing

clearance without inspection, study or knowledge of the

Panchayat. Therefore, it is rather clear that the main reason for

denial of permission was on account of environmental issues

which according to us has already been taken care of by the grant

W.A. Nos.2760/15 &amp; 78/16

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                  -:48:-</span>

of environment clearance by the competent authority viz., SEIAA.

</p><p id="p_88">     30. Under such circumstances, though these issues are not

considered by the learned Single Judge, even on a consideration

of such material, we are of the view that the learned Single Judge

has exercised the discretion in accordance with law and there is

no reason to interfere with the said judgment in exercise of

appellate jurisdiction.

<p id="p_89">     Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed.
