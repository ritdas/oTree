     2017 corresponding to G.R. No.3239 of 2017 instituted under Sections 4/54 of
     Jharkhand Minor Mineral Concession Rules, Section 3/8 of J.M.R.D. Rule and
     <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of Air Pollution Act, 1981, the petitioner has moved this Court for
     grant of privileges of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_6">            Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and learned Addl.P.P.
     appearing for the State.
</p><p id="p_7">            Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the allegation
     against the petitioner is that he has stacked illegally excavated stone chips. It is
     submitted that the allegations against the petitioner are all false and that the
     land over which the illegally excavated stone chips were kept, does not belong
     to the petitioner and the petitioner has been implicated in this case only on the
     basis of statement of some anonymous villagers. Drawing attention of this Court
     to para-10 of the instant anticipatory bail application, learned counsel for the
     petitioner submits that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent. It is lastly
     submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to co-operate with the
     investigation of the case and to furnish sufficient security including cash
     security. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privileges of
     anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_8">            Learned Addl.P.P appearing for the State opposes the prayer for
     anticipatory bail of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_9">            Considering the submissions of learned counsels and the facts and
     circumstances stated above, I am inclined to grant privileges of anticipatory bail
     to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to surrender in the Court
     of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribagh within four weeks from
     today and in the event of his arrest or surrendering, he will be enlarged on bail
        on depositing Rs.2,000/-(Rupees two thousand) as cash security and on
       furnishing bail bond of Rs.25,000/- (Twenty five thousand) with two sureties of
       the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class,
       Hazaribagh in connection with Barhi P.S. Case No.311 of 2017 corresponding to
       G.R. No.3239 of 2017 with the condition that he will co-operate with the
       investigation of the case and appear before the investigating officer as and
       when noticed by him and furnish his mobile number and photocopy of the
       Aadhar Card with an undertaking that he will not change his mobile number
       during the pendency of the case and subject to the conditions as laid down
       under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Section 438(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
