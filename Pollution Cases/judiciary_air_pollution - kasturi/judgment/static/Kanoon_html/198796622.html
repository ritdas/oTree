S. N. Prasad, J.          In all these batch of writ petitions the issue regarding jurisdiction of

             National Green Tribunal and the Machineries to control the pollution under

             the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment Act</a> is under challenge, as such all the writ petitions have been

             decided to be heard together and accordingly heard together and the same are

             being disposed of by this common order.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">             2.           In these batch of writ petitions there are two sets of writ petitions - in

             the first set of writ petitions the order passed by the National Green Tribunal as

             well as the show cause notice issued by the Pollution Control Board are under

             challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">                          In the second set of writ petitions the order of closure of units as well

             as the order of the National Green Tribunal, basis upon which the units of the

             petitioners have been closed, are under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">             3.           The fact of the cases are that the petitioners are exclusive privilege

             (licence) holders of main out still liquor shop, licence for the manufacture and sale

             by retailer of the country spirit in a shop on the out still system since 2005-06 and

             are carrying on their business as per the licence granted by the State Authorities

             under the State Excise Laws. While the petitioners were running their out still

             shops, the Collector of the concerned district has issued an order on 12.5.2017

             directing closure of the out still liquor shops pursuant to the order dtd.24.4.2017

             passed by the National Green Tribunal, Eastern Zone, Kolkata in O.A.

             No.19/2017/EZ holding that no liquor manufacture units, be it country or

             otherwise, shall be permitted to operate without environment clearance.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          5</span>


             According to the petitioners they have duly been issued with the valid

licences by the competent authorities under the State        Laws   and    without

examining the issue as to whether the out still shops are coming under the zone of

either National Green Tribunal or the Environmental Laws, the orders have been

passed and consequent upon the same the out still shops have been closed by the

competent authority by passing an order in this regard.


</p><p id="p_16">             Learned counsel, representing the petitioners, have demonstrated

that on the basis of their process of manufacturing and the quantum of

manufacturing, they cannot be dragged under the purview of the jurisdiction of

National Green Tribunal or the Environmental Laws, the Tribunal, without

appreciating this aspect of the matter, has passed an order and thereafter the

competent licencing authority has issued closure notice of the units. Hence the

arbitrary action has been taken by the authorities putting their interest in

jeopardize without considering the fact that they are valid licence holders, issued

by the competent department under the State Excise Laws of the State of Odisha.


</p><p id="p_17">             Learned counsel has drew attention of this court that in view of the

notification dtd.14th September, 2006 they are not coming under the list of

projects or activities requiring prior environmental clearance as would be evident

from reference of the distilleries provided under clause 5(g) wherein all molasses

based distilleries or all Cane Juice / non-molasses distillery whose production

capacity is greater than 30 kilo-liter per day or all cane juice / non-molasses

based distilleries whose production capacity is less than 30 kilo liter per day

(KLD).

</p><p id="p_19">              According to them, since they are not coming under the parameter of

the notification dtd.14th September, 2006, hence the        order   passed    by   the

National Green Tribunal or the concerned Collector is without jurisdiction.


</p><p id="p_20">4.            The second set of writ petitioners have put forth their grievance that

on the basis of the order passed by the National Green Tribunal, wherein they

were not made parties, the closure order has been passed and basis upon which

the out still shops have been closed, which is absolutely arbitrary and

unreasonable decision of the authority since they have not been provided to put

forth their defence.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">              They submit that they even have filed applications before the

Tribunal for recall of the order passed by it, but that has also been refused to be

entertained, hence the order has been passed closing their out still shops, which is

not proper.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">5.            This court has issued notice upon the State as well as the Pollution

Control Board, pursuant thereto the Pollution Control Board has appeared

through its counsel and filed detailed counter affidavit.


</p><p id="p_25">              The State has also been represented by the learned Additional

Government Advocate who has also filed counter affidavit.


</p><p id="p_26">              The stand of the State Pollution Control Board is that these writ

petitions are not maintainable before this court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India since there is a provision of appeal under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_3">Section 22</a> of

these writ petitions should not have been entertained by this court.

Judges Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.P. Sampath Kumar Vrs.

Union of India and Others, reported in (1987) 1 SCC 124 has observed that

though judicial review is a basic and essential feature of the Constitution and it

cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic structure of the Constitution, but

if any constitutional amendment made by Parliament takes away from the High

Court the power of judicial review in any particular area and vests it in any other

institutional mechanism or authority, it would not be violative of the basic

structure of doctrine, so long as the essential condition is fulfilled, namely, that

the alternative institutional mechanism or authority set up by the parliamentary

amendment is no less effective than the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_97">
</p><p id="p_98">             The Hon'ble Apex Court has again considered the ratio laid down by

it in the case of Sampath Kumar (supra) by referring the matter before the 7

Judges Bench in the case of L. Chanra Kumar Vrs. Union of India, reported in

(1997) 3 SCC 261 by taking contrary view from the ratio laid down in the case of

S. Sampath Kumar, it has been held on the issue whether the power of judicial

review vested in the High Court and Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_36">227</a>

and <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_37">32</a> is part of the basic structure of the Constitution.


</p><p id="p_99">             The doctrine of basic structure was evolved in Kesavananda Bharati

case. In Kesavananda Bharati case a thirteen Judge Constitution Bench, by a

majority of 7:6, held that though, by virtue of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_38">Article 368</a>, Parliament is

empowered to amend the Constitution, that power cannot be exercised so as to

damage the basic feature of the constitution or to destroy its basic structure. The

identification of features which constitute the basic structure of our Constitution

has been subject matter of great debate in Indian Constitutional Law.

</p><p id="p_100">              The aspect of judicial review does not find elaborate mention in all

the major judgments. Kesavananda Bharati case did not lay down that the

specific and particular features mentioned in that judgment alone would

constitute the basic structure of our Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_101">
</p><p id="p_102">              It has been observed that the Constitution of India while conferring

power of judicial review of legislative action upon the higher judiciary,

incorporated important safeguards. An analysis of the manner in which the

Framers of our Constitution incorporated provisions related to judiciary would

indicate that they were very greatly concerned with securing the independence of

the judiciary. It is therefore held in the judgment that the power of judicial review

over legislative action vested in the high courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_39">Article 226</a> and in the

Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_40">Article 32</a> of the constitution is an integral and essential

feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure.


</p><p id="p_103">              It has also been held that the power vested in the High Courts to

exercise judicial superintendence over the decision of all courts and tribunals

within their respective jurisdictions is also part of basic structure of the

Constitution. This is because of a situation where the High Courts are divested of

all other judicial functions apart from that of constitutional interpretation, is

equally to be avoided.

<p id="p_159">
</p><p id="p_160">                The fact remains that the petitioners are the manufacturing units of

country spirit through fermentation and distillation which is coming under Red

category / Orange category and as such, as per the State Pollution Control Board,

Odisha notification dtd.31.10.2016 and as per revised classification list as per the

direction of the Central Pollution Control Board dtd.7.3.2016, they are required to

obtain consent from the State Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_161">10.          The National Green Tribunal, after hearing the applicants, Pollution

Control Board and the petitioners herein, has not adjudicated                       the    issue     on

merit as would be evident from the order passed in O.A. No.124 of 2015 since the

Tribunal has only passed the direction which we are quoting for ready reference:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                     "In the facts and circumstances, the State Pollution Control Board
             shall consider the following before granting consent to operate:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         a) To ascertain as to whether or not the country made liquor manufacturing unit seeking
            consent is molasses based or cane juice / non-molasses based.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">         b) Whether or not such unit falls under either of the categories described in clause 5(g) of the
            schedule referred to above.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">                    Based on the above, the PCB shall decide as to whether consent to
             operate should be granted or not.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">                     If the unit is molasses and / or cane juice based and is of more 30
             KLD capacity, it shall direct the applicants seeking consent to operate, to first
             obtain EC from the MOEF as it would fall under category A. If it is a cane juice
             / non-molasses based with capacity of less than 30 KLD, it shall be directed
             to the SEIAA for obtaining EC.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                     The PCB shall make the requirement of obtaining EC, mandatory for
             being eligible to be granted consent to operate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">                      In so far as the manufacturing units which are said to be in operation,
             list of which has been provided as annexure-A3 at pages 26-35 of the OA, we
             leave it upon the State PCB to institute appropriate proceedings for the
             purpose of bringing them within the ambit of this order. Let this exercise be
             carried out expeditiously."</blockquote><p id="p_162">

</p><p id="p_163">             It is evident from the order passed by the Tribunal that the matter

has been left upon the State Pollution Control Board to assess the units as to

whether they are coming under the fold of the consent zone or not. Thereafter the

other order has been passed being O.A. No.19 of 2017 wherein the contention was

raised that pursuant to the order passed by the Tribunal on 24.4.2017, the

Collector and District Magistrate, Ganjam has closed down the country liquor

manufacturing units since the EIA notification 2006 would not be applicable to the

units as no limit on emission in respect of the kind of manufacturing unit as that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                           29</span>


of the applicants has been prescribed in the EIA notification and negating the

argument the Tribunal has disposed of the original application by observing that


             "Considering the definition of out still as provided in the Orissa

      Excise Act, there is no dispute about the fact that as in the case of

      distillery, the unit run by the applicants which are said to be out still units,

      also used the process of distillation for manufacture of liquor, the only

      difference being the medium for manufacture of the liquor."


</p><p id="p_164">             So far as the action on the part of the District Magistrate to close

down the unit is concerned, before the Tribunal, stand has been taken by the

petitioners that before its closure notices have not been issued, which has been

refuted by the Pollution Control Board by submitting that notices to show cause

were issued to the occupier of the units on 4.5.2017, as such the Tribunal,

accepting the argument of the Pollution Control Board, has given the finding that

the principle of natural justice has substantially been complied with.


</p><p id="p_165">12.          So far as the question related to providing adequate opportunity of

being heard, learned counsel for the petitioners on behalf of the occupiers have

fairly submitted that they are ready to follow the Environmental Laws including

the notification issued by the Pollution Control Board or the Central Board as the

case may be, if sufficient opportunity would be granted to them.


</p><p id="p_166">             Learned counsel appearing for the Pollution Control Board has not

raised objection in this regard, rather he has fairly submitted that if they will

approach to the competent authority either the Pollution Control Board or the

Central Board, as the case may be, that will be decided as per the Law applicable.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                             30</span>


</p><p id="p_167">               We, after appreciating the argument advanced on behalf of the

parties in this respect, are of the view that since the consent     to   operate      is

mandatorily required as per the notification issued by the Central Government as

well as the Pollution Control Board but simultaneously the requirement of natural

justice is also to be followed and when the occupiers of the units are ready to

follow the Environmental Laws, as such in the ends of justice it would be

appropriate for this court to disposed of the writ petitions with the following

directions:-
</p>
<p id="p_168">
</p><p id="p_169"> (i)    The petitioners are granted liberty to approach the competent authority of

        the Pollution Control Board or the Central Board, as the case may be, for

        seeking consent to operate in the appropriate application to be filled up,

        complete in all respect, within period of 7 days from the date of receipt of

        copy of the order.
</p>
<p id="p_170">
</p><p id="p_171"> (ii)   The competent authority before whom the applications would be filed is

        hereby directed to conclude the process of granting consent to operate and

        issue environmental clearance if found eligible as per Law applicable within

        further period of three weeks from the date of receipt of the applications.


</p><p id="p_172">(iii)   This Court has passed an interim order vide order dtd.10.07.2017 taking

        into consideration the interim order passed by a coordinate Bench of this

        court in W.P.(C) No.10260 of 2017 on 01.06.2017. Since we are directing

        the Board to take decision for issuance of environmental clearance, hence it

        would be in the ends of justice to direct for continuation of the interim

        orders granted vide order dtd.1.6.2017 in W.P.(C) No.10260 of 2017 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                      31</span>


                dtd.10.7.2017 passed in these batch of writ petitions, if the occupiers of the

                units will make applications within period of seven days from the date of

                receipt of copy of the order as per direction No.(i), the same shall operate for

                a period of four weeks, i.e. the maximum period by which the competent

                authority of the Board has been directed to take decision for granting

                consent to operate as per direction No.(ii).
</p>
<p id="p_173">
</p><p id="p_174">                          It goes without saying that if the units will not make their

       applications within the stipulated period as directed under direction No.(i), the

       Board will be at liberty to take all measures provided under Law for its closure.


</p><p id="p_175">                          The further continuation of operation of the units in question would

       depend upon the final outcome of the decision of the Board which would be taken

       pursuant to the order passed by this court as directed above.


</p><p id="p_176">                          With these observations and directions the order passed by the

       National Green Tribunal in O.A. No.124 of 2016 and 19 of 2017 is modified to the

       extent as indicated above.
</p>
<p id="p_177">
</p><p id="p_178">                          Accordingly all the writ petitions stand disposed of with the
