          causing a threat to human health, fishery yield and ecology.

         The Applicant claims that he and the Fisherman Co-operative

         Society have made regular complaints to various authorities

         bringing such pollution to their notice for immediate action.

         It is the grievance of the Applicant that though the authorities

         have done some paper work but no deterrent and stringent

         action has been initiated against the Respondent No.1 and

         the Pollution is still continuing. The Applicant rely on various

         communications           from      these   authorities   addressed    to

         Respondent No.1 wherein pollution of the lake and the canal

         has been mentioned and also, certain damages caused have

         been cited by the Irrigation Department for replenishing the

         water to wipe out the polluted stagnant water, resulted due to

         into ingress of molasses and other effluent from Respondent

         No.1-Industry.           Several    communications       from   fisheries

         department addressed to the Respondent No.1, specifically

         high-lighting the probable damages and loss of fisheries on

         account of water pollution are also referred.

         basically has three (3) units namely, sugar unit, distillery unit

         and co-generation unit. The sugar plant is of 600 MT per day

         sugar production capacity and is equipped with Effluent

         Treatment Plant (ETP) capacity of 720 Mᵌ per day which is

         sufficient to meet the treatment norms stipulated by MPCB.

          The industry also has 25 hectare of earmarked agricultural

         land for using the treated effluent for irrigation purpose. The

         Co-Gen plant has the ETP of 1360 Mᵌ per day capacity. The

         distillery unit of industry is of 60 killo liter (KL) per day

         capacity, which started commercial production in January

         2011. This distillery unit is zero discharge industry where the

         entire effluent i.e. spent wash generated in the industry is

         fully consumed in boiler as fuel and for that the industry has

         provided Reverse Osmosis System, multiple effect evaporator

         followed by incineration boiler.      The Industry has invested

         substantial capital amount for installing the State of Art

         pollution control system and also, incurring significant

         expenditure for efficiently operating the same.

         maintainability of the Application and questioned as to how

         the applicant is entitled for the relief claimed.           The

         Respondent No.1 alleged that though said society was taken

         over by the Administrator long back, the Applicant has mis-

         led this Tribunal by filing this Application without any

         authority and without any locus-standie. The Applicant has

         also resorted to makeing several unsubstantiated personal

         allegations against Respondent No.2 which cannot be dealt by

         this Tribunal, and will be dealt by Respondents separately as

         responsible officer and         collect   the   samples   of   effluent

         observed that the treated effluent was found to be disposed of

         no discharge entering either Akola Nala or Mannat lake. The

         treated effluent sample also found to be generally within

         consented standard.          The Applicant in further hearing also

         pleaded about the impact on fisheries and therefore, the

</p><p id="p_34">         20.              We may highlight the fact that, admittedly, in the

         month of June 2010, there was spillage of molasses from the

         molasses storage tank No.1 of the Respondent No.1-Industry.

         This molasses tank has a total capacity of 10,000 Mᵌ. The

         Counsel for Respondent No.1 fairly submitted that this

         spillage occurred due to construction default of not providing

         the proper base for this storage tank. The result is that the

         molasses gushed out and spilled over, leading to soil

         contamination and leachate leading to the nearby canal and

         Mannat lake.             MPCB which has investigated this complaint

         has not placed on record the quantum of molasses spilled

         over and the area of the plant and surrounding affected by

         molasses spill over.             These are tale telling facts and

         circumstances. It is obvious that such incident occurred as a

         result of improper construction of molasses storage tank by

         the Respondent No.1. Nobody can deny that if the molasses

         storage tank was appropriately constructed and molasses

         storage was scientifically managed by the Respondent-1, by

         taking necessary care including provision of dyke walls and

         emergency spillage control measures, then the incident would

         not have occurred. The incident itself is of such a nature that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">(J) Application No.30/2013 (WZ)                                                20</span>
          no separate proof for "negligent act" on part of                   the

         Respondent No.1 is required to be adduced. This is a case for

         which principle of resipsa loquitur is applicable. We have no

         hesitation, therefore, in holding that the Respondent No.1

         committed gross negligence resulting into spillage of molasses

         that caused environmental damage to the surrounding area

         including the canal and Mannat lake.               Needless to say, the

         Respondent No.1 is liable to restore environmental damages

         caused due to the incident. The remedy as available under

         <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_10">Section 18</a> of National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 is inclusive

         of    restitution,       restoration   and   of   compensation.    The

         adjudication by National Green Tribunal has to be done on

         Polluters pay principle as enumerated in <a href="/doc/170223725/" id="a_11">section 20</a> of

         National Green Tribunal Act 2010. We hold, therefore, that

         the Application will have to be allowed for certain reliefs

         claimed and proper measures should be taken to avoid future

         similar incident.

<p id="p_35">         21.              The     Polluter   Pay's    Principal   is   commonly

         interpreted as, the Polluter must pay for, the cost of Pollution

         abatement, cost of environment damage recovery, cost of

         incident management and compensation costs for the victims

         of the incident, if any, due to Pollution. It implies that those

         who caused environmental damage by polluting should pay

         the costs of reversing that damage and also controlling the

         further damage.            Though the Principle is very simple, its


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">(J) Application No.30/2013 (WZ)                                                    21</span>
          implementation is rather difficult and complex mainly due to

         the      difficulty      in     identification   of    the     Polluters   and

         apportioning their responsibilities.                  Another concern, in

         implementation of this principle is to how the polluter should

         pay. Even the difficulties in restoring the ecological system,

         once it is disrupted or contaminated makes the assessment of

         payment in the terms of loss (loss of bi-diversity, loss of

         habitat, loss of top soft soil so on and so forth) difficult.

         Moreover, the payment is, at the end of the day, probably in

         ferms of money.               It is well documented that the monetary

         compensation do not essentially fully make up for ecological

         loss or loss of resource such as ground water, top soil,

         biodiversity and therefore, in reality to some degree, at least,

         the polluter never pays the real cost of the pollution, even if,

         some         restitution       or   compensation        is     possible.   The

         environmentalist               generally,    therefore,       advocate     the

         importance of 'Precautionary Principle' over the 'Polluter Pay's

         Principle' in the enforcement policies.                      The environment

         damage costing is an evolving subject and can involve both

         non market valuation as well as market valuation. There are

         various methodologies in literature for such environmental

         damage costing such as methods of direct market method,

         surrogate market based method, constructed market based

         methods and experimental methods.                      In the instant case

         where the damages are related to change in water quality of

         fields and also loss of means of livelihood due to not taking

         crop in the agricultural fields, a multipronged approach based

         on above methodologies needs to be taken by this Tribunal.

         referred to documents submitted on 24th March 2014 and

         informed that the said Society even in 2009-10, when

         Respondent No.1-Industry was not operational, was in loss as

         mentioned in the statutory audit. He further refers the same

         Audit Report wherein it is mentioned that there are no sale of

         fish conducted by the Society.        He further mentions that

         though there are only 27 members in the year 2010-11, the

         claim submitted by the Applicant is for 37 members which

         clearly indicate that the Applicant has conducted a perjury by

         adding ten (10) names who were not members of the Society

         in the year 2010-11.       He further refers the Audit Report of

         2010-11 which mentions the negligence and unawareness of

         the Board of Directors resulted into loss of production, and no

         reference is made about the deteriorating water quality of

         lake. He further brings it to the notice from the various audit

         reports that the maximum yearly income of the Society is

         Rs.45,000/- per year and therefore,          claims that even

         accepting the contention of the compensation, the claim

         cannot be more than Rs.45,000/- for one year. The Counsel

         for Respondent No.1 also alleges perjury and contempt

         has been put on Affidavit dated 23rd May 2014. He further

         submits that none of the submissions made by him on

         argument, the Counsel fairly submits that though they are

         doing lot of work in the Pollution Control management and

         ready to work for environmental improvement in the area.

          bearer of the Society, however, there is no intention to mis-

         lead or mis-guide the Tribunal.           We have gone through the

         entire documents and failed to find any credible evidence

         about the damages to the fisheries due to the said incident.

         No doubt, the water quality was deteriorated; however,

         whether the fisheries stock was affected could not be

         established by the Applicant and also by the Respondent No.4

         . The correspondence from Fisheries department is generally

         refereeing to the possible effects on fisheries in case of

         discharge of effluents by the Respondent-1. The fisheries

         department seems to have not assessed the effect on fisheries

         through scientific means, if they had seen such probability. In

         any case, in case of water pollution issues, they should have

         immediately informed and involved MPCB, who is the

         specialized organization for the necessary investigations. In

         the absence of such critical information, we are not inclined

         to accept the claim made by the Applicant about damage to

         fisheries. The CIFE, which is specialized agency, also finds

         that presently the water quality of Mannat Lake is fit for

         fishery.
