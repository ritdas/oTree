         this Court reported in the case of Sandesh Ltd. &amp;
         Anr. Vs. Transmedia Software Ltd. [2016 (1) GLR 574],
         it was contended that, as decided by the Division
         Bench    of     this       Court,       the      appeal       even       against            the
         order of notice is maintainable under Order 43, Rule
         1   of   Code        of    Civil       Procedure          and      therefore,               the
         appeal is maintainable and the stay may be continued.
         He further submitted that no reply is filed before
         the learned Trial court, even no notice is given for
         revocation and the pipeline is already installed and
         operative.           It   was    submitted            that      the      trial        Court
         ought to have looked into the aspect of reasonable
         apprehension              as    averred           in      the        plaint;            more
         particularly as stated in paragraph 6 of the plaint.
         That     even         respondent           No.3        has       stated          in         the
         Affidavit-in-Reply that he has received an amount of
         Rs.13,00,000/-. It was further submitted that even
         though it is averred that such use was permitted till
         30.06.2017, respondent No.3 has not come out with a
         case that, there are any arrears. It was contended
         that,     the        same       has     to       be    compensated              and         the
         applicant is duty bound to make it good and that the
         applicant is ready and willing to give compensation
         for the permissive use.
</p>
<p id="p_12">         (f) It was also submitted that, as averred in the
         Affidavit-in-Reply               by       respondent            No.3,         purported
         purchase has been made on 10.01.2017 and as can be
         seen from the documents, it is established that the
         pipeline was in existence on the date on which the
         alleged transaction is made by respondent No.3.</p><pre id="pre_2">

         applicant submitted that the appeal requires consideration
         and the order of status quo deserves to be continued till

         Court    on    merits       and       the     parties         are       required          to      be

         Nos.1    and     2    submitted           that         there       is      Memorandum             of
         Agreement with the applicant and respondent Nos.1 and 2
         have no dispute about the same. He further submitted that
         it is a matter of fact that respondent No.3 has threatened
         to remove the pipeline laid down with the permission of
         respondent Nos.1 and 2 and if the stay is not granted, it
         would indirectly give permission to respondent No.3 to
         uproot    the        pipeline,           which         would         not        only        cause
         irreparable         damage       to    the       applicant,             but     also        cause
         irreparable damage to the land of respondent Nos.1 and 2.
         It was also contended that Survey No.373 is a composite
         survey    and that there is no part alike Survey No.373/3
         and   that     respondent         Nos.1       and      2    dispute         the       claim       of
         ownership put forward by respondent No.3.

         undertaken any proceedings to make out a case of having
         legitimate      right       on    the       disputed         property.           He     further
         submitted that, in the facts of the case the order of
         status quo granted by this Court deserves to be continued
         till the application Exh:5 is decided and the same would
         meet the ends of justice as there is threat of breaking

         respondent No.3 is incorrect statement and respondent No.3
         has only relied upon the so called map of DILR and has not
         even produced the sale-deed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_16">         9. Mr.Viral K. Shah, learned counsel for respondent No.3
         has opposed the Appeal From Order as well as the Civil
         Application and has contended that, the applicant-company
         was incorporated in the year 2009 and it has started its
         commercial       activities          in     the         year     2014       and      there          is
         already      separate         pipeline              for        transmitting              treated
         effluents from its manufacturing unit to CETP at GIDC,
         Sarigam. It was also contended that the entire case is
         based on an lease-agreement with respondent Nos.1 and 2.
         He further submitted that respondent No.3 has purchased
         the   land     bearing        Survey         No.373/3           from        one      Lalitbhai
         Naginbhai Ravat and not from any of the respondents. He
         further     contended         that        the       contention            that       there          is
         extortion        done        by     respondent               No.3         is       incorrect.
         Rs.13,00,000/- was paid in the month of January 2017 and
         that too upto the period of 30.06.2017. It was further
         contended      that,        there     is      no        reason       that       why      problem
         erupted in the month of June, 2017 only. It was also
         contended       that        the    permission             was       granted          only          for
         particular period and there is already another pipeline in
         existence and the applicant had sought permission only for
         repairs of the said pipeline. It was also contended that
         there is no irregularities committed by respondent No.3
         and in fact, respondent No.3 is not the party to the
         license and therefore, there is no necessity to undertake
         any process for revocation.                     It was further asserted that
         respondent No.3 has become the owner by registered sale
         deed and there is no evidence on record to show that the
         pipeline     was      laid        down    before          10.01.2017.             He     further

         contended that if the same would have been true, there was
         no     reason          for       making       payment            of      Rs.13,00,000/-                  to
         respondent No.3. It was also asserted that the suit is
         filed       before         the    learned         Trial         Court        with       incomplete
         details and the same is abuse of process of the Court.
         Even if it is small portion of land, nobody can force
         respondent No.3 to permit the applicant to lay down the
         pipeline           and     then     say      that,         respondent              No.3       can       be
         charged.           It was also contended that there is nothing on
         record to show that Survey No.373 is only one composite
         number and there is no document to show that there is one
         part       of     the      land    and      therefore,              the      appeal          and        the
         application              filed     by       the          applicant           deserve           to        be
         dismissed.

         counsel for the respective parties.

<p id="p_18">         10.     At the outset, it deserves to be noted that as the
         present appeal arises out of the order of notice and non-
         grant of ex parte ad-interim injunction, the matter is to
         be examined in said ambit. Considering the prima facie
         case of the applicant, it clearly bornes out from the
         record of the suit,                 which is brought on record by way of
         separate            paper-book,           that           there         is       Memorandum               of
         Understanding between the applicant and respondent Nos.1
         and    2    in       relation      to     the      land        bearing          Survey        No.373,
         admeasuring 3577 sq.mtrs. and Survey No.58/p2, admeasuring
         1742       sq.mtrs.         It    goes     without            saying        that,       respondent
         Nos.1 and 2 have no objection if the pipeline which is
         laid down by the applicant is permitted to remain as it is
         at least still application Exh:5 is decided. It is also an
         admitted            position         that,           the          applicant             is        paper
         manufacturing              unit     and       has        to      make        arrangement                for

         discharge of treated affluents upto CETP, situated at a
         distance of 4.5 kms., away from its manufacturing unit,
         which is part of Sarigam Industrial Estate. As a paper
         manufacturing unit, the applicant is therefore bound by
         environment         laws       and    has         to       maintain         the      prescribed
         standards for discharging its affluents for which pipeline
         is   a    sine     qua       non.     The       documents             on    record         clearly
         establish the fact that, there is MOU and unregistered
         lease-deed. Though respondent No.3 has brought on record
         the Tippan/Map(sic) of DILR, which shows bifurcated part
         being Survey No.373/3, however, the fact remains that the
         names of respondent Nos.1 and 2 along with one Sanjaybhai
         Desai as owners and occupiers of the land bearing Survey
         No.373 as per the revenue records, which is brought on
         record of the suit. Even Tippan which is annexed with the
         affidavit does not support the case of respondent No.3 as
         if the land bearing Survey No.373 has been bifurcated into
         three      parts      (1)      In     addition             to     that,        even        in        the
         Affidavit-in-Reply              which        is       filed       before          this       Court,
         respondent        No.3       has     not     even       mentioned            the     registered
         number of the sale-deed nor copy of the same has been
         produced on record and only oral assertion has been made
         by     respondent            No.3     to      the          effect          that      purely           on
         humanitarian ground, permission was accorded by respondent
         No.3 and that the same was not beyond 30.06.2017. Further,
         it   is    also     an       admitted       fact       that       respondent            No.3         has
         accepted huge amount of Rs.13,00,000/- and huge expenses
         have      incurred       by     the     applicant               for     laying         down          the
         pipeline      and      therefore,            the       contention            that      there          is
         alternative pipeline does not take the case of respondent
         No.3 any further.</p><pre id="pre_3">

         No.3,     which        is        already        admitted            by    respondent             No.3.
         Moreover, one of the entry of Rs.10,00,000/-, which is
         paid     by      way        of     cheque          dated        30.01.2017,              is      dated
         01.02.2017.         The        invoices,           which        are      annexed          with         the
         plaint,       show      that         the      material           for      laying          down         the
         pipeline       is      of     12.05.2016,              04.12.2016,            10.12.2016               and
         lastly, the tax invoices issued by Laxmi Techno Industries
         Ltd. is dated 19.12.2016, which prima facie shows that
         pipeline was laid down by the month of December, 2016.

<p id="p_21">         13. Even if the date, which is mentioned by respondent
         No.3    is     taken          into     consideration                reckoning,            the      fact
         remains that assertion made by the applicant that the
         pipeline was laid down before 10.01.2017 is prima facie
         fortified by such facts and the same is operative as of
         now.

                     C/CA/8397/2017                                                    ORDER



         mischief will ensue to the applicant/plaintiff. In the
         instant case, if the pipeline is removed, which is in
         prima    facie       opinion     of       this         Court      laid        down       before
         10.01.2017, the same would cause greater injustice to the
         applicant herein. The facts of the case do not disclose
         that the applicant has trespassed into the land upon which
         the     alleged      claim      of      ownership            is      put       forward           by
         respondent No.3. Even according to respondent No.3, he has
         become the owner of alleged separate part of Survey No.373
         i.e.     Survey      No.373/3        on      10.01.2017             and      as      observed
         hereinabove, the invoices on record prima facie show that
         the    work     of    laying     down        the       pipeline         was       over       till
         December, 2016. It also appears that, the suit is not
         based     merely       on     apprehension,             but       threats          given         by
         respondent No.3 and in such cases, this is a fit case for
         at least grant of status quo as provided under Order 39,
         Rule 1 read with Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_23">         15.     In light of the aforesaid, on examining the case on
         hand and three cardinal principles enshrined in Order 39,
         Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure i.e. prima facie
         case,    balance        of    convenience            and     irreparable             loss         is
         concerned, it is a matter of record that respondent Nos.1
         and 2 have entered into MOU with the applicant for the
         land bearing Survey Nos.373 and 58/p1. It is also brought
         on record, which prima facie shows that the pipeline has
         been laid down in the month of December, 2016 and no sale
         deed, index or extract or any revenue records in favour of
         respondent No.3 has been produced on record and therefore,
         the     applicant       has    very        good        prima        facie         case.          The
         applicant being paper manufacturing unit has to keep flow
         of    treated     effluents      discharged             from       its      manufacturing
         unit, so as to reach into CETP in regular manner without

         any obstruction and therefore, the balance of convenience
         is    in    favour       of    the     applicant.           Similarly,            if     interim
         relief       is      not       granted,        the        applicant             will       suffer
         irreparable            loss.     The        facts         of      the          case      clearly
         establishes that it falls within the ambit of Rule 3,
         Order 39 of Code of Civil Procedure. The aspect whether
         the applicant has any easement right or not is to be
         examined by the learned Trial Court when the application
         Exh:5 is taken up for hearing threadbare. The present
         Appeal from Order arising out of non-grant of interim
         relief, present appeal is maintainable, and therefore the
         appeal is admitted in view of the observations made by
         Division Bench of this Court in the case of Sandesh Ltd. &amp;
         Anr.       (supra).

         opinion of this Court, present case falls in the category
