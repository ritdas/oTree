                               C A V Order

08/09/2015

</p><p id="p_20">1.    In these three writ petitions, the petitioners would assail the letters

      of termination issued by the respondent No.6 - The Assistant Vice

      President, Human Resources &amp; Employee Services, Jindal Steel &amp;

      Power Limited.
</p>
<p id="p_21">2.    The petitioners claimed to be working on different posts in the

      establishment of the respondent No.6, who was operating Gare-
</p>
<p id="p_22">      Palma - IV/1 coal mines, popularly known as Jindal Open Cast

      Coal Mine # 1, Dongamouha. The said allotment of coal mines was
          cancelled under the orders passed by the Supreme Court in

         <a href="/doc/135364996/" id="a_1">Manohar Lal Sharma v. Principal Secretary and Others1</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_23">3.       According to the petitioners, after cancellation of the coal mines, the

         same has been entrusted to the Coal India Limited (for short 'CIL'),

         as designated custodian.
</p>
<p id="p_24">4.       It has been argued that since the subject coal mines is now manged

         by the respondent CIL, the respondent No.6 is not competent to

         terminate the petitioners from the services.
</p>
<p id="p_25">5.       It is settled law that private company would normally not be

         amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the

         Constitution of India because a company is not an instrumentality of

         the State.
</p>
<p id="p_26">6.       The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_3">Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas and

         Others2</a>, held thus :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                         18. From the decisions referred to above, the
                         position that emerges is that a writ petition under
                         <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India may be
                         maintainable against (i) the State (Government);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                         (ii) an authority; (iii) a statutory body; (iv) an
                         instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a
                         company which is financed and owned by the
                         State; (vi) a private body run substantially on
                         State funding; (vii) a private body discharging
                         public duty or positive obligation of public nature;
                         and (viii) a person or a body under liability to
                         discharge any function under any statute, to
                         compel it to perform such a statutory function.</blockquote>

<p id="p_27">                         27. Such private companies would normally not
                         be amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article
                         226</a> of the Constitution. But in certain
1    (2014) 9 SCC 614
2    (2003) 10 SCC 733
                       circumstances a writ may issue to such private
                      bodies or persons as there may be statutes
                      which need to be complied with by all concerned
                      including the private companies. For example,
                      there are certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_6">Industrial
                      Disputes Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_7">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the
                      <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_8">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper
                      environment, say the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control
                      of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or the Water (Prevention
                      and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or
                      statutes of the like nature which fasten certain
                      duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such
                      private bodies which they are bound to comply
                      with. If they violate such a statutory provision a
                      writ would certainly be issued for compliance with
                      those provisions. For instance, if a private
                      employer dispenses with the service of its
                      employee in violation of the provisions contained
                      under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_11">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable
                      cases the High Court interfered and has issued
                      the writ to the private bodies and the companies
                      in that regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ
                      may arise where there may not be any non-
                      compliance with or violation of any statutory
                      provision by the private body. In that event a writ
                      may not be issued at all. Other remedies, as may
                      be available, may have to be resorted to.
</p>
<p id="p_28">    7.   In the case at hand, the petitioners have not been terminated by the

         respondent CIL, but by the respondent No.6, a company registered

         under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_12">Companies Act</a>, 1956, therefore, in view

         of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Federal Bank Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_29">         (supra), the writ petition is not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_30">    8.   As a sequel, all the petitions are liable to be and are hereby

         dismissed.                                         Sd/-
