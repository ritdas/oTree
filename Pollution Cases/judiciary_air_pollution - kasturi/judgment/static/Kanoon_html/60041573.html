A.K.SIKRI, CJ, (Oral)

            The petitioner-firm is engaged in the manufacture of cardboard.

The "No Objection Certificate" for setting up the manufacturing unit was

granted to it on 13.03.1991 and the consent, as required under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_1">Sections 25</a>

and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_2">26</a> of the Water (Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Pollution) Act</a>, 1977

(hereinafter referred to as the "1977 Act") for running the manufacturing

unit was also granted upto 31.12.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            As per the case of the petitioner, till May 1998, the

manufacturing process was continued without any dispute but in June 1998,

the petitioner received two demand notices raised by respondent No.2 by
 CWP No.1389 of 2002                                                      [2]
                                      *****

invoking <a href="/doc/760991/" id="a_4">Section 6(1A)</a> of the1977 Act. The first demand was for payment

of `54,955/- for the period 26.01.1992 to 28.02.1998 and the second

demand was for payment of `3,004/- for the period from July 1990 till

25.01.1992. The appeals filed by the petitioner against the said demands

were rejected and the writ petition bearing CWP No.12099 of 2000 was

disposed of on 07.09.2000 with the direction that "the respondents-

authorities shall appoint a paper technologist, who will visit the site of the

petitioner alongwith the representative of the Board and the team shall

assess the power consumption for the period of July 1990 to October 1999

and evaluate the production details for the corresponding period. The

respondents-authorities shall then charge the cess as per the observations

made by the Appellate Committee. The fee of the paper technologist expert

shall be borne by the petitioner. If the Appellate committee comes to the

conclusion that the petitioner was running the unit more than 2.5 ton, the

petitioner shall not only pay the levy, but also, pay interest at the rate of

12% p.a. which shall be calculated by the respondents-authorities".

Thereafter, the petitioner filed an application for review and the fee of the

paper technologist was fixed @ `15,000/- in lump sum but till date no

expert was appointed. The petitioner has, thus, challenged the demands

raised by the respondent-Board in the present writ petition.

</p><p id="p_5">            From the aforesaid narration, it becomes clear that two aspects

need consideration in this matter:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             (i)   "Whether the respondent Pollution Board
                   could undertake 'best judgment assessment'
                   and pass the orders in that manner; and
 CWP No.1389 of 2002                                                     [3]
                                   *****

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            (ii)   If the answer to the first question is in the
                   affirmative, whether the manner in which
                   'the best judgment assessment' is carried out,
                   is sustainable in law"?.</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">            Insofar as the first question is concerned, answer to that has

to be in affirmative i.e. in favour of the Pollution Board. As pointed above,

in order to enable the Pollution Board to carry out assessment on actual

basis, it was imperative on the part of the petitioner to       install meter

reflecting the actual consumption of water.        The petitioner was also

supposed to file the returns. Admittedly, no such returns were filed despite

opportunities granted by the Pollution Board to the petitioner. Once the

returns are not filed, the Pollution Board is left with no alternative but to

take recourse to the 'best judgment assessment'. There is yet another factor

which itself goes in favour of the Pollution Board.

</p><p id="p_8">            The petitioner had approached the Appellate Committee, by

filing appeal under <a href="/doc/1919908/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_6">Control of

Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977. In the said appeal, orders were passed whereby

the Appellate Committee decided that installed capacity of the mill may be

got verified by engaging Paper Technologist along-with representative of

the Board. It was further directed that the same team shall assess power

consumption for the period from July 1990 to October 1999 and evaluate

the production details for the corresponding period. Thereafter, the water

cess shall be decided. In an event, it is found by the Appellate Committee

that the installed capacity is 5.0 ton for which the NOC was obtained, the

assessment order shall be drawn on the 5.0. ton capacity and the penalty

shall be levied on the compound amount.
</p><pre id="pre_3"> CWP No.1389 of 2002                                                     [4]
                                  *****

</pre><p id="p_9">            The matter was adjourned thereafter and again taken up by the

Appellate Committee on 28.6.2000. On this date, submissions of both the

parties were considered and the Appellate Committee passed the order

deciding that the balance payment be deposited along-with interest on or

before 30.6.2000.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            Significantly, the petitioner challenged this order by filing the

writ petition No.12099 of 2000 in this Court.       That writ petition was

disposed of at the admission stage itself vide order dated 07.9.2000,

directing the respondents to appoint Paper Technologist, who shall visit the

site of the petitioner along-with the representative of the Board and the

team shall assess the power consumption for the period July 1990 to

October 1999 and evaluate the production details for the corresponding

period. The Court specifically ordered that fee of the Paper Technologist

shall be borne by the petitioner. It was also directed that if the Appellate

Committee comes to the conclusion that the petitioner was running the unit

more than 2.5. tone, the petitioner shall not only pay the levy but also pay

interest at the rate of 12% per annum which shall be calculated by the

respondent-authorities. We would like to point out that inspite of passing

the order, the respondent had proceeded with the assessment taking into

consideration installed capacity of 5 tons for which NOC was obtained,

the petitioner on the other hand was maintaining that capacity of the plant

was 2.5 tons and 5 tons.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            Review of this order was sought and in the said review

application, Division Bench of this Court passed an order dated 23.11.2001
 CWP No.1389 of 2002                                                      [5]
                                    *****

fixing the fee of the Paper Technologist at Rs.15,000/- in lump sum.

Thereafter, the Pollution Board appointed the Expert from Saharanpur as

the Paper Technologist to carry out the matter in terms of the order of this

Court. A letter dated 17.11.2003 was addressed to the petitioner to deposit

the fee and charges of the Institution which is accepted on record but the

petitioner did not deposit the said fee.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             Having regard to the same, we are of the view that neither the

petitioner alleges violation of principle nor the petitioner can question the

move of the respondents in proceeding with the 'best judgment assessment'.

</p><p id="p_13">             Coming to the second issue as diluted above, it has to be

decided as to whether the basis on which the 'best judgment assessment' is

carried out, is correct or not.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             As already pointed out above, the Pollution Board had taken

into consideration the capacity of the petitioner as 5 metric tons and on that

basis, water consumption is calculated in the absence of actual record,

which could be furnished by the petitioner. The contention of the petitioner

on the other hand, is that actual capacity installed was 2.5 metric tons. No

doubt, this issue could be sorted out in clear terms and authoritatively, the

petitioner had deposited the fee of consultant, to that extent, the petitioner

is to be blamed. At the same time, we find on the basis of record that

without the Expert going into that question, there are certain documents on

record on the basis of which this controversy can be determined by this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             No doubt, the NOC was given by the Pollution Board for 5
 CWP No.1389 of 2002                                                      [6]
                                   *****

metric tons capacity. However, after obtaining NOC, the petitioner set up

the factory and applied for consent of the Pollution Board under the

provisions of Water (Prevention &amp; Control of Pollution) Cess,Act,1978. In

the said application dated 26.3.1993 submitted to the Pollution Board, the

petitioner showed installed capacity.      It is this application which was

considered by the Pollution Board and the Pollution Board gave the consent

vide order dated 29.1.1996 for three tons capacity. It can easily be inferred

that before giving this consent, the Pollution Board might have inspected

the factory of the petitioner but would have satisfied itself about the

directions stated in the application for consent, wherein it was mentioned

that installed capacity was 2.5 tons. Once we find from the record that the

petitioner had constructed the factory with the installed capacity of 2.5 tons

and consent was also given only for three tons, there cannot be any basis

for making the assessment on the premise that 'No Objection Certificate'

was obtained for five tons. No doubt, there could have been increase in the

capacity afterwards, however, it could be only for three metric tons for

which consent was given. If the petitioner had added the installed capacity

more than three metric tons, the petitioner had to approach the Pollution

Board again for fresh consent. No such event even took place. Therefore,

on the basis of the material placed on record, we are of the opinion that 'the

best judgment assessment' could have been done on the basis of consent

order and not on the basis of 'NOC' given by the Pollution Board.

</p><p id="p_16">            Mr.Walia, learned counsel for the Pollution Board has

produced the record of assessment for the period from July 1990 to January
 CWP No.1389 of 2002                                                      [7]
                                    *****

25,1992. The assessment is made at `3004/-. For the period from January

26,1992 to February 1999, the assessment comes to `54955/-. Since these

two assessment orders have been taken into consideration for five metric

tones capacity, it should have been in our above discussion three metric

tons capacity. We modify the assessment reducing the aforesaid amount by

40%.
</p>
<p id="p_17">             As a result, this writ petition is partly allowed. The petitioner

shall pay 60% of the amount assessed. This amount shall be paid within

four weeks from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order along-with

interest which shall be calculated at the rate of 9% per annum from January

01.2000 till the date of payment.</p><pre id="pre_4">
