NOT FILED)

                     -0-0-0-0-0-

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES
226 AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA
PRAYING QUASH THE ORDER DTD.2.8.2014 ISSUED
BY THE R-3 AT ANNEX-A.

     This writ petition coming on for preliminary
hearing this day, Chief Justice made the following:-

                      ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ(Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.   The petitioner has invoked <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India to call into question the order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span>


dated 02.08.2014 of the Karnataka State Pollution

Control Board whereby the petitioner is directed to stop

operation of their silk spinning unit and BESCOM is

directed to stop power supply to the petitioner-industry.


</p><p id="p_3">2.   Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Ashok Haranahalli

appearing   for   the   petitioner   submitted   that   the

impugned order is made without notice and without

affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. He

also submitted that the petitioner has never been given

an opportunity to meet the standards of noise which

might have been prescribed by the Pollution Control

Board. He further submitted that there is no appellate

authority available to hear and decide an appeal and

therefore, the petitioner is constrained to approach this

Court for necessary relief.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.   It was fairly conceded on behalf of the petitioner

that petitioner had never applied for requisite consent

under the provisions of The Air(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control

of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and without valid consent of the

State Pollution Control Board the industry could not be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>


allowed to operate at the premises where it is located.

There is also no dispute about the fact that the industry

of the petitioner is located in residential area.   It was

also seen from the impugned order that it is an urgent

and temporary measure, based on relevant material. As

pointed out by learned counsel Mr. Gururaj Joshi,

appearing for the State Pollution Control Board, if and

when the petitioner applies for consent and if it is found

to the satisfaction of the Board that the operation of the

industry of the petitioner will not cause nuisance or air

pollution beyond the prescribed limits the petitioner

may be granted consent and other directions issued in

the impugned order may be modified or reversed.


</p><p id="p_6">4.   Therefore, with a view to making an appropriate

application for consent of the Pollution Control Board

and without prejudice to the rights of the petitioner, the

petitioner has not pressed for any further order at this

stage.   It is only requested that the Pollution Control

Board may be directed to entertain and decide the

application proposed to be made by the petitioner for

consent under the Act. Responding to that it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5</span>


submitted by learned counsel Mr. Gururaj Joshi

appearing for the Pollution Control Board that if and

when requisite application in the prescribed form with

the prescribed fees is submitted to the Pollution Control

Board,      it   will   be   examined   and   entertained   in

accordance with law and decided as expeditiously as

possible.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.   Recording the above statements, the petition is

disposed as not surviving with no order as to cost.
