ORAL ORDER</pre>


<p id="p_1">     The unit, engaged in the manufacture of Castor
     Oil and Dehydrated Castor Oil, has been served with a
     notice not only by the State Government but also by this
     Court.
</p>

<p id="p_2">     2.Officers of the GPCB visited the        unit   on
     21.5.1996 in exercise of powers conferred upon them under
     <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_1">section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act.         No
     adequate facilities for treatment of effluent        were
     noticed.   Facilities are required to be provided by the
     standard specified by the Government.      A sample was
     collected for analysis and that indicated that the
     effluent was acidic and the concentration of T.D.S.,
     Sulphate, BOD, COD, Oil and Grease were higher than the
     permissible limits specified. It appears that the unit
     was also served with a notice under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_2">section 5</a> of the
     Environment Protection Act. It appears that a show cause
     notice has also been issued for breach of provisions
     contained in Hazardous Waste Management and Handling
     Rules, 1989.There are reports of sample collected on
     2.5.96 and looking to the result, it is very clear that
     the parameters are not within the prescribed limits.
</p>

<p id="p_3">     3.The   unit was granted consent under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">section 21</a> of
 the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981.      In the
order dated 12.8.1993 passed by GPCB refusing consent, it
is informed to the unit that in order to qualify for the
consent of the Board under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>, one of the
conditions is that the height of the stack attached to
the emission source/scrubber/any air pollution control
system shall be atleast 50 mtrs. from the ground level.
In the application submitted by the unit on 25.2.1997 for
the consent under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air Act</a>, in the column regarding
emission details in clause 12(b)(4) of the application,
against height of vent/outlet/stack from ground level in
meters, it is mentioned 13 mtrs, 12 mtrs and 4.2 mtrs.
while in the column for name and location of process
vessel to which the stack/vent is attached, it is
indicated as boiler No.1, boiler No.2 to 4 and 5.     The
unit has submitted an affidavit wherein it is mentioned
that there are three boiler house out of two having the
stage monitoring facilities and one without S.M.S. It is
also stated that they have started the work of providing
S.M.F. to the stack. Mr. Trivedi stated that he shall
produce the past reports.      Today, copy of the recent
inspection report is given to Mr. Nanavati.
</p>

<p id="p_4">The matter is adjourned to 21.4.1997.
