    THIS PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED

FOLLOWING:

                            ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Petitioner who was appointed as the Chairman of

second    respondent-Karnataka        State     Pollution    Control

Board     [hereafter     "KSPCB"]     vide    Notification    dated

30.12.2019 at Annexure-A, is knocking at the doors of

writ court for calling in question the Notification dated

02.05.2020 at Annexure-B, issued by the first respondent-

State (hereafter "Government") whereby, his Chairmanship

has been determined by virtue of resignation allegedly

given by him.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.     After      service   of   notice,    Government       is

represented by the learned AAG Sri.Dhyan Chinnappa and

it has filed the Statement of Objections resisting the Writ

Petition; the KSPCB is represented by the learned Senior

Advocate Mr.Ashok Haranahalli; there are Advocates on

record for the respective parties.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  3</span><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">       3.   Learned Senior Advocate Mr.P.S. Rajagopal

appearing for the petitioner strenuously argues that: (i)

some    loose   sheets   of   papers        containing   petitioner's

signatures having been misused by the quarters that be, a

resignation letter dated 02.05.2020 is fabricated vide

Annexure-E; (ii) the Government having wrongly treated it

to be the resignation, has accepted the same vide

impugned Notification; and (iii) the resignation letter could

not have been acted upon by the Government since it was

not addressed to it as required u/s 5(4) of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 [hereafter

"1974 Act"]; however, the first contention as to authorship

of the alleged resignation letter has been given up, regard

being had to the nature &amp; scope of writ jurisdiction,

although not conceding it; he has relied upon a set of

Rulings in support of his case.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">       4.   Learned Addl. Advocate General Sri.Dhyan

Chinnappa appearing for the Government in substance

passionately    contends      that:   (i)    in   petitioner's   First

Information     Report     concerning         alleged    forgery    &amp;

fabrication, the jurisdictional police after investigation,

have filed a 'B' Report; (ii) a litigant cannot approbate &amp;

reprobate in the sense that at one breath, disputing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>

authorship of resignation letter and at the other, asserting

that the same does not constitute resignation in the eye of

law; and it is not open to the petitioner to take up mutually

destructive    averments;    (iii)   the   resignation   letter   is

addressed to the Chief Minister of the Govt. of Karnataka

and therefore, it is addressed to the State Government;

banking upon certain Rulings of the Apex Court in support

of these contentions, he seeks dismissal of the Writ

Petition with costs.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      5.      Learned Senior Advocate Mr.Ashok Haranahalli

appearing for the KSPCB vehemently opposes the Writ

Petition contending that: (i) there is no dispute as to the

authenticity of petitioner's signature on the resignation

letter; petitioner as an after-thought, cannot now turn

around and dispute the authenticity of the letter as if he is

an illiterate; (ii)    the subject letter is addressed to the

"Hon'ble Chief Minister, Government of Karnataka" and

therefore, the requirement of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_3">Section 5(4)</a> of the 1974 Act is

perfectly satisfied; and (iii) under the constitutional

scheme, the Chief Minister is the chief executive of the

State Government, the resignation made to him is a

resignation made to the State Government itself; he cites a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     5</span>

few decisions of the Apex Court to substantiate his

contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     6.       Having      extensively        heard   all    the    learned

Counsel appearing for the parties and having perused the

Petition Papers and also after adverting to the relevant

Rulings cited at the Bar, this Court declines to grant

indulgence     in   the    matter       in    view   of    the    following

discussion:
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">     7. As to forgery &amp; fabrication of Resignation

Letter:
</p>
<p id="p_14">     (a)      The first contention of the petitioner that he

had never authored the resignation letter in question and

that the blank papers containing his signatures have been

misused for fabricating the one has been given up, regard

being had to the nature and scope of writ jurisdiction that

ill-suits adjudication of disputed facts; however, the issue

as to fraud, forgery &amp; fabrication is kept open for being

agitated before the criminal law court in which the police

have now submitted the 'B' Report; consequently, the

contentions of the learned AAG built up on the basis of 'B'

Report do pale into insignificance, as rightly submitted by

Mr.Rajagopal; for the same reason, the Rulings dealing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>

with the status of 'B' Report filed in criminal proceedings

and the power of the criminal law court to accept or reject

the same, or to direct further investigation, do not merit

much consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">      8. As       to    approbation    &amp;     reprobation   and   of

mutually destructive pleas:
</p>
<p id="p_17">      (a) The proposition canvassed by learned AAG that a

litigant    and        more   particularly    the   one    invoking

extraordinary jurisdiction under Articles 226 &amp; 227 of the

Constitution of India, cannot be permitted to approbate &amp;

reprobate, or that he cannot be allowed to take mutually

destructive pleas, does not need substantiation; the Apex

Court in Suzuki Parasrampuria Suitings Private Limited

Vs. Official Liquidator of Mahendra Petrochemicals

Limited, (2018) 10 SCC 707 at paras 12 &amp; 13 observed

as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "12. A litigant can take different stands at
      different times but cannot take      contradictory
      stands in the same case. A party cannot
      be permitted to approbate and reprobate
      on      the      same      facts      and     take
      inconsistent shifting stands. The untenability of
      an inconsistent stand in the same case was
      considered in Amar Singh Vs. Union of India
      (2011)7 SCC 69, observing as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                    "50. This Court wants to make
             it clear that an action that at law is
             not a game of chess. A          litigant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span>

           who comes to Court and invokes its
           writ jurisdiction must come with
           clean hands. He cannot prevaricate
           and take inconsistent positions."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     13.A similar view was taken in Joint Action
     Committee of Air Line Pilots' Assn. of India Vs.
     DG of Civil Aviation (2011) 5 SCC 435,
     observing:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                "12. The doctrine of election
           is based on the rule of estoppel
           the    principle   that   one    cannot
           approbate and reprobate inheres in it.
           The doctrine of estoppel by election is
           one of the species of estoppels in pais
           (or equitable estoppel), which is a rule
           in equity.....Taking inconsistent pleas
           by a party makes its conduct far from
           satisfactory.    Further, the parties
           should not blow hot and cold by taking
           inconsistent stands and prolong
           proceedings unnecessarily."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (b)   The above having been said, now what needs to

be examined is the invocability of the said proposition in

the fact matrix of the case; true it is that the petitioner

disputed the authenticity of the resignation letter, despite

admitting the genuineness of signature appearing therein;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">Mr.Rajagopal submits and this court thinks right that even

if the genuineness of the Resignation Letter is assumed

against the petitioner, still the substantial question

namely, whether the said letter constitutes "resignation" in

the eye of law remains writ large for consideration and

therefore, there is no approbation or reprobation; standard
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                          8</span>

books on law of conveyances are replete with cases

wherein despite admitting the genuineness of signatures,

the execution of documents is held not proved; this could

be true of documents like resignation letters too; it hardly

needs not be stated that though a Resignation Letter is not

a conveyance, the difference between them per se is

immaterial; therefore, the proposition canvassed by the

learned AAG cannot be pressed into service.


</p><p id="p_19">     9.       As to whether there is a Resignation Letter

in fact:
</p>
<p id="p_20">     (a)      The       petitioner       has    produced     a   copy   of

     A bare look of the letter shows that: it's title is

"RESIGNATION LETTER"; it bears name, address &amp;

signature of the petitioner; it is dated 02.05.2020; it refers

to the Notification dated 30.12.2019 whereby, petitioner

was appointed as the Chairman of KSPCB; it is addressed

to "Hon'ble Chief Minister, Govt. of Karnataka"; it speaks of

resignation to the office of Chairman with immediate effect,

and, it mentions "personal reasons" as the cause of

resignation. Going by the intent &amp; content of this letter, no

prudent person would deny that it is a Resignation Letter.


</p><p id="p_23">     10.      As to whether the subject "Resignation

Letter" is valid &amp; effective in the eye of law:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   10</span>

</p><p id="p_24">     (a)      The argument of Mr.Rajagopal that the letter in

question does not qualify to be a "resignation" in terms of

<a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_4">section 5(4)</a> of 1974 Act since it is not addressed to the

"State Government", but was made to the "Chief Minister",

is bit difficult to countenance; Justice Rama Jois in his

magnum       opus     "Services      Under      the   State",   2007

Publication, Indian Law Institute, at Page 705, concisely

states "Resignation is a voluntary act on the part of a civil

servant by which he wishes to leave the government service

to which he is appointed..." In Service Jurisprudence,

normally, a resignation by an employee needs acceptance

by the employer or by the competent authority, in order to

be effective from the intended date, of course, subject to a

contra     legal   position   vide     Inland    Water   Transport

Corporation Ltd Vs. Brojo Nath Ganguly (1986) 3 SCC

156 cited by Mr.Rajagopal; it is profitable to see the

following text of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_5">section 5(4)</a> for ascertaining if there is a

norm-variant:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           "A member of a Board, other than the
           member-secretary, may at any time resign

</p><p id="p_26">        (b)     In the course of their submission, learned

counsel appearing on both the sides, were broadly in

consensus that the act of resignation contemplated u/s

5(4)    apparently    being   unilateral,   does   not   require

acceptance by the Government as a sine qua non for it's

efficacy; to that extent, it partakes the character of

resignation of a High Court Judge u/a 217 (1) of the

Constitution of India, a relevant part of which runs: ".......a

Judge may, by writing under his hand addressed to the

President, resign his office"; this aspect of the matter has

been discussed by the Apex Court in Union of India Vs.

Gopal Chandra Misra, (1978) 2 SCC 301, as pointed out

by Mr.Rajagopal; it is not impertinent to advert to the

following observations in Moti Ram Vs. Param Dev,

(1993) 2 SCC 725 at para 22 (which again is cited by

him):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                "...... A Chairman of the Board may resign
          his office as Chairman but may continue as
          member of the Board. If he resigns only from the
          office of Chairman of the Board, there is no
          requirement that such resignation should be
          accepted by any authority or that any other
          action is required to be taken for the said
          resignation to be effective. It would, therefore,
          appear that the act of relinquishment of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                             12</span>

       office of Chairman of the Board is unilateral in
       character and the resignation from the said
       office takes effect when it is communicated
       without any further action being required to be
       taken on the same... "</blockquote><p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">     In view of the above legal position which both the

 sides fairly conceded to, this court is of a considered

 opinion that what the Government does after the

 resignation was tendered by the petitioner, would not be

 much relevant for consideration; thus, the endorsement

 of the Chief Minister made on the subject Resignation

 Letter "CAVÃPÀj¹zÉ" (Accepted) advances nobody's case;

 consequently, the only substantial question that merits

 examination in this case is: whether the subject

 Resignation Letter can be treated as having been

 addressed to the State Government...?;
</p>
<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">     (c)   Mr.Rajagopal, strenuously argued that since

the subject Letter is addressed to the Chief Minister and

not to the State Government, the same does not fit into

the mandatory text of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_6">Section 5(4)</a> and therefore, the

Government is not justified in treating the petitioner as

having resigned from the office of the Chairman of KSPCB;

this argument is structured on the premise that the Chief

Minister does not represent the State Government, but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                             13</span>

only the Governor does; for this, he seeks to draw succor

from the provisions of the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_7">General Clauses Act</a>, 1897

which arguably equates the "State Government" to the

"Governor"; he heavily banks upon the Five Judge Bench

decision in Gullapalli Nageswara Rao Vs. APSRTC, AIR

1959 SC 308 in which at para 26, the Apex Court has

observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_31">          "26 ... the business rules of the Andhra state
   continue to govern the Secretariat of the
   AndhraPradesh Government. The effect of the
   aforesaid provisions may be stated thus: A State
   Government means the Governor; the executive
   power of the State vests in the Governor; it is
   exercised by him directly or by officers subordinate
   to him in accordance with the provisions of the
   Constitution; the Ministers headed by the Chief
   Minister advise him in the exercise of his functions;
   the Governor made rules enabling the Minister in
   charge of particular department to dispose of cases
   before him and also authorizing him, by means of
   standing orders, to give such directions as he thinks
   fit for the disposal of the cases in the department.
   Pursuant to the rule, the record discloses, the Chief
   Minister, who was in charge of Transport, had made
   an order directing the Secretary to Government,
   Home Department, to hear the objections filed
   against the scheme proposed by the State Transport
   Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_32">          27. The aforesaid machinery evolved by the
   rules for the disposal of cases by the State
   Government has been followed in this case. The
   petitioners and others filed objections to the
   proposed scheme before the Secretary to the
   Government Transport Department. He gave a
   personal hearing to the parties-some of them
   appeared in person and others by representatives;
   the entire material recorded by him was placed
   before the Chief Minister in charge of Transport, who
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               14</span>

   made his order approving the scheme; and the order
   was issued in the name of the Governor,
   authenticated by the Secretary in charge of the
   Transport Department. It may therefore be said that
   the State Government gave the hearing to the
   petitioners in the manner prescribed by the rules
   made by the Governor..."
</p>
<p id="p_33">     These observations far from aiding the petitioner's

case support the contention of the respondent side; true it

is, there are some observations that tend to give an

impression that there is difference between a Minister and

the department; however, that was only in the context of

invocation of the principles of natural justice which

required that the hearer should decide and that the

division between the two has the mischief potential; the

subsequent    decision   in   Gullapalli   Nageswara     Rao

Vs.State of A.P, AIR 1959 SC 1376 again does not come

to the aid of the petitioner since the question that has

arisen in the present Writ Petition did not crop up directly

&amp; substantially.
</p>
<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">     (d)   After the enactment of our Constitution, it has

been a well settled legal position that the word "President"

is a shorthand for the Central Government and the word

"Governor" correspondingly is a shorthand for the State

Government vide Maru Ram Vs. Union of India, (1981) 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               15</span>

SCC 107, subject to all just exceptions; succinctly put, the

State Government means the authority or the person

authorized who exercises it's executive powers, since the

Government is only a juristic person, with no organs to

move, nor the arms to act; someone authorized by law

needs to act on its behalf either as its limb or as its

agency, as forcefully contended by the opposing counsel.



</p><p id="p_36">     (e) <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_8">Section 5(4)</a> as rightly pointed out by Mr.Dhyan

Chinnappa, does not designate any particular authority

unlike the ones in New India Assurance Company Ltd

Vs. Raghuvir Singh Narang, (2010) 5 SCC 335 and in

Municipal Corporation, Bhopal Vs. State of M.P, (1998)

2   MPLJ   512;      both   these     decisions   are     cited   by

Mr.Rajagopal;   in    the   former,     Section   41(2)     of    the

Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and

Industrial Townships Act, 1965 had designated "the

Collector" to and before whom the resignation needed to

be applied; in the later, Section 18 of M.P. Municipal

Corporation Act, 1956 had specified the Mayor to whom

notice of resignation was to be addressed; thus, there

being a marked difference between the text of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_9">section 5(4)</a>

of the 1974 Act and the language of the provisions of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               16</span>

Acts involved in the above two rulings, there is no pari

materia legal regimes and consequently, the ratio laid

down therein cannot be pressed into service; after all, a

case is an authority for the proposition that it actually

articulates in a given lego-factual matrix, and not for all

that which logically follows therefrom, as Lord Halsbury

more than a century ago had put it in Quinn Vs.

Leathem, [1901] UKHL 2.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">      (f)   Mr.Ashok Haranahalli is more than justified in

contending that, to understand the meaning of "State

Government" employed in <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_10">Section 5(4)</a> of the 1974 Act and

its   functional   aspects,   one   has   to   advert   to   the

constitutional scheme arising inter alia from Articles 53,

74, 154, 163 &amp; 361 of the Constitution; our Constitution

although deals with the Union and the State Executive

separately, the provisions relating thereto follow a common

pattern; the Constitution divides the subject under four

sub-heads viz., the Chief Executive, the Council of

Ministers, the Law Officers and the Conduct of Business;

the President is the chief executive of the Union of India

and in him vests the executive power of the Union vide

Articles 52 &amp; 53; similarly, at the Provincial level, the

Governor is the chief executive of the State and it's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                  17</span>

executive power is vested in him vide Articles 153 &amp; 154;

<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_11">Article 361</a> provides absolute immunity to both these high

constitutional       functionaries,    for   the    exercise    and

performance of the powers &amp; duties of their offices because

neither the President nor the Governor exercises the

executive functions individually or personally; the exercise

of the executive power is a formally function of the

President or the Governor as the case may be; in order to

aid &amp; advise the President in the exercise of his function,

<a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_12">Article 74(1)</a> provides for a Council of Ministers with the

Prime Minister at the head; similarly, at the State level

<a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_13">Article 163</a> provides for a Council of Ministers with the

Chief Minister at the head; both these Articles relate to the

conduct of business of the Government;
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">       (g)      It is pertinent to mention that the Executive

power of the Union or the State is described by the Apex

Court in Ram Jawaya Kapur Vs. State of Punjab, AIR

1955       SC   549, ordinarily as being "the residue of

Governmental functions that remain after legislative &amp;

judicial     functions   are   taken   away"       and   that   they

necessarily include the execution of the laws; Mr.H.M.

Seervai in his "Constitutional Law of India", 4th Edition,

Volume 2 (Tripathi Publication) at Page 2042 states
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                             18</span>

"...according to Dr.Ambedkar, .............. the President of

India was bound to accept the advice of his Ministers..." At

pages 2034 &amp; 2036 of the same Volume, Mr.Seervai has

churned out the ratio decidendi of Apex Court decisions (a

set of two) in Samsher Singh Vs. State of Punjab, (1974)

2   SCC    831   vociferously    pressed   into   service   by

Mr.Haranahalli; only the relevant ones to the case in hand

are reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">           "(a) Our Constitution generally embodies
     the Parliamentary or the Cabinet form of Govt. on
     the British model, both for the Union and the
     States.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">           (b) It is a fundamental principle of English
     constitutional law that the Sovereign does not
     act on his own responsibility but on the
     advice      of    his  Ministers    who accept
     responsibility and who command the confidence
     of the House of Commons. This principle of
     English constitutional law is embodied in our
     Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">           (c) It follows from the British form of
     Parliamentary or Cabinet Govt. that the
     President and the Governors are the formal or
     Constitutional heads of the Union and the States
     and they must act with the aid and advice of the
     Council of Ministers except where a contrary
     provision is made by the Constitution."</blockquote><p id="p_41">


</p><p id="p_42">     (h)   Mr.Haranahalli heavily banks upon another

recent decision in A.A. Padmanabhan Vs. State of Kerala,

(2018) 4 SCC 537 wherein, the highest Court of the

country having surveyed the growth of this branch of law

has thus observed at para 16: "...Except the discretionary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                             19</span>

functions of the Governor, he does not exercise any

executive functions individually or personally. When a

Minister takes an action according to the Rules of

Business, it is both in substance and in form the action of

the Governor..." Both Mr.Dhyan Chinnappa and Mr.Ashok

Haranahalli take the court through the provisions of

Karnataka Government (Transaction of Business) Rules,

1977 in support of their contention that the subject matter

in question falls within the domain of the Chief Minister;

item 15 in II Schedule to these Rules puts into the hands

of the Chief Minister, the matters relating to appointment

inter alia to the post of "Chairman and Members of any

other Commission, Authority, Tribunal or Committees

created by Statute"; the text &amp; context of this provision

which is generic in nature, the word "appointment"

employed therein needs to be understood to include inter

alia resignation of the appointee, as well; this apart, Rule

15(1) of 1977 Rules vests prerogative powers in the Chief

Minister to take decisions even in respect of matters of

business that normally belong to the domain of other

Ministers as per the 1977 Rules; the said Rule reads:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">          "15. (1) The Chief Minister may call for
     papers from any Department and express his
     views and also tender advise on any matter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                 20</span>

       coming within the purview of the business
       allocated to any Minister."</blockquote><p id="p_43">



</p><p id="p_44">       (i)   The text &amp; context of the relevant constitutional

provisions as interpreted in Samsher Singh supra, coupled

with the provisions of the 1977 Rules show the prominent

position assigned to the Chief Minister of the State; true it

is, that the Chief Minister is not the manifestation of the

State unlike the King in England; but he acts as a limb of

the Government, is not legally disputable; therefore, the

letter of resignation addressed to the "Hon'ble Chief

Minister,    Government    of    Karnataka"   can    be   safely

construed as the one addressed to the "State Government"

in terms of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_14">section 5(4)</a> of the 1974 Act; an argument to

the contrary falls foul of the constitutional scheme as

consistently articulated by the Apex Court in a catena of

decisions     including    Samsher      Singh       and    A.A.

Padmanabhan, supra.
</p>
<p id="p_45">

</p><p id="p_46">       11.   As to other incidental submissions at the

Bar:
</p>
<p id="p_47">       (a)   Mr.Rajagopal referred to the text of <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_15">Article 300</a>

of the Constitution to buttress his argument that the letter

of resignation made to the Chief Minister cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                21</span>

construed as the one made to the State Government; he

submitted that it is only the Secretary of the department

concerned who can be termed as State Government going

by the text of <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_16">section 5(4)</a> r/w relevant provisions of the

1977 Rules; <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_17">Article 300</a> speaks of suits and proceedings to

be instituted by or against the Govt. of India or the Govt. of

a State, as a juristic person; the Apex Court has construed

this Article keeping in view the Transaction of Business

Rules concerned vide Secretary Vs. Mohinder Singh

Jagden, (1996) 6 SCC 229; this court is at loss to know

as to how this Article is relevant to the case at hands,

especially when what Secretary does needs to be construed

as what the Minister of the department concerned does

vide Padmanabhan Case supra; this view is supported by

the text of Section 19(1) of the GC Act, 1897 which is as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">              "In any <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_18">Central Act</a> or Regulation made
       after the commencement of this Act, it shall be
       sufficient, for the purpose of expressing that a law
       relative to the chief or superior of an office shall
       apply to the deputies or subordinates lawfully
       performing the duties of that office in the place of
       their superior, to prescribe the duty of the
       superior."</blockquote><p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">       It hardly needs to be stated that the Minister is the

head     of   the   department      concerned   by   virtue   of

Transaction/Allocation of Business Rules and that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                               22</span>

Secretaries regardless of their varying nomenclatures act

as his deputies, although in the formal paper works, the

names of these deputies are reflected; a contra argument

would render the Minister subservient to other public

servants, if not redundant, and this would demean the

very Cabinet Form of Government which is enacted in our

Constitution.

<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">     (b)    Mr.Rajagopal's submission that the text of

<a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_19">Section 5(4)</a> of the 1974 Act being mandatory in nature,

the Chief Minister cannot be equated to the State

Government, does not appear to be sound for the

discussion, supra; whether the provision is mandatory or

directory, in the facts of the case, may not be relevant,

either; in fact, the opposing counsel did not dispute the

nature of the said provision nor did they resist the Writ

Petition on the ground of "substantial compliance of the

provision"; the short and long of their case was that the

Chief Minister acts as the limb of the State Government and

therefore, what is immediately addressed to the Chief

Minister is mediately addressed to the State Government

and further that any argument in variance thereof would

upset the constitutional principles by which the Government

of the day is run; in view of this, there is no need to discuss
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                              23</span>

the Rulings cited by Mr.Rajagopal for the proposition that

mandatory whereas the statutory duty imposed on the

shoulder of the Caesar, is directory.
