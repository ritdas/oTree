</p><p id="p_3">                          2.    The second respondent herein has filed the Original Application No.

                   164 of 2015 (SZ) before the Tribunal contending that he is a social activist and

                   fighting against Corruption. The second respondent claims himself to be a whistle

                   blower and that he had brought to the notice of the various authorities as well as

                   the Courts regarding the violation of statutory rules and law by those who indulged

                   in such acts.    He also would contend that he has taken profound interest in

                   environment protection and has even made films for the National Bio-Diversity

                   Authority of India (Incredible India Incredible Biodiversity) and UNDP (Enchanting
http://www.judis.nic.in
                   Jharkhand Enchanting Biodiversity).      According to the second respondent, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                            3</span>

                   famous Buckingham Canal cutting across the City of Chennai from North to South

                   has been highly polluted and it poses serious health hazard to the general public

                   residing in the areas close to the banks, including him, who is also residing very

                   close to the canal bank in Tiruvanmaiyur area.          According to the second

                   respondent, the Buckingham Canal serves as an important water link during the

                   water upsurge, cyclonic storms and tsunami, however, the present condition of the

                   Buckingham Canal is dismal. It is also claimed that the major portion of Chennai

                   Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) Railway Line from Chennai Beach to

                   Velacherry rides on top of the Buckingham canal whereby the width of the canal

                   narrowed down considerably, restricting the free flow of the water in the canal. The

                   second respondent also furnished a tabulated statement before the Tribunal

                   indicating the various sections in the City through which the Buckingham Canal

                   flows. It is the grievance of the second respondent that the Buckingham Canal has

                   been highly polluted with dirty sewer water being let into the canal at many places

                   owing to which it stinks badly and the stagnant water has become a breeding

                   source for many sporadic disease, both water borne and air borne. Therefore,

                   during heavy rains, the Buckingham Canal would witness blockage of rain water

                   which inundates several parts of the City with sewage water. As the sewage water

                   is let into Buckingham Canal, the ground water table has been gravely affected in

                   the City and the water received through the bore wells have been contaminated.

                   The second respondent, highlighting the above aspects, has also submitted a

                   representation dated 17.09.2015 to the third respondent and requested to take

                   appropriate remedial action, however, no action has been taken thereof. In such

                   circumstances, the second respondent has filed the Original Application before the
http://www.judis.nic.in
                   Tribunal seeking for a direction to direct the respondents 1 and 2 therein to remove
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                4</span>

                   the debris, plants and water hyacinth immediately so that there will not be any

                   obstruction in the canal; directing the second respondent to dredge the canal for

                   easy passage of water and to remove the blockage at Adyar river side; directing the

                   second respondent to lay proper embankments along with canal in the city;

                   directing the third respondent to plug any sewer water inlets and to direct the fourth

                   respondent to furnish complete details of budget allocation under the National

                   Waterways (NW 4) project and in particular for the Buckingham Canal from North

                   Chennai to South Chennai, details of nature of work undertaken and money spent.



</p><p id="p_4">                           3.      On notice, the respondents in the Original Application, including the

                   second respondent/Petitioner herein, have filed various reports to the Tribunal

                   indicating the maintenance work undertaken by them to mitigate the problems

                   faced by the general public owing to the effects of the pollution caused by the

                   Buckingham Canal and the future course of action which they proposed to take.

                   Notwithstanding the various reports filed by the respondents in the Original

                   Application, the Tribunal passed the order dated 13.02.2019 imposing a fine of

                   Rs.100 Crores upon the State Government. Aggrieved by the same, the present

                   writ petition is filed.

                   order dated 09.04.2019 granting interim stay of operation of the order dated

                   13.02.2019 passed by the Tribunal for two weeks. However, in the order dated

                   09.04.2019, it was made clear that the question of maintainability of the writ petition

                   will be gone into by this Court at the time of final disposal of the writ petition.

                   the various departments in an effort to revamp the Buckingham Canal. According

                   to the learned Advocate General, restoration of Coovum River has been at the top

                   crores has also been initiated. In effect, a total sum of Rs.190.90 crores have

                   been disbursed towards implementation of the projects. Even these developments

                   have been brought to the notice of the Tribunal through the reports dated

                   05.03.2018, 18.05.2018, 20.07.2018, 26.10.2018 and 12.12.2018.            Even as on

                   date, removal of 1648 Metric Tonne of solid waste has been fully completed,

                   fencing work has been completed for a length of 2.66 kilometer and the work in

                   respect of fencing the remaining area at a length of 8.12 kilometer is in progress.

                   Above all, even after the order dated 13.02.2019, which is impugned in this writ

                   petition, has been passed, in compliance with the various directions issued by the

                   Tribunal, the Chief Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu had conducted six

                   fortnightly review meetings on 08.03.2019, 19.03.2019, 01.04.2019, 15.04.2019,

                   06.05.2019 and 20.05.2019. Even the Chief Secretary to the Government of Tamil

                   Nadu appeared before the Tribunal on 23.04.2019 and informed the progress in the

                   on-going works as well as the works proposed to be taken. In such circumstances,

                   the learned Advocate General would contend that the order dated 13.02.2019 is

                   legally not sustainable and prayed for allowing this writ petition.

                   General would contend that the first Division Bench of this Court, in the order dated

                   07.07.2015 made in WP No. 35098 of 2013, in P. Sundararajan vs. Deputy

                   Registrar, National Green Tribunal, relying upon the order passed by Honourable

                   Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/83270443/" id="a_2">Union of India and others vs. Major General Shri Kant Sharma

                   and another</a> reported in 2015 (6) SCC 773, which arises out of an order passed by

                   Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of The Constitution of India is not maintainable.

                   According to the learned Advocate General, the provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/50690063/" id="a_4">Armed

                   Forces Tribunal Act</a>, 2007 stands on a different footing from that of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_5">National

                   Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010. By quoting <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_6">Section 22</a> of the National Green Tribunal

                   Act, 2010, the learned Advocate General would contend that "Any person

                   aggrieved by any award, decision or order of the Tribunal, may file an appeal to the

                   Supreme Court, meaning thereby, it is not mandatory to file an appeal against the

                   order passed by the National Green Tribunal before the Honourable Supreme Court

                   and the writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of The Constitution of India is maintainable

                   considering the usage of the word "may" in <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_8">Section 22</a> of the National Green

                   Tribunal Act, if there is any violation of principles of natural justice. Whereas, under

                   appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court against the final decision of the Tribunal."

                   Thus, the learned Advocate General sought to make a distinction between the

                   provisions under <a href="/doc/50690063/" id="a_10">The Armed Forces Tribunal Act</a>, 2007 and <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_11">National Green

                   between the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_12">National Green Tribunal Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_13">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986

                   inasmuch as the appeal provisions under both the Acts are similarly worded.

                   According to him, under <a href="/doc/271754/" id="a_14">Section 23</a> of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, it is

                   clearly stated that "may prefer an appeal" against such order to the Supreme Court.

                   The learned Advocate General therefore submitted that in fact, the Honourable

                   Supreme Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/925018/" id="a_15">State of Karnataka vs. Vishwabharathi House

</p><p id="p_13">                          9.    Above all, it is contended by the learned Advocate General that the

                   <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_25">National Green Tribunal Act</a> has been enacted pursuant to the decision taken at the

                   United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de

                   Janerio during June 1992 in which India participated. Thereafter the said legislation

                   was brought into effect by invoking the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/741672/" id="a_26">Article 253</a> of The

                   Constitution of India.   As the National Green Tribunal has been constituted by

                   invoking the powers conferred under the Constitution of India, the orders passed by

                   the Tribunal are amenable to the jurisdictions conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> or 227 of

                   The Constitution of India. In this context, reliance was also placed on the decision

                   Advocate General to contend that the power under Articled 226 of The Constitution

                   of India can be invoked, in matters relating to public interest, even if the same falls

                   within the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. Therefore, it is contended by the learned

                   Advocate General that the instant writ petition is maintainable under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> of

                   Tribunal did not afford sufficient and adequate opportunity to the respondents in the

                   Original Application.    Before passing the order dated 13.06.2019, the various

                   reports submitted by the respondents in the Original Application have not been

                   taken note of by the Tribunal. When the order dated 13.06.2019 has been passed

                   in violation of principles of natural justice, the writ petition is maintainable before

                   this Honourable Court without resorting to the alternative remedy provided for

                   preferring an appeal as against the order dated 13.06.2019 of the Tribunal.

                   contend that it is incorrect to state that the Tribunal has passed the order dated

                   13.06.2019 without affording sufficient or adequate opportunity to the petitioner

                   herein.      The Tribunal was constrained to pass the order dated 13.06.2019

                   inasmuch as the petitioner did not comply with many of the directions issued by the

                   Tribunal. The Tribunal has concluded that the repeated failure of the regulatory

                   authorities to perform their public duty has resulted in large scale and continuous

                   damage to the environment and public health and therefore, it was constrained to

                   pass the order dated 13.02.2019. In any event, it cannot be said that the order

                   dated 13.02.2019 has been passed without affording opportunity to the petitioner or

                   there is violation of principles of natural justice warranting this Court to entertain this

                   writ petition filed by the petitioner. When there is a specific provision under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_30">Section

                   22</a> of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 to file an appeal before the

                   the Tribunal complaining poor maintenance and immense pollution caused to the

                   water body and the failure on the part of the Government of Tamil Nadu to tackle

                   the same. Admittedly, the Original Application has been filed by the second

                   respondent on 01.10.2015 and on notice, the petitioner herein has filed their reply

                   statement on 19.10.2015. Even as admitted by the Petitioner herein, they have

                   filed various status reports on various dates bringing to the notice of the Tribunal

                   the progress made by them in the project commenced for restoration of

                   Buckingham Canal and those reports have been taken on record. While so, it

                   cannot be said that the Tribunal did not afford sufficient or adequate opportunity to

                   the petitioner. Even in the order dated 13.02.2019, the Tribunal has recorded the

                   various status reports filed on behalf of the respondents in the Original Application

                   in para Nos. 8 to 24, date-wise. It is also seen from the records that the order

                   dated 13.02.2019 has been passed by the Tribunal after hearing the counsel for the

                   petitioner through Video-conferencing. When such being the position, the question

                   of violation of principles of natural justice does not arise. We hold that the Tribunal

                   13.02.2019 and therefore the question of violation of principles of natural justice will

                   Chairperson along with a Judicial Member and an Expert Member. The Tribunal

                   was constituted for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to

                   environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources,

                   including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment and giving relief and

                   compensation for damages to persons and property and for matters connected

                   therewith or incidental thereto.   <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_43">Section 14</a> of the Act confers powers on the

                   Tribunal to adjudicate all civil cases where a substantial question relating to

                   environment is involved. The Tribunal is also empowered to entertain appeal, as

                   an appellate authority, against the order or decision made by the appellate authority

                   under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_44">Section 28</a> of the Water (Pollution and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_45">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

                   other similar such Acts relating to environmental pollution.     Similarly, the order

                   passed by the Tribunal shall be challenged before the Supreme Court, as

                   contemplated under <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_46">Section 22</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">                          16.   However, according to the learned Advocate General, the word "may"

                   indicated in <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_47">Section 22</a> of the Act would mean and include that an aggrieved person

                   may either approach the Supreme Court of India or this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_48">Article 226</a> or

                   227 of The Constitution of India. Such submission made by the learned Advocate

                   General cannot be countenanced. <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_49">Section 22</a> of the Act clearly stipulate that any

                   person aggrieved by any award, decision or order of the Tribunal may file an appeal

                   to the Supreme Court. The words included in <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_50">Section 22</a> of the Act are crystal clear

                   that any order, direction, award or decision of the Tribunal can be subjected to

                   challenge only before the Supreme Court of India and the Supreme Court is the

                   appellate Authority to entertain an appeal against the decision of the Tribunal.
http://www.judis.nic.in
                   Therefore, as per <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_51">Section 22</a> of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                             14</span>

                   jurisdiction of this Court has been impliedly excluded, by inclusion of the words

                   "Supreme Court" and therefore, the writ petition filed before this Court is not

                   maintainable.     When there is an efficacious and statutory remedy of appeal

                   available before the Honourable Supreme Court, this writ petition filed by the

                   petitioner, as against the order dated 13.02.2019 passed by the Tribunal, is not

                   maintainable.

<p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27">                          17.   Yet another submission of the learned Advocate General appearing

                   for the petitioner is that the Tribunal did not consider the various status reports and

                   other documentary evidence filed by the petitioner and it amounts to violation of

                   principles of natural justice, therefore, the writ petition is maintainable. We are not

                   inclined to accede to such submission made by the learned Advocate General

                   appearing for the petitioner. Even assuming that the Tribunal did not consider the

                   various records filed on behalf of the petitioner, including the status reports, it will

                   not be a ground for us to entertain this writ petition especially when the records

                   produced before us shows that the Tribunal, before passing the order dated

                   13.02.2019 has afforded sufficient and adequate opportunity to parties to the

                   Original Application to putforth their submissions. In such view of the matter, we

                   hold that the order dated 13.02.2019 has not been passed in violation of principles

                   of natural justice and accordingly, the argument advanced by the learned Advocate

                   General is rejected.

                   not maintainable in view of the alternative remedy of an appeal provided under

                   <a href="/doc/108726654/" id="a_52">Section 22</a> of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, we are not inclined to go into
