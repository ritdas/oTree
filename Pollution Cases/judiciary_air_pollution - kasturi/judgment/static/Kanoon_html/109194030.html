Central Government to take such measures as it deems necessary or
expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the
environment and preventing controlling and abating environmental
pollution. <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_2">Section 6</a> of the said Act empowers the Central Government,

Government to make rules for carrying out the purposes of this Act. Rule

Government may take into consideration, inter alia, the maximum
allowable limits of concentration of various environment pollutants
(including noise) for an area, while prohibiting or restricting the location
of industries and carrying on of processes and operations in different
areas. In exercise of the aforesaid powers, the Central Government
framed rules called the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules,

 2000. Rule 3(1) of the said Rules provides that the ambient air quality
standards in respect of noise for different areas zones shall be such, as is
specified in the Schedule annexed to these rules. Clause (3) of the said
Rules provides that the State Government shall take measures for
abatement of noise, including the noise emanating from vehicular
movements and ensure that the existing noise levels do not exceed the
ambient air quality standards specified under these rules. Rule 4 (1)
provides that the noise levels in any area/ zone shall not exceed the
ambient air quality standards in respect of noise as specified in the
Schedule.

Development Authority stated to be having about 20,000 residential flats
inhabited by more than 60,000 persons. The said area is stated to have
more than 20 schools besides Jawaharlal Nehru University and various
institutions including Indian Spinal Injury Centre, Fortis Hospital and
Apollo Hospital Centre. The area also has a number of shopping malls.
The case of the Society for Protection of Cultural Heritage Environment
Traditions and Promotions of National Awareness, the petitioner in
W.P(C) No.9337/2009 is that though the noise level in the area of Vasant
Kunj is roughly between 74 to 84 dB(A) due to the noise created by over
flying of aircrafts and as per the report submitted by the Chairman,
Airport Association, the noise level touches up to 99 decibels at the time
the aircraft approaches for landing and crosses 98 decibels at the lateral
stage. This is also the case of the petitioner that the noise pollutants
created by aircrafts is causing noise and affecting the health of the
residents of the Vasant Kunj and nearby area, thereby violating their
fundamental rights to lives and liberty guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the

 Constitution, besides, contravening the Noise Pollution (Regulation and
Control) Rules, 2000. The petitioner has accordingly sought, inter alia,
directions to the respondents to stop flying of Aircrafts over these areas.
The petitioners are also seeking direction to the respondent to
immediately provide noise barriers along with the runways at the IGI
Airport. They have also sought quashing of granting environment
clearance for construction of 3rd runway at IGI Airport, New Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.     W.P(C) No.12719/2009 has been filed by Indian Spinal Injuries
Hospital which is a hospital situated in Vasant Kunj area. The case of the
petitioner is that the sound emitted by the aircrafts flying over the hospital
is in the range of 75 dB(A) to 84 dB(A) which is clearly beyond the
prescribed limits, as a result of which the in-house patients of the hospital
are constantly suffering from noise pollution caused by the low flying of
the aircrafts. The prayer made in this petition is also identical to the
prayers made in W.P(C) No.9337/2009.

<p id="p_10">4.     W.P(C) No.13675/2009 has been filed by Bijwasan Gram Vikas
Samiti and others on similar allegations. Bijwasan also is an area nearby
the IGI Airport. The prayer made in this petition is to direct the
respondents to take necessary measures to mitigate the noise pollution
caused by the aircrafts.

18.10.2010. <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_6">The Act</a> provides for establishment of a Tribunal to exercise
the jurisdiction, powers and authority conferred on such Tribunal under
the said Act. <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_7">Section 14</a> of the Act, to the extent it is relevant, provides
that the Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction over all civil cases where a

 substantial question relating to environment, including enforcement of
any legal right relating to environment, is involved and such question
arises out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule
I. Sub section (2) of the said Section provides that Tribunal shall hear the
disputes arising from the questions referred to in sub-section (1) settle
such disputes and pass order thereon. <a href="/doc/177298014/" id="a_8">Section 15(1)</a> of the said Act
provides that the Tribunal may, by an order, provide, (a) relief and
compensation to the victims of pollution and other environmental damage
arising under the enactments specified in the Schedule 1, including
accident occurring while handling any hazardous substance, (b) for
restitution of property damaged and (c) for restitution of the environment
for such area or areas, as the Tribunal may think fit.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       Schedule-I of the said Act includes the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_9">Environment (Protection)
Act</a>, 1986 as well as the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981. The expression "air pollutant" has been defined in the later Act to
mean any solid, liquid or gaseous substance (including noise) present in
the atmosphere in such concentration as may be or tend to be injuries to
human beings or other living creatures or plants or property or
environment. „Air pollution‟ has been defined in <a href="/doc/53690461/" id="a_11">Section 2(b)</a> to mean the
presence in the atmosphere of any air pollutant.
</p>
<p id="p_13">6.     It would be seen from a perusal of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_12">Section 14</a> of the National
Green Tribunal Act, 2010 that before a matter can be brought to the
Tribunal, it should fulfill two requirements. Firstly, it should involve a
substantial question relating to environment and secondly, such question




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P(C) Nos. 9337/2009, 12719/2009 &amp; 13675/2009              Page 6 of 8</span>
 should arise out of the implementation of one or more of the Acts
specified in Schedule-I to the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_14">7.       Considering the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_13">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986,
The Environment Protection Rules, 1986 and the Noise Pollution
(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 as also the definition of noise
pollutants given in the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
1981, it can hardly be disputed that these petitions involve a substantial
question relating to environment including enforcement of legal rights
relating to environment and such questions arise out of the
implementation particularly of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_15">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. If
the noise level in Vasant Kunj, Bijwasan and other areas in the vicinity of
Terminal-III of IGI Airport exceeds the limits laid down in the Schedule,
that would be substantial question relating to environment and also
amount to violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment (Protection) Act</a>,
1986. Thus, these petitions fulfill the twin requirements of <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_17">Section 14</a> of
the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Had these petitions been filed
after constitution of National Green Tribunal, the said Tribunal would
have jurisdiction to hear and decide these petitions and pass appropriate
orders thereon. The Tribunal would have also the power to provide one or
more reliefs envisaged in <a href="/doc/105916374/" id="a_18">Section 15</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act,
2010.

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "39. We find it imperative to place on record a
               caution for consideration of the courts of
               competent jurisdiction that the cases filed and
               pending prior to coming into force of the NGT
               Act, involving questions of environment laws
               and/or relating to any of the seven statutes
               specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act, should
               also be dealt with by the specialized tribunal, that
               is the NGT, created under the provisions of the
               NGT Act. The Courts may be well advised to
               direct transfer of such cases to the NGT in its
               discretion, as it will be in the fitness of
               administration of justice."
</blockquote><p id="p_16">9.     Considering the above referred decision of the Supreme Court and
the issues involved in these petitions, as discussed hereinbefore, we are of
the view that these petitions should be transferred to the National Green
Tribunal. In our opinion, such an order would only subserve the interest
of justice. We ordered accordingly. Registry is directed to send the entire
record of these petitions to the Registrar of National Green Tribunal
within one week.
