                       -0-0-0-0-0-


     This writ petition is filed under Articles 226 and
227 of the Constitution of India praying to direct
respondent Nos.4 to 6 to prevent the Air and Water
Pollution by the Respondent Nos.1 and 12 or by any
other persons etc.


     This petition coming on for preliminary hearing
this day, Chief Justice made the following:-
                              4



                       ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ(Oral)


</p><p id="p_2">1.    This petition is moved by an <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_1">RTI Act</a>ivist on the

basis of the material showing consistent failure on the

part of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board in

taking any action against Respondent No.11 and 12,

who   have    admittedly    been    discharging   untreated

effluent into an open drain which ultimately joins

Bhadra      Canal    near     National     Highway-4     at

Shiramagondanahalli. Since there is no dispute about

the fact of consistent discharge of untreated effluent as

also about inaction on the part of the State Pollution

Control Board, it is not necessary to further delve into

the factual aspect of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.    However, by filing an affidavit of learned advocate

appearing for Respondent No.11 and 12, it is stated that

the work of establishing a sewage treatment and

recycling plant is already entrusted to M/s.Ecosoft

Water Technology, Bangalore, and the work is in

progress.    It is further declared and undertaken that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             5</span>


sewage    treatment   and       recycling   plant   will   be

constructed in the premises of Respondent No.12 and

will be operational within seven months and latest by

31.3.2015.    It is also stated by learned counsel

Mr.Gururaj Joshi appearing for the State Pollution

Control Board that at least now Respondent No.11 and

12 shall not be permitted to discharge untreated

effluent outside the premises of Respondent No.12 and

for that purpose the premises shall be inspected by

Inspector of Pollution Control Board once every week

and in case, if, any violation of the provisions of The

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

is found, immediate and energetic action including

direction to stop the offending activity and filing of

criminal cases will be taken up.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.   Upon the above statements made and recorded,

the petition is not pressed for any further relief at this

stage. It is however painfully noted during the course of

hearing that the State Pollution Control Board appeared

to have practically abdicated its duties and functions by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             6</span>


not taking any action worth the name for prevention of

pollution of the common and important water resource.

It was in that context that learned counsel Mr. Gururaj

Joshi submitted that the State Pollution Control Board

shall take up this matter at the higher level so as to

issue necessary standing instructions to all the Officers

of the regional offices of the State Pollution Control

Board instructing them to take immediate and energetic

action in such cases of gross violation of mandatory

legal provisions of the aforesaid Acts.    He also stated

that the instructions proposed to be issued may also

include a stipulation that conscious failure of the

officers in discharging their duties would be treated as

dereliction of duty for the purpose of taking disciplinary

action and the damage caused to the environment

because of such dereliction of duty may be quantified

and ordered to be recovered from the salary of the

officers concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.   Accordingly,     recording   the   above   statement,

petition is disposed with no order as to cost with the

expectation that the State Pollution Control Board
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           7</span>


would take up the matter seriously and file before this

Court, within fifteen days, the copies of instructions

being circulated in terms of the statements recorded

hereinabove.
