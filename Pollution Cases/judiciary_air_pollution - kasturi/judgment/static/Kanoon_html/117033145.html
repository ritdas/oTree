GURCHARAN SINGH SARAN, PRESIDING JUDICIAL MEMBER

                                ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            Complainant has filed this complaint against the

opposite parties (hereinafter referred as Ops) under <a href="/doc/1749394/" id="a_2">Section 17</a> of

the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short the Act) on the

averments that Op Nos. 1 &amp; 2 advertised their project, namely,

'Motia Marvel Homes' on the land situated at Barewal Road,

Backside Gurdev Hospital, Ludhiana. Brochure was issued

reflecting the amenities to be provided and highlighted structural

and proposed building plans. It provided 60% open space to be left

in the project by mentioning that the same would be allowed to the

allottees and residents to enjoy the nature. Against the 40%

covered area, club house, swimming pool, lush playground, billiard

table, health club and multipurpose recreational hall and round the

clock security was promised. It was also highlighted of independent

car parking, high speed elevators of Kone or OTIS Company

having capacity of 10 passengers with automatic rescue device

system. It comprised 48 flats and 8 towers i.e. 6 flats in each tower.

Allured by the highlights of the project, the complainant agreed to

purchase flat No. 4, 3rd floor in Tower C for a total price of Rs. 52

Lacs. Agreement to sell dated 29.1.2015 was entered into between

the parties. After completion of formalities and payment of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                 3</span>



expenses for stamp duty etc., sale deed Vasika No. 11245 dated

19.3.2015 was executed. It has been further mentioned that

complainant and her sister are only two children of their parents

married at Ludhiana. Her parents are living at Khanna, therefore, in

the old age, they have nobody to depend upon except complainant

and her sister. Looking at the future need, complainant's husband

Amit Kumar also purchased a flat in the said project from original

allottee Anoop Bansal for his personal needs. Number of amenities

were not provided in the project. The complainant and her husband

approached Ops but with no result, then complainant got served a

legal notice dated 29.4.2016 calling upon Op Nos. 1 &amp; 2 to provide

all amenities alongwith completion certificate. When no reply was

received, complainant referred consumer complaint No. 403 of

2016 before the District Forum, Ludhiana. Ops did not appear and

were proceeded ex-parte. They challenged the proceedings before

the Hon'ble State Commission and the said prayer was declined in

F.A. No. 619 of 2016. The said order was further challenged before

the Hon'ble National Commission in Revision Petition No. 2800 of

2016, which was also dismissed vide order dated 16.12.2016,

however, the learned District Forum on surmises and conjectures

dismissed the complaint filed by the complainant holding that the

facilities mentioned in the brochure have since been superseded

on account of sale deed and agreement to sell having been

executed, therefore, the facilities not forming part of agreement to

sell need not to be provided by Op Nos. 1 &amp; 2. The order of the

District Forum was challenged in F.A. No. 280 of 2017. In the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                    4</span>



meantime, judgment of the Hon'ble National Commission in case of

'Ambrish Kumar Shukla &amp; Others Versus Ferros Infrastructure Pvt.

Ltd.' had come into being, which had laid down that the issues with

regard to facilities, the value of the subject matter is to be taken

into consideration to decide the pecuniary jurisdiction. Accordingly,

the State Commission allowed the complainant to withdraw the

complaint as well as the appeal as the complaint was not

maintainable before the District Forum and also granted a

permission to file a fresh complaint on the same cause of action

vide order dated 11.9.2017. The facilities as detailed in the

brochure are not existing at the spot as Ops have installed lifts of

Schindler   Company with capacity of 8 persons whereas in the

brochure they had promised to provide OTIS/KONE lifts with

capacity of 10 persons with automatic rescue device, there would

be 60% space kept open to enjoy nature and to inhale the bounty

of natural surrounding but only a small ground has been left and

the remaining has been covered under the construction, swimming

pool has not been constructed and there is no provision of club

house/ health club and billiards table alongwith multipurpose

recreation hall. There is no fire fighting gas or water and only box of

fire fighting cable have been installed. There would be green trees

and beautiful surroundings adjoining to the wall. Ops had left no

space for planting trees. In the brochure and sale deed, single

separate parking space was proposed and for every flat owner but

no parking lot has been made, they have failed to install fountain in

the middle of the park, failed to install glass to cover the building,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                        5</span>



completion/occupation certificate of the project and apartment to

the complainant has not been applied with the Competent

Authorities. They have also failed to take approval from the Airport

Authority of India. Ops have mis-utilized the FAR permitted by the

Regulatory Authority by constructing 8 Pent Houses over and

above 48 flats on the top of every tower. Therefore, the possession

of the flat handed over to the complainant is in fact incomplete and

illegal possession. There is violation of Municipal Corporation Act

as well as PAPRA, 1995. Alleging unfair trade practice and

deficiency in services on the part of Op, this complaint has been

filed by the complainant against the Ops seeking following

directions:-

not a consumer as defined under the CP Act as one flat has been

purchased by the complainant, 2nd flat has been purchased by

Ramesh Kumar, her father in law and 3rd flat has been purchased

by the husband of the complainant Amit Kumar, therefore, the flat

was booked just to earn the profit and for that reason, the

complainant is not covered under the definition of the consumer as

defined under the CP Act; Marvel Home Society, Barewal Road,

Ludhiana has been constituted under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_3">Societies Act</a> and the

building and other common utility facilities. However, neither the

complainant nor her husband has paid the maintenance charges of

the entire building as Rs. 4,000/- per month w.e.f. October, 2016.

Without paying the maintenance charges, the complainant is not

entitled to common utility facilities; the buyer's agreement was

lead their respective evidence.

<p id="p_6">5.          In support of his allegations, the complainant had

tendered into evidence affidavit of Mrs. Sheenu as Ex. C-A and

documents Exs. C-1 to C-36. On the other hand, Op Nos. 1 &amp; 2

had tendered into evidence affidavit of Vinod Kumar, Director of

Co. as Ex. OP1&amp;2/A, affidavits of residents of the Society Ex. Op-

1&amp;2/B to X and documents Exs. Op-1&amp;2/1 to 90.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.          We have heard the counsel for the complainant,

learned counsel for Op Nos. 1 &amp; 2 and have carefully gone through

the pleadings of the parties, evidence and documents on the record

with their assistance.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.          An objection has been taken by the counsel for the Ops

that the complainant is not a consumer because she had booked

the flat to earn the profit, which comes under the commercial

aspect and is not covered under <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_9">Section 2(1)(d)</a> of the Act.

According to them, complainant booked one flat and the 2nd flat

was purchased by her father-in-law Ramesh Kumar which was sold

by him to Smt. Amandeep Kaur w/o Ajitpal Singh of Ludhiana.

Ramesh Kumar is a separate family unit, therefore, in case father

in law of the complainant purchased any flat and sold it, it cannot

be said to be purchased by the same family. So far as purchasing

another flat by Amit Kumar husband of the complainant, it has been

alleged that it has been rented out. No direct evidence with regard

to renting out the premises/flat by Amit Kumar but they had made a

reference to the FIR Ex. Op-1&amp;2/13 in which there is reference of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                 13</span>



flat No. F-4, Marvel Home where tenant had committed suicide.

Even if a flat is on rent in that eventuality both the flats are with

complainant and her husband. The complainant in her complaint in

para No. 5 has stated that they are two sisters and they are the

only children of their parents, who are residing at Khanna. Her

parents are in the old age and there is nobody else to lookafter

them except the complainant and her sister, therefore, to look after

them a flat was booked by her so that her parents could be

properly looked-after. The counsel for the Ops have not brought

any evidence on the record that earlier the complainant and her

husband had purchased any other flat at Ludhiana and then sold it

at premium. No evidence that they are trading in real estate. In

case such an evidence is not produced on the record then it cannot

be said that they are not the consumer. In this regard, counsel for

the Ops has made a reference to the judgment of Andhra Pradesh

State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission reported as 2014

(1) CLT 78 "GYSN Murthy versus M/s Suchir India Infratech (P)

Ltd. &amp; Ors." wherein it was held that purchaser of more than one

flat cannot invoke jurisdiction of the Consumer Fora. He has

referred to another judgment of the Hon'ble National Commission II

(2008) CPJ 329 (NC) "Travel India Bureau Pvt. Ltd. versus

HUDA &amp; Ors." wherein it was observed that the purchase of

dwelling unit not for earning livelihood by means of self

employment. The transaction is for commercial purposes. He has

also referred to another judgment of the Hon'ble National

Commission reported as III (2017) CPJ 202 (NC) "Ravinder Kaur
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  14</span>



Sethi versus DLF Universal Ltd. &amp; Ors." that letting out of shop

is a commercial purpose. So far as the judgment "GYSN Murthy

versus M/s Suchir India Infratech (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors." and "Travel

India Bureau Pvt. Ltd. versus HUDA &amp; Ors." cannot be relied

upon in view of the latest judgments of the Hon'ble National

Commission that till the Ops proves that the allottee/complainant

had been trading in real estate then booking/purchasing more than

one flat cannot be straight away stated that it was for commercial

purposes and that he is not a consumer. In this regard, counsel for

the complainant has made a reference to the judgment 2017(3)

CLT 459 "Pranab Basak versus Suhas Chatterjee".               In that

case, two flats were booked by the complainant and a plea was

taken that the complainant had booked these flats for investment

purposes. It was observed by the Hon'ble National Commission

that unless it is established that the complainant is dealing in sale

and purchase or his real intention in booking the flat was to sell the

same on profit, on appreciation of the value of the real estate.

Further in "Kavita Ahuja versus Shipra Real Estate Ltd. and Jai

Krishna Estate Developer Pvt. Ltd.", 2016 (1) CPJ 31 it was

held by the Hon'ble National Commission that buyers of the

residential unit would be termed as consumer unless it is proved

that he/she had booked the same for commercial purposes. So far

the judgment "Ravinder Kaur Sethi versus DLF Universal Ltd. &amp;

Ors."(supra), it relates to the commercial property for which it is

the basic requirement to come under the CP Act that it was

purchased to earn livelihood by way of self employment, which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                   15</span>



cannot be make applicable to the residential unit for which there is

no such requirement. Therefore, keeping in view the pleadings,

evidence and the judgments referred by the counsel for the parties

and the fact that the Ops have not been able to bring on the record

any evidence that the complainant had been trading in real estate,

therefore, merely on the fact that the complainant and her husband

had two flats and in view of the explanation given by the

complainant in the complaint that it was booked to lookafter her

parents as they are two sisters residing at Ludhiana whereas her

parents are at Khanna and to properly lookafter them a flat was

purchased by her at Ludhiana, therefore, in no such circumstances,

it can be said that it was purchased for commercial purposes or

that the complainant is not a consumer.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.          A plea has been taken that the complaint filed by the

complainant is barred by limitation. The possession of the flat was

delivered on 19.3.2015 vide which sale deed was also executed in

favour of the complainant whereas this complaint was filed by the

complainant on 6.10.2017, not within the period of limitation but it is

pertinent to mention here that earlier the complainant had filed a

complaint No. 403 of 2016, which was dismissed and then an

appeal was filed before this Commission and in the meantime the

judgment 'Ambrish Kumar Shukla &amp; Others Versus Ferros

Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.' 2017(1) CPJ 1 was delivered by the

larger Bench of the Hon'ble National Commission and it was held

that pecuniary jurisdiction is to be counted on the basis of total sale

consideration and not on the basis of deficiency, therefore, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                               16</span>



complaint was not maintainable before the District Forum and on

the request of the complainant, the complaint and the appeal was

allowed to be withdrawn and then the fresh complaint has been

filed by the complainant on the same cause of action and an

application to condone the delay in filing the complaint was filed,

which was allowed vide order dated 8.1.2018. Therefore, now this

point cannot be raised by the counsel for the Ops that the

complaint is barred by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.          An objection has been taken that Marvel Home Society,

Barewal Road, Ludhiana is a necessary party because after the

possession of the flat, the maintenance work is to be looked-after

by Marvel Home Society.         It has further been stated that the

complainant is required to pay Rs. 4,000/- per month as

maintenance charges, the complainant is not paying these

charges. In this background, it was argued by the counsel for the

Ops that Marvel Home Society is a necessary party but it is

pertinent to mention here that the complainant has filed this

complaint with regard to not providing the facilities/amenities as

detailed in the brochure and no occupation/completion certificate,

which does not have any concern with Marvel Home Society. In

case the complainant has not paid the maintenance allowance then

any action as required under the Byelaws of the Marvel Home

Society can be taken by the Society. Therefore, we do not find any

force in the arguments raised by the counsel for the Ops that

Marvel Home Society is a necessary party.

</p><p id="p_12">10.         As stated above, in this complaint, the complainant has

contended that occupation/completion certificate was not taken by

the Ops from the Competent Authority before delivery of the

possession and that the facilities/amenities as detailed in the

brochure were not provided.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.         Firstly, dealing with the preposition whether the Ops are

under legal obligation to provide all the facilities/amenities as

detailed in the brochure or they are to act only in accordance with

the terms and conditions of the agreement. In case we go through

the brochure, the same has been brought on the record as Ex. C-1

in which it has been stated magnificence and splendor play in 40%

of our covered area, 60% space is kept open to enjoy nature.

Provision of swimming pool, club house and play ground,

emergency call switch, security room, fire hose reels for fire

protection &amp; intercom facility, KONE or OTIS 10 passengers lift

which will cover that in case of power failure, the lift does not stuck

up on the way and comes on the next station. 100% rain harvesting

etc. Whereas under the agreement to sell Ex. C-2, total cost of the

flat is Rs. 52 Lacs, Flat No. 4, Tower C, Third Floor. Definition of

super area, date of possession, parking area for two cars, its

maintenance etc. has been referred. There is no reference of any

amenities in the agreement as promised in the brochure. When any

brochure/advertisement is issued by the Ops, it has some meaning

because ordinary people apply in the project of the Ops seeing all

the facilities/amenities, which are going to be provided to them in

the project as highlighted in the brochure. To counter this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  18</span>



preposition, counsel for the Op has relied upon II (2006) CPJ 83

"Subhash Kumar Jain versus Chandigarh Housing Board &amp;

Anr." in which it was observed by the Hon'ble State Commission

that only tentative price is fixed under the brochure and pricing

policy cannot be challenged after allottee has taken the

possession. He has further referred on the same point judgment of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in II (2006) CPJ 1 (SC)

"PUDA     (Chief    Administrator) and Another         versus Mrs.

Shabnam Virk" that advertisement showing tentative price of flat

issued. Allottee consented and entered into an agreement

regarding payment of price determined by the Board and

possession was taken by adding the demanded amount. Additional

amount was demanded by the builder regarding increase in the

plinth area, ground area and payment of enhanced compensation

to land owners. Whereas in our case, there is no dispute with

regard to the price of the flat, which stand settled and it is same as

same mentioned in the agreement to sell to which the complainant

has   challenged.     The    challenge   is   with   regard   to   the

facilities/amenities as proposed in the brochure. Whereas counsel

for the complainant referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble National

Commission reported in 2009(1) CPJ 217 "Madan Builders

versus R.K. Saxena". In the housing advertisement, a false

representation was made in that glass capsule lift will be provided.

It was observed by the Hon'ble National Commission that there

was deficiencies as they failed to provide facilities as promised in

the advertisement/brochure, which amounts to deficiency in service
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                 19</span>



as well as unfair trade practice. A reference has been made to

another judgment 2010 (1) CPR 132 "The General Secretary,

(Shri Amol Mahapatra), Royal Garden Residents Welfare

Association versus The Managing Director, (Shri Girish Batra),

M/s Padmini Infrastructure (I) Ltd.". In that case, Op developer

failed to provide necessary facilities according to the terms of the

agreement given in the brochure. It was observed with regard to

water supply system was defective and fire safety measures were

inadequate. It was observed as a gross deficiency in service for

non-provision of necessary facilities. In another judgment by the

Chandigarh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission

reported as 2015 (1) CLT 160 "Ansal Lotus Melange Projects

Pvt. Ltd. and others versus Ibensreet Singh Bajwa", Car

parking was not provided as per the brochure. It was observed that

it is a deficiency in service. Apart from that there is another

judgment of the Hon'ble National Commission reported as "IV

(2014) CPJ 172 (NC) "Sahara India Commercial Corporation

Ltd. &amp; Ors. Versus Mukamala Nataraja Rao &amp; Anr." In that case,

infrastructure facilities expressly assured in brochure not provided.

Complaint was allowed by the State Commission. It was observed

by the Hon'ble National Commission that several facilities and

services assured to purchasers of residential unit in Sahara States

Township has not been provided. Hospital a major facility promised

was yet to start. Defects in the construction and long delays in

provision of services like potable water, external electrification,

parks and gardens amounts to deficiency in service in which there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  20</span>



is a reference of the distinction made by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court with regard to common areas and facilities and community

and other facilities like schools, hospitals, community centres,

shops etc. and it has been held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">            "There is a marked difference between 'common areas

            and facilities' and 'community and commercial facilities'.

            A colonizer is duty bound to provide all the common

            areas and facilities as per Section 3(f), except

            community and commercial facilities referred to in

            Section 3(f)(7). "Common areas and facilities" referred

            to in Section 3(f)(7) of the Apartment Act has a co-

            relation with the 'Community and Commercial Facilities'

            referred to in <a href="/doc/161235/" id="a_10">Section 3(3)(a)(iv)</a> of the Development

            Act. It is for that reason that a discretion has been given

            to the colonizer to either provide the same or not to

            provide the same in the declaration referred to in

            Section 3(f) of the Apartment Act. The expression 'may'

            used in Section 3(f)(7) of the Apartment Act clearly

            indicates that no duty is cast on the colonizer to give an

            undivided     interest   over   those   community      and

            commercial facilities exclusively to the apartment

            owners of a particular colony, since the same have to

            be enjoyed by other apartment owners of DLF City,

            Phase I, II and III as well. Even otherwise, the colonizer

            could not have parted with his ownership rights

            exclusively to one Colony alone."

Commission were upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been

referred as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">            "This is a case where we need to consider the impact of

            the conduct of OP on the buyers of Pushpanjali Farms.

            No special expertise is required to appreciate that the

            OP would have realized significantly lower price from

            these farms, had the project been marketed without the

            country club. Therefore, the element of loss suffered by

            individual   farm    purchasers      cannot   be   ignored.

            Simultaneously, we also need to consider the future

            impact on consumers at large. If the Consumer Fora

            were to allow the service providers to benefit from such

            conduct, the latter will be encouraged to renege on their

            commitments, without any fear of the law. As already

            observed, in this case, failure of the Op to provide the

            country club tantamounts to a deficiency of service as

<p id="p_15">There is another judgment of the Hon'ble National Commission

reported as II (2011) CPJ 158 (NC) "GDA versus Alok Chandra

Sharma" that the contention of the Op that possession cannot be

delivered due to High Court's stay order not acceptable as no stay

in respect of particular land by the Court. Brochure clearly states

possession within two years. Deficiency in house and lack of civil

facilities proved. Op liable for deficiency in service. On the basis of

all these judgments, the plea taken by the Ops that once there was

an agreement to sell between the parties then the parties cannot

go beyond the agreement to sell and facilities/amenities as referred

in the brochure were never agreed and cannot be provided but the

counsel for the Ops was unable to refer judgments contrary to the

judgments of the Hon'ble National Commission and the State

Commission referred above in which it has been held that in case

any     amenities/facilities    has    been      referred    in    the

advertisement/brochure then the builder/developer is under legal

obligation to provide these facilities, otherwise, it will amount to

unfair trade practice as well as deficiency in services. Therefore we

do not agree with the plea raised by the counsel for the Ops that

the amenities/facilities as referred by the Ops cannot be provided

to him as there was no reference in the agreement to sell.

</p><p id="p_16">12.         It has been further contended that after agreement to

sell, the sale deed has also been executed between the parties, the

same has been referred on the record as Ex. C-3 wherein the

complainant had expressed his satisfaction with regard to the flat

and had taken the possession and now she cannot move around to

say so that the amenities/facilities are not provided. The sale deed

has been executed in consonance of agreement to sell between

the parties and the amenities were to be provided as per the

features highlighted in the brochure because these were not

highlighted in the agreement to sell and there is no recital in the

sale deed that the complainant is satisfied to the facilities /

amenities provided in the flat and in the project as highlighted in the

brochure. Moreover, at the time of taking the possession,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  23</span>



everything can be checked as and when any allottee uses the flat

then he comes to the conclusion whether the construction is upto

mark or the amenities/facilities advertised at the time of launching

the scheme or so provided in the brochure have been

given/provided or not that is why under Section 11(2) of the

PAPRA, 1995, it has been provided that the building shall be

constructed and completed in accordance with the plans and

specifications aforesaid and if any defect in the building or material

or if any unauthorized change in the construction is brought to the

notice of the Promoter within a period of 2 years from the date of

handing over the possession, it shall whatsoever will be rectified by

the Promoter without further charge to the persons, who have

agreed to take the apartments and in other cases, such persons

shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for such

defects. Therefore, we do not agree with the plea raised by the

counsel for the Ops that in case sale deed has been executed by

the Ops in favour of the complainant, the complainant does not

have any right to point out the defects, if any, which is contrary to

Section 11(2) of the PAPRA referred above.
</p>
<p id="p_17">13.         What are the deficiencies on the part of the Ops with

regard to the facilities/amenities to be provided to the complainant?

It has been so detailed by the complainant in Para No. 18 of the

complaint. It has been stated that the lifts of Schindler Company

with capacity of 8 persons with no automatic rescue device system

in case of power failure has been installed whereas in the brochure

the lifts of OTIS/KONE with capacity of 10 persons with automatic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  24</span>



rescue device, in case of power failure were promised. Counsel for

the complainant has drawn the attention of this Commission

towards the brochure Ex. C-1 where in the page of specifications, it

has been mentioned as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">            "Lift shall be of KONE or OTIS of 10 passengers with

            automatic rescue device system will be provided ARDS

            ensures that even in case of power failure, the lift does

            not get stuck up on the way and comes on the next

            station."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">It has been reiterated by the Ops that brochure is not a contract of

sale. After the execution of the agreement to sell between the

parties Ex. C-2 about which they have already given the findings

above about the enforceability of the features as highlighted in the

brochure. It has been admitted that the lift of Schindler Company

has been provided. It was denied that lift of OTIS/KONE with

capacity of 10 persons with automatic rescue device system were

promised. The lifts are properly working and no deficiency in

services on the part of Op. Once the lifts have been provided, it will

not be equity and justice in case directions are given to the Ops to

remove these lifts and in that place of lifts of KONE/OTIS be

provided because apparently no defect has been pointed out by the

complainant in its service during his evidence. The only point is that

it does not have power back up for that some damages can be

awarded to the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.         It has been stated that in the prospectus/brochure it

was mentioned that there would be 60% space kept open to enjoy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                   25</span>



nature whereas the said 60% area has been made concrete and

only small ground has been left by the Ops. However, in the

pleadings and evidence, it has not been stated by the counsel for

the complainant, how much open area has been left by the Ops in

the site plan Ex. Op-1&amp;2/68. The area in front of the tower has

been kept open to the extent of 15%. However, in case we go

through the notes approved by the Competent Authority, who has

approved the layout plan, total plot area has been mentioned as

42747.33 sq. ft. Ground floor plan 21373.67 sq. ft. and actual

covered area 12739.64 sq. ft. In case this area is taken to the total

plot area of 22747.33 sq. ft., it will be more than 60% of the total

plot area because apart from the area left in front of the plots, the

open area has been covered under the roads etc. Therefore, in the

absence of any specific evidence brought on the record by the

complainant that open area has not been left by the Ops according

to the highlights in the brochure, therefore, we do not agree with

this plea raised by the counsel for the complainant that 60% open

area has not been left as promised in the brochure.

</p><p id="p_20">15.         It has been further stated that it was promised that

there would be swimming pool for refreshment and beautification

but swimming pool has not been constructed and the alleged

swimming pool is used for washing of the utensils. It was also

promised in the brochure that there would be club house/health

club and billiard table alongwith multi purpose recreation hall. It has

been stated that swimming pool has already been constructed and

some work of swimming pool/ Jim is under construction. The delay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  26</span>



has been caused as the residents of the Society wanted the

swimming pool/Jim to be constructed of high quality and the

Promoter Company is taking the advice of the residents of the

Society. In this regard, affidavit has been filed by Nishi Garg, owner

of Flat No. H-1, Marvel House that work of the swimming pool is

still under construction and delay has been caused as it is to be

constructed of high quality and that the Promoter Company is

taking the advice of residents of the Society. Similar is the affidavit

Ex. Op-1&amp;2/B owner of Flat No. F-1, therefore, there is no denial

with regard to provision of the swimming pool. It is under

construction and apart from the affidavit filed by the residents of the

said Society, some photographs Exs. Op-1&amp;2/35, Op-1&amp;2/36, Op-

1&amp;2/37 alongwith room for the motor Ex. Op-1&amp;2/38. With regard to

health club/billiard table and multipurpose recreation hall, it has

been stated in the written reply, although it has not been agreed

but Ops have agreed to construct club house/multipurpose

recreation hall and billiard table and has already been provided

with lights and 4 to 10 ACs have been installed alongwith interior

decorative items and it has been handed over to the Marvel Home

Society w.e.f. 24.2.2016. In case the complainant is to use those

facilities then he has to pay the continuance/maintenance charges

as fixed by Marvel Home Society. In this regard, some photographs

have also been placed on the record as Exs. Op-1&amp;2/39, Op-

1&amp;2/40, Op-1&amp;2/42, Op-1&amp;2/43 and Marvel Home Society is there.

The obligation of the Op was upto the construction. So far as

operation of the amenities is concerned, in case the residents are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  27</span>



to use those facilities in case some user/maintenance charges

have been fixed by the Society then the complainant is required to

pay the charges. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the

swimming pool is under construction and major work is complete

and some directions can be given to the Ops to complete it within a

specific period and so far as club house/health club, billiard table

and multipurpose recreation hall, it is already complete and handed

over to Marvel Home Society, therefore, no such relief with regard

to this aspect can be granted to the complainant.

</p><p id="p_21">16.         It has been stated that no fire fighting gas or water and

only box and fire fighting cable has been installed. Whereas in the

reply, it has been denied that only box has been placed with no fire

fighting system. The safety arrangements have been totally

installed in the complex and in this regard certificate was issued by

Assistant Divisional Fire Officer, Ludhiana       vide its letter No.

1741/FR/2 dated 19.12.2017, it has been placed on the record as

Ex. Op-1&amp;2/44 wherein the fire fighting system installed by the Op

was found to be correct. On the other side there is no report of any

expert tendered on the record by the complainant that the fire

fighting system installed is only an instrument and that it is not in a

working condition, therefore, when there is a certificate of

Competent Authority that cannot be disbelieved and in the absence

of any specific evidence by the complainant on the record, no such

relief can be granted to the complainant.

<p id="p_22">17.         It has been stated that on the last page in the Map, it

has been provided that on the compound there would be green
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                   28</span>



trees and beautiful surroundings adjoining to the walls, whereas

this fact has been denied by the Ops. Space has been left for

planting the trees and complete concrete walls and pass ways

have been made and that there was no provision to provide any

trees alongside the walls in the brochure Ex. C-1. Nothing has

been pointed out by the counsel for the complainant that such a

facility was promised. The walls are there, open space is there. In

case such a facility is required, the trees can be planted with the

passage of time but when no specific highlight was there in the

brochure or in the agreement to sell then no such direction can be

passed in favour of the complainant and against the Ops.

</p><p id="p_23">18.         It has been further stated that in the brochure as well as

in the sale deed, single separate parking space has been provided

for every flat owner/consumer but no parking lot has been made.

The counsel for the complainant has referred to the brochure Ex.

C-1. Counsel for the complainant has referred to the agreement to

sell Ex. C-2, para No. 21 wherein it has been stated that the

purchaser shall be only authorized resident and shall be allowed to

use common parking area for two cars. In the sale deed Ex. C-3 it

has been mentioned that each flat owner will be entitled to use one

car parking. This recital in the sale deed is even against the recitals

in the agreement. It was argued by the counsel for the Ops that

once in the sale deed, it has been admitted by the complainant to

get one car parking then he is estopped by his act and conduct to

ask for two car parkings. The rights are to be determined on the

basis of agreement or the amenities they have promised in their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  29</span>



brochure. Sale deed is a step further to provide these facilities.

Therefore, the sale deed is not a contract between the parties. In

case in the brochure or agreement to sell, it has been provided that

each flat owner will be entitled to use common space for two car

parking then he will be entitled to two car parking instead of one car

parking and to that extent the direction can be given to the Ops.

</p><p id="p_24">19.         With regard to the poor hygienic condition, once the

complex is complete and Marvel Home Society is there,

maintenance work is looked after by Marvel Home Society and plea

has been taken by the Ops that each flat owner has to pay Rs.

4,000/- per month for maintenance and it has also been pleaded

that the complainant has not paid his due share for the last one

year. Once the flats are complete and Marvel Home Society is

there then maintenance of the common spaces is to be lookedafter

by the said Society, therefore, no such direction can be given to the

Ops in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_25">20.         It has been stated that Ops failed to install fountain in

the middle of the park and glass cover. No doubt that in front of the

towers in the brochure Ex. C-1, one fountain has been shown i.e.

just a photograph and in the highlights in the brochure, there is no

reference with regard to provision of any fountain and glass cover

in front of the towers, therefore, mere on the basis of photographs,

the complainant is not entitled to such facility, therefore, no such

direction in this regard can be given to the Ops.
</p>
<p id="p_26">21.         Ops have failed to take approval from Airport Authority

of India. Whereas in the written reply, Ops have taken the plea that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                     30</span>



the height of the building was 70'6" and FAR was 1.2. Counsel for

the complainant has not stated the height for which any certificate

from Airport Authority of India is required. It is not required in every

building, it is required only in case the height of the building is more

than the prescribed limit. In the pleadings, it has not been referred

what is the prescribed limit or whether the height of the building is

more than that, therefore, in the absence of any specific pleading

or evidence on the record, no such direction with regard to taking

any certificate from the Airport Authority of India can be asked to

the Ops.
</p>
<p id="p_27">22.         It has been stated that completion/occupation certificate

of the apartment has not been obtained by the Ops. In reply to that,

it    was    denied     that    they     have       not   provided    the

completion/occupation      certificate   of   the    apartment   to   the

complainant nor it was applied with the Competent Authorities.

Basically there is no provision for providing completion/occupation

certificate of the apartment to the complainant, it has been so held

by District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ludhiana. The

judgment so passed by District Consumer Disputes Redressal

Forum, Ludhiana stand withdrawn because the complaint filed by

the complainant was withdrawn when it was observed that the

pecuniary jurisdiction was more than that of the District Forum,

therefore, the District Forum had no jurisdiction to entertain the

complaint. It has been further stated that the building was

completed for taking sanction from the Municipal Corporation. No

doubt that layout plan is required to be approved either by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                           31</span>



Municipal Corporation or by the GLADA. They have referred that

NOC has been given by Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana to which

they are referring as a completion certificate. Referring to letter No.

1077/ATP-D dated 31.3.2011, which shows that the Ops raised

construction        more   than   the       sanctioned    plan   and   it   was

compounded a sum of Rs. 11,77,603/- and after that they have

given the NOC to get Bank loan, water, sewerage and sale

purchase etc. but technically it is not a completion/occupation

certificate as pleaded by the counsel for the Ops. The Ops is a

developer and has taken a licence to develop it as a Colony under

the PAPRA, therefore, the provision of the PAPRA will be

applicable. A reference has been given to Clause 3(2)(j), which

reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             "(j)     not allow persons to enter into possession until an

             occupation certificate required under any law is duly

             given by the appropriate authority under that law and

             no person shall take possession of an apartment until

             such occupation certificate is obtained;"

</blockquote><p id="p_28"><a href="/doc/159242890/" id="a_11">Section 14</a>.(1) relates to responsibility of the promoter, which reads

as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             "(i) in the case of apartments, to obtain from the

             authority required to do so under any law completion

             and occupation certificates for the building and if a

             promoter,      within      a    reasonable     time,   after   the

             construction of the building, does not apply for an

             occupation certificate from the aforesaid authority, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                  32</span>



            allottee of an apartment may apply for an occupation

            certificate from the said authority;"

</blockquote><p id="p_29">Therefore, according to these provisions, occupancy/completion

certificate is required to be obtained by the Ops. The counsel for

the complainant has also referred to Section 272 of Punjab

Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, which reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">            "272. Completion certificate - (1) Every person who

            employs a licensed architect or engineer or a person

            approved by the Commissioner to design or erect a

            erection of the building or execution of the work, deliver

            or send or cause to be delivered or sent to the

            Commissioner a notice in writing of such completion

            accompanied by a certificate in the form prescribed by

            bye-laws made in this behalf and shall give to the

            Commissioner all necessary facilities for the inspection

            of such building or work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">            (2)    No person shall occupy or permit to be occupied

            any such building or use of permit to be used any

            building or a part thereof effected by any such work

            until permission has been granted by the Commissioner

            in this behalf in accordance with bye-laws made under

            this Act;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">            Provided that if the Commissioner fails within a period

            of thirty days after the receipt of the notice of

            completion to communicate his refusal to grant such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31"> Consumer Complaint No. 856 of 2017                                 33</span>



            permission, such permission shall be deemed to have

            been granted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">Therefore, Ops were under legal obligation to get the completion

certificate. Even if the sale deed has been executed in favour of the

complainant even that is not a bar to get the completion certificate.

In this regard, the counsel for the complainant has referred to the

judgment of the Hon'ble National Commission 2017(3) CPJ 569

"Dr. Pradeep B. Pawar versus Dilip Varyamal Virmani Kamal

Nagar". In that case, completion certificate issued by Gram

Panchayat. It was mentioned that it is not a valid certificate taken

without consulting District Town Planner. It was further observed

that sale deed is also defective if it is taken without Completion

Certificate in accordance with law. No contrary judgment has been

cited by the counsel for the complainant. Therefore, the plea taken

by the counsel for the Ops that sale deed has been executed,

therefore, completion certificate is not required, is no ground. Even

if the sale deed has been executed, the completion/occupation

certificate as required under the PAPRA or Municipal Corporation

Act, 1976 be obtained by the Ops.
</p>
<p id="p_31">23.         No other point was argued.
</p>
<p id="p_32">24.         Sequel to the above, we partly accept the complaint

and direct Ops No. 1 &amp; 2 as under:-
