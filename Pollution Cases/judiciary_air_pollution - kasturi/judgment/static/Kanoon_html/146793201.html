Honble Mr Justice Virender Singh, Judge
Honble Mr Justice Muzaffar Hussain Attar,Judge
Date: 10.09.2012 
:J U D G M E N T :
</pre><p id="p_1">Muzaffar Hussain Attar:
</p><p id="p_2">We the people of India have given to ourselves the
Constitution, from the bossom of which are born three principal
organs of the State viz., Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. In
view of the mandate contained in the Constitution, all the three
organs of the State have to function within the frontiers
delineated by the Constitution itself. The legislature has to
legislate the laws and the executive, which is answerable to the
legislature, has to implement the said laws. Amongst others, the
principal and fundamental functions of the Courts are to interpret
the laws and resolve the disputes between the litigating parties,
which disputes are brought before them.
</p><p id="p_3">Because of the disability from which certain sections of the
society are suffering from viz., down-trodden class of the society,
the children and women folk, and further in order to protect the
environment, a national asset, the Constitutional Courts have
been entertaining the petitions which are in public interest or
even at times, have been taking suo-moto cognizance of the
issues which have impact on large sections of the society. The
2/
Constitutional Courts have opened the doors for such
proceedings for the benefit of under-privileged class of the
society.
</p><p id="p_4">The failure on the part of the Statutory and administrative
authorities in effectively implementing the statutes and carryingout
the mandate of the political bosses in public interest and in
accordance with the law, results in subjecting the common
masses to incalculable sufferings and untold miseries. The inaction
and non-performance/poor performance on the part of the
statutory and administrative authorities results in depriving the
basic facilities/amenities to the man on street. The amenities and
the facilities which are to be provided to the people at large, have
many shades. The people are approaching the courts now by filing
the Public Interest Litigation complaining therein that even the
basic civic facilities are not being made available to them. The
products/commodities which are hazardous to human life and 
which endanger the environment, even though, their manufacture
and circulation is banned by laws, are still available in
abundance. 
</p><p id="p_5">Such type of litigations are eating into public time of the
courts which is, otherwise, to be devoted for resolving the
disputes between the parties which are brought before the
Constitutional Courts and other courts. In the above stated
backdrop and for above reasons, the issues raised in this Public
Interest Litigation have surfaced.
</p><p id="p_6">Legislatures are painting rainbow of rights, which due to
cruel defiance of some persons, who are duty bound to translate
them into reality, get eclipsed under dark clouds of insensitivity.
Petitioner in this Public Interest Litigation has prayed for
issuance of directions to the respondents which besides State of
J&amp;K, include J&amp;K State Pollution Control Board, Commissioner,
3/-
</p><p id="p_7">Municipal Corporation, Jammu and the Deputy Commissioner,   
Jammu, for implementing the provisions of the Environment
(protection) Act of 1986, Plastic Waste (Management and 
Handling) Rules, 2011, Municipal Solid Waste (Management &amp;  
Handling) Rule, 2000, the Jammu and Kashmir Non-  
Biodegradable Material (Management, Handling and Disposal) Act, 
2007 and the Rules made thereunder. 
</p><p id="p_8">If the authorities, who are charged with the duties to
implement such laws, would discharge their duty honestly and
diligently, such type of petitions would not be filed.
One of the functions of the Courts is to direct
implementation of laws, if it is complained that the same are not
being implemented by the authorities concerned. Such a situation
can arise once in a blue moon. Unfortunately, this court is being
flooded with Public Interest Litigations.
The Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Jammu and the  
Chairman, J&amp;K State Pollution Control Board, Jammu, who are 
present in the court, have assured that those of the laws which
are to be implemented by these authorities will be implemented
faithfully by them.
</p><p id="p_9">The grievances projected in this Public Interest Litigation
are of significant importance and the respondent-State and its
authorities would be duty bound to take measures and remedial
steps to redress the grievances of people at large.
The issues raised in this petition are manifold and
significant. Among others, it has surfaced that Municipal
Corporation, Jammu is not making all out efforts to keep the city
clean and create hygienic conditions. The State Pollution Control
Board, in view of the averments made in the petition is found
4/-
</p><p id="p_10">lacking in taking effective and stringent action in accordance with
the law against violators of the law.
</p><p id="p_11">Keeping this petition on the files of this Court any further is
not required and is disposed of in the following manner:-
1/ Respondents who are present in person in the court, are
directed to take all effective steps and gear up the statutory and
administrative machinery for implementing the provisions of the
Environment (protection) Act of 1986, Plastic Waste (Management 
and Handling) Rules, 2011, Municipal Solid Waste (Management &amp;  
Handling) Rule, 2000, the Jammu and Kashmir Non-  
Biodegradable Material (Management, Handling and Disposal) Act, 
2007 and the Rules made thereunder. 
</p><p id="p_12">2/ The Commissioner/Secretary, Urban and Local Bodies, J&amp;K  
State, is directed to monitor the functioning of the Municipal
Corporation, Jammu for implementing these laws and 
maintenance of the cleanliness and hygienic conditions of Jammu
city.
</p><p id="p_13">3/ The Commissioner/Secretary Urban and Local Bodies is  
further directed to supervise the functioning of Municipal
Corporation, Srinagar, and all other Municipal Committees of the
Jammu and Kashmir State;  
</p><p id="p_14">4/ The Competent/disciplinary authorities are directed to seek
periodical reports from all the concerned authorities;
5/ The Commissioner/Secretary, Urban and Local Bodies, shall 
initiate or order initiation of disciplinary proceedings against all
such officers/officials who would be lacking in their performance
of duty and would show utter dis-regard to the provisions of
statute and instructions of superiors;
</p><p id="p_15">5/-
</p><p id="p_16">6/ The J&amp;K State Pollution Control Board, Jammu, shall take all
effective steps in implementing the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment
(Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and the The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and The Chairman of the Board shall be
personally responsible to effectively implement the provisions of
the aforementioned Act;
</p><p id="p_17">7/ It is further provided that if any of the members of the
society would have any grievance against the functioning of the
officers/officials of the departments concerned, then, the same
shall be brought to the notice of the Competent/Disciplinary
authority, who shall be under an obligation to consider and take a
decision on such complaints preferably within four weeks from the
date, such complaints are received and convey the results thereof
to the aggrieved person(s).
</p><p id="p_18">The orders passed in this Petition, from time to time, shall
become part of this order and the directions issued, shall be
carried out in letter and spirit.
