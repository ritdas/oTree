to control the menace of noise pollution but what is lacking is its effective

implementation. The following suggestions were given for effective

implementation of the provisions of law:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             i)    To make the prevention of noise pollution an integral
                   part of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             ii)   Sensitize people, both the officials and the general
                   public, about the hazardous effects of noise pollution and
                   its ill-effects on human beings, birds and animals as well
                   as nature.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             iii) Sensitize religious institutions, marriage palaces and
                   other noise producing institutions about the adverse
                   impact of noise pollution in the vicinity. In this respect
                   highlighting the Hukamnama issued by Sri Akal Takhat
                   Sahib on use of loudspeakers only within the precincts of
                   a Gurdwara.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">             iv) This process of sensitizing the public should be done
                   through an aggressive campaign of 4-6 months through
                   pamphlets,     posters,         newspapers,   electronic   media,
                   advertisements, messages through mobile operators, etc.,
                   especially by taking the Health Department of the three
                   governments on board.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             v)    The press and the media should also be requested to
                   highlight the adverse effects of noise pollution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             vi) The authorities responsible for implementing the laws
                   have to be warned that it is their duty to implement the
                   laws. In this respect, the Chief Secretaries/ Advisor and
                   the    DGPs       should         be   made     responsible    for
                   implementation of the law and to ensure that the
                   supporting authorities under the Rules perform their
                   duties effectively.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             vii) As an aid to discharging their functions, the authorities
                   should be equipped with modern noise monitoring
                   devices.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      viii) Each religious institution should be asked to nominate a
            responsible person to ensure the implementation of the
            law and in case of any breach, should be held
            accountable.

            institutions, marriage palaces, barred industrial units, etc.
            should have noise monitoring devices installed to prevent
            them going above the permissible limit.

 We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a
 hazardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses a
 potential threat to the health and safety of the persons
 working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas
 owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to
 ensure that no harm results to anyone on account of
 hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity
 which it has undertaken. The enterprise must be held to be
 under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or
 inherently dangerous activity in which it is engaged must be
 conducted with the highest standards of safety and if any
 harm results on account of such activity, the enterprise must
 be absolutely liable to compensate for such harm and it
 should be no answer to the enterprise to say that it had taken
 all reasonable care and that the harm occurred without any
 negligence on its part. Since the persons harmed on account
 of the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity carried on
 by the enterprise would not be in a position to isolate the
 process of operation from the hazardous preparation of
 substance or any other related element that caused the harm
 the enterprise must be held strictly liable for causing such
 harm as a part of the social cost for carrying on the
 hazardous or inherently dangerous activity. If the enterprise
 is permitted to carry on an hazardous or inherently.

 such permission is conditional on the enterprise absorbing

 enterprise engaged in such hazardous or inherently
 dangerous activity indemnifies all those who suffer on
 account of the carrying on of such hazardous or inherently

 central Government with all such powers as are "necessary or
 expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving the
 quality of the environment". The Central Government is
 empowered to take all measures and issue all such directions
 as are called for for the above purpose. In the present case,
 the said powers will include giving directions for the removal
 of sludge, for undertaking remedial measures and also the
 power to impose the cost of remedial measures on the
 offending industry and utilise the amount so recovered for
 carrying out remedial measures. This Court can certainly give
 directions to the Central Government/its delegate to take all
 such measures, if in a given case this Court finds that such
 directions are warranted.
</p><p id="p_54"> We find that similar directions have been made in a recent
 decision of this Court in Indian Council for Enviro-Legal
 Action and Ors. [supra]. That was also a writ petition filed
 under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_12">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. Following is the
 direction: It appears that the Pollution Control Board had
 identified as many as 22 industries responsible for the
 pollution caused by discharge of their effluents into
 Nakkavagu. They were responsible to compensate to farmers.
 It was the duty of the State Government to ensure that this
 amount was recovered from the industries and paid to the
 farmers.

 appropriate directions for the purpose of ensuring remedial
 action. It is more a matter of form.

 a "non-natural" user to attract the rule. In other words, if the
 user by the defendant is a natural user of the land, he would
 not be liable for damages. Thus, the twin tests - apart from the
 proof of damage to the plaintiff by the act/negligence of the
 defendants - which must be satisfied to attract this rule as
 "forcibility" and "non-natural" user of the land.
</p><p id="p_57"> 65.    On a consideration of the two lines of thought [one
 adopted by the English Courts and the other by the Australian
 High Court], we are of the opinion that any principle evolved
 in this behalf should be simple, practical and suited to the
 conditions obtaining in this country. We are convinced that
 the law stated by this Court in Oleum Gas Leak Case is by far
 the more appropriate one - apart from the fact that it is
 binding upon us. [We have disagreed with the view that the
 law stated in the said decision is obiter.] According to this
 rule, once the activity carried on is hazardous or inherently
 dangerous, the person carrying on such activity is liable to
 make good the loss caused to any other person by his activity
 irrespective of the fact whether he took reasonable care while
 carrying on his activity. The rule is premised upon the very
 nature of the activity carried on. In the words of the
 Constitution Bench, such an activity "can be tolerated only on
 the condition that the enterprise engaged in such hazardous
 or inherently dangerous activity indemnifies all those who
 suffer on account of the carrying on of such hazardous or
 inherently dangerous activity regardless of whether it is
 carried on carefully or not." The Constitution Bench has also
 assigned the reason for stating the law in the said terms. It is
 that the enterprise [carrying on the hazardous or inherently
 dangerous activity] alone has the resource to discover and
 guard against hazards or dangers - and not the person
 affected and the practical difficulty [on the part of the
 affected person] in establishing the absence of reasonable
 care or that the damage to him was foreseeable by the
 enterprise.

 MCD, it is clear that the regularisation certificate is for
 running of a pathological lab whereas the conditions
 mentioned therein are directed towards running of a nursing
 home. Therefore, there is a lot of inconsistency within the
 regularisation certificate itself and due to the same, the
 regularisation certificate cannot be accepted by us as it is
 impermissible not only in law but also because the same was
 granted without seeking permission from the High Court
 during the pendency of the earlier Writ Petition No. 8808 of

 are not permissible under Clause 15.5 of the MPD 2021.
 Further, when the respondent owners started the Diagnostic
 Centre, they employed about more than 50 people and
 installed 25 air conditioners, two diesel generator sets of 25
 kVA and 40 kVA each in the setback area, along with
 kerosene tanks, gas cylinders and electric panels. Around 300
 patients visit the Centre per day and more than 100 cars are
 parked in the vicinity. All these factors lead to air pollution
 which is in contravention of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_31">Control
 of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. At present, 80 employees are working
 and around 300 patients visit the pathological lab every day

 emission of hazardous substances and in that process human

 are being exposed to harmful physicochemical properties. Not
 only this, they also create pollution which contaminates water
 on account of the discharge of chemical properties used in the
 process of running the pathological lab, causing nuisance and
 harm to public health and safety of the residents of the area.
 This fact is certified by DPCC in its report dated 4-8-2008.
 The usage of such generator sets has led to the damage of the
 building and cracks have been found in the building structure.
 The explanation sought to be given by the respondent owners
 is that the aforesaid generator sets were installed in the
 setback area as the appellant has not permitted to install the
 same on the terrace of the building. The objection of the
 appellant installing the same in the terrace is that he has
 purchased the said area and the appellant is living on the
 second floor and therefore, if the generator sets are installed
 on the terrace, it would be completely impossible for him to
 live on the second floor of the premises due to the sound and
 air pollution caused by the generator sets. It would not only
 affect the appellant and his family but also the other
 neighbouring residents of the locality.

 principles laid down by this Court in <a href="/doc/69408974/" id="a_46">M.C. Mehta v. Union of
 India15</a>, the relevant paragraph from the said case is
 extracted hereunder: (SCC pp. 423-24, para 56)
        "56. On 18-5-1995, Justice R.C. Lahoti (as the former
 Chief Justice of India then was) in <a href="/doc/463883/" id="a_47">ANZ Grindlays Bank v.
 MCD16</a> echoed similar words and referred to decision of this
 Court, observing that the word 'environment' is of broad
 spectrum which brings within its ambit hygienic atmosphere
 and ecological balance. It is, therefore, not only the duty of
 the State but also the duty of every citizen to maintain
 hygienic environment. There is constitutional imperative on
 the State Government and the municipalities, not only to
 ensure and safeguard proper environment but also an
 imperative duty to take adequate measures to promote,
 protect and improve both the man-made and the natural
 environment. Dealing with the municipal laws providing for
 power of demolition, it was observed that while interpreting
 municipal legislation framed in public interest, a strict
 constitutional approach must be adopted. A perusal of the
 master plan shows that the public purpose behind it is based
 on historic facts guided by expert opinion."
