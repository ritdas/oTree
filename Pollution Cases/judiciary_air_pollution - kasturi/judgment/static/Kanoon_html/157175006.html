</p><p id="p_7">                          3. We have heard M/s.C.Rekha Kumari, learned counsel for the

                     petitioner and Mr.V.Haribabu, learned Additional Government Pleader

                     for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">                          4. The petitioner is a private Limited Company registered on the

                     file of the respondent under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General

                     Sales Tax Act, 1959. The petitioner's case is that they imported

                     Ayurvedic Bulk Reishi Gano Powder and Gano Celium Powder from

                     Malaysia. After which they have given on job work basis to other

                     companies to be filled in the capsules. Initially, the job work was given

                     to M/s.Madras Pharmaceuticals, in Chennai. After the manufacturing

                     process, the marketing of the product was done by the petitioner from

                     January 2002 to May 2002. Subsequently, the petitioner started

                     purchasing the filled up capsules from M/s. DXN Herbal Manufacturing

                     (India) Private Limited, Puducherry. Thus the petitioner became a mere

                     trader of the said product. The petitioner collected 4% on the sale of

                     the product as they contended that it is an Ayurvedic proprietary

                     Medicine.

</p><p id="p_11">                          5. The dispute in the instant case is with regard to the rate of tax

                     which was levied by Assessing Officer, whether the same was right and

                     whether the First Appellate Authority and the Tribunal were correct in

                     confirming the order of the Assessing Officer. The reason given by the

                     Tribunal for treating the product as one to fall under the residuary deal

                     or on the three grounds namely, the product is imported product,

                     secondly, it is not an Ayurvedic medicine to food supplement and

                     thirdly, it is not sold in medical shops but is sold by multi-level

                     marketing.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">                          6. The petitioner started dealing with the product as a trader after

                     May, 2002 by purchasing the capsules from one M/s.DXN Herbal

                     Manufacturing (India) Pvt. Ltd. The said company had approached the

                     Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court to which one of us is a party [TSSJ]

                     in T.C.A.Nos. 341 and 342 of 2007. The question before the Division

                     Bench was whether the said assessee was entitled to claim deduction

                     under <a href="/doc/1502697/" id="a_1">Section 80(I)(B)</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961; whether the

                     Assessing Officer was right in denying the claim made under <a href="/doc/394567/" id="a_2">Section 43</a>

                     (B) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The substantial questions were

                     decided in favour of the assessee in the judgement reported in [2018]

                     (India) Private Limited Vs. Income Tax Officer, Ward(1),

                     Puducherry. The reason we have referred said decision is in support of

                     our stand that the product has undergone a process of manufacturing.

                     In other words, the product which was imported is not the product,

                     which was marketed. The Court also took into consideration the various

                     licenses obtained by the said assessee under the various enactments

                     which showed that the product is an Ayurvedic Proprietary Preparation.

                     At this juncture, it would be useful to refer to certain paragraphs of the

                     said decision to give a clear view of the factual positions. Paragraph

                     Nos. 9 and 10 from the above judgement are extracted herein,

                                      “9. In the instant case, the petitioner/assessee
                                was dealing with Ayurvedic drug preparation. The
                                Tribunal has rendered its finding that the mushroom
                                powder can be consumed in bulk form nakedly
                                without being put into any enclosures or by putting
                                into the gelatine capsules. We find that there is no
                                material, based on which, such finding was recorded
                                by the Tribunal and to say the least, it is the
                                personal opinion of the Tribunal. The Tribunal lost
                                sight of a very important fact that the assessee has
                                obtained licences from various statutory authorities
                                namely    license   in   Form-25-D    issued   by   the
                                Government of Pondicherry. Food and Drug including

                     Revenue that, what was imported is put into capsules and marketed and

                     there is no manufacturing work. After examining the process adopted

                     Manufacturing (India) Pvt. Ltd. is a clear answer to the first ground on

                     which the petitioner was non-suited that the product is an imported

                     product.

                     Ayurvedic Medicine to Food Supplement. This finding is not supported

                     by any document, but it appears to be the view of the Tribunal. This

                     finding is incorrect because of the various licenses obtained by the

                     manufacturer namely M/s.DNEX Herbal Manufacturing (India) Pvt.Ltd.

                     which was taken note of in the afore mentioned decision. Furthermore,

                     the literature also clearly described the product as an Ayurvedic

                     Proprietary Medicine. Therefore the tribunal could not have adopted the

                     common parlance test. The same line of reasoning was given by the

                     Kerala Sales-Tax Appellate Tribunal, Additional Bench, Ernakulam in

                     T.A.No.1367 of 2003 dated 31.05.2003. The appellant in the said case

                     was one Daehsan Trading (India) Pvt. Ltd., Ernakulam, who is none

                     other than the person who purchased the product from the petitioner

                     before us. The question which was decided by the tribunal was whether

                     the items Ganocelium Capsules and Reishi Gano are Ayurvedic

                     Proprietary Medicines, items coming under Entry 141 of the First

                     who purchased the product from the petitioner produced several

</p><p id="p_23">                          9. The Kerala Sales Tax Tribunal took note of the above expert

                     opinion, and noted that it is an Ayurvedic Proprietary Medicine and it is

                     manufactured under Drug License and therefore will not come under

                     Entry 141 under the Kerala Sales Tax Act of the first Schedule to be

                     taxed at 20%. Further, the properties of Relshi Gano and Ganocelium

                     were discussed and the factual finding was given that the product

                     cannot be treated as a Food support.

<p id="p_24">                          10. The authoritative opinion of qualified scholars in Ayurveda was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                         10</span>

                     accepted and    the   tribunal   in our view,   rightly held that such

                     authoritative opinion cannot be brushed aside, as the department has

                     no such technical knowledge to reject such material. Further more, the

                     interpretation of the revenue, that they are food supplements and the

                     common parlance test was also rejected. Thus, ultimately it held that

                     the product is Ayurvedic Proprietary Medicines and direction was issued

                     to the Assessing Authority to treat the items as Ayurvedic preparations

                     and tax accordingly. We have informed that the order passed by the

                     Kerala Sales Tax Tribunal has attained finality and the appellant therein,

                     the person who purchased the product from the petitioner before us has

                     also been granted refund. Since the product is same, the factual finding

                     will bind the respondent department, though the decision was rendered

                     by a tribunal in the State of Kerala. The revenue has not been able to

                     bring down any material to dislodge the factual finding recorded by the

                     Tribunal duly supported by expert opinion. Therefore, the second

                     ground on which the tribunal refused the relief to the petitioner

                     deserves to be set aside.

                     through multi level marketing and not sold in all the shops. This can

                     hardly be a reason to determine the rate of tax payable on the product

                     when it is sold. The manner in which the product is sold cannot be a test


http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                         11</span>

                     to determine the nature of the product of that matter at what rate it has

                     to be taxed. Therefore, the Tribunal misdirected itself in referring to the

                     method of marketing as a reason for imposing a higher rate of tax. It is

                     common knowledge that now a days all products are available through

                     online purchaser. Therefore, the method of purchase at a stretch of

                     imagination cannot be a reason to impose a higher rate of tax.

                     requires interference. Accordingly, the Tax Case Revisions are allowed

                     and the Substantial Questions of Law are answered in favour of the
