<pre id="pre_1">  THE HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE SRI RAGHVENDRA SINGH CHAUHAN
                              AND
           THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE B. VIJAYSEN REDDY

                          WRIT PETITION No.10085 OF 2020

ORDER: (Per Hon'ble the Chief Justice Sri Raghvendra Singh Chauhan)

        The Petitioner, M/s.Kosher Pharmaceuticals Private Limited,

has challenged the legality of the closure notice, dated 23.05.2020,

passed by the respondent No.3.</pre>

<p id="p_1">        The petitioner claims to be a pharmaceutical company of bulk

drugs situated in survey Nos.286, 289 (part) and 297 (part) of

Jagdevpur Village and Mandal, Siddipet District. It claims that it is

engaged in manufacturing of bulk drugs. Moreover, on 12.02.2015, it

was granted the Certificate For Establishment (CFE) to manufacture

fifteen (15) bulk drugs with maximum production capacity of

1900 kg/day, with a condition that the Industry shall not produce

more than four products, and individual capacities mentioned therein

at any given point of time. Subsequently, on 18.09.2017, it was

granted the Consent For Operation (CFO) under the Hazardous Waste

Act for manufacturing two products at a given point of time, out of

fifteen products. Maximum production capacity for manufacturing

these products would be 1300 kg/day. Moreover, according to the

petitioner, the CFO was renewed, and continues to be valid till

31.03.2023.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        According to the petitioner, on 15.03.2020, the respondent

No.2 received a complaint with regard to the discharge of acid water

into the neighbouring lands, and with regard to their causing ground

water pollution in the surrounding areas. Therefore, an Inspection

was carried out on 06.05.2020; according to the petitioner, an

Inspection Report was prepared behind its back. Subsequently,

without giving any opportunity of hearing, the closure notice was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2</span>




issued on 23.05.2020. Hence, the present writ petition before this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The    learned   counsel    for       the   petitioner   has   vehemently

contended that prior to the issuance of the impugned closure notice,

an opportunity of hearing should have been given to the petitioner.

However, such opportunity of hearing was never given. Therefore, the

impugned closure notice is violative of principles of natural justice.

</p><p id="p_4">      On the other hand, Ms. Padmaja, the learned standing counsel

for the Pollution Control Board, submits that both <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">Section

31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, grant

ample powers to the Pollution Control Board to immediately order the

closure of a unit, in case the Pollution Control Board is of the opinion

that pollution is being caused to a great extent which would endanger

human life. Therefore, while invoking the powers under these two

provisions, the closure notice, dated 23.05.2020, was passed by the

respondent No.3. Therefore, she has supported the impugned closure

notice.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Heard the learned counsel for the parties, and perused the

impugned notice, and the records submitted by the petitioner as well

as the report submitted by the Pollution Control Board.

</p><p id="p_6">      <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_5">Section 33A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974, is as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">        33A. Power to give directions:- Notwithstanding anything contained
in any other law, but subject to the provisions of this Act, and to any
directions that the Central Government may give in this behalf, a Board
may, in the exercise of its powers and performance of its functions under
this Act, issue any directions in writing to any person, officer or authority,
and such person, officer or authority shall be bound to comply with such
directions.
</p><p id="p_8">        Explanation.- For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that
the power to issue directions under this Section includes the power to
direct-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        (a) the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation
            or process; or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (b) the stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity, water or any
           other service.</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">       <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_7">Section 31A</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1981, is as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_11">        31A. Power to give directions:- Notwithstanding anything contained
in any other law, but subject to the provisions of this Act, and to any
directions that the Central Government may give in this behalf, a Board
may, in the exercise of its powers and performance of its functions under
this Act, issue any directions in writing to any person, officer or authority,
and such person, officer or authority shall be bound to comply with such
directions.
</p><p id="p_12">        Explanation.- For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that
the power to issue directions under this Section includes the power to
direct-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (a) the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or
            process; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (b) the stoppage or regulation of supply of electricity, water or any
            other service.</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">       A bare perusal of both these provisions clearly reveals that they

are in identical terms. Moreover, neither of these two provisions

require that the principles of natural justice should be followed.

Moreover, both these provisions bestow an urgent power, or an

exceptional power, on the Pollution Control Board to deal with an

urgent situation, whereby the closure of a unit may be required on an

emergent basis. Therefore, the learned counsel for the petitioner is

unjustified in claiming that before the power under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_9">Section 33A</a> of

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_11">Section 31A</a>

of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, is invoked, an

opportunity of hearing should have been given to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_15">       However, a post-decisional hearing can always be given by the

Pollution Control Board to the erring unit to rectify the defects, or the

violations, committed by the erring unit. A bare perusal of the Report

submitted by the Pollution Control Board clearly reveals that there is

a large number of lacunae/defects/violations of the Water (Prevention

and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, and of the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, allegedly committed by the petitioner. But,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    4</span>




nonetheless, the petitioner must be given a chance to rectify the

errors committed by it. Therefore, this Court directs the respondent

No.2 to give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner as a post-

decisional hearing, and to give him sufficient time to rectify the

defects present in the functioning of the unit, and to give it sufficient

time to comply with the requirements of law.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      With these directions, this writ petition stands disposed of.

Miscellaneous petitions, pending if any, shall stand closed. There

shall be no order as to costs.
