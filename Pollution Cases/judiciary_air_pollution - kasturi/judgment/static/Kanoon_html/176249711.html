     THIS WRIT APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 4 OF THE
KARNATAKA HIGH COURT ACT PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE
ORDER PASSED IN THE WRIT PETITION 15080/2007 DATED
19/06/2009.

     THIS WRIT APPEAL COMING ON FOR PRL.HEARING THIS
DAY, NARAYANA SWAMY, J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:

                           JUDGEMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">         The appellant preferred writ petition challenging the

order passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Shimoga dated

23.7.2007 and sought for quashing the same. The said writ

petition came to be dismissed, against which this appeal is

filed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">         2. It is the case of the appellant-petitioner that he is

the owner in possession of the properties in Sy.No.16/1P1,

16/2A measuring 33 guntas and 25 guntas respectively. In

Sy.No.16/1P1, there is a open well which is insufficient to

feed water to the lands referred above. Hence he made a

representation      to   the   competent     authority   seeking

permission to dig a bore-well.        The same was rejected,

against which he preferred writ petition No.5637/2006. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               4</span>




writ petition came to be disposed of directing the petitioner

to avail an alternative remedy. Accordingly, he approached

the competent authority, the Executive Officer, Taluk

Panchayat under Section 3(3) of Karnataka Ground Water

(Regulation for Protection of Source of Drinking Water) Act,

1999, hereinafter referred to as `the Act' for short.    The

said authority by the order dated 27.1.2007 (Annexure-B)

rejected the claim.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3. The appellant thereupon filed appeal before the

Deputy Commissioner, Shimoga.       The appeal came to be

dismissed confirming the order passed by the competent

authority. The appellant challenged the said orders by filing

W P No.15080/2007 (GM-RES), which came to be dismissed

by the order dated 19.6.2009. Hence the present appeal.


</p><p id="p_6">     4. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that

the writ court has committed an error in not considering the

case of the appellant. The orders of the appropriate

authority as well as the appellate authority are ultra vires
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               5</span>




the provisions of Section 3(3) of the Act as the appropriate

authority has failed to seek advise of the technical officer.

Further it is submitted that the Government has not yet

issued any notification declaring public source of drinking

water. In the absence of the same, it is not proper for the

appropriate authority as well as the appellate authority to

reject the claim of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     5. On the other hand, the learned government

advocate submits to dismiss this writ petition.           The

competent authority as well as the appellate authority have

assigned reasons that if permission is granted, the streams

which is used for public as well as animals would dry

causing hardship to the public.      In the circumstances, the

endorsement issued by the authorities is justified which is

rightly appreciated by the learned Single Judge    calling for

no interference.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     6. The provisions of the Act prevents unregulated

sinking of bore-well in order to protect public source of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                6</span>




drinking   water.    Section   2(7)   of   the   Act   provides,

Government has to issue notification declaring public

streams, wells and tanks for the purpose of application of

provisions of the Act. In the instant case, the Government

has not issued any notification. There is a tank situated in

Sy.No.13 and a water body (natural spring) in Sy.No.18

both are within a distance of 500 meters from the

appellant's land. It is the opinion of the competent authority

and the appellate authority that if permission to sink a

bore-well as sought for by the appellant is granted, it would

result in drying up the streams which is used for public as

well as animals. When these are the facts situation, non

issue of notification u/s 2(7) of the Act would be of no

consequence. The appropriate authority has also not taken

advise from the technical officer. It also not invalidates the

decision of the appropriate authority because such an

advise is formal in nature. It has to be construed that in a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 7</span>




suitable case, the appropriate authority has to seek his

advise.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">       7. Since water is needed for survival and growth, it is

necessary to ensure that benefits are distributed in a fairly

and equitable manner to see that everybody has access to

it to fulfill the minimum needs of drinking water and water

for domestic use. Introduction of high power technology of

extracting ground water strikes at the very root of ground

water as a property right available to every property owner.

The ground water is a dynamic resource which flows from

different channels, the owners of land cannot claim absolute

ownership over water beneath the land.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">       8. An easement is a right which the owner or occupier

of   certain   land   possess   on   which   for   the   beneficial

enjoyment of his land, to do and continue to do something

or to prevent and continue to prevent something being

done in or upon or in respect of certain other land not his

own.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    8</span><p id="p_15">




</p><p id="p_16">     9.      The     Supreme     Court   of   India    has   further

reinterpreted <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India to

include right to water as a fundamental right to life.             The

ground water is not mentioned in any of the list in the 7th

Schedule of the Constitution of India.                This could be

because framers of the Constitution did not envisage a

situation like that of today when ground water in a

particular    area    is   so   scarce   as   to   pose   threat    to

environment, life and livelihood of the people of the

concerned area in several parts of the country. A few land

owners who install powerful bore-wells, tube-wells in the

beginning and thereby succeeded in withdrawing higher

proportion of water may leave little water for other land

owners who join the race later on.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">     10. Though the land owner has got a right over the

ground water but as it is already discussed, the ground

water is not a captive resource.         In fact it flows like the

river beneath the surface.         The nature of the stream or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               9</span>




ground water which moves from one area to another area

and it provides survival and source of growth to the vast

population.   Under these circumstances, the owner of a

particular land claiming as his right under Easementary Act

by putting modern equipment to draw water, which

ultimately deprives public at large. Hence the mandate put

under Section 3 of the Act has to be implemented in its full

spirit to save the public, poor and disadvantaged and to

keep the environment and livestock.         Though the Act

provides to take permission under Section 3 to sink a bore-

well, it has to be understood in a proper perspective that

every bore-well lorry or truck shall take permission from

the competent authority or appropriate authority before

proceeding to sink a bore-well in anybody's land. It should

be in the form of licence to move to sink a bore-well.


</p><p id="p_19">     11. In ancient times, our ancestors gave important

place to environment, worshipped nature namely, Sun,

Moon, Earth, Air, Water, River etc., The water has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              10</span>




worshipped in many forms namely, Gange, Jeeva Nadi,

Symbol of Life. Tanks and lakes were built in every village

and temples and tanks were general found in every village.

Regular monsoon, full of water, tanks, lakes, kalyanies,

river, dams   was a regular picture.    No scarcity of water

noticed. The water was surplus to small population.


</p><p id="p_20">     12. Today's seen is entirely different.   Irregular and

erratic rain patron of monsoon, unevenly distributed rain,

dry lakes and tanks and rivers and drying level reached

dams.   Destruction of forest, unscientific use of water for

irrigation is common feature.     Population explosion also

contributed in it.   The population exceeds 1.1 billion and

growing annually at an astonishing figure of 14%.         The

people are facing thirsty. Such a situation makes necessity

to impose restriction on access to ground water.


</p><p id="p_21">     13. It is not specifically mentioned in the constitution,

right to water, as a fundamental right. Nevertheless, right

to life is provided under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article 21</a> of the Constitution,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                              11</span>




Right to water as a fundamental right. The Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/1646284/" id="a_3">Subhash Kumar vs., State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1991 SC

420 had held that right to environment of pollution free

water.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">     14. In Part-IV of the Constitution, Directive Principles

of State Police, <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_4">Article 39(b)</a> provides that the State shall,

in particular, direct its policy towards securing that the

ownership and control of the material resources of the

community are so distributed as best to sub-serve the

common good. In the light of the said provision, the State

is under its constitutional duty to take control over the

ownership of the material resources of the community, if it

is required to sub-serve the common good. The open wells

even if it belongs to a person, river, lakes, tanks are to be

taken out by the Government if it is in its decision that it

sub-serves the common good.       As it is already discussed,

the underground water springs which flow under the soil

from place to place like a river and the same is found in any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  12</span>




particular place, it should not be treated as its ownership

belongs to a particular individual. If the private owners are

permitted to sink bore-wells and to employ heavy machines

to suck water, it definitely dries up the public water

resources.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">     15. Sub-clause (g) of <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_5">Article 51-A</a> Part-IV-A of the

Constitution provides that it is the duty of every citizen of

India to protect and improve the natural environment

including the forests, lakes, rivers, wildlife and to have

compassion for living creatures.      The constitution puts a

duty on the part of the individual to protect natural

environment including lakes, rivers and water resources for

the better natural environment for them and also for the

succeeding generation.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">     16.     This   Court   in    a   reported   judgment   in

<a href="/doc/1863578/" id="a_6">Venkatagiriyappa vs. Karnataka Electricity Board,

Bangalore &amp; others</a> (1999(4) Kar.L.J.482 (DB), though

it has not held that drinking water is not a right, held that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                13</span>




impugned orders apparently appear to have been issued for

the purpose of protecting the hardship of drinking water

faced by the people in the rural areas. Digging and drilling

of further wells in close proximity of one another, they are

required to be regulated which apparently appears to have

been achieved by issuance of the aforesaid orders.


</p><p id="p_28">     17. Number of statutes such as water (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, the Water Prevention and Control

of Pollution) Cess, Act 1977 etc., lay down the guidelines

for maintenance of water quality as well as for conservation

of water.   The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_8">M.C. Mehta vs., Kamal

Nath</a> (AIR 1988 SC 1037) held that "the Court declared that

our legal system based on English common law includes a

public trust doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State

is the trustee of natural resources which are by nature

meant for public use and enjoyment. The public at large is

the beneficiary of the sea-shore and running water, air,

forest, ecologically fragile lands.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               14</span><p id="p_29">




</p><p id="p_30">      18. The State as a Trustee is under a legal duty to

protect natural resources.     These resources meant for

public use cannot be converted under private ownership. In

this background, the representation seeking permission to

sink a bore-well has to be considered by the authorities.


</p><p id="p_31">      19. In the circumstances, the order passed by the

appropriate authority as per Annexure-B and that of the

appellate authority as per Annexure-A are in consonance

with provisions of the Act and the same has been properly

considered by the writ court elaborately and the reasons

assigned therein are sound and proper. We do not find any

good reasons to interfere.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">      Accordingly the writ appeal is dismissed.
