                           JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">(Judgment delivered by the Bench)




</p><p id="p_2">1.          This appeal is directed against an order dated 28.10.2010 made
     under Section 31 -A of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>
     1981, (for short Air act ) whereunder the Unit of the Appellant was
     directed to be closed and further the electricity Board was directed to
     stop supply of electricity for certain violations under the said Act.
     Aggrieved thereby, the Appellant appears to have approached the
     Hon'ble High Court of Madras in Writ Petition No. 2389 to 2408 of 2010.
     However, the said writ petition papers were directed to be returned to
     the Appellant to enable him to approach the Green Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_3"> 2.        When the matter had come up for hearing on 14.2.2012, we
entertained a doubt as to the maintainability of the application. The Learned
Counsel for the Appellant sought adjournment till date. The Learned Counsel
for the appellant vehemently submitted and argued that though the
impugned order is passed under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Section 31-A</a> of the Air Act and an appeal is
available under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section 31</a> of the same Act to the named authority, this
appeal is also maintainable for various reasons.
</p>

<p id="p_4">           Firstly, the Appellant being aggrieved by the impugned order,
 filed Writ Petition No. 2389 to 2408 of 2010 before the Honorable High
 Court of Madras. The Writ Petition was entertained. However, on
 15.9.2011, the papers were returned to enable the appellant to approach
 this Tribunal. Therefore, there is no necessity for Appellant to approach
 the Appellant Authority u/s 31 of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_5">          Secondly, the Hon'ble High Court of Madras itself has recorded
that to enable Petitioner to approach the Green Tribunal, the papers were
returned, and as such, it is the binding duty of this Tribunal to entertain this
Appeal and dispose it on merits and it cannot examine the aspect of
maintainability at this stage.
</p>

<p id="p_6">   3.    We are afraid, we may not agree with the submission made by the
   Learned Counsel for the appellant, Shri G. Sivabalamurugan in this
   regard. Ours is only a Statutory Tribunal and merely because the papers
   were returned by The Hon'ble High Court of Madras to enable the
   appellant to approach this Tribunal, it cannot be said that we should
   entertain the appeal without examining the legal provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   4.       It is an admitted fact that against the impugned order dated
   28.1.2010, an appeal under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_5">Section 31</a> of the Air Act is available. Instead
   of availing of that remedy, appellant had approached the Hon'ble High
   Court of Madras under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. No
   doubt, the Hon'ble High Court of Madras returned the papers to enable
   the Petitioners to approach this Tribunal. This does not mean that this
   Tribunal can allow Petitioners to bypass the appeal available under
   <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_7">Section 31</a> of the Air Act.
</p><p id="p_8">         Further, this Tribunal is the Appellate Authority against any
order that may be passed by the Appellant Authority under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_8">Section 31</a> of
the Air Act. We are not a constitutional body which can bypass the
appeal provided under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a> by invoking discretionary powers against
the impugned order herein, particularly in the absence of any direction
from the Hon'ble High Court of Madras to entertain the appeal and
dispose it of on merits. We are of the considered opinion that this
appeal is not maintainable. Therefore, the appeal stands dismissed. No
cost.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.      However, we make it clear that it is always open to the Petitioner
to file an appeal under <a href="/doc/377630/" id="a_10">Section 31</a> of the Air Act before the authority
concerned and also seek condonation of delay in filing the appeal in view
of the pendency of the Writ Petition before the Hon'ble Madras High
Court and the appeal filed before this Tribunal. We further make it
clear that the interim order granted by this Tribunal on 18.10.2011 shall
be continued for a period of one month from today and petitioner is at
liberty to file appeal u/s 31 and obtain necessary orders from
appropriate authority, in the meanwhile.
