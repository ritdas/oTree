&amp; AIR IN APPEAL NO.01 OF 2018 DATED 29.1.2018, AS
CONTAINED IN ANNEXURE-A AND ETC.

     THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:


                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The challenge in these petitions is to the interim order

passed by the Karnataka State Appellate Authority under the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a> 1981 (hereinafter

referred as 'the said Acts of 1974 and 1981').


</p><p id="p_2">2.    In these petitions, there is an interim order which directs

that the second respondent shall operate their industries from

6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. In the normal course, the petitions could

have been disposed of by directing the Appellate Authority to

dispose of the appeals. However, it is pointed out that the post

of the Chairperson of the Appellate Authority is vacant.


</p><p id="p_3">3.    Today, the learned Additional Government Advocate has

tendered a memo annexing thereto a letter dated 24th July

2019 issued by the Under Secretary to the Government

(Ecology and Environment), Forest, Ecology and Environment

Department to the learned Government Advocate stating that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   -8-</span>



three names have been recommended for the post of

Chairman and the matter of appointing the Chairman is under

active consideration of the Government.


</p><p id="p_4">4.    The Appellate Authority constituted under the said Acts

of 1974 and 1981 performs an important role. Therefore, the

State Government cannot take unreasonably long time to make

an appointment to the post of Chairperson thereby frustrating

the very object of establishing the Appellate Authority.

Therefore, the appointment will have to be made within a time

bound schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">5.    As we are directing the State Government to appoint the

Chairperson within the time fixed by this Court, the appeals

pending before the Appellate Authority can be ordered to be

disposed of expeditiously while continuing the ad-interim relief

granted by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">6.    As far as W.P.Nos.43995-44005/2018 are concerned, it

is not in dispute that the second respondent company, namely,

M/s. IJM Concrete Products Private Limited has shifted its

activities to some other place.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       -9-</span><p id="p_9">



</p><p id="p_10">7.       Accordingly, we dispose of the petitions by the following

order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         (i)     We    direct   the    State    Government      to   make

                 appointment of the Chairperson of the Appellate

                 Authority as expeditiously as possible and in any

                 event on or before 20th September 2019;


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (ii)    The State shall file a status report for reporting

                 compliance on or before 24th September 2019;

                 Authority being Appeal Nos.1 and 3 of 2018 shall

                 be disposed of as expeditiously as possible.

                 However, till the disposal of the appeals, the

                 interim order passed by this Court directing that

                 the   second     respondent      in     W.P.Nos.43293-

                 43303/2018 shall continue to operate till the

                 place, it is not necessary to continue the interim

                 order against the said respondent.          However, if

            Appellate Authority, the second respondent in the

            said writ petitions resumes its activities at the

            original place, the said interim order will continue

            to govern the second respondent till the disposal

            of the appeals;

            be decided by the Appellate Authority.</blockquote><p id="p_11">
