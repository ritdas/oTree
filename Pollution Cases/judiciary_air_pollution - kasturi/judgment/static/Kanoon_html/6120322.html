<p id="p_1">            The   appellant-Board    filed   criminal   complaint       dated

1.10.1991 against the respondent(s) for offences under Section 21/22 read

with <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_1">Sections 37</a>, <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_2">39</a> and <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_3">40</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short 'the Act'), through its Assistant

Environmental Engineer (AEE), who is competent to institute the

complaint vide notification issued by the State Board dated 19.11.1985
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CRA-S-725-SBA of 2000                                                 -2-</span>

(Mark A).
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.            It is stated that the accused-industry is a company as defined

under <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_5">Section 40</a> of the Act which is one of the offences mentioned in the

complaint but that is on a wrong notion as <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_6">Section 40</a> of the Act only

applies to the offences against the company. It is admitted by the Board

that the accused/respondent No. 1-M/s Mahalaxmi Industries is a

proprietorship concern and accused/respondent No. 2 is the sole

proprietor and thus would not fall within the definition of term company

as given in explanation to <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_7">Section 40</a> of the Act. The explanation to

<a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_8">Section 40</a> of the Act says that for the purposes of this section (a)

"company" means any body corporate, and includes a firm or other

association of individuals; and (b) "director", in relation to a firm, means

a partner in the firm. That is otherwise is not a very relevant factor for

disposal of the instant appeal because accused/respondent No. 2 being the

proprietor of accused/respondent No. 1 admittedly, the appellant-Board

shall not have to satisfy the ingredients of <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_9">Section 40</a> of the Act, for

making those persons as accused, who are responsible to the company for

the conduct of business of the company as well as the company on the

basis of vicarious liability.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.            The basic allegation against the respondent-accused is that

the industry was emitting polluted air in contravention to the provisions

of the Act and did not obtain the consent as required by <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of the

Act and these violations attract the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_11">Section 39</a>

of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.            The respondent-accused was running business of rolling of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CRA-S-725-SBA of 2000                                                 -3-</span>

steel round bars with production of 12 T/day and installed re-rollers and a

coalfed heating furnace for this purpose, for which herollable steel

material is used as raw material, thereby emitting black smoke and SPM

discharged through a stack thus causing air pollution. This industry is

running since the year 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.          It was further stated that the respondent-industry was

discharging the emissions from its premises into the atmosphere, without

obtaining previous consent of the Board and without installing any air

pollution control equipment. On 13.6.1990, the premises of respondent-

accused was visited by PW-1 Sh. N.S. Manshahia, Assistant

Environmental Engineer (AEE) who prepared spot inspection report/field

data sheet Ex. P-2 finding that the industry is using 2T/day coal as fuel in

reverberatory furnace of capacity 1.5 T/hour and, thus, black smoke and

SPM discharged through a stack of 60 ft. height causing air pollution in

the atmosphere. The industry had not made any effort to install air

pollution control devices.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.          The premises of respondent-accused was also visited on

23.3.1991 by Sh. R.K. Goyal, JEE, the authorized officer and it was again

found that no such air pollution control device was installed. The Board

passed a resolution for prosecuting the respondent-accused in its 76th

meeting held on 8.7.1991 and made a complaint before the Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_7">7.          The respondent-accused was summoned by finding prima

facie case and after recording pre-charge evidence, charge was framed

against respondent under the aforesaid sections. The respondent-accused

did not further cross-examine PW-1 after the charge. The respondent No.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CRA-S-725-SBA of 2000                                                 -4-</span>

2 denied all the incriminating circumstances appearing in evidence of the

complainant during this examination under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_12">Section 313</a> of Code of

Criminal Procedure and himself appeared as DW-1 in defence.

</p><p id="p_8">8.          After hearing learned counsel for the parties, the learned trial

Court acquitted the respondent-accused of the charges framed against him

vide judgment dated 7.3.2000, which has been assailed by appellant-

Board in this appeal. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court.

</p><p id="p_9">9.          Learned counsel for the appellant-Board at the outset

contended that he has the instructions from the Board, not to pursue this

appeal because the industry presently running in the said premises has

been granted 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) and necessary consent

under the Act since long. This argument cannot prevail because the

appeal has to be heard on merits after leave to appeal was granted by this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.         I have heard learned counsel for the parties. The record of

lower Court, has also been perused.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.         It is admitted that the respondent-industry was in existence

since September, 1981. This fact is also recorded in the spot inspection

report Ex. P-2 dated 13.6.1990. <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_13">Section 21</a> of the Act prohibits any

person to establish or operate any industrial plant in an air pollution

control area without previous consent of the Board.        Proviso to this

section says that a person operating any industrial plant in any air

pollution control area immediately before the commencement of <a href="/doc/106204869/" id="a_14">Section

9</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 1987

for which no consent was necessary prior to such commencement, may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CRA-S-725-SBA of 2000                                                  -5-</span>

continue to do so for a period of three months from such commencement

or, if he has made an application for such consent within the said period

of three months, till the disposal of such application.

</p><p id="p_12">12.          <a href="/doc/1980619/" id="a_15">Section 9</a> of the Amendment Act of 1987 came into force

w.e.f. Ist of April, 1988, vide notification dated 28.3.1988. It is admitted

that the respondent-accused had applied for grant of necessary consent

under the Act. This is apparent from communication dated 18.12.1990,

Ex. P-3, addressed by appellant-Board to the respondent-accused that the

industry had not installed any air pollution control equipment, so the

consent to the industry under the Act was refused. There is no evidence

to prove that this industry continued working after refusal of the consent.

In paragraph No. 6 of the complaint it is stated that the premises of this

industry was also visited on 23.3.1991, by Sh. R.K. Goyal, JEE, the

authorized officer and it was found that no such air pollution control

device had been installed.     No such report of spot inspection dated

23.3.1991 was proved nor Sh. R.K. Goyal, was examined by the appellant

to prove this fact.     The appellant-Board examined PW-1 Sh. N.S.

Manshaia, AEE only who made spot visit on 13.6.1990.

</p><p id="p_13">13.          It was vehemently contended for the respondent that spot

visit report Ex. P-2 does not show that the industry was infact working

nor PW-1 has stated to this effect. The report Ex. P-2 suggests that

height of the stack was 60 meters from the ground level but what was the

extent of emission of smoke in the area has not been described. There is

also no evidence of collection of samples for test by the laboratory etc.

</p><p id="p_14">14.          Respondent-accused on the other appeared as his own
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CRA-S-725-SBA of 2000                                                 -6-</span>

witness as DW-1 and stated that this industry was leased out to M/s Lok

Tilak Steel Industries vide lease deed Mark-DA, for three years i.e. from

5.7.1990 to 4.7.1993. It is submitted by learned appellant's counsel that

this is only a copy of lease deed but original has not been produced.

PW-1 through whom the complaint was instituted does not deny this fact.

He rather stated in the cross-examination that he does not know if the

factory was leased out vide lease deed Mark-DA.        The contents of the

lease deed would show that M/s Lok Tilak Steel Industries, was a

partnership concern comprising of Mr. Baldev Raj Chopra and Narinder

Paul Chopra as partners and the lease deed is dated 11.7.1990 to be

effective from 5.7.1990.
</p>
<p id="p_15">15.         PW-1 admitted in cross-examination that M/s Lok Tilak

Steel Industries was issued 'No Objection Certificate' Ex. D-4 in the

capacity of lessee of respondent-accused No.1. This certificate Ex. D-1 is

dated 20.12.1991 and issued for pollution angle.           The subsequent

correspondence proved by respondent No.2 as DW-1 between the Board

and M/s Lok Tilak Steel Industries would support the defence version.

Ex. D-2 is a letter dated 8.5.1992, addressed by the Board to M/s Lok

Tilak Steel Industries, that the said industry had to make fresh application

for consent for the expanded capacity of the Industry.           The other

correspondence for the years 1992/1993 entered with M/s Lok Tilak Steel

Industries is Ex. D-3 and D-4.
</p>
<p id="p_16">16.         The next question is whether there was violation of <a href="/doc/67145311/" id="a_16">Section

22</a> of the Act which says that no person operating any industrial plant,

shall discharge or cause or permit to be discharged the emission of any air
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CRA-S-725-SBA of 2000                                                  -7-</span>

pollutant in excess of the standards laid down by the State Board under

clause (g) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_17">Section 17</a> of the Act. Clause (g) of sub-

section (1) of <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_18">Section 17</a> of the Act reads as under:-

                          Board and having regard to the standards for the

                          quality of air laid down by the Central Board,

                          standards for emission of air pollutants into the

                          atmosphere     from    industrial   plants    and

                          automobiles or for the discharge of any air

                          pollution into the atmosphere from any other

                          source whatsoever not being a ship or an

                          aircraft:

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                          Provided that different standards for emission

                          may be laid down under this clause for different

                          industrial plants having regard to the quantity

                          and composition of emission of air pollutants

                          into the atmosphere from such industrial plants."

</blockquote><p id="p_17">No such standards which may have been laid down are proved on record.

It is, therefore, found that the appellant-Board did not lead appropriate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> CRA-S-725-SBA of 2000                                               -8-</span>

evidence to prove charges against the respondent-accused.

</p><p id="p_18">17.         The lower Court was, however, impressed by the fact that the

respondent-accused was holding valid consent for the period of one year

from 6.7.1990 to 5.7.1991 on the basis of letter Ex. P-4 issued by the

appellant-Board. That is an incorrect finding as Ex. P-4 is a consent

under Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and not

under the Act of 1981. The consent was obviously in reference to an

application made by respondent-accused at earlier point of time. The

columns of date of application are, however, missing in Ex. P-4.

</p><p id="p_19">18.         From the above discussion, I am of the view that appellant-

Board was unable to prove the charges against respondent accused by

leading cogent evidence. The acquittal rendered by the lower Court thus

cannot be interferred, though for different reasons. The instant appeal is

thus dismissed. The bail bonds furnished by respondent No. 2-accused

shall stand discharged.
