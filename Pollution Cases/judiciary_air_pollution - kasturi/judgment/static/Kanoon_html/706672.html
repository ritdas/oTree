ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. S.J. MUKHOPADHAYA)
 

 


 

	Having
heard the counsel for the parties, taking into consideration the
public interest and as suggested by the parties, the following order
is passed for the present :-
</p> 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_2">There
	will be a monitoring agency consisting of experts of Sardar
	Vallabhbhai Patel National Institute of Technology, Surat  ( SVPNIT 
	for short) which will monitor all the units situated within Sarigam
	Industrial Estate, Valsad.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_3">All
	the industrial units situated within Sarigam Industrial Estate,
	Valsad will get their respective units checked and obtain
	certification from SVPNIT.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_4">The
	industrial units not discharging any effluent (zero discharge) and
	not connected with any drain will also get their units checked and
	obtain certificate from the aforesaid agency.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_5">The
	running industrial units, having effluent treatment plants to treat
	their effluents, are also required to get their respective units
	checked and obtain certification to show that they are treating
	their effluents in conformity with the parameters required under the
	law.  They will give specific undertaking in writing that they will
	operate their respective treatment plant all times, failing which
	the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) may close the unit.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_6">The
	units, which have been ordered to be closed or have already been
	closed, are allowed to start trial production and may discharge
	their treated effluents, but they will have to get their respective
	unit checked and inspected by SVPNIT within one week from the date
	of trial production.  Necessary electrical and water connection may
	be given for trial production, subject to the final order as may be
	passed by this Court.  For further continuance of their units, they
	will have to obtain permission from this Court which may be granted
	on the basis of the report of SVPNIT within a period of fifteen days
	from the date of trial production, failing which they will have to
	close their unit and there shall be disconnection of electricity and
	water supply.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_7">SVPNIT
	is directed to get all the industrial units situated within the
	Sarigam Industrial Estate checked and certified to find out whether
	they fulfill the norms under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of
	Pollution) Act</a> and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. 
	It will submit its first report before the Court and may make
	surprise inspection any time subsequently during the present
	calendar year.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_8">For
	such inspection, the following amount is prescribed for payment in
	favour of SVPNIT by the industrial units for the rest of the
	calendar year :-
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_9">(a)	Plastic
industry will pay Rs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand only) in favour of
SVPNIT.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">(b)	The
other industries whose capital investment towards movable and
immovable property is less than Rs.5 Crores, will pay Rs.25,000/-
(Rupees twenty five thousand only) each in favour of SVPNIT.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">(c)	The
rest of the industries (large scale industries) will pay a sum of
Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) each in favour of SVPNIT.
</p> 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_12">Each
	industrial unit will ensure that the in-house treatment plant in
	their respective industrial unit is certified by SVPNIT.  In absence
	of such certification, the Court may order for closure of such unit.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_13">It
	will be open to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to get
	the industrial units of the area monitored through the aforesaid
	agency viz. SVPNIT for subsequent calendar year and for that it may
	prescribe annual fee to be deposited by one or other industry with
	the SVPNIT.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_14">In
	case any of the industries fails to deposit the amount with the
	SVPNIT within a month for inspection in terms of the Court s
	order, the GPCB will close such unit.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_15">Sarigam
	Industrial Association shall take the responsibility to monitor the
	treatment of effluent of its member industries before pushing it to
	the pumping station.  If it comes to the notice of the Association
	that any of its members or even a non-member is discharging
	untreated effluents in the pumping station, it will bring the same
	to the notice of the Pollution Control Board.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_16">Random
	monitoring and checking will be conducted by SVPNIT.  Apart from it,
	it will also be open to the GPCB to conduct random checking and
	monitoring of any of the industries.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_17">The
	Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) may repair the
	existing effluent pipeline.  In any case, they will install and
	complete the new pipeline to carry the treated effluents to the sea
	as per the norms by 30th May, 2010.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_18">The
	State Government and the District Administration are directed to
	give necessary police protection to the GIDC, if it so requires, for
	laying down the new pipeline.
</p>
 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_19">The
	Pollution Control Board will submit its report alongwith the details
	of certification as made by SVPNIT in favour of one or other
	industry for further order.
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_20">Direct
service of this order is permitted.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_21">Post
the matters on 8th April, 2010.
