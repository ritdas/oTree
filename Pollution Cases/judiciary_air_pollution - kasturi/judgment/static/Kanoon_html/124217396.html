 JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1      In brief plaintiff M/s.Leatheroid Plastics Pvt.Ltd. filed the suit for

declaration   and   mandatory   injunction   through   its   director   Sh.Vipul

Goel.     As   per   the   plaintiff   case,   Sh.Vipul   Goel   being   one   of   the

director   was   duly   authorised   by   the   Board   of   Directors   vide   its

Resolution dt.22.10.98 to institute the suit.  As per the plaintiff case,

plaintiff   is   a   registered   consumer   of   electricity     vide   K.No.   X

10191001186/BS­11/1   installed   at   premises   no.B­11/31,   Mohan

Cooperative Industrial Estate, Badarpur, New Delhi.  It is disclosed in

the   plaint   that   under   sect.31(A)of   Air   (Prevention   &amp;   <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control   of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 vide letter dt.7.1.96, the factory premises of the

plaintiff company was sealed w.e.f. 8.1.98.   Delhi Pollution Control

Committee   revoked the direction of sealing of the premises of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                     2</span>
 plaintiff vide letter dt.13.4.98 with immediate effect.  As per the case

of   the   plaintiff   between   8.1.98   and   13.4.98   the   factory   premises

remained   sealed   as   per   the   direction   of   Delhi   Pollution   Control

Committee   and   during   the   said   period   the   plaintiff   Co.was   the

incapacitated to run its business.  It is stated that during the period of

sealing, no electricity was consumed.   Vide order Ex.PW1/2, at the

time of sealing of the premises of the plaintiff, DVB was directed to

disconnect   the   electricity   supply,   but   still   the   electricity   was   not

disconnected.  The bills were continuously raised even for the period

in   which   the   premises   remained   sealed   and   no   electricity   was

consumed.     Despite   legal   notice,   the   matter   was   not   referred   to

arbitrator   by   defendant   and   adjustments   for   the   period   in   which

factory premises remained  sealed was not given.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                                    3</span>
 2      Therefore, plaintiff has prayed the relief of declaration thereby

declaring the impugned bill of Rs.4,61,416/­ as illegal arbitrarily and

void.   Plaintiff has prayed for mandatory injunction thereby directing

the defendant to refund the amount paid by plaintiff during the period

of disconnection from the date of the sealing of premises I.e. 28.1.98.

In   view   of   the   interim   orders   of   the   court   and   further   directions   to

defendant   to   re­finalized   the   bill   on   the   basis   of   taking   the

disconnection date from the date of sealing of the factory premises.




3      In   written   statement,   it   was   alleged   that   plaintiff   has   not

approached the court with clean hands and suppressed the material

facts.   The electricity supplied was disconnected on 3.12.98 due to

non   payment   of   dues   and   an   amount   of   Rs.7,61,391/­   was

outstanding against plaintiff as on 21.8.99.  In preliminary objections,

 it was alleged that suit is bad for non  joinder to necessary parties as

Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has not been impleaded

as a necessary party.   It was alleged that relief of declaration was

claimed by way of amendment of plaint at a highly belated stage and

therefore, the relief of declaration is barred by limitation.  It was also

alleged   that   plaintiff   has   not   affixed   the   proper   court   fee   on   the

demand of Rs.7,16,391/­.   On merits, the fact that premises of the

plaintiff   was   sealed   as   per   direction   of   Delhi   Pollution   Control

Committee was denied for want of knowledge.  It was submitted that

electricity supply of the plaintiff was not  disconnected because of the

orders   of   DPCC,   but   due   to   non   payment   of  bills.     Other   material

contents of the written statement were also denied.

5       In   order   to   prove   its   case   PW1   Sh.Vipul   Goel,   one   of   the

director of the plaintiff Co.appeared in the witness box.   He proved

his authorizing   Ex.PW1/1,   Letter dt.7.1.98 from DPCC Ex.PW1/2,

letter   from   DPCC   Ex.PW1/3,     Final   order   given   on   16.12.99

 dt.23.398.   He   stated   that   despite   directions   of   DPCC,   bills   were

continuously   raised   by   the   defendant,   though   the   premises   was

sealed and electricity was not used.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      During cross examination, nothing material could be achieved.

It was not disputed that the premises of the plaintiff was sealed by

DPCC   between   the   period   from   8.1.98   to   23.3.98.   There   was   no

material cross examination on the other aspect of the testimony of

PW1.  The authenticity of documents proved on record was also not

disputed during cross examination.

Ld.Predecessor vide order dt.29.7.09.

 record   and   the   written   submissions   filed   by   the   parties.    I  have

carefully   considered   the   arguments   advanced   at  bar.       Issue   wise

discussions is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_19">


7  Issue no.:Whether this court has pecuniary jurisdiction to try


the present suit?
</p>
<p id="p_20">
Issue no.:Whether the plaintiff has valued his suit property for


the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction?
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      In order to avoid repetition these two issues are taken together

for discussion.     As per the amended plaint, plaintiff has valued the

suit for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction at Rs.4,49,656/­for

the   relief   of   declaration   and   ad­valorem   court   fee   has   been   paid,

whereas   the   relief   of   mandatory   injunction   has   been   valued

atRs.130/­ and the court fee has been paid.  A preliminary objection

 was taken in this regard in the written statement.   No question was

asked during cross examination of PW1 in respect of the valuation of

the   suit,   pecuniary   jurisdiction   of   the   court   or   the   court   fee.     No

evidence has been lead from the side of the defendant.  Allegations

taken   in   preliminary   objections   has   not   been   proved   by   the

defendant.   After   careful   consideration,   in   my   opinion,   as   per   the

amended plaint  the court has the pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain

and try the suit.  The suit has been valued properly for the purpose of

court fee and jurisdiction and proper court fee has been paid.  Issue

is   accordingly   decided   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff   and   against   the

defendant.

nothing has been asked in this regard.  The relief of declaration and

mandatory   injunction   has   been   claimed   by   plaintiff   against   the

defendant in respect of the electricity bill raised by the defendant, in

which   DPCC   has   no   role   to   play.     In   my   view,   DPCC   was   not   a

necessary   party   in   the   suit.     Objection   has   been   taken   by   the

defendant   without   any   substance.     Issue   is  accordingly  decided   in

              held, respondent's suit barred by limitation"




       I  have carefully considered the submissions of Ld.Counsel for


defendant.   In   my   view,   the   case   of   Tarlok   Singh   was   decided   in

different facts, where a suit for permanent injunction was converted

in a suit for specific performance of contract.  In the present suit, the

dispute   was   pertaining   to   the   impugned   bill   and   originally   suit   for

permanent   and   mandatory   injunction   was   filed   by   the   plaintiff.

Objections were taken from the side of the defendant.  A preliminary

issue was framed by the court to the effect, whether without seeking

the relief of declaration suit is maintainable,   In view of the law laid


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                                    14</span>
 down by Hon.High Court of Delhi in the case of Sarjivan Singh Vs.

DVB.     An   application   under   order   6   rule   17  CPC  was   filed   by   the

plaintiff for seeking amendment in the plaint and thereby the relief of

declaration was added. After careful consideration, in my opinion, by

way of the amendment, neither the cause of action nor the nature of

the suit was changed.   The same relief was claimed in the original

plaint   in   the   form   of   mandatory   and   permanent   injunction,   but   the

material dispute was pertaining to the payment of court fee.   In my

opinion, judgment cited by Ld.counsel for defendant is not applicable

in the facts and circumstances of the case.  As the material relief was

already claimed in the form of mandatory and permanent injunction,

the   suit   for   declaration   is   not   barred   by   limitation.     Issue   is

accordingly   decided   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff   and   against   the

defendant.

Whether   the   plaintiff   is   entitled   for   the   relief   of   mandatory

<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">      For the sake of convenience and in order to avoid the repetition


both the issues are taken together for discussion.  Main case of the

plaintiff  is   that   as   per the   orders  issued   by Delhi Pollution   Control

Committee, the factory premises of the plaintiff remained sealed from

8.1.98   to   13.4.98.     Between   8.1.98   to   13.4.98   the   plaintiff   Co.was

incapacitated to run the factory premises or to use the electricity.  As

per the plaintiff case, despite directions to DVB by DPCC vide letter

Ex.PW1/2,   the   electricity   supply   was   not   disconnected,   rather   the

bills   were   continuously   raised   even   for   the   period   from   8.1.98   to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                                  16</span>
 13.4.98.   In written statement, the fact that premises of the plaintiff

remained   sealed   between   8.1.98   to   13.4.98   was   not   specifically

denied.     Only it was denied for want of knowledge.   During   cross

examination   of   PW1,   the   fact   of   sealing   of   the   premises   was   not

disputed.   So,   it   has   been   proved   on   record   by   the   plaintiff   that

premises   of   the   plaintiff   remained   sealed   from   8.1.98   to   13.4.98.

Letter Ex.PW1/2 by DPCC is not in dispute.   As per this letter, DVB

was directed to disconnected the electricity supply.  DVB and DPCC

both are the agencies controlled by the Government.  The directions

of DPCC in respect of disconnection of electricity was not complied

with by the defendant.  Testimony of plaintiff could not be challenged

on material points during cross examination.   No evidence has been

lead from the side of the defendant.  Keeping in view the entire facts

and  circumstances  and  the  testimony  of  witnesses,   in my opinion,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                                   17</span>
 plaintiff   has   been   able   to   establish   the   material   avernments   of   its

case.    It  has  been proved  on record that  electricity  bills has been

raised by the defendant even for the period from 8.12.98 to 13.4.98

in which the factory premises of the plaintiff remained sealed. In my

opinion, the action  of the defendant is  not in  consonance  with the

principal of natural justice and equities.  Defendant can not be asked

to pay the electricity bill for the period from 8.1.98 to 13.4.98 in which

the   factory   premises   remained   sealed.     Accordingly,   in   my   view,

plaintiff is entitled for the relief of declaration as well as for mandatory

injunction.  Issue is accordingly decided in favour of the plaintiff and

against the defendant.
