<p id="p_1">  1.       In the Bhopal edition of daily newspaper 'Times of India' dated 10th

  April, 2013 a news item was published on the front page under the caption

  "Dolomite mining a threat to Tiger corridor in Kanha - Foresters want ban

  on mining in Mandla District". Considering the gravity of the news item suo-

  motu cognizance was taken by this Tribunal and notice was issued to the

  Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 on 10th April, 2013 with a direction to place on record

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                      Page 4 of 25</span>
 the particulars of Mining Leases (in short 'ML') mentioned in the news item. In

response to the above notice, the Respondent No.5, Madhya Pradesh State

Pollution Control Board (in short 'MPPCB') submitted reply dated 29th April,

2013 stating that the officials of the MPPCB inspected the Dolomite mines in

Mandla District and monitored the Ambient Air Quality (in short 'AAQ') in

different locations where Consent to Operate the mines was granted to 36 ML

holders. Out of 36 mines, 26 mines are having valid Consent to Operate and

during the inspection they were found to be under operation. Of the remaining

10 mines for which Consent to Operate has expired, it was found that 2 mines

are still under operation which is irregular and 8 mines are closed. Therefore

show notice was issued for closure of the aforesaid 2 mines. With regard to

AAQ it is reported that the standards are within the permissible limits and no

pollution is observed. However, not satisfied with the above reply of the

MPPCB, during the hearing of the case on 1st May, 2013 this Tribunal directed

the MPPCB to furnish full particulars of all the Dolomite mines in Mandla

District.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.          Vide their additional return filed on 7th May, 2013 the MPPCB stated

that the lease holders of 2 mines for which Consent to Operate had expired,

applied for extension of the consent and their applications are pending with the

MPPCB. It was further stated in the return that after verification of the record

obtained from the Asst. Mining Officer, Mandla District it was found that there

are 8 more Mining Leases granted in the area making a total of 43 mines. These

8 Mining lease holders have not sought any consent so far from the MPPCB

and therefore being unaware of their existence, the MPPCB had submitted their

earlier reply dated 29th April, 2013 listing only 36 mines. However, the

aforesaid 8 mines, listed at Sl. No. 36 to 43 in the list enclosed with the reply,

are not under operation and they have not yet applied for the consent. Based on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                        Page 5 of 25</span>
 the reply of MPPCB notices were ordered to be issued by this Tribunal in its

order dated 9th May, 2013, to the erring ML holders Respondent Nos. 7 to 15.

Further, in compliance of the orders of this Tribunal on 05.08.2013 as to how

many mines have obtained the Environmental Clearance (for short 'EC'), a

status report dated 10th August, 2013 was filed by the MPPCB wherein it was

stated that the Collector (Mines), District Mandla is having direct control over

the mines and the mine owners submit their monthly production details/returns

to the Office of the Collector (Mines) and after obtaining information about the

mines sanctioned and material extracted from the office of the Collector

(Mines), a list of 43 mines was furnished vide their previous return dated

07.05.2013


</p><p id="p_4">3.        On 22nd August, 2013 this Tribunal directed the MPPCB to constitute

a committee to inspect all the 24 Dolomite Mines under operation and furnish

detailed report. Accordingly, in their reply the MPPCB stated that a committee

was constituted and the committee members inspected the mines from 29th to

31st August, 2013. At the time of inspection it was found that almost all the

mines are temporarily not working due to heavy rains in the locality. However

certain deficiencies were found in the mines and hence they were allowed 15

days time to submit their explanation. The MPPCB stated that out of 24 ML

holders 15 ML holders have submitted their reply and after considering the

replies in detail appropriate action will be taken.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.        In their further affidavit dated 27.09.2013, the MPPCB submitted that

out of 43 mines 24 are having valid ML and are under operation and therefore

they do not immediately require the EC as EC is required only at the time of

their renewal. However, out of 24 units which are under operation 2 units

already obtained EC. In respect of the ML of Shri Santosh Jain consent expired

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                      Page 6 of 25</span>
  on 31.08.13 and the renewal application is pending with the Board. Thus in all,

 out of 43, 19 units (placed at Annexure R-2 of the affidavit) are not under

 operation and prosecution against the following 8 units which were found

 operating without obtaining consent from the MPPCB and also against the

 concerned Mining Officer for allowing lease          holders to continue mining

 operations without obtaining consent from MPPCB, has been launched.

</pre><p id="p_7">           It was also submitted in the reply of the MPPCB that the MPPCB has

 communicated to the Mining Officer to make sure that extraction of the mineral

 beyond the permissible limits is not allowed and strict compliance of the

 conditions, imposed while granting the consent, is ensured.


</p><p id="p_8"> 5.        Again as per the orders of this Tribunal issued on 27th September,

 2013 a joint inspection team was constituted by the MPPCB and the team

 conducted inspection of mines from 21st to 23rd October, 2013. The report

 states that the mines are located in clusters at villages Mugdara and Bhatiyatola

 towards the western side of        Banjar river and at Bhawartal, Kakaiya and

 Katamal villages located towards eastern side of the Banjar river.            The

 following aspects were taken on record while inspecting the mines.

</pre><p id="p_9"> 6.        The Respondent MPPCB further stated in their reply that all these

Dolomite Mines are doing open cast mining as per the mining plan approved by

the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM). As per the list of mines enclosed with the

reply the lease area of the 24 mines under operation is ranging from 0.78

hectares to 19.223 hectares but most of them are below 5 hectares falling in the

range of 2 to 3 hectares.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">7.        The Respondent No. 2, 3, 4 &amp; 6 filed combined reply along with the

affidavit of the Divisional Forest Officer, West Mandla division, Asst.

Geologist, Directorate of Geology and Minerals and Mining officer, Office of

the Collector, Mandla. It was stated in the reply that as on 1st April, 2013 a

total of 43 Dolomite MLs were sanctioned by the Department of Mines out of

which MPPCB has given Consent to Operate (filed at Annex R-1-A) to 26 MLs

and therefore rest of the 17 MLs (filed at Annex R-1-B) are not under operation.

These 26 mines under operation are located within 250 mt. from the forest

boundary. Out of 17 mines not under operation, renewal applications in case of

10 MLs are under consideration of Respondent No. 6 and since the MPPCB has

also not given any further consent the Department of Mines has stopped

providing transit passes to these 10 ML holders (filed at Annex R-1-C). It was

further stated in the reply that so far only 3 MLs where the lease period expired

and another 10 mines whose lease period is going to expire shortly, have

applied for renewal within the prescribed time limit of 12 months within the

purview of the Rule 24-A of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (filed at

Annex R-1-D &amp; R-1-E).
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">8.        It was further stated in the reply that as per the Forest Department

Circular No. F-5/16/81/10-3 Bhopal dated 7th October, 2002 in ordinary course

ML will not be sanctioned within 250 mt. from the forest area / boundary. In

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                       Page 8 of 25</span>
 that event if the District Collector, considering the importance of the mining,

decides that it is necessary to sanction the ML, the matter will be referred for

consideration of Panchayat Level Committee consisting President, Zila

Panchayat, District Collector and the Divisional Forest Officer. However it was

mentioned in the Circular that 250 mt. rider will not be applicable to the

existing MLs sanctioned prior to 7th October, 2002.       Subsequently in the

that during the site inspection it was observed that the mining operations are

going on without any scientific and technical inputs. Overburden is dumped in

the mining area without marking any designated place and without any sloping

and terracing leading to loss of valuable top soil. The mine water is being

pumped without any treatment and allowed to settle in the nearby natural water

bodies. It was also stated that during the field visit wild animals such as wild

boar, deer, jackal etc. were found in the area. It was also suggested that for the

violation of the conditions by the ML holders, the MPPCB may be directed to

      host dispersing aged individuals from the Kanha source. In this
      context, the disturbance and habitat loss caused by the mines and
      its associated infrastructure development would be detrimental
      for the source value of Kanha. If the communication route to and
      fro from these mines is from the south or south-west, then it can
      have disastrous effects of reducing the corridor connectivity
      between Kanha and Pench Tiger sources. Therefore, all caution

</blockquote><p id="p_36">20.        Having gone through the record placed before us and having heard the

Learned Counsel for the parties at length it is required to examine and discuss

the issues to arrive at a conclusion whether any environmental laws are violated

while granting MLs and whether any ecologically sensitive areas were

subjected to illegal activities resulting damage to the environment in general

and wildlife habitat in particular more so in case of Tiger.


</p><p id="p_37">21.        We are conscious of the fact that under Schedule-I of the National

Green Tribunal Act, 2010 Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 is not listed and

therefore this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the matters related to

Wildlife. But in this particular case the issue to be examined is whether these

mines are sanctioned and allowed to operate in violation of provisions of the

thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_38">22.       As defined under the Act of 1986 'Environment' includes water, air

and land and the inter relationship which exists among and between water, air

and land and human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro organisms and

property. We are of the opinion that occurrence of Wildlife in a particular

ecosystem having relation with the environment has to be considered as a part

of environment and therefore the matters related to wildlife are liable for

adjudication and can be definitely brought under the environmental

jurisprudence more so in cases pertaining to ESZs and therefore the matter

being dealt in this OA is not just a Wildlife issue par se to be adjudicated under

the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. Certainly the provisions of the Act of 1986

and Rules made thereunder are liable to be examined in this case. <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_3">Section 3</a> of

the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 gives powers to the Central

Government to take all measures which if feels are necessary for protecting and

improving the quality of environment and to prevent and control environmental

pollution. To meet this objective, the Central Government can restrict areas in

which any industries, operations or processes or class of industries, operations

or processes shall not be carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain

safeguards [<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> (2) (v)]. Rule 5 (1) of the Environment (Protection)

Rules, 1986 states that the Central Government can prohibit or restrict the

location of industries and carrying on of certain operations or processes on the

basis of considerations like the biological diversity of an area (clause v)

maximum allowable limits of concentration of pollutants for an area (clause ii)

environmentally compatible land use (clause vi) proximity to Protected Areas

</p><p id="p_40"> 23.      Wildlife is a part of environment and any action that is causing

damage to the wildlife or that may likely to lead to damage to the cause of

wildlife, cannot be excluded from the purview of this Tribunal. Therefore,

movement of Tigers in a particular locality which is in proximity to the

Protected Area requires certain measures to be taken for protection. The

National Wildlife Action Plan (NWAP) 2002-2016 indicates that "Areas

outside the Protected Area network are often vital ecological corridor links and

must be protected to prevent isolation of fragments of biodiversity which will

not survive in the long run. Land and water use policies will need to accept the

imperative of strictly protecting ecologically fragile habitats and regulating use

elsewhere". <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">The Act</a>ion Plan also indicates that "All identified areas around

Protected Areas and wildlife corridors to be declared as ecologically fragile

under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_6">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986."
</p>
<p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">24.      This whole issue of regulating mining activities in the area in question

is due to the fact that it is reported that in the vicinity of these mines movement

of Tiger which is a flagship wildlife species and declared as a National animal

and which has got a special threatened status, is noticed. Latest reports reveal

that the efforts made by the Forest Departments across the country under the

strict regime of Wildlife laws enacted for the protection of wildlife and through

regular monitoring and support of the MoEF and NTCA and also as the issue of

protecting Tiger in the wild is reviewed at the highest level and given maximum

thrust, the Tiger population in the wild in the country is reported to have gone

up from 1411 in 2006 to 1706 2010 which augurs well for this charismatic big

cat but the concern here is that during the same period the Tiger occupancy area

is reported to have gone down from 94,000 Sq. Km. to 82,000 Sq. Km. across

the Tiger bearing States. Corresponding decrease in the Tiger occupancy area is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                       Page 17 of 25</span>
 leading to territorial conflict among the Tigers pushing the sub adults and old

and infirm among them to the fringes of          the Protected Areas leading to

escalation of man animal conflict. The frequent incidents of Tigers straying into

human habitations around the Protected Areas clearly indicate a rise in their

population. Reports also indicate that Tigers are getting killed in territorial

fights, with their population increasing. The incidents which have been widely

reported during the past one year and statistics compiled by the NTCA support

this argument and it is reported that a number of human deaths have occurred

and still occurring in various parts of the country. It is reported that in the

landscape nearer to the Central Western Ghats which consists of forests in

Karnataka and adjacent parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu and also in the

Badhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh there is highest concentration of

Tigers in the wild in the world. It is also reported that Tiger populations in some

well protected reserves, have dramatically rebounded with their numbers

attaining near saturation densities of 10-15 per 100 sq. km. Therefore the

concern here is that there is bound to be further escalation of       man animal

conflict. The recent spate of increase in Tiger attacks has made the striped

animal unpopular. The population of Tigers is increasing in the wild whereas

their habitat is shrinking and is under severe threat because of various

anthropogenic activities. Mining is one of the most disturbing activities in these

sensitive areas.
</p>
<p id="p_43">                          (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_44">25.       The recent reports further reveal that due to increase in their

population, because of good management practices, it is not only leading to

increase of incidents of human animal conflict but the Tigers are trying to

migrate/disburse to the nearest Protected Area/wildlife habitats by establishing

corridor even in non forest tracts crossing human habitations and criss cross
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                       Page 18 of 25</span>
 road net work. The best example is the recent news report wherein it was stated

that one male Tiger is moving from Panna Tiger Reserve and heading towards

Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve which is about 120 km. distance crossing the

fragmented habitat.    It is reported that earlier the corridor from Panna to

Bandhavgarh was freely accessible for movement of wildlife but of late,

increase the anthropogenic activity caused its discontinuity. This incident gives

an indication how even the areas well beyond 10 km. from the boundaries of the

Protected Areas and restoration of lost corridors connecting the habitat of this

magnificent animal are critical and there is urgent need to minimize the human

interference in these areas particularly from the activities such as mining.


</p><p id="p_45">26.       Forest corridors play an important role in movement of Tigers from

one locality to the other and thus help avoid inbreeding and maintain genetic

variation among the Tigers.      Therefore there is every need to restore the

corridors wherever possible and increase the size of buffer areas around the

Protected Areas if scientific management of the Tigers has to be sustained

keeping pace with their increase in numbers in the wild. A new mechanism is

required to be put into place adding as many buffer areas including non forest

lands adjacent to the Protected Areas / forest areas, as possible. The private

landscapes which are contiguous to the Reserved Forests also can be identified

through an innovative mechanism within the framework of the existing

environmental and wildlife provisions based on the scientific and objective

criteria and developed as ecologically viable buffers which will increase

opportunities and create viable buffers to existing Tiger habitats in the Protected

Areas and reserves. Further, maintaining gene flow between isolated Tiger

population is very important in order to avoid deleterious effects of low genetic

diversity and inbreeding.

</p><p id="p_47"> 27.      As per the guidelines issued by the MoEF itself, it was held that in

cases where sensitive corridors connectivity and ecologically important patches,

crucial for landscape linkage are even beyond 10 km. width, these should be

included in the ESZ. In the context of a Protected Area the distribution of an

area of ESZ and the extent of regulation may not be uniform all around and it

could be variable in width and extent. ESZs are meant to act as shock absorbers

for regulating and managing the activities around such Protected Areas and they

are not meant to hamper day to day activities but insist for protecting the

precious forest / Protected Areas in their locality from any negative impact.

The areas surrounding the Protected Areas require well planned management

and interventions. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is

required to ensure that areas connecting Tiger habitats are not diverted for

ecologically unsustainable activities except in public interest and with the

approval of National Board for Wildlife.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">28.      Considering all the above issues one can safely conclude that wildlife

and its habitats are part and parcel of environment and preservation of

environment shall form the centre stage of implementation of management

practices and therefore it is for the authorities to examine how far the existing

Dolomite mines in Mandla District are permitted to continue their operations as

these mines are located in close proximity to the wildlife habitats though it is

contended by the Chief Wildlife Warden of the State himself that presently they

are not required to be brought under ESZ as they do not fall within 10 km. from

the boundary of the Protected Areas.

 boundary. It was clear in the report of the MPPCB &amp; Regional Office, MoEF,

Bhopal that some of the ML holders have resorted to irregularities including

encroachment of forest land and it appears that so far no concrete action has

been taken against the erring ML holders as per the record placed before us.


</p><p id="p_52">30.       It is reported that the Dolomite mined from these mines in Mandla

District is of superior quality, highly valued and is in good demand in the

market.   It is also reported that this superior quality mineral is not found

elsewhere in the country. However mining is required to be taken up only if it is

compatible with the objective of protecting the environment, more so in the

context of location of Dolomite mines relatively in close proximity to Kanha

National Park. While the objective of granting ML forms part of the

development process of the country, it is the duty of the Central Government

and the State Government to take steps to protect the environment which

includes wildlife and maintain the ecological balance and prevent damage that

may be caused by mining operations. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1658270/" id="a_7">Sansar

Chand v. State of Rajasthan</a>, (2010) 10 SCC 604 held that



          "All efforts must be made to implement the spirit and
          provisions of the Wild life <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_8">(Protection) Act</a>, 1972; the
          provisions of which are salutary and are necessary to be
          implemented to maintain ecological chain and balance. The
          Stockholm Declaration, the Declaration of United Nations,
          Conventions on Human Environment signed in the year
          1972, to which India is the signatory, have laid down the
          foundation of sustainable development and urged the
          nations to work together for the protection of the
          environment. Conventions on Biological Diversity, signed
          in the year 1962 at Rio Summit, recognized for the first time
          in International Law that the conservation of biological
          diversity is a common concern of human kind and is an
          integral part of the development process".

           humans, in other words, humans take precedence and
           human responsibilities to non-human are based benefits to

            concentration of labour, deployment of machinery, movement of

            trucks to and from the mine sites shall definitely have a cumulative

       shall be regulated in consultation with the Forest Department so as to

       not to disturb the wildlife in the area.

<p id="p_63">iii.   The reply filed on behalf of the State Govt. functionaries reveal that

       there is no coordination between the Mining and Forest Departments

       atleast in case of those mines which are located in the Forest area and

       which are in close proximity to the forest boundary. In the reply filed

       on behalf of the Respondents No. 2, 3, 4 and 6 it was stated that the

       local Forest officials have expressed their deep concern pertaining to

       the mines sanctioned in the Reserved Forest and mine operators are

       required to obtain transit passes from the Forest Department. It was

       also stated that the ML conditions are not informed to the Forest

       Department and the ML holders are also reluctant to provide the

       information to the Forest Department. There is a need to put full stop

       to this state of affairs and streamline the entire procedure of

       sanctioning &amp; operating the mines. The Government should evolve a

       suitable mechanism to avoid such conflicting situation and ensure

       coordination among all the law enforcing authorities in the state.

iv.    The irregularities pointed in the reply filed by the Regional Office,

       MoEF shall be taken up seriously and all the mines found violating

       the provisions &amp; ML conditions as well as Environmental laws shall

       be dealt with seriously in accordance with law.

<p id="p_65">      vi.       Even though the mines are under operation for a long period, it is

                surprising to note that such grave irregularities have been noticed only

                during the inspection of mines by the officials of the Regional Office,

                MoEF that too after the case was taken up suo motu by this Tribunal

                and no record was placed before us to the effect that any severe action

                has been taken against the defaulting ML holders.           The Chief

                Secretary shall get the whole issue enquired and initiate action against

                the erring officials if it is found that they indulged in dereliction of

                duty by allowing the mines to continue to operate violating the law.



         vii.   With regard to those mines which are located on the boundary of the

                notified forest itself the issue may be examined in details and action

                may be taken to revoke their licence in accordance with law, if no

                such provision of granting MLs touching the notified forest boundary,
