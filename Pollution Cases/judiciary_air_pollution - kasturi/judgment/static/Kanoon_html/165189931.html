                                                  ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">Date : 27-09-2019



       This order will dispose of all the above three writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    Heard Dr A K Saraf, learned Senior Counsel, assisted by Mr P Baruah, learned counsel for the
petitioners in WP(C) Nos. 6179 and 6180 of 2013 and Mr R K Agarwal, learned counsel for the petitioner
in WP(C) No. 6320/2013. Also heard Mr D Mazumdar, learned Senior Counsel and Additional Advocate
General, Assam, assisted by Mr S Biswas, learned counsel for the State respondents; Mr S C Keyal, learned
Assistant Solicitor General of India; Mr A C Borbora, learned Senior Counsel, assisted by Mr M Smith,
learned counsel for added respondent Nos. 10, 11 and 12 in WP(C) No. 6179/2013; and Mr V Rajkhowa,
learned counsel for respondent No. 10 in WP(C) No. 6180/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    In all the writ petitions, challenge made is to the closure notices issued by the State respondents in the
Environment and Forest Department, Government of Assam, to close down the cement manufacturing
industrial units of the petitioners on the ground that those are situated within 10 km radius from the
boundary of Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    In WP(C) No. 6179/2013, impugned notice is dated 26.09.2013, issued by the Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Environment and Forest Department addressed to the Divisional Forest Officer,
Kamrup (East) Division to take immediate steps for closure of three cement units, which are situated within
10 km radius from Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary and to submit compliance report. The said letter was issued
on the basis of letter from the Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (C), Ministry of
Environment and Forests, Government of India, Regional Office at Shillong.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.    The said letter dated 26.09.2013 is also under assailment in WP(C) No. 6180/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    In WP(C) No. 6320/2013, impugned notice is dated 21.10.2013, issued by the Divisional Forest
Officer, Kamrup (East) Division addressed to the three petitioners for closure of their respective cement
units in the interest of Wildlife Conservation as those are situated within 10 km radius from Amchang
Wildlife Sanctuary, i.e., within the eco-sensitive zone, which attracts violation of the guidelines of the
Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.    Before proceeding further, it may be mentioned that in WP(C) No. 6179/2013, the initial petitioner
was Cement Manufacturing Company Limited. However, the name of the petitioner company was changed
                                                                                               Page No.# 8/15

from Cement Manufacturing Company Limited to Star Cement Limited. Accordingly, the name of the
petitioner has been changed following order dated 18.09.2018, passed in IA (C) No. 300/2018.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    Basic contention of the petitioners is that petitioners had established Cement Grinding Plants at
Chamatapathar by making huge investments. Petitioners obtained necessary clearances prior to
commencement of production. Petitioners were served with letters dated 12.09.2013 from the Secretary to
the Government of Assam, Environment and Forest Department, stating that it was reported that petitioners
were operating Cement Manufacturing Plants within a radius of 10 kms of Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary;
which was within the eco-sensitive zone of the said Wildlife Sanctuary. Thus, setting up of the
manufacturing units were in clear violation of the guidelines of the Supreme Court. The basis of the
aforesaid communication was a letter dated 22.08.2013, issued by the Additional Principal Chief
Conservator of Forests (C), Government of India, Regional Office at Shillong.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.    Petitioners in their reply denied that the cement plants were within 10 km radius of Amchang Wildlife
Sanctuary. To remove doubt and confusion, a joint survey was suggested. It was also contended that no eco-
sensitive zone was defined and notified in and around Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary. Therefore, there was no
restriction or prohibition on setting up or operation of industry within the 10 km radius.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.   Without considering the aforesaid response of the petitioners, impugned closure notices were issued.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.   In WP(C) No. 6179/2013, this Court vide order dated 22.10.2013, passed an interim order directing
the respondents not to take any step for closure of the industrial unit of the petitioner. On 30.10.2013, a
detailed order was passed whereby the case was admitted for hearing and the interim order passed on
22.10.2013 was directed to be continued. Relevant portion of the order dated 30.10.2013 is extracted
hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "This petition challenges communication dated 26.09.2013 of the Government of Assam in
        the Environment and Forest Department directing authorities of the Forest Department to take
        steps for closure of 3 cement units, including the unit of the petitioner, on the ground that those are
        situated within 10 Km radius of Amchang Wild Life Sanctuary.</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">                Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that environmental clearance was
        granted to establish the industrial unit of the petitioner by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
        Government of India on 02.01.2009, as it was found that the proposed site of the unit was located at
        a distance of 10.8 km from the Amchang Wild Life Sanctuary. It was also noted that the proposed
        cement plant is a small unit of B category having sufficient air pollution control measures and that
        it is environment friendly. After obtaining consent to establish and consent to operate the industrial
        unit from the Pollution Control Board of Assam with adequate and effective pollution control
                                                                                       Page No.# 9/15

measures in place, the industrial unit of the petitioner has commenced production w.e.f. 31.01.2013,
generating revenue and giving employment opportunity to a large number of people. Learned
senior counsel also submits that there is no direction from the Hon'ble Supreme Court for closure of
any industrial unit situated within a radius of 10 Km of any wildlife sanctuary. On the contrary, he
submits that the approach of the Central Empowered Committee is to regulate existing industrial
activities rather than closure or prohibition of such activities. He also submits that though Assam
Government has submitted proposal before the Central Government for declaring an area within
radius of 1 Km from Amchang Wild Life Sanctuary as Eco Sensitive Zone, no such declaration has
been notified till date. Further submission is that when the Secretary to the Government of Assam,
Environment and Forest had issued show cause notice to the petitioner on 29.08.2013, petitioner
submitted its detailed reply and was awaiting consideration of the same. In such circumstances,
issuance of the impugned closure notice is wholly illegal, arbitrary and unjustified, he submits.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        Both Mr. Bhagawati and Mr. Upadhyay, learned Central Government Counsel and Stat e
Government Counsel respectively seek time to obtain instruction.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        Mr. Goswami, learned counsel submits that he would file an intervention application on
behalf of Sri Akhil Gogoi. He submits that his client has filed application before the National Green
Tribunal seeking closure of the industrial unit of the petitioner. Notice has been issued on such
application. He has also placed before the Court a decision of the Apex Court dated 09.08.2012
passed in WP(C) No. 50/98 (Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan and Ors. Vs Union of
India an d Ors) to contend that since the National Green Tribunal is considering the matter, this
Court should not entertain the writ petition and the matter should be transmitted to the National
Green Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_15">        A perusal of the aforesaid decision particularly paragraph 38 thereof would show that
matters covered by Schedule-1 to the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_1">National Green Tribunal Act</a>, 2010 are required to be
adjudicated by the Green Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_16">        A perusal of Schedule-I indicates that 7 acts have been enlisted therein including
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_2">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        Whether the present proceeding wherein challenge has been made amongst others to the
impugned closure notice would come within the ambit of Schedule-I to the aforesaid Act would
require examination of the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        This petition raises issues of considerable public importance. On the one hand is the need to
protect the ecology and prevent further environmental degradation, while on the other hand there is

<p id="p_25">12.    Joint Director (S) in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, has filed
affidavit. Stand taken is that regional office had requested the State Government of Assam on 22.08.2013 to
close down the industrial units as those were within 10 km radius of Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary. As per
site visit, the distance of the plants were within 5.8 km (approximately) from Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary
and 8 km (approximately) from Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. It is contended that such request was made for
conservation and protection of wildlife, which was in conformity with Supreme Court guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_26">13.   Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, i.e., State of Assam in the Environment and Forest Department, have filed a
common affidavit supporting the closure notices; however stating that closure notices were issued in
pursuance of Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests' letter dated 22.08.2013. It is
stated that proposal for notifying eco-sensitive zone for Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary was already forwarded
to the Government of India, but eco-sensitive zone has not yet been notified. A reference has been made to
order dated 04.12.2006, passed in WP(C) No. 460/2004, where Supreme Court had directed that in case of a
project requiring environmental clearance is located within eco-sensitive zone around a Wildlife Sanctuary
or National Park or in the absence of any delineation of such a zone if it is within a distance of 10 kms from
the boundary, User Agency/Project Proponent is required to obtain recommendations of the Standing
Committee of National Board for Wildlife.
</p>
<p id="p_27">14.   Petitioner has filed rejoinder affidavit to both the affidavits. Referring to the order of the Supreme
Court, it is contended that there is no direction, interim or final, prohibiting mining activities within 10 kms
of the boundaries of National Parks or Wildlife Sanctuaries. In fact, by the order dated 04.12.2006, Supreme
                                                                                                  Page No.# 11/15

Court had only directed Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, to give a final
opportunity to the States/Union Territories to respond to the proposal to notify the areas within 10 kms of
the boundaries of National Parks or Wildlife Sanctuaries and also to refer to the Standing Committee of the
National Board for Wildlife in the cases in which industrial clearance has already been granted in respect of
activities within 10 kms radius zone from the boundaries of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks. It is
asserted that by the order dated 04.12.2006 Supreme Court had neither fixed any buffer zone within 10 kms
nor directed closure of industries. In this connection, reliance has been placed on judgment of the Supreme
Court dated 21.04.2014 in WP(C) No. 435 of 2012 (Goa Foundation -Vs- Union of India).
</p>
<p id="p_28">15.        Petitioner has also filed an additional affidavit placing on record notification dated 07.05.2017 of the
Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, notifying eco-sensitive zone
of Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary giving details of the boundaries.
</p>
<p id="p_29">16.    Impleaded respondent Nos. 10, 11 and 12 have filed affidavit. Basic contention of the impleaded
respondents is that industrial units of the petitioners are in close proximity of Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary.
It is stated that as per letter of Forest Department, Government of Assam, distance of M/s Star Cement from
Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary is 5750 metres; M/s Raksha Cement is 368 metres; and M/s A G Cement is
128 metres. It is contended that the industries of the petitioners are highly polluting ones exposing the local
villagers to health hazards.
</p>
<p id="p_30">17.    Dr Saraf and Mr Agarwal have vehemently argued that such closure notices are wholly illegal and are
liable to be set aside. There is no Supreme Court order either prohibiting or closing down industrial units
located within 10 kms from the boundaries of Wildlife Sanctuaries. Therefore, the very foundation of the
closure notices is untenable. Closure notices cannot now be justified on grounds not mentioned in the
notices. Reliance has been placed on notification dated 07.05.2017 of the Ministry of Environment, Forests
and Climate Change, Government of India, to contend that only new industries and expansion of existing
polluting industries in the eco-sensitive zone have been prohibited. Existing industries are not to be touched
or closed. Additionally, Mr Agarwal contends that there are a large number of cement plants and other
industries in the area in question but only the petitioners have been targeted. Therefore, closure notices are
illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_31">18.    Mr Mazumdar, learned Additional Advocate General has referred to the affidavit filed by respondent
Nos. 1 and 2 and submits that closure notices were issued on the basis of inputs received from the central
authorities.

Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests submits that such steps have been taken for protection of

<p id="p_33">18.2. Mr A C Borbora, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the impleaded respondents has referred to
various provisions of the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Air Pollution Act</a>, 1981 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986 to contend that
closure of the industrial units has become necessary to protect the environment and to preserve wildlife.
Impugned notices were preceded by ground level inspection which clearly established that the industrial
units of the petitioners have been set up in the vicinity of the wildlife sanctuary. He also expresses doubts
about environmental clearance obtained by the petitioners and whether all formalities have been complied
with. In the course of his submissions, Mr Borbora has placed reliance on various write ups to drive home
the point that conservation of biological diversity is a common concern of mankind and is an integral part of
the development process. He has also referred to an order of the Supreme Court dated 15.09.2017 in SLP
Nos. 2579-2580/2014, expressing concern over reduction of 10 kms eco sensitive zone to 100 metres.

mining activities in the State of Goa. In that judgment, Supreme Court examined whether it had by orders
passed on 04.08.2006 and 04.12.2006, prohibited mining activities around National Parks or Wildlife
Sanctuaries. Order dated 04.08.2006 was passed in the case of T N Godavarman Thirumulpad -Vs-

not prohibited any mining activity within 10 kms distance from the boundaries of National Parks or Wildlife
Sanctuaries. After extracting the relevant portion of the order dated 04.12.2006, it was clarified that
Supreme Court had not passed any order or direction, interim or final, prohibiting mining activities within
10 kms of the boundaries of National Parks or Wildlife Sanctuaries. Relevant portion of the clarificatory

that the order passed by this Court saying that there will be no mining activity within one kilometer

<p id="p_38">21.   Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India issued a notification
dated 07.05.2017 in exercise of the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_11">Sections 3</a> (1), (2) (v) and (xiv), and (3) of the
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_12">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986, read with Rule 5 (3) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986,
notifying an area of Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary as the Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary Eco-sensitive Zone.
The eco-sensitive zone is spread over an area of 109.99 square kilometers, with an extent varying from 170
metres to 8.1 km with zero eco-sensitive zone extent on the western side due to presence of cantonment
area. Regarding zonal master plan for the eco-sensitive zone, it has been clarified that such zonal master
plan shall not impose any restriction on the approved existing land use, infrastructure and activities unless
so specified in the notification and the zonal master plan shall factor in improvement of all infrastructure
and activities to be more efficient and eco-friendly. The notification further provides that on or after
publication of the notification in the official gazette no new polluting industries shall be allowed to be set
up within the eco-sensitive zone. Clause- 4 of the notification listed the activities to be prohibited or to be
regulated within the eco-sensitive zone. Serial No. 2 of the Table deals with setting up of industries
including new oil and gas exploration causing pollution. In respect of Serial No. 2, it is provided that no
new industries and expansion of existing polluting industries in the eco-sensitive zone shall be permitted.
The notification also provides for constitution of a monitoring committee headed by Deputy Commissioner,
Kamrup (Metro) for effective monitoring of the eco-sensitive zone.

</p><p id="p_40">22.   Therefore, from the above it is evident that there is no order of the Supreme Court prohibiting any
mining activity within 10 kms distance from the boundaries of National Parks or Wildlife Sanctuaries. That
apart, as per the notification dated 07.05.2017, Central Government has notified eco-sensitive zone in and
around Amchang Wildlife Santuary with the clarification that the approved existing land use, infrastructure
and activities shall not be interfered with. There is only prohibition in the establishment of new industries
and expansion of existing polluting industries in the eco-sensitive zone. Existing industries, i.e., those set up
before the notification dated 07.05.2017 has not been touched.
</p>
<p id="p_41">23.   This notification dated 07.05.2017 is not under challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_42">24.    It is nobody's case that petitioners have set up their industrial units after issuance of the above
notification or have undertaken expansion of their existing units. Rather, as discussed above, the
notification has only saved the existing industrial units, of course, to be monitored by the Monitoring
Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_43">25.   Viewed in the above context, impugned closure notices cannot be sustained in law. Grounds on which
the impleaded respondents have justified the closure notices are not the grounds on which the closure
notices have been issued. The grounds on which the closure notices have been issued are non-existent.
Therefore, impugned closure notices are set aside. Stay orders passed earlier are made absolute.
