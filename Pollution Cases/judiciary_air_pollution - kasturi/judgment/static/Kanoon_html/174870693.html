</p><p id="p_3">            1. This appeal is directed against the communication of

Respondent No. 1, the Ministry of Environment and Forests

(MoEF), Government of India dated 3rd May, 2012 and the

consequential order of consent given by the Andhra Pradesh

Pollution Control Board (APPCB),             respondent No. 3, dated 19th

December, 2012, to and in favour of the respondent No. 6 and for

further    direction   to    the   respondents           to   conduct     a    fresh

Environmental Impact Assessment in respect of the Thermal Power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       3</span>
 Project proposed by the Project proponent namely respondent No. 6

strictly in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment

Notification 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     2. The Appellants are the villagers of six villages in Muthukur

Mandal     namely     Pynapuram,        Nelatur,    Musunuruvaripalem,

Varakavipudi,      Mamidipudi   &amp;   Pidatapoluru     situated     close   to

Krishnapatnam port in Nellore District. The Government of Andhra

Pradesh in the year 1995 by a notification dated 2nd August, 1995

acquired 299 acres of land in survey number 117-179 in

Musunuruvaripalem, Pynapuram village for providing housing

colonies for the employees of Krishnapattnam Power Project. The

said Thermal Power Plant requires Environmental Clearance (EC)

from the MoEF as per the EIA notification 2006. As per the said

Notification dated 14th September, 2006, Thermal Power Plant falls

under category 'A' which includes apart from new projects, expansion

and modernisation of existing projects or change in product-mix and

requires   prior    Environmental       Clearance   (EC)   from    Central

Government in the Ministry of Environment and Forest. As per the

notification, it requires public hearing to be conducted at the location

of the project before EC is granted.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     3. The Government of Andhra Pradesh is stated to have

approved the proposal for establishment of 2 x 800 MW capacity

Thermal Power Plant in the above said place and thereafter the

respondent No. 6 has applied for EC from respondent No.1. It is said

that in accordance with the notification a public hearing was held on

6th January, 2007 by the District Collector and it is stated that in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    4</span>
 public hearing it was informed that respondent No. 6 was proposing

to set up 2 x 800 MW coal based thermal power station at Melatur

and Krishnapatnam in an area measuring 1270 acres. It is stated

that certain objections were raised by the public. The respondent No.

1 has granted EC for the project on 17th July, 2007. As per the said

clearance, it contemplates construction of an ash pond for disposal

of fly ash/bottom ash to be generated during the course of generating

Thermal Power and the said pond was proposed to be set up within

the Thermal Power Plant area. The APPCB in the order dated 1st

October, 2007 has issued consent for establishment to respondent

No. 6 in respect of the said project.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     4. Thereafter, respondent No. 1 is said to have considered the

request of respondent No. 6 to shift the ash pond to a different

location in survey No. 190 to 300 of Pynapuram village and granted

permission by the impugned order dated 3rd May, 2012. According

to the Appellant, the place of relocation of ash pond was originally

earmarked for construction of a housing colony to the employees of

the Power Plant and is situated in the midst of six thickly populated

villages and such clearance for relocation has been granted by

respondent No. 1 in spite of objections. It is stated by the Appellants

that after many representations made by villagers, APPCB in fact had

issued a notice to the respondent No. 6 not to undertake any change

in location of the ash pond without prior consent from the Board.

Subsequently, the APPCB, in the impugned order dated 19 th

December, 2012 has issued consent for change of location of ash

pond to the new site.
</p>
<p id="p_10"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5</span>
</p><p id="p_11">      5. It is challenging the said impugned orders of the respondents

No. 1 &amp; 3, the present appeal has been filed by the Appellants on the

grounds, that even as per the information of the respondent No. 6

dated 6th April, 2013, sought for by the villagers, the proposed new

location of ash pond is a classified "Tank Poromboke'', that the

permission for relocation has been granted not by considering the

objections raised by the public, that in spite of the notice given by

the respondent No. 3 APPCB, directing the respondent No. 6 not to

proceed with the shifting of the ash pond to the new site by the notice

dated 6th October, 2012, within nearly two months namely on 19th

December, 2012, the respondent No. 3 has passed order granting

permission which is illegal and arbitrary, that the clearance given by

respondent No. 1 is in violation of EIA Notification, 2006, that by the

impugned orders, the lands which are categorised as water body is

being illegally permitted to be used for ash pond resulting in

damaging the water body, that the proposal for relocation of ash pond

to a place other than the original location requires a fresh EC by

MoEF which is possible only after following the EIA Notification 2006

and conducting public hearing afresh for the relocation.         For a

change in location of the ash pond to a different area, there ought to

have been a fresh Environmental Impact Assessment and therefore,

the non following of the procedure is fatal to the impugned orders. It

is also the case of the Appellants that the coal based thermal project

in the coastal area is creating incriminating effect resulting in

ecological, human disaster and that the burning of about 4 lakhs

tonnes of coal everyday and spewing of 1.45 lakh tonnes per day of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   6</span>
 toxic fume in the environment will emit Sulphur, Zinc, Mercury and

other dangerous elements to the environment. It is also their case

that the agricultural activities, ecology, water bodies, sea and health

of people are endangered by the impugned order and that the act of

the Government in acquiring land for the respondent No. 6 which

are shown as "Tank Poromboke'' in the revenue registers and

permitting it to be used as relocated fly ash pond for the project is

against law and that the impugned order is against the Judgments

and pronouncement of various orders of the Courts and the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_12">     6. In the reply filed by the 1st respondent, MoEF, it is stated

that the EC was granted in accordance with the notification, that in

the public proceeding held on 6th January, 2007 conducted by the

APPCB, the public have overwhelmingly welcomed the power project,

that as far as the original of EC granted to respondent No. 6, the

project proponent is required to utilise 100 per cent of fly ash from

the day of commencing of the plant, that for the ash pond which is

for storage of bottom ash, the respondent 6 is required to develop a

3 tier green belt around the ash pond for arresting any fugitive

emissions, that the earlier proposed location of ash pond was nearer

to a water body and a creek which drained into the Buckingham

Canal and therefore it was felt undesirable which necessitated the

approval of the new location, that the Expert Appraisal Committee

examined the proposal for change of ash pond location in its meeting

held on 12th/13th September, 2011 and agreed for the proposal of

respondent No. 6 for relocation, that it was thereafter, based on the

Expert Appraisal Committee Report the respondent No. 1 has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   7</span>
 permitted relocation under the impugned order dated 3rd May, 2012,

which is well in accordance with the notification, and that the

respondent No. 1 has carried out the exercise of according approval

for change of location of ash pond after duly considering that the

change is nowhere prejudicial to the environment at large and hence

it is valid in law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      7. The respondent No. 3 APPCB in its reply while admitting that

the Thermal Power Project proposed by the respondent No. 6 is

covered under 'A' category of the notification, stated that the

notification itself makes it clear that fresh EC is required only in the

event of expansion or modernisation of the existing projects or

activities listed in the Schedule to the notification with additional

capacity beyond the limits specified and in the event of any change

in the product mix in the existing manufacturing unit and therefore,

according to respondent No. 3, the change in place of ash pond within

the total area already approved does not require a fresh EC and it

does not require any further public hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">      8. It is also the case of the respondent No. 3 APPCB that the ash

pond originally proposed was only an emergency ash pond and the

proposed relocation is also to be established within the plant site of

1270 acres and permission was granted subject to the conditions

that the ash pond water has to be recycled and should not be

discharged into the sea. It is further stated that even though the

representation of the villagers dated 10th September, 2012 has stated

that the proposed relocation of the ash pond is situated in the midst

of six villages, there was no objection raised by any one that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   8</span>
 proposed relocated place of ash pond was situated in a tank or water

body. The notice issued by the respondent No. 4 on behalf of the

APPCB dated 6th October, 2012 to respondent No. 6 directing not to

undertake the relocation work was only to the effect that the same

cannot be done without obtaining prior consent from the APPCB

under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution)

Act</a> 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_4">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> 1981 and therefore, the notice dated 6th October, 2012

is not a bar for subsequent issuance of consent to establish by the

respondent No. 3 which was done after referring to the order of the

respondent No.1 dated 3rd May, 2012 and taking note of the fact that

the relocation of the ash pond by the respondent No. 6 will avoid

contamination of fresh water tank adjacent to the site earlier

envisaged. It is also stated that respondent No. 4 has made a site

inspection of the proposed new place for establishment of the ash

pond in Pyampuram Village on 7th November, 2012 and the report

was placed for obtaining the consent to establish before Committee

in the meeting held on 23rd November, 2012 and after detailed

examination, the Committee recommended not only to extend the

period of consent to establish up to 13th January, 2015 but also for

the change of ash pond location subject to certain conditions. It is

also stated that against order of the respondent No. 3, appellate

authority is provided, and Appellate Authority's period has been

extended by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in the order dated

1st July, 2013 and thereafter the Appellant cannot straightaway

approach the Tribunal.    It is also stated that since the proposed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  9</span>
 relocated place of ash pond is situated within 1270 acres of land in

respect of which EC has been given after conducting public hearing

in 2007, there is no necessity for having another public hearing.


</p><p id="p_17">     9. On behalf of respondent No. 5 the District Collector, it is

stated that with regard to land for relocation by the project

proponent, even though the said lands were originally classified as

"Tank Poromboke'', it was reclassified later as "assessed waste" land

since there was no tank in existence. In the Affidavit dated 30th July,

2013 it is stated that the Revenue Board of the erstwhile combined

Madras Province has abandoned the tank as early as in the year

1924. The sanction of Revenue Board for abandoning the tank was

communicated from the District Collector, Nellore in the letter dated

17th August, 1924. While paying compensation for the acquired land

in the year 2006 many of the assignees were not paid compensation

based on the diglot alone which was having misleading information

without incorporating the above said record of 1924. It is stated that

after the mistakes were identified the payment of compensation was

ordered by the District Collector as per the order dated 31st August,

2010.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">     10. Respondent No. 6, project proponent in its reply has stated

that at the outset the appeal is barred by limitation. The order of the

respondent no. 1 dated 3rd May, 2012 and the consequential order

dated 19th December, 2012 are challenged after the limitation period

of 30 days and further condonable limit of 60 days. It is the further

case of the said respondent No. 6 that when the Government of

Andhra Pradesh has approved the proposal for establishing 2x800

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  10</span>
 MW capacity Thermal Power Plant in the name of Shri Damodaram

Sanjeevaiah Thermal Power Station at Nelatur Village in the year

2006 and subsequent land acquisition proceedings were completed,

a Special Purpose Vehicle in the name of the 6th respondent being a

subsidiary company was floated and thereafter an application was

made to the respondent No. 1 for the grant of EC. The respondent

No. 1 after conducting a public hearing on 6th January, 2007 and

circulating the Environmental Impact Assessment Report to the

public as well as to the appropriate authorities, by the order dated

17th July 2007 has granted EC for the project subject to conditions.

It is stated that based on the detailed project report, preliminary

specifications were prepared and tenders were awarded for the

project for which a total financial outlay was estimated at 10,450

crores and so far an expenditure of Rupees 7,900 crores has been

incurred and the plant is nearing completion as per the Schedule and

coal firing is to take place during September 2013 and energy

production from December 2013. During the course of execution of

the project more area was required for accommodating coal handling

system and therefore, the originally allotted ash pond could not be

continued and had to be shifted. As the movement of the ash pond

could not be done either on the Western or Eastern side since it would

be closer to the major water bodies at Nelatur Village Buckingham

Canal, it was decided that there is a need for developing a 3 tier green

belt area, and a decision was taken to relocate the ash pond on the

northern side of the main plant which was originally earmarked for

the proposed township area. On the basis that the shifting will avoid


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   11</span>
 proximity   to   major   water   bodies,   respondent   No.6   by   a

communication dated 30th May, 2011 has sought permission from

the respondent No. 1 as per clause 6 of the EC already granted for

relocation of the ash pond.       It was after the proper detailed

presentation made on 13th September, 2011, the request of the

respondent No. 6 was placed before the Expert Appraisal committee

of the respondent No. 1 in its meeting held on 13th September, 2011

and thereafter, by an order dated 3rd May, 2012 the respondent No.

1 has granted permission for relocation of the ash pond.


</p><p id="p_20">     11. Based on the complaint of the appellants, respondent No.4,

in the communication dated 6th October, 2012 has directed the

respondent No. 6 not to proceed with the relocation before obtaining

prior consent from respondent No. 3. Accordingly, the 6th respondent

applied to the respondent No.3 on 6th November, 2012 and the said

respondent after examining the proposal in detail, by order dated on

19th December, 2012 has granted consent. Therefore, according to

the respondent No. 6, everything was done strictly in accordance with

law and the work of construction of ash pond was started by levelling

the land and making excavation. In the meantime, on filing the above

appeal the Tribunal has granted an order of stay on 24th December,

2013. It is stated that almost the entire work has been completed.

The mandatory requirement of the notification has been fully

followed. The various grounds raised by the appellant have also been

denied. It is also denied that there is any "Tank Poromboke'' in the

proposed site where the ash pond is to be relocated. The ash pond

is envisaged by way of zero effluent discharge technology in 100 acres

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  12</span>
 and ash particles will be pumped into the ash pond area in a semi

solid state and the entire slush will settle in the pond and water

stagnate above the sediment is subsequently sent to a lagoon and

reused in the plant and no water will be discharged into the sea. It

is stated that the project involved in borrowing of money from a

German Company and another firm in New Delhi, involving payment

of huge interest and therefore, everyday of delay will cost to the

exchequer.    Accordingly, the respondent No. 6 has prayed for

dismissal of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">     12. It is the submission of Mr. K.S. Vishwanathan, learned

counsel appearing for the appellants that when the original Terms of

Reference by the project proponent has shown the place of ash pond

in 100 acres as an emergency ash pond, whenever any change of

place by way of relocation was proposed the same should have been

by a reference to EAC and after conducting a public hearing.

Otherwise, according to him a fresh clearance is required by following

procedures including the public hearing for relocation. Therefore,

according to him in the absence of such clearance, the order of the

MoEF in granting permission for relocation is prima facie bad and it

suffers from inherent illegality.    He would also contend that the

impugned order of the respondent No. 1 (MoEF) is liable to be struck

down on the ground of non application of mind. It is his submission

that based on the original EC dated 17th July, 2007, Rs.8000/- crores

have been spent and thereafter, the relocation of ash pond is

proposed with the purpose of drawing water from sea for which no

pipelines have been made ready. He has also submitted that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    13</span>
 project proponent has not divulged the complete details to enable the

MoEF to pass orders in a proper manner and the MoEF in its turn

has failed to find out the real truth in respect of relocation of ash

pond independent of divulgence of correct fact by the project

proponent. He also submitted that the permission granted by the

Pollution Control Board after the impugned order of the MoEF is also

mechanical and not by independent exercise of its power. It is his

submission that when the water body was going to be dealt with, the

Government should have been properly represented. On the other

hand, the collector and the RDO have only acted helping the project

proponent to obtain permission for relocation.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">     13. Per Contra, Mr. R. Theagarajan, Learned Senior Counsel

appearing for respondent No. 6, project proponent contended that as

per the EIA notification 2006, a fresh EC is required only in cases of

expansion and modernisation of the existing project. According to

him even in the original EC the place of ash pond has been stated as

an emergency ash pond and the relocation is only within the entire

campus demarcated for the industry and therefore, it would not

amount to an expansion or modernisation.           It is his further

submission that as stated by the RDO and the collector, the place

where the relocation of ash pond is to be made, is not a water body

and the same has been entered in the earlier records by mistake

which was subsequently rectified. Therefore, according to him, a

fresh EC is not required and consequently the impugned order of the

MoEF and the consequential order of the Pollution Control Board

(PCB) cannot be held to be bad in law.
</p>
<p id="p_25"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  14</span>
</p><p id="p_26">      14. The Learned Counsel appearing for the MoEF Mrs.

Sangamithirai would also reiterate her stand that the impugned

order has been passed by the MoEF in accordance with the EIA

Notification and in as much as the relocation of ash pond is within

the area allocated for the industry and the same has been considered

to be more ecologically viable by the MoEF, one cannot jump to a

conclusion that the impugned order is bad in law and passed with

non application of mind. That is also the contention of the Learned

Counsel appearing for the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board.


</p><p id="p_27">     15. We have heard the Learned Counsel appearing for the

appellant as well as the respondents elaborately and referred to

various documents and given our anxious thought to the issues

involved in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">     16. The main facts are not in dispute. The respondent No. 6 was

created as a Special Purpose Vehicle being a subsidiary company of

Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation Ltd. which has got

51 per cent of the share with the balance 49 per cent share with the

Government of Andhra Pradesh and the respondent No. 6, jointly.

On a proposal made by the respondent No. 6 for establishing a 2 x

800 MW capacity Thermal Power Plant at Krishnapatnam, Nellore,

Andhra Pradesh, the Government has approved the same to be found

in the name of Shri Damodaram Sanjeevaiah Thermal Power Station

(SDSTPS) at Nelatur Village, Muthukur Mandal, Nellore District,

Andhra Pradesh. An application was made by the project proponent,

the respondent No. 6 by way of a proposal to the respondent No. 1

in form 1 as per the EIA notification 2006. As per the proposal, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 15</span>
 requirement of lands for the project was 1250 acres which includes

land for coal conveyers and the estimated requirement of coal was

13,656 TPD. The water requirement for the project was estimated at

2, 96,400 ML per day which has to be drawn from sea. It has been

stated in Form 1 by the project proponent that there is no ecologically

sensitive area within 10 km from the project boundary and no forest

land is involved.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">     17. On the basis of the said proposal, a public hearing was held

in accordance with the EIA Notification 2006 of the MoEF,

Government of India, on 6th July, 2007 in the elementary school at

Nelatur conducted by the District Collector with the Environmental

Engineer Nellure as the convenor. Admittedly, public representatives

as well as the officers have participated in the public hearing and

thereafter the proposal was referred as per Para 12 of EIA notification

2006, to the Expert Appraisal Committee. It is based on the report

of the said Committee that the MoEF in the order dated 17th July,

2007 has granted EC to the project subject to various terms and

conditions. One of the conditions contemplated in the EC issue by

the MoEF reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     " Para xii. Fly ash shall be collected in Silos in dry form and

       bottom ash in hydro bins and its 100 per cent utilisation shall

       be ensured from the day of the Commission of the plant. In

       emergency, the unutilized fly ash/bottom ash shall be

       disposed off at the proposed ash disposal site through HCSD

       system. Borrow earth shall not be taken from ash pond area

       for construction of ash dyke etc."</blockquote><p id="p_33">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                  16</span>
</p><p id="p_34">      18. The said EC also contains a clause which contemplates a

fresh reference to the Ministry in cases of any deviation or alteration

in the project proposed. It is relevant to extract the said clause of the

EC for the better appreciation of the entire fact


          " 'Clause 6' In case of any deviation or alteration in the

          project proposed from those submitted to the Ministry

          for clearance, a fresh reference should be made to the

          Ministry to assess the adequacy of the conditions

          imposed and to incorporate additional environmental

          protection measures required, if any ".
</p>
<p id="p_35">
A close reading of the said clause makes it abundantly clear that in

cases of deviation or alteration in the project from the proposal

originally submitted, a duty is contemplated on the project proponent

to make a fresh reference to the Ministry. The Ministry assesses the

adequacy of the conditions already imposed and incorporate

additional environmental protection measures.         Therefore for the

purpose of the Ministry to have the benefit of a fresh reference one

has to satisfy that from the original project proposal, a deviation or

alteration is sought for. In the absence of the meaning of the word

"deviation" or "alteration", it is to be irresistibly concluded that what

is deviation or alteration of a project already proposed is subject to

the satisfaction of the Ministry. If the Ministry is satisfied, for which

it may always refer the proposal for deviation or alteration to the

Expert Appraisal Committee if it is of category 'A' project or to the

State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) if it is of category 'B'

project, and on such subjective satisfaction of the Ministry, it is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                   17</span>
 entitled to assess the adequacy of conditions already imposed or to

incorporate additional environmental protection measures required.

It is relevant to note that even in such event whether the Ministry

has to issue a fresh Environment Clearance or not is not clear both

in the original order of the Ministry given to the project proponent

dated 17th July, 2007 and for that matter even in the Environment

Clearance Regulations 2006 also.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">     19. However, in the Environment Clearance Regulations 2006,

para 2 which deals with the requirements of prior EC, while making

it clear that in respect of projects falling under category A in the

schedule, it is the Central Government in the Ministry of

Environment and Forest and in respect of matters falling under

category B, it is the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment

Authority (SEIAA), states that such authority shall confer prior EC in

respect of all new projects and activities listed in the schedule,

expansion and modernization of existing projects or activities listed

in the schedule or any change in product mix in an existing

manufacturing unit included in the schedule beyond the specified

range. We feel it appropriate to extract the said paragraph number

2 which would throw light on the issue involved in this case.


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          " 2) Requirements of prior Environmental Clearance

      (EC)- The following projects or activities shall require prior

      environmental clearance from the concerned regulatory

      authority, which shall hereinafter referred to        as the

      Central Government in the Ministry of Environment and

      Forests for matters falling under Category 'A' in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  18</span>
           Schedule    and     as   State    level   Environment   Impact

          Assessment Authority (SEIAA) for matters falling under

          Category 'B' in the said Schedule, before any construction

          work, or preparation of land by the project management

          except for securing the land, is started on the project or

          activity:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">
</blockquote><p id="p_38"> (i)      All new projects or activities listed in the Schedule to this

          notification;
</p>
<p id="p_39"> (ii)     Expansion and modernization of existing projects or

          activities listed in the Schedule to this notification with

          addition of capacity beyond the limits specified for the

          concerned sector, that is, projects or activities which cross

          the threshold limits given in the Schedule, after expansion

          or modernization;
</p>
<p id="p_40"> (iii)    Any change in product-mix in an existing manufacturing

          unit included in Schedule beyond the specified range."

</p><p id="p_41">                                                     (emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_42">         20. Therefore it is clear that deviation or alteration of the

proposal as contained in the EC given to the project proponent in this

case is different from expansion and modernization of existing

projects      etc.,   contemplated     in    the    Environment   Clearance

Regulations 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">         21. On the other hand to be more clear, if a project is proposed

to be deviated or altered by the project proponent which mean that

without expansion and modernization but within the devices and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       19</span>
 mechanisms contemplated in the original proposal, such deviation or

alteration does not require a fresh prior Environmental Clearance

and it has to be only made as a reference to the Ministry to assess

the adequacy of condition already imposed and also to decide

whether new environmental protection measure ought to be

incorporated as additional conditions. Consequently, such proposals

or deviation or alteration which does not require fresh EC need not

undergo the fresh process of grant of EC including the public hearing.

On the other hand, as contemplated in paragraph 2 elicited above, if

in respect of an existing project, a proposal for expansion and

modernization with additional capacity which crosses the threshold

limits given in the schedule after the expansion or modernisation, is

deemed to be a fresh proposal which requires fresh consideration and

issuance of fresh prior EC in which event necessarily it has to

undergo the entire process including the public hearing.


</p><p id="p_45">     22. Now having analysed the contents of the Environmental

Clearance given to the project proponent by the Ministry dated 17th

July, 2007 in relation to the conditions regarding deviation and

alteration and also the provisions of Environmental Clearance

regulations   2006    particularly     related   to   expansion   and

modernization of project, we have to consider the facts of the present

case in the above background. Since we are concerned in this case

about the shifting and relocation of the ash pond, it is not necessary

to go into the various aspects related to the land acquisition etc,

suffice to state that the entire project for which original EC was

granted by the Ministry, was contained in the area of 1250 acres. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                  20</span>
 project proponent, in the communication dated 31st May, 2011 and

addressed to the Ministry of Environment and Forests Government

of India has stated that as per the original EC the ash pond situated

in 120 acres and was located close to an existing fresh water body

and saline water creek which joins Buckingham Canal and during

the detailed engineering study it was found that to relocate the ash

pond area away from the main project will be environmentally

advantageous and therefore, requested permission from the Ministry

to shift the ash pond to a place which is admittedly within the total

extent of 1250 acres originally demarcated for the project township,

in order to avoid proximity to existing fresh water body and water

creek which joins Buckingham Canal. The said letter of the project

proponent also points out that the said request was made as per

clause 6 of the original Environmental Clearance dated on 17th July,

2007 elicited above. Along with the said letter, the project proponent

has also enclosed some basic information more particularly about

the ash pond to be relocated apart from other particulars in the

communication dated 30th August, 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_46">
</p><p id="p_47">     23. As it is seen in the impugned order of the Ministry of

Environment and Forest, Government of India dated 3rd May, 2012,

the said request made by the project proponent was considered by

the Expert Appraisal committee (Thermal Power) in its meeting held

on 12th and 13th September, 2011 and made its recommendation and

accordingly the Government has permitted the change of ash pond

location to the new site at co-ordinates 14º 21 ' 06" North to 14º 21'


29 " North Longitudes and 80º 06 ' 58" to 80º 07 ' 45" East Latitude.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                  21</span>
 In fact, in the said order dated 3rd May, 2012 the Ministry has

imposed further conditions which are as follows :


</p><p id="p_48">     " xxv) The project proponent shall upload the status of

compliance of the      conditions stipulated in the environmental

clearance issued vide this Ministry's letter of even no. dated 17th July,

2007 in its website and updated periodically and also simultaneously

send the same by e-mail to the Regional Office of the Ministry of

Environment and Forests.
</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">     xxvi) Criteria pollutants levels including NOX, RSPM (PM10 &amp;

PM2.5), SOX (from stack &amp; ambient air) shall be regularly monitored

and results displayed in your website and also at the main gate of

the power plant.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">     xxvii) A three tier thick green belts on either side of the Colony

and Ash Pond shall be developed to prevent fugitive emissions and

status of implementation shall be reported to the Regional Office of

the Ministry regularly."
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">     24. Therefore, it is clear that the impugned order of respondent

No. 1 is in terms of the original EC granted dated 17 th July, 2007

particularly para 6 as stated above by sending a new proposal for

relocation of the ash pond within the original area of the entire

project, which cannot be treated as a proposal for modernisation or

expansion with any additional capacity beyond the limits granted in

the schedule or any change in the product mix in the existing

manufacturing unit which alone requires a fresh prior EC. Therefore,

we are of the view that the relocation of the ash pond on the facts


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                   22</span>
 and the circumstances of the present case cannot be treated as

expansion or modernisation beyond the original capacity and

therefore, it does not require a fresh Environmental Clearance from

the Ministry. Consequently, there is no obligation on the part of the

Ministry to direct a fresh public hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">     25. Consequent to this conclusion, the next question which

follows is as to whether there was any malafide on the part of the

respondent No. 6 or non consideration of the issue by the respondent

No. 1 in its proper perspective and independently.        The reason

mentioned for the proposed relocation of ash pond is to protect a

fresh water body and creek which joins the sea. As it is seen in the

impugned order the recommendation of the Expert Appraisal

committee (Thermal Power) in respect of the proposal for relocation

of pond has been considered by the Ministry while granting such

permission. Not only that, the Government as a matter of abundant

caution has directed for the development of a 3 tier thick green belt

on either side of the colony and ash pond to prevent fugitive

emissions and also directed the status of implementation to be

informed to the Ministry. We see no malafide either on the part of

respondent No. 6 or the respondent No. 1 in this regard and one can

never say that the impugned order of respondent No. 1 is either

devoid of merit or passed with non application of mind. There is no

question of assessing technical reason in a participatory manner at

the stage of consideration of alteration since it is not in the form of

expansion or modernisation beyond the capacity as per the

Environmental Clearance Notification 2006. The contention of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                  23</span>
 Learned    Counsel    appearing    for   the   appellants    that   the

Environmental Appraisal Committee during the time when it

considered the proposal for relocation of ash pond should have set

up issue based manifesto is certainly not applicable at that stage.


</p><p id="p_57">26. There is one other issue that is raised on behalf of the appellants

namely that the APPCB having issued a show cause notice on 6th

October, 2012 to the project proponent has abruptly changed its

stand in the impugned order dated 19th December, 2012. The said

contention in our view is totally baseless. On a reference to the notice

issued by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) dated

6th October, 2012 which is after the permission granted by the MoEF

dated 3rd May, 2012, it is seen that what is stated by the APPCB in

the said notice is that the project proponent should not undertake

any change in location of ash pond without obtaining prior consent

from the APPCB as per the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of

Pollution) Act</a> 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>

1981. It was after the communication dated 6th November, 2012

made by the APPCB, the project proponent has stated that the

consent issued by the Board originally for 5 years has expired on 30th

September, 2012 and pointing out the order of the Ministry dated 3rd

May, 2012 requested the Board to extent the validity of the consent

to establish till 31st March, 2015 explaining various progress of works

taken up by the project proponent.         Thereafter, the Executive

Engineer of the Pollution Control Board has filed a detailed report.

Considering the detailed report of the Executive Engineer dated 17th

October, 2012 and the inspection report of the regional officer dated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                   24</span>
 12th November, 2012 which were considered by the CFE Committee

in the meeting held on 23rd November, 2012 and recommended not

only the extension of the consent to establish up to 31st March, 2015

but also for relocation of the ash pond, based on which the impugned

order came to be passed. In fact, the impugned order of the Pollution

Control Board reiterates the conditions imposed by the MoEF,

Government of India for the purpose of developing a 3 tier thick green

belt to prevent fugitive emissions. In such view of the matter we hold

that there is certainly no change in the attitude of the APPCB and

there is no reason to come to the conclusion that the impugned order

of the APPCB is malafide or one passed with non - application of

mind.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">     27. There is one other point which has been raised in the

grounds of appeal by the appellants namely that the place where the

ash pond is permitted to be relocated has been shown as a "reservoir"

and "Tank Poromboke" in the revenue records and therefore,

permission granted to shift the ash pond of the project proponent in

a water body is illegal and will affect the ecological conditions. In

fact, the Learned Counsel appearing for the appellants has relied

upon a decision of this Tribunal dated 20th September, 2011. That

was a case where in respect of Koradi Thermal Power Project in

Nagpur District of Maharashtra there was an allegation of

misrepresentation of the distance between the Thermal Power Plant

Project from Nagpur City as 11 kilometers which is stated to be wrong

and it was in those circumstances considering the impact on the

public health this Bench has made certain directions to the MoEF to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                  25</span>
 take note of the issue as to whether the nuclear radiations from the

Thermal Power Projects can cause any cumulative affect.


</p><p id="p_60">     28. In the affidavit filed by the Thasildar of Muthukur Mandal,

Nellore District, on behalf of the respondent No. 5 dated 8th July,

2013, it was stated that an extent of 190.62 acres of patta land and

108.78 acres of Government land were handed over to the project

authorities. It was also stated in the said affidavit that earlier even

in the said extents of land wherever it is classified as Tank/Tank

Poromboke/Channel Poromboke, they were reclassified as Assessed

Waste and assigned to the eligible persons as there was no tank in

existence. However, when a document from the revenue department

in the form of adangal, dated 18th July, 2013 was shown where the

said survey number 213/1 was stated to be a "pond poromboke",

issued by another Thasildar of Muthukur Mandal, it was explained

in the affidavit filed by the Revenue Divisional Officer, Nellore dated

30th July,2013 that a part of the area earmarked for relocation of ash

pond included in survey number 213/1 etc are shown as

Pynampuram Small Tank (Pynampuram Chinna Cheruva) as shown

in the survey map. It is explained that in the original diglot

maintained in the year 1908 compiled by the then British

Government based on which the above said map was prepared, it was

mentioned as small tank. But thereafter, by a process of law, the

Revenue Board of the erstwhile Combined Madras Province in the

year 1924 has abandoned the tank as communicated by the District

Collector of Nellore dated 17th August, 1924. It is also stated in the

said affidavit that when the land was acquired in the year 2006 and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                  26</span>
 question of payment of compensation was considered, many of the

assignees including those lands which were abandoned in 1924

stated above were not granted compensation by referring to the above

said diglot alone. It was in those circumstances the then Revenue

Divisional Officer has filed an affidavit in Andhra Pradesh High Court

in a Writ Petition stating that they were Government lands but

cultivated by individuals. However, after the public agitation, the

matter was in detailed examined by the District Collector including

the 1924 records mentioned above and thereafter by an order dated

31st August, 2010 the District Collector has ordered payment of

compensation to the occupants of the said survey numbers and

therefore it ceased to be a water body. In such factual circumstance

explained in clear terms, we are unable to accept the contention

raised on behalf of the appellants that the new place of relocation of

ash pond is remaining a water body. The reference made by the

Learned Counsel for the applicants to the judgment of the Andhra

Pradesh High Court in K. Venket Reddy Vs. Government of Andhra

Pradesh and Ors., reported in 2006 (1 ALD 29) has no application to

the facts of the present case especially when due process was

followed as early as in the year 1924 when the tank was abandoned.


</p><p id="p_61">     29. The further reliance placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, rendered in Hinch Lal Tiwari Vs. Kamla Devi and

Ors, reported in 2001(6) SCC 496) is also not applicable to the facts

of the present case. That was a case where admittedly there was a

consistent finding by the authorities below that the place concerned

was a pond. However, the High Court has differed and it was in those

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                  27</span>
 circumstances the Hon'ble Apex Court has made some significant

observations regarding the material resources of the community. It

is relevant to extract the following paragraphs of the judgment for a

better appreciation of the issue involved therein which is as follows

:-
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">     "12) On this finding in our view, the High Court ought to have

confirmed the order of the Commissioner. However, it proceeded to

hold that considering the said report the area of 10 biswas could only

be allotted and the remaining five Biswas of land which have still the

character of a pond, could not be allotted. In our view, it is difficult

to sustain the impugned order of the High Court. There is concurrent

finding that a pond exists and the area covered by it varies in the

rainy season. In such a case no part of it could have been allotted to

anybody for construction of house building or any allied purposes.


</p><p id="p_64">     13) It is important to notice that the material resources of the

community like forests, tanks, ponds, hillock, mountain etc. are

nature's bounty. They maintain delicate ecological balance. They

need to be protected for a proper and healthy environment which

enables people to enjoy a quality life which is the essence of the

guaranteed right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_8">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.              The

Government, including the Revenue Authorities i.e. Respondents 11

to 13, having noticed that a pond is falling in disuse, should have

bestowed their attention to develop the same which would, on one

hand, have prevented ecological disaster and on the other provided

better environment for the benefit of the public at large. Such vigil is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                   28</span>
 the best protection against knavish attempts to seek allotment in

non- abadi sites."
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">     30. The said judgment was given on the admitted facts of the

said case which in our respectful view is not applicable to the facts

of the present case on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">     31. Therefore, looking at any angle we are unable to come to a

conclusion that the impugned orders of the respondent No. 1 and 3

suffer from any illegality. Accordingly, we confirm both the impugned

orders as valid in law and the appeal stands dismissed. No order as

to the cost.
