JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">		      J U D G M E N T
B.P.JEEVAN REDDY,J.
</p><p id="p_2">     WRIT PETITION (C) NO.967 OF 1989:
</p><p id="p_3">     This  writ	  petition  filed   by	an  environmentalist
organization brings  to light  the woes	 of people living in
the vicinity  of chemical  industrial plants  in  India.  It
highlights the	disregard, nay,	 contempt for law and lawful
authorities on	the part of some among the emerging breed of
entrepreneurs,	taking	 advantage,  as	  they	do,  of	 the
country's need	for industrialization  and export  earnings.
Pursuit of profit has absolutely drained them of any feeling
for fellow  human beings  - for	 that matter,  for  anything
else. And  the law  seems to  have been	 helpless.  Systemic
defects? It  is such instances which have led many people in
this country  to believe that disregard of law pays and that
the consequences  of such  disregard will  never be  visited
upon them - particularly, if they are men with means. Strong
words indeed - but nothing less would reflect the deep sense
of hurt,  the hearing  of this case has instilled in us. The
facts of the case will bear out these opening remarks.
</p><p id="p_4">     Bichhri is	 a small  village  in  Udaipur	district  of
Rajasthan. To its north is a major industrial establishment,
Hindustan Zinc	Limited, a  public sector  concern. That did
not affect Bichri. Its woes began somewhere in 1987 when the
fourth respondent  herein, Hindustan  Agro Chemicals Limited
started producing  certain chemicals  like Oleum [said to be
the concentrated  form of  Sulphuric acid]  and Single Super
Phosphate. The real calamity occurred when a sister concern,
Silver Chemicals  [Respondent No.5], commenced production of
`H' acid  in a	plant located  within the  same complex. `H'
acid was meant for export exclusively. Its manufacture gives
rise to	 enormous quantities  of highly toxic effluents - in
particular, iron-based	and gypsum-based  sludge -  which if
not properly  treated, pose grave threat to mother Earth. It
poisons the  earth, the	 water and  everything that comes in
contact	 with  it.  Jyoti  Chemicals  [Respondent  No.8]  is
another unit  established to  produce `H' acid, besides some
other chemicals. Respondents Nos.6 and 7 were established to
produce fertilizers and a few other products.
</p><p id="p_5">     All the  units/factories of  Respondents Nos.4 to 8 are
situated in  the same complex and are controlled by the same
group of  individuals. All  the units are what may be called
"chemical industries".	The complex  is located	 within	 the
limits of Bichhri village.
</p><p id="p_6">     Because of	 the pernicious	 wastes	 emerging  from	 the
production of  `H' acid,  its manufacture  is stated to have
been banned  in the  western countries.	 But the need of `H'
acid continues	in the	West. That need is catered to by the
industries like	 the Silver Chemicals and Jyoti Chemicals in
this part  of the  world. [A  few other unites producing `H'
acid have  been established  in Gujarat, as would be evident
from the  decision of  the Gujarat  High Court in <a href="/doc/783573/" id="a_1">Pravinbhai
Jashbhai &amp;  Ors. v.  State  of	Gujarat	 &amp;  Anr</a>.  (1995	 (2)
G.L.R.1210), a decision rendered by one of us, B.N.Kirpal,J.
as the	Chief Justice  of that	Court.] Silver	Chemicals is
stated to  have produced 375 MT of `H' acid. The quantity of
`H' acid  produced by  Jyoti Chemicals is not known. It says
that it	 produced only	20mt., as  trial production,  and no
more. Whatever	quantity these	two units may have produced,
it has	given birth  to about  2400-2500 MT  of highly toxic
sludge [iron-based  sludge and	gypsum-based sludge] besides
other pollutants.  Since the  toxic untreated  waste  waters
were allowed  to flow  out freely  and because the untreated
toxic sludge  was thrown  in the  open	in  and	 around	 the
complex, the  toxic substances have percolated deep into the
bowels	of   the  earth	  polluting  the  aquifers  and	 the
subterranean supply of water. The water in the wells and the
streams has  turned dark  and dirty  rendering it  unfit for
human consumption.  It has  become unfit for cattle to drink
and for	 irrigating the	 land. The  soil has become polluted
rendering it  unfit for	 cultivation, the  main stay  of the
villagers. The	resulting misery  to the  villagers needs no
emphasis. It  spread disease,  death  and  disaster  in	 the
village and  the surrounding  areas. This sudden degradation
of earth and water had an echo in Parliament too. An Hon'ble
Minister  said,	  action  was	being  taken,	but  nothing
meaningful was	done on the spot. The villagers then rose in
virtual revolt	leading to  the imposition  of	<a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_2">Section	 144</a>
Cr.P.C. by  the District  Magistrate in	 the  area  and	 the
closure of  Silver Chemicals in January, 1989. It is averred
by the respondents that both the units, Silver Chemicals and
Jyoti Chemicals	 have stopped  manufacturing `H'  acid since
January, 1989 and are closed. We may assume it to be so. Yet
the consequences  of their  action remain  - the sludge, the
long-lasting damage to earth, to underground water, to human
beings, to  cattle and the village economy. It is with these
consequences that  we are  to  contend	with  in  this	writ
petition.
</p><p id="p_7">     The present  social action	 litigation was initiated in
August, 1989  complaining precisely  of the  above situation
and requesting	for appropriate remedial action. To the writ
petition, the  petitioner enclosed  a number  of photographs
illustrating the  enormous damage  done	 to  water,  cattle,
plants and  to	the  area  in  general.	 A  good  amount  of
technical  data	  and  other   material	 was  also  produced
supporting the averments in the writ petition.
COUNTER-AFFIDAVITS OF THE RESPONDENTS
     On notice	being given,  counter-affidavits  have	been
filed by  the Government  of India, Government of Rajasthan,
Rajasthan Pollution Control Board [R.P.C.B.] and Respondents
Nos.4 to 8. Since the earliest counter-affidavit in point of
time is	 that of R.P.C.B., we shall refer to it in the first
instance. It  was filed	 on October  26, 1989. The following
are the averments:
</p><p id="p_8">(a)  Re. Hindustan  Agro Chemicals  Limited [R-4]:  The unit
obtained 'No-Objection	Certificate'  from  the	 P.C.B.	 for
manufacturing sulphuric acid and alumina sulphate. The Board
granted clearance  subject to certain conditions. Later 'No-
Objection  Certificate'	  was  granted	 under	 the   Water
[Prevention and	 Control of Pollution] Act, 1974 [<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>]
and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 [<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_5">Air
Act</a>], again  subject to	 certain conditions.  However,	this
unit changed  its product  without clearance from the Board.
Instead of  sulphuric acid,  it started	 manufacturing Oleum
and Single  Super Phosphate  [S.S.P.]. Accordingly,  consent
was refused  to the  unit on  February 16,  1987. Directions
were also  issued to  close down  the unit.  (b)  Re.:Silver
Chemicals [R-5]:  This	unit  was  promoted  by	 the  fourth
respondent without obtaining 'No-Objection Certificate' from
the Board  for the  manufacture of `H' acid. The waste water
generated from	the manufacture of `H' acid is highly acidic
and contains  very high	 concentration of  dissolved  solids
along with  several  dangerous	pollutants.  This  unit	 was
commissioned in	 February, 1988	 without obtaining the prior
consent of  the Board and accordingly, notice of closure was
served on  April 30, 1988. On May 12, 1988, the unit applied
for consent  under Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>s which was refused. The
Government was requested to issue directions for cutting off
the electricity	 and water  to this  unit but  no action was
taken by  the Government.  The unit  was found closed on the
date of inspection, viz., October 2, 1989.
</p><p id="p_9">(c)  Re.:Rajasthan Multi  Fertilizers [R-6]:  This unit	 was
installed without obtaining prior 'No-Objection Certificate'
from the  Board and  without even applying for consent under
Water and  <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>s.  Notice was  served  on  this  unit  on
February 20,  1989. In reply whereto, the Board was informed
that the  unit was  closed since  last three  years and that
electricity has also been cut off since February 12, 1988.
</p><p id="p_10">(d)  Re.:Phosphates  India   [R-7]:  This   unit  was	also
established   without	 obtaining    prior    'No-Objection
Certificate' from  the Board  nor did  it apply	 for consent
under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a>s. When notice dated February 20,
1989 was  served upon this unit, the Management replied that
this unit was closed for a long time.
</p><p id="p_11">(e)  Re.:Jyoti Chemicals  [R-8]: This  unit applied for 'No-
Objection  Certificate'	 for  producing	 ferric	 alum.	'No-
Objection   Certificate'   was	 issued	  imposing   various
conditions on  April 8, 1988. The 'No-Objection Certificate'
was withdrawn  on May  30, 1988 on account of non-compliance
with its conditions. The consent applied for under Water and
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>s  by this  unit was  also refused.  Subsequently, on
February 9,  1989, the	unit applied  for fresh	 consent for
manufacturing `H'  acid. The  consent was refused on May 30,
1989. The  Board has  been keeping  an eye upon this unit to
ensure that  it does  not start the manufacture of `H' acid.
On October  2, 1989,  when the	unit was  inspected, it	 was
found closed.
</p><p id="p_12">     The Board	submitted further [in its counter-affidavit]
that the  sludge lying	in  the	 open  in  the	premises  of
Respondents Nos.4 to 8 ought to be disposed of in accordance
with  the  provisions  contained  in  the  Hazardous  Wastes
(Management  and   Handling)  Rules,   1989   framed   under
<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Environment (Protection)  Act</a>, 1986. According to the Board,
the responsibility for creating the said hazardous situation
was squarely  that of  Respondents Nos.4  to  8.  The  Board
enclosed several  documents to its counter in support of the
averments contained therein.
</p><p id="p_13">     The Government of Rajasthan filed its counter-affidavit
on January  20, 1990.  It made a curious statement in Para 3
to the following effect: "(T)hat the State Government is now
aware of the pollution of under-ground water being caused by
liquid effluents  from the firms arrayed as Respondent Nos.4
to 8  in the  writ petition. Therefore, the State Government
has initiated  action  through	the  Pollution."  The  State
Government stated  that the water in certain wells in Bichri
village and some other surrounding villages has become unfit
for drinking  by human	beings and  cattle, though  in	some
other wells, the water remains unaffected.
</p><p id="p_14">     The Ministry  of Environment and Forests, Government of
India filed  its counter  on  February	8,  1990.  In  their
counter,  the	Government  of	 India	stated	that  Silver
Chemicals was merely granted a Letter of Intent but it never
applied	 for   conversion  of  the  Letter  of	Intent	into
industrial licence.  Commencing production  before obtaining
industrial  licence   is   an	offence	  under	  Industries
[Development and  Regulation] Act,  1951. So  far  as  Jyoti
Chemicals is  concerned,  it  is  stated  that	it  has	 not
approached the	Government at  any time	 even that  in June,
1989, a	 study of  the situation  in Bichri village and some
other surrounding  villages was	 conducted by the Centre for
Science and  Environment. A copy of their Report is enclosed
to the counter. The Report states the consequences emanating
from the  production of `H' acid and the manner in which the
resulting wastes  were dealt  with by Respondents Nos.4 to 8
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "The effluents  are very  difficult
     to treat  as many of the pollutants
     present are  refractory in	 nature.
     Setting up	 such  highly  polluting
     industry in a critical ground water
     area was essentially ill-conceived.
     The  effluents  seriously	polluted
     the  nearby  drain	 and  overflowed
     into Udaisagar main canal, severely
     corroding its cement-concrete lined
     bed and  banks. The polluted waters
     also   seriously	 degraded   some
     agricultural   land   and	 damaged
     standing crops. On being ordered to
     contain the effluents, the industry
     installed an  unlined holding  pond
     within its premises and resorted to
     spraying the effluent on the nearby
     hill-slope. This  only resulted  in
     extensive seepage	and  percolation
     of the  effluents into ground water
     and their	spread down the aquifer.
     Currently about  60 wells appear to
     have  been	 significantly	polluted
     but every	week a	few  new  wells,
     down  the	 aquifer  start	 showing
     signs  of	 pollution.   This   has
     created serious  problems for water
     supply   for   domestic   purposes,
     cattle-watering crop irrigation and
     other beneficial  uses, and  it has
     also caused  human illness and even
     death,  degradation   of  land  and
     damage to	fruit, trees  and  other
     vegetation.   There   are	 serious
     apprehensions  that  the  pollution
     and its harmful effects will spread
     further  after  the  onset	 of  the
     monsoon as	 the  water  percolating
     from the  higher parts of the basin
     moves down	 carrying the pollutants
     lying  on	 the  slopes  -	 in  the
     holding  pond   and  those	 already
     underground."</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">     Each of  the  Respondent  Nos.4  to  8  filed  separate
counter-affidavits. All	 the affidavits	 filed on  behalf of
these respondents  are sworn-to	 by Lt.Gen.  M.L.Yadava, who
described himself  as the  President of each of these units.
In the	counter-affidavit filed	 on  behalf  of	 the  fourth
respondent, it	is stated  that it  is in no way responsible
for the	 situation complained  of.  It	is  engaged  in	 the
manufacture  of	  sulphuric  acid   and	 had  commenced	 its
operations on  January 6,  1987. It  has been  granted	'No-
Objection Certificates'	 from  time  to	 time.	The  consent
obtained from  R.P.C.B.	 is  valid  upto  August  15,  1988.
Application for extension of consent has already been filed.
This counter-affidavit was filed on January 18, 1990.
</p><p id="p_16">     In the  counter-affidavit filed  on behalf of the fifth
respondent  [Silver   Chemicals],  it  is  stated  that	 the
manufacture of	`H' acid  which was  commenced in  February,
1988 has  been completely  stopped after  January, 1989. The
respondent is  fully conscious	of the	need to conserve and
protect environment  and is  prepared fully  to cooperate in
that behalf.  It is ready to comply with any stipulations or
directions that	 may be	 made for  the purpose. It, however,
submitted that	the real  culprit is Hindustan Zinc Limited.
The Archaeological Department of the Government of Rajasthan
had issued  environmental clearance  for  its  unit  [rather
surprising statement].	'No-Objection Certificates' had also
been issued  by the Executive Engineer [Irrigation], Udaipur
Division and the Wild Life Warden. So far as the requirement
of 'consent'  under Water  and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air  Act</a>s  is  concerned,  it
merely stated  that it	had applied  for it.  Its closure in
January, 1989  was on  account of  promulgation of  an order
under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_12">Section 144</a> Cr.P.C. by the District Magistrate in view
of  wide-spread	 agitation  by	the  villagers	against	 its
functioning.
</p><p id="p_17">     In the  counter-affidavit filed  on behalf of the sixth
respondent [Rajasthan  Multi Fertilizers], it is stated that
it commenced production on March 14, 1982 and closed down in
December, 1985. Electrical connection to it was disconnected
on February  13, 1988.	It was	submitted that since it is a
small-scale industry,  no consent was asked for from anyone.
It denied  that it was causing any pollution, either ground,
air or water.
</p><p id="p_18">     In the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the seventh
respondent [Phosphates	India], it  is stated that this unit
commenced production  on May  15, 1988 but was closed on and
with effect  from September 1, 1988 for want of support from
the  Central   Government  in  the  form  of  subsidies.  It
submitted that	it has	merged with the fourth respondent in
1987-88.
</p><p id="p_19">     In the  counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the eighth
respondent [Jyoti  Chemicals], it  is stated  that it has no
electrical connection,	that it	 had commenced production in
April 1987  and closed	down completely in January, 1989. It
is stated that the unit produced `H' acid to an extent of 20
MT as  a trial	measure for one month with the permission of
the Industries Department. It is no longer manufacturing `H'
acid and,  therefore, is  not responsible  for	causing	 any
pollution. It  is further submitted that it is a small-scale
industry and  was  registered  with  the  District  Industry
Centre, Udaipur	 for the  manufacture of ferric alum and `H'
acid. It  began its  operation simultaneously with the fifth
respondent, Silver  Chemicals, and several of the clearances
are common  to both,  as both  of them are located together.
The trial  production of  `H' acid, it is stated, took place
in January, 1987.
</p><p id="p_20">     Hindustan Zinc  Limited  was  impleaded  as  the  ninth
respondent at the instance of Respondents Nos.4 to 8. It has
filed a	 counter-affidavit denying that it is responsible in
any manner  for causing	 any pollution	in Bichri village or
the surrounding	 areas. According  to  it,  its	 plants	 are
situated downstream,  towards north of Bichri village. We do
not think  it necessary	 to refer  to this  affidavit in any
detail inasmuch	 as we	are  not  concerned,  in  this	writ
petition, with	the pollution,	if any,	 caused by the ninth
respondent in  other villages  but only	 with the  pollution
caused by  Respondents Nos.4  to 8 in Bichhri or surrounding
villages.
</p><p id="p_21">ORDERS PASSED AND STEPS TAKEN DURING THE PERIOD 1989-1992:
</p><p id="p_22">     The first	considered Order  made,	 after	hearing	 the
parties, by  this Court	 is of December 11, 1989. Under this
Order,	the   Court  requested	the  National  Environmental
Engineering  Research	Institute  [NEERI]   to	 study	 the
situation in  and around  Bichri village  and  submit  their
report "as to the choice and scale of the available remedial
alternatives". NEERI  was requested  to suggest	 both short-
term and  long-term measures  required to  combat the hazard
already caused.	 Directions were  also made  for  supply  of
drinking  water	  to  affected	villages  by  the  State  of
Rajasthan. The	R.P.C.B. was  directed to  make available to
the  Court   the  Report  it  had  prepared  concerning	 the
situation in Bichhri village.
</p><p id="p_23">     On the  next date	of hearing, i.e., March 5, 1990, the
Court  took  note  of  the  statements	made  on  behalf  of
Respondents Nos.4 to 8 that they have completely stopped the
manufacture of	`H' acid  in their  plants and that they did
not propose  to resume	its manufacture. The Court also took
note  of   the	petitioner's   statement  that	 though	 the
manufacture of	`H' acid  may have  been  stopped,  a  large
quantity  of  highly  dangerous	 effluent  waste/sludge	 has
accumulated in	the area  and that  unless properly treated,
stored and  removed, it	 constitutes a serious danger to the
environment.  Directions  were	given  to  the	R.P.C.B.  to
arrange for  its transportation,  treatment and safe storage
according  to	the  technically   accepted  procedures	 for
disposal of  chemical wastes  of that  kind. All  reasonable
expenses  for  the  said  operation  were  to  be  borne  by
Respondents Nos.4  to 8	 [hereinafter referred	to  in	this
judgment as the "Respondents"]. So far as the polluted water
in the	wells was  concerned, the Court noted the offer made
by the	learned counsel	 for the  respondents that they will
themselves undertake  the  de-watering	of  the	 wells.	 The
R.P.C.B. was directed to inspect and indicate the number and
location of the wells to be de-watered.
</p><p id="p_24">     The matter	 was next  taken up on April 4, 1990. It was
brought to  the notice of the Court that no meaningful steps
were taken for removing the sludge as directed by this Court
in its	Order dated  March 5,  1990. Since  the monsoon	 was
about to  set in, which would have further damaged the earth
and water in the area, the Court directed the respondents to
immediately remove  the sludge from the open spaces where it
was lying  and store  it in safe places to avoid the risk of
seepage of  toxic substances  into the soil during the rainy
season. The  respondents were  directed to complete the task
within five weeks therefrom.
</p><p id="p_25">     It is  not really necessary to refer to the contents of
the various Orders passed in 1990 and 1991, i.e., subsequent
to the	Order dated  April 4, 1990 for the present purposes.
Suffice it  to say  that the respondents did not comply with
the direction  to store	 the sludge  in safe places. The de-
watering of  wells did	not prove  possible. There  was good
amount of  bickering between the respondents on one side and
the R.P.C.B.  and the Ministry of Environment and Forests on
the other.  They blamed	 each other  for lack of progress in
the matter  of removal of sludge. Meanwhile, years rolled by
and the hazard continued to rise. NEERI submitted an interim
Report. [We  are, however,  not referring to the contents of
this interim Report inasmuch as we would be referring to the
contents of  the final Report presently after referring to a
few more relevant orders of this Court.]
     On February  17,  1992,  this  Court  passed  a  fairly
elaborate order	 observing that	 Respondents Nos.5  to 8 are
responsible for discharging the hazardous industrial wastes;
that the  manufacture of  `H' acid  has given  rise to	huge
quantities of  iron sludge and gypsum sludge - approximately
2268 MT	 of gypsum-based  sludge and  about 189 mt, of iron-
based sludge;  that while  the respondents blamed Respondent
No. 9  as the  main culprit,  Respondent No.  9	 denied	 any
responsibility therefor.  The immediate	 concern,  said	 the
Court, was  the appropriate  remedial action.  The report of
the R.P.C.B.  presented a disturbing picture. It stated that
the  respondents  have	deliberately  spread  the  hazardous
material/sludge all over the place which has only heightened
the problem  of its  removal and  that they  have failed  to
carry out  the Order  of this  Court dated  April  4,  1990.
Accordingly, the  Court directed the Ministry of Environment
and Forests,  Government of  India  to	depute	its  experts
immediately to	inspect the  area to ascertain the existence
and extent of gypsum-based and iron-based sludge, to suggest
the handling  and disposal  procedures and  to	prescribe  a
package for its transportation and safe storage. The cost of
such storage and transportation was to be recovered from the
respondents.
</p><p id="p_26">     Pursuant to  the above Order, a team of experts visited
the area and submitted a Report alongwith an affidavit dated
March 30,  1992. The  report presented	a highly  disturbing
picture. It  stated that  the sludge was found inside a shed
and also  at four  places outside  the shed  but within	 the
premises of  the complex  belonging to	the respondents.  It
stated further	that sludge  has been mixed with soil and at
many places  it is  covered with  earth. A  good  amount  of
sludge was  said to  be lying  exposed to  sun and rain. The
Report stated.	"Above all,  the extent	 of pollution in the
ground water  seems to	be very great and the entire aquifer
may be affected due to the pollution caused by the industry.
The organic  content of	 the sludge  needs to be analysed to
assess the  percolation property  of the  contents from	 the
sludge. It  is also  possible that  the iron  content in the
sludge	may  be	 very  high  which  may	 cause	the  reddish
colorations.  As  the  mother  liquor  produced	 during	 the
process (with  pH-1) was  highly acidic	 in nature  and	 was
indiscriminately discharged  on land  by  the  unit,  it  is
possible that  this might  have eroded	soil and  caused the
extensive damage.  It is  also	possible  that	the  organic
contents of the mother liquor would have gone into soil with
water together	with the  reddish colour."  The Report	also
suggested the  mode of	disposal of  sludge and measures for
re-conditioning the soil.
</p><p id="p_27">     In view of the above Report, the Court made an order on
April 6, 1992 for entombing the sludge under the supervision
of the	officers of the Ministry of Environment and Forests,
Government of  India. Regarding	 revamping of  the soil, the
Court observed	that  for  this	 purpose,  it  might  become
necessary to  stop or suspend the operation of all the units
of the	respondent but	that, the Court said, requires to be
examined further.
</p><p id="p_28">     The work  of entombment  of sludge	 again faced several
difficulties. While  the respondents  blamed the  Government
officers for  the delay, the Government officials blamed the
said respondents  of non-cooperation.  Several	Orders	were
passed by this Court in that behalf and ultimately, the work
commenced.
</p><p id="p_29">ORDERS PASSED  IN 1993, FILING OF WRIT PETITION (C) NO.76 OF
1994 BY RESPONDENT NO.4 AND THE ORDERS PASSED THEREIN:
</p><p id="p_30">     With a  view to  find out	the connection	between	 the
wastes and  sludge resulting from the production of `H' acid
and the	 pollution  in	the  underground  water,  the  Court
directed on  20th August, 1993, that samples should be taken
of the	entombed sludge	 and also  of  the  water  from	 the
affected wells and sent for analysis. Environment experts of
the Ministry  of Environment  and Forests were asked to find
out whether  the pollution  in the well water was on account
of  the	 said  sludge  or  not.	 Accordingly,  analysis	 was
conducted and  the experts  submitted the Report on November
1, 1993. Under the heading "Conclusion", the report stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "5.0 CONCLUSION
     5.1   On	 the   basis	of   the
     observations and  analysis results,
     it is  concluded beyond  doubt that
     the sludge	 inside the  emtomed pit
     is the  contaminated one as evident
     from  the	 number	 of   parameters
     analysed.

     revealed good  correlation	 between
     the colour of well water and H-acid
     content in it. The analysis results
     show high	degree of  impurities in
     sludge/soil and  also in well water
     which  is	a  clear  indication  of
     contamination    of     soil    and
     groundwater due  to disposal  of H-
     acid waste."</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">The report  which is based upon their inspection of the area
in September, 1993 revealed many other alarming features. It
represents a  commentary on  the attitude and actions of the
respondents. In Para-2, under the heading "Site Observations
&amp;  Collection  of  Sludge/Contaminated	Soil  Samples",	 the
following facts are stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "2.1.     The Central  team, during
     inspection	 of   the  premises   of
     M/s.HACL,	observed   that	  H-acid
     sludge	 (iron/gypsum)	     and
     contaminated soil	are still  lying
     at different  places, as  shown  in
     Fig.1,   within	the   industrial
     premises (Photograph  1) which  are
     the left overs. The area, where the
     solar evaporation pond was existing
     with H-acid  sludge dumped here and
     there, was	 observed to  have  been
     levelled	with	borrowed    soil
     (Photograph 2). It was difficult to
     ascertain whether	the  sludge  had
     been   removed    before	filling.
     However, there are visual evidences
     of contaminated soil in the area.
     2.2  As reported  by the  Rajasthan
     Pollution	Control	  Board	  (RPCB)
     representatives, about  720  tonnes
     out of  the total contaminated soil
     and sludge	 scraped from the sludge
     dump sites	 is disposed  of in  six
     lined  entombed   pits  covered  by
     lime/flyash mix,  brick soling  and
     concrete (Photographs  3 &amp;	 4). The
     remaining	 scraped    sludge   and
     contaminated soil	was  lying  near
     the  entombed   pits  for	want  of
     additional	   disposal    facility.
     However, during the visit, the left
     over sludge  and contaminated  soil
     could  not	  be  traced   at  site.
     Inspection of  the surrounding area
     revealed  that   a	 huge	heap  of
     foreign  soil  of	5  metre  height
     (Photograph  5)  covering	a  large
     area, as  also indicated  in Fig.1,
     was raised	 on the	 slopy ground at
     the foot  hill within  the industry
     premises. The  storm water	 run-off
     pathway  over   the   area	  showed
     indication	  of	H-acid	  sludge
     leachate coming  out of  the  heap.
     Soil in  the area	was sampled  for
     analysis.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     2.3  M/s.HACL has a number of other

     operating within  the same premises
     without  valid  consents  from  the
     Rajasthan Pollution  Control  Board
     (RPCB). These  plants are sulphuric
     acid (H2SO4),  fertilizer (SSP) and
     vegetable	 oil   extraction.   The
     effluent of  these	 units	are  not
     properly treated  and the untreated
     effluent particularly from the acid
     plant is passing through the sludge
     dump area playing havoc (Photograph
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     7).   The	  final	  effluent   was
     collected	at  the	 outlet	 of  the
     factory premises  during  operation
     of these  units,  at  the	time  of
     groundwater monitoring in September
     1993, by  the RBPC. Its quality was
     observed to  be highly acidic (pH :

     So4 :  21,000 mg/1,  Fe : 392 mg/1,
     COD :  167	 mg/1)	which  was  also
     revealed in  the earlier  visits of
     the Central  teams. However,  these
     units were	 not in operation during
     the present visit."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     Under Para 4.2.1, the report stated
     inter alia:

     also exhibited  very high values of
     the  above	  mentioned  parameters.
     This revealed that the contaminated
     soil is  buried under  the new dump
     found by the team."</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">     So much  for the  waste disposal by the respondents and
their continuing  good conduct!	 To the	 same effect  is the
Report of the R.P.C.B. which is dated October 30, 1993.
</p><p id="p_33">     In	 view	of  the	 aforesaid  Reports,  all  of  which
unanimously point  out the  consequences  of  the  `H'	acid
production, the	 manner in  which the highly corrosive waste
water (mother  liquor) and  the sludge	resulting  from	 the
production of  `H' acid	 was disposed  of and the continuing
discharge of  highly toxic  effluents by the remaining units
even in	 the year  1993, the  authorities [R.P.C.B.]  passed
orders closing	down, in  exercise  of	their  powers  under
<a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_13">Section 33A</a> of the Water Act, the operation of the Sulphuric
Acid Plant  and the  solvent extraction	 plant including oil
refinery of  the fourth	 respondent with  immediate  effect.
Orders	were   also  passed   directing	  disconnection	  of
electricity supply to the said plants. The fourth respondent
filed Writ  Petition (C)  No.76 of 1994 in this Court, under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_14">Article 32</a>  of the Constitution, questioning the said Orders
in January,  1994. The	main grievance in this writ petition
was  that   without  even   waiting  for   the	petitioner's
[Hindustan Agro	 Chemicals Limited]  reply to the show-cause
notices, orders	 of closure and disconnection of electricity
supply were  passed and	 that this  was done by the R.P.C.B.
with a malafide intent to cause loss to the industry. It was
also submitted	that sudden  closure of its plants is likely
to result  in disaster	and, may  be, an  explosion and that
this consideration was not taken into account while ordering
the closure.  In its  Order dated  March 7, 1994, this Court
found some  justification in  the contention of the industry
that the  various counter-affidavits  filed by	the R.P.C.B.
are self-contradictory.	 The Board  was directed  to adopt a
constructive attitude  in the matter. By another Order dated
March 18,  1994, the  R.P.C.B. was  directed to	 examine the
issue of  grant of permission to re-start the industry or to
permit any  interim arrangement	 in that behalf. On April 8,
1994, a	 'consent' order  was passed whereunder the industry
was directed  to deposit a sum of Rupees sixty thousand with
R.P.C.B. before April 11, 1994 and the R.P.C.B. was directed
to carry  on the  construction	work  of  storage  tank	 for
storing and  retaining ten days effluents from the Sulphuric
Acid plant.  The construction of temporary tank was supposed
to be  an interim  measure pending  the construction  of  an
E.T.P. on  permanent basis.  The Order	dated April 28, 1994
noted  the   Report  of	  the  R.P.C.B.	  stating  that	 the
construction of	 temporary tank	 was completed	on April 26,
1994 under  its supervision.  The industry  was directed  to
comply with such other requirements as may be pointed out by
R.P.C.B.  for	prevention  and	 control  of  pollution	 and
undertake any  works  required	in  that  behalf  forthwith.
Thereafter, the matter went into a slumber until October 13,
1995.

Report was submitted in April, 1994 and it states that it is
based upon  the study  conducted by  it	 during	 the  period
November, 1992	to February,  1994.  Having  regard  to	 its
technical competence and reputation as an expert body on the
subject, we  may be permitted to refer to its Report at some
length:
</p><p id="p_36">     At Page  7, the  Report mentions  the industrial  wates
emerging from the manufacture of `H' acid. It reads:
</p><p id="p_37">     "Solid wastes  generated from    H-
</p><p id="p_38">     acid manufacturing process are:
</p><p id="p_39">     Gypsum sludge  produced during  the

     Iron  sludge  produced  during  the
     reduction	 stage	  (around    0.5
     tonnes/tonne	of	  H-acid
     manufactured)
     Gypsum   sludge   contains	  mostly
     calcium sulphate  along with sodium
     salts  and	 organics.  Iron  sludge
     constitutes unreacted  iron powder,
     besides ferric salts and organics.
</p><p id="p_40">     It	 is  estimated	that,  for  each
     tonne of H-acid manufactured, about
     20	  m3	of   wholly    corrosive
     wastewater was  generated as mother
     liquor, besides  the generation  of
     around 2.0	 m3 of	wash water.  The
     mother liquor  is characterised  by
     low  pH   (around	2.0)   and  high
     concentration  of	total  dissolved
     solids (80	 - 280 g/L). High COD of
     the wastewater  (90 g/L)  could  be
     attributed	  to   organics	  formed
     during    various	   stages     of
     manufacture.     These	 include
     naphthalene   trisulphonic	   acid,

     At Page  10, the  Report mentions	the six	 dump  sites
outside the  `H' acid  plant premises  where the  sludge was
lying in  the open. At Pages 26 and 27, the Report states on
the basis  of V.E.S. investigations that while certain wells
were found  contaminated, others  were not.  At Page 96, the
Report states thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "Damage to Crops and Trees
     The field	surveys in  contaminated
     fields in zone I and II showed that
     no crops  were coming in the fields
     particularly in low lying areas. On
     some  elevated  areas,  crops  like
     jowar, maize  were growing; however
     the  growth  and  yield  were  very
     poor.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">     Further it	 was also  observed that
     even trees	 like eucalyptus planted
     in contaminated  fields  show  leaf
     burning and  stunted  growth.  Many
     old trees which were badly affected
     due  to   contamination  are  still
     growing under  stress conditions as
     a result of soil contamination.
     The top soils at the old dump sites
     outside  the   plant  premises  are
     still  contaminated   and	 require
     decontamination before  the land is
     used for other purposes.
     It was observed that even after the
     operation	of  hauling  the  sludge
     back to the industry premises, some
     sludge mixed  soil was  still lying
     in the premises of a primary school
     (Table    1.1),	 which	   needs
     decontamination."</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">     In	 Chapter-6,   the  Report   mentions  the   remedial
measures. Para 6.1, titled "Introduction", states:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">     "As could	be seen	 from  the  data
     reported in  Chapter 4  and 5,  the
     ground water  and soils within 2 km
     from   the	   plant    have    been
     contaminated.   After    critically
     scrutinising  the	 date,	it   was
     concluded that  there is  an urgent
     need to  work out a decontamination
     strategy  for  the	 affected  area.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">     This    strategy	 includes    the
     decontamination   of    the   soil,
     contaminated   ground   water   and
     abandoned dump  sites. This chapter
     details the  remedial measures that
     can     be	     considered	     for
     implementation   to   restore   the
     environmental   quality	of   the
     affected area."</blockquote>
<p id="p_44">     The  Chapter   then  sets	 out  the  various  remedial
measures,   including	 land	treatment,   soil   washing,
revegetation, control  over the	 flow  of  the	contaminated
water to adjoining lands through canals, leaching of soluble
salts, design  of farm	to development	Agroforestry  and/or
forestry plantation  with  salt	 tolerant  crops/plants	 and
ground water decontamination. Inter alia, the Report states:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     "The   entire   contaminated   area
     comprising	   of	 350	ha    of
     contaminated land and six abandoned
     dump sites	 outside the  industrial
     premises  has   been  found  to  be
     ecologically   fragile    due    to
     reckless past  disposal  activities
     practiced by  M/s. Silver Chemicals
     Ltd. and  M/s.Jyoti Chemicals  Ltd.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">     Accordingly, it  is suggested  that

<p id="p_45">     Under Para	 6.3.2, the Report suggests "Decontamination
Alternatives  for   Groundwater"  including  Bioremediation,
Degradation of	H-acid by  Azotobacter Vinelandii, Isolation
of Bacterial  Population from  H-acid Contaminated  Soil and
several other methods.
</p><p id="p_46">     Under Para	 6.4.2,	 the  Report  mentions	the  several
decontamination	 alternatives	including   containment	  of
contaminated soil,  surface control,  ground water  control,
leachate collection and treatment, gas migration control and
direct waste treatment.
</p><p id="p_47">     At	 Pages	 157  and   158,  the  report  mentions	 the
continuing  discharge	of  effluents	in  an	illegal	 and
dangerous manner. It reports:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">     "It was  also observed  by	 NEERI's
     team during  the current study that

     (pH.1.5) from  the existing  plants
     (Sulphuric	 acid,	Fertilizer,  and
     Oil    extraction)	    are	   being
     discharged, without  treatment,  on
     land  within  the	plant  premises.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">     This  indiscriminate   and	 willful
     disposal	activity    is	 further
     aggravating    the	   contamination
     problem   in   the	  area.	  Acidic
     effluent  leaches	 the  pollutants
     from  the	dumped	sludge	and  the
     contaminated soil	and  facilitates
     their   penetration   through   the
     ground and	 thereby increasing  the
     concentration  of	 sulphates   and
     dissolved	solids	in  groundwater.
     What is  most serious  is the  fact
     that    the    industry	produced
     chlorosulfonic  acid   for	 a   few
     months during  late 1992 which is a
     hazardous and  toxic  substance  as
     per   MEF	  Notification	  titled
     'Manufacture, Storage and Import of
     Hazardous Chemical Rules, 1989, and
     even floated  public shares for the
     manufactures  of	this   obnoxious
     chemical.	 The	production   was
     however   ceased	 due   to    the
     intervention   of	 the   Rajasthan
     Pollution Control Board in December
     1992 as  the industry was operating

     essential	 for	M/s.   Hindustan
     Agrochemicals Ltd.	 to comply  with
     these requirements for carrying out
     the present  industrial activities.
     The    abatement	  of	 further
     contamination warrants  the closure
     of all  industrial operations  till
     an appropriate  effluent  treatment
     plant is  installed, and  certified
     by RPCB  for its functions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">     The Report adds:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">     "The  Industry  management	 in  the

<p id="p_48">			(Emphasis added)
     We do  not think  that the	 above Report  requires	 any
emphasis at  our hands. It speaks for itself - and it speaks
volumes of the 'high regard' the respondents have for law!
     At Pages  179 onwards,  the Report refers to the damage
to the	crops and  the land  and to  the  psychological	 and
mental	torture	  inflicted  upon   the	 villagers   by	 the
respondents and	 suggests that	the principle  of  'Polluter
Pays' should  be applied  in  this  case  inasmuch  as	"the
incident involved  deliberate release  of  untreated  acidic
process wastewater  and negligent  handling of	waste sludge
knowing Fully well the implication of such acts." The Report
suggests that  compensation should  be paid under two heads,
viz., (a)  for the  losses due to damage and (b) towards the
cost of	 restoration of environmental quality. It then works
out the	 total cost  of restoration of environmental quality
at Rs.3738.5 lakhs - i.e., Rs.37.385 crores.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">     REPORT  OF	 R.P.C.B.  SUBMITTED  IN
     JANUARY,  1996   DURING  THE  FINAL
     HEARING OF THESE MATTERS:</blockquote>
<p id="p_50">     When all  these matters were posted before the Court on
October 13, 1995, we realised that the matter requires to be
heard on  a priority  basis. Having regard to the voluminous
data gathered  by this	Court and  the several Orders passed
from time  to  time,  the  matter  was	listed	for  regular
hearing. We  heard all	the parties at length on 10th, 11th,
16th and  17th January, 1996. We have been taken through the
voluminous record.  Submissions have  also been	 made on the
questions of law arising herein.
</p><p id="p_51">     At the end of the first day of regular hearing, we made
an Order  calling upon	the R.P.C.B.  to send a team of high
officials to  the spot	and report to us the latest position
on the following aspects:
</p><p id="p_52">(i)  Whether the  factories of	Silver Chemicals,  Rajasthan
Multi Fertilizers  and Jyoti Chemicals are still working and
whether the  machinery installed  in the said plant is still
existing?  [This  information  was  required  to  check	 the
statement of  the respondents  that the said units are lying
closed since last several years.]
</p><p id="p_53">(ii) To	 report	  whether  the	 factory  or   factories  of
Respondent  No.4,   Hindustan  Agro-Chemicals  Limited,	 are
working and if they are working, what are the products being
manufactured by	 them? The Board was also directed to report
whether the  seventh respondent,  Phosphate India, which was
said to	 have merged with the fourth respondent, is having a
separate factory and if so, what is being produced therein?
</p><p id="p_54">(iii)	  The approximate quantity of sludge - whether 'iron
sludge' or  'gypsum sludge'-  lying in	the area. The report
was to	indicate what  quantity was entombed pursuant to the
Orders of  this Court  and whether  any further	 sludge	 was
lying in  the area  or in  the premises	 of the respondents'
complex, its  approximate quantity  and the time, effort and
cost required to remove the same.
</p><p id="p_55">(iv)The Board was also to take samples of the water in wells
and tanks  in the  area and  have them	analysed and tell us
whether it  is fit  for drinking  by cattle  and/or fit	 for
irrigation purposes.
</p><p id="p_56">     Accordingly, the  R.P.C.B. officials  visited the	site
and have filed a Report dated January 16, 1996 along with an
affidavit. The Report discloses the following facts:
(1)  The two units, Silver Chemicals and Jyoti Chemicals, do
not exist  now. There is no machinery. A godown and a Ferric
Alum plant  have been  constructed at  the site	 of the said
plant. The  Ferric Alum	 plant was  not in  operation at the
time  of   inspection  though	plant  and   machinery	 for
manufacturing it  was found  installed therein.	 Certain old
stock of  Ferric Alum  was also found lying within the plant
premises.
</p><p id="p_57">(2)  Hindustan	Agro-Chemicals	 Limited  [R-4]	  has  seven
industrial  plants,   viz.,  Rajasthan	 Multi	 Fertilizers
[manufacturing	 Grannulated	Single	  Super	   Phosphate
(G.S.S.P.)], a	Suphuric Acid  Plant, a Chlorosulphonic Acid
Plant, Edible  Oil  Solvent  Extraction	 Plant,	 Edible	 Oil
Refinery  and  a  Ferric  Alum	Plant  (known  as  M/s.Jyoti
Chemicals),  all  of  which  are  located  within  the	same
premises. All these seven plants were found not operating on
the date  of inspection	 by the R.P.C.B. officials though in
many cases  the machinery  and the  other equipment  was  in
place. So  far as  the sludge still remaining in the area is
concerned, the report stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">     "3.  Village   Bicchidi  and  other
     adjoining areas were visited by the
     undersigned   officials   to   know
     whether gypsum  and iron  sludge is
     still lying  in the aforesaid area.
     In area  adjoining	 the  irrigation
     canal, sludge  mixed with soil were
     found on  an  area	 of  about  3000
     sq.ft. The	 area was  covered  with
     foreign soil.  Sample of the sludge
     mixed soil	 was collected	for  the
     perusal  of   the	Hon'ble	  Court.
     Entire  premises  of  M/s.Hindustan
     Agro  Chemicals   Ltd.   was   also
     inspected	and  sludge  mixed  with
     soil was  observed in a large area.
     It was  further observed that fresh
     soil in  the varying depth has been
     spread over in most of the area. In
     view of  the fact	that sludge  was
     mixed with	 the soil  and difficult
     to separate  out of  the soil it is
     very  difficult   to  estimate  the
     exact  quantity   of   the	  sludge
     required to  be removed. Samples of
     sludge   mixed   with   soil   were
     collected from  different	part  of
     this area after serving due notices
     under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_17">Environment	Protection  Act</a>,
     1986."</blockquote>
<p id="p_58">     So far  as the  water in  the wells  was conceded,	 the
Report mentioned  that they took samples from the wells from
Bichhri and  other surrounding	villages, i.e.,	 from thirty
two different  locations and  that water in sixteen location
was found  to "contain colour of varying intensities ranging
from very  dark brown  to light	 pink which apparently shows
that these wells/handpumps are still polluted".
</p><p id="p_59">     Sri K.N.Bhat,  learned  counsel  for  the	respondents,
however,  submitted   that  the	  R.P.C.B.  officials	have
throughout  been   hostile  to	the  respondents  and  that,
therefore, the Reports submitted by them should not be acted
upon.  He  also	 submitted  that  respondents  have  had  no
opportunity to	file objections	 to the	 said Report  or  to
produce material  to contradict the statements made therein.
While taking  note of  these submissions,  we may,  however,
refer to  the letter  dated January  13, 1996 written by the
fourth respondent  to  the  R.P.C.B.  In  this	letter,	 the
particulars of	the stocks  remaining in  each of  its seven
plants are  mentioned  along  with  the	 date  of  the	last
production in  each of	those  plants.	The  last  dates  of
production  are	  the  following:  Sulphuric  Acid  Plant  -
November  10,	1995,  S.S.P..	Plant  [Phosphate  India]  -
November  11,	1995,  G.S.S.P.	  Plant	  [Rajasthan   Multi
Fertilizers] -	July 7,	 1995, Solvent	Extraction Plant and
Refinery -  December 2, 1993, Jyoti Chemicals- October, 1990
and Chlorosulphonic  Acid Plant	 - September 29, 1995. It is
worthy of note that these dates are totally at variance with
the dates  of closure  mentioned in  the  counter-affidavits
filed by these units in 1990-91.
</p><p id="p_60">     CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES:
</p><p id="p_61">     Sri  M.C.Mehta,   learned	counsel	 appearing  for	 the
petitioner, brought  to	 our  notice  the  several  Reports,
orders and  other material  on record. He submitted that the
abundant  material   on	 record	  clearly  establishes	 the
culpability  of	 the  respondents  for	the  devastation  in
village	  Bichhri    and   surrounding	 areas	 and   their
responsibility	and   obligation  to   properly	 store	 the
remaining sludge,  stop discharge of all untreated effluents
by taking  necessary measures  and  defray  the	 total	cost
required for remedial measures as suggested by NEERI [Rupees
forty crores  and odd].	 Learned counsel  suggested that  in
view of the saga of repeated and continuous violation of law
and lawful  orders on the part of the respondents, they must
be closed  forthwith. So  far as  the legal propositions are
concerned, the	learned counsel	 relied	 strongly  upon	 the
Constitution Bench  decision in	 M.C.Mehta v. Union of India
[Oleum Gas  Leak Case]	(1987 (1)  S.C.C.395) as well as the
recent Order  of this  Court in	 Indian Council	 for <a href="/doc/1315992/" id="a_18">Enviro-
Legel Action v. Union of India</a> [1995 (5) SCALE 578]. Learned
counsel also  invited our  attention to	 quite a few foreign
decisions and  text books on the subject of environment. Sri
Altaf Ahmed,  learned Additional Solicitor General appearing
for the	 Union of  India, also	stressed the need for urgent
appropriate directions	to mitigate and remedy the situation
on the spot in the light of the expert Reports including the
one made by the central team of experts.
</p><p id="p_62">     The learned  counsel for  the State  of Rajasthan,	 Sri
Aruneshwar Gupta,  expressed  the  readiness  of  the  State
Government to  carry out  and enforce  such orders  as	this
Court may think fit and proper in the circumstances.
</p><p id="p_63">     Sri K.B.Rohtagi,  learned	counsel	 for  the  R.P.C.B.,
invited our  attention to  the various Orders passed, action
taken, cases  instituted and  Reports submitted by the Board
in this	 matter. He  submitted that until recently the Board
had no	power to  close down  any industry  for violation of
environmental laws  and that after conferment of such power,
they did  pass orders  of closure. He denied the allegations
of malafides  or hostile  intent on  the part  of the  Board
towards	 the  respondents.  Learned  counsel  lamented	that
despite its  best  efforts,  the  Board	 has  not  yet	been
successful in  eradicating the	pollution in  the  area	 and
hence asked for stringent orders for remedying the appalling
conditions  in	 the  village	due  to	  the  acts  of	 the
respondents.
</p><p id="p_64">     Sri K.N.Bhat, learned counsel for the respondents, made
the following submissions:
</p><p id="p_65">(1)  The respondents  are private corporate bodies. They are
not  `State'  within  the  meaning  of	<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_19">Article	 12</a>  of	 the
Constitution. A	 writ  petition	 under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_20">Article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution, therefore, does not lie against them.
(2)  The R.P.C.B.  has	been  adopting	a  hostile  attitude
towards these  respondents  from  the  very  beginning.	 The
Reports submitted  by it  or obtained  by it are, therefore,
suspect. The  respondents had  no opportunity  to  test	 the
veracity of  the said Reports. If the matter had been fought
out in	a properly  constituted suit,  the respondents would
have had  an opportunity  to cross-examine  the	 experts  to
establish that	their Reports  are defective  and cannot  be
relied upon.
</p><p id="p_66">(3)  Long  before   the	 respondents  came  into  existence,
Hindustan Zine	Limited was  already in	 existence close  to
Bichhri village	 and has  been discharging  toxic  untreated
effluents in  an unregulated  manner. This  had affected the
water in  the wells, streams and aquifers. This is borne out
by the	several Reports made long prior to 1987. Blaming the
respondents for	 the said  pollution is	 incorrect as a fact
and unjustified.
</p><p id="p_67">(4)  The respondents  have been	 cooperating with this Court
in all	matters and  carrying out its directions faithfully.
The Report  of the  R.P.C.B. dated  November 13,  1992 shows
that the  work of  entombment of the sludge was almost over.
The Report  states that the entire sludge would be stored in
the prescribed	manner within  the next two days. In view of
this report,  the subsequent  Report of	 the  Central  team,
R.P.C.B. and  NEERI cannot be accepted or relied upon. There
are about  70 industries  in India  manufacturing `H'  acid.
Only the  units of  the respondents have been picked upon by
the Central  and State	authorities while  taking no  action
against the  other units.  Even in the matter of disposal of
sludge, the directions given for its disposal in the case of
other units  are not as stringent as have been prescribed in
the case  of respondents.  The decision	 of the Gujarat High
Court in  Pravinbhai Jashbhai Patel shows that the method of
disposal prescribed  there is  different and  less elaborate
than the one prescribed in this case.
</p><p id="p_68">(5)  The Reports  submitted by	the various so-called expert
committees that	 sludge is  still lying	 around	 within	 and
outside the  respondents'  complex  and/or  that  the  toxic
wastes from the Sulphuric Acid Plant are flowing through and
leaching  the	sludge	and   creating	a  highly  dangerous
situation is  untrue and  incorrect. The R.P.C.B. itself had
constructed a  temporary E.T.P. for the Sulphuric Acid Plant
pursuant to  the Orders	 of this Court made in Writ Petition
(C) No.76 of 1994. Subsequently, a permanent E.T.P. has also
been constructed.  There is  no question  of untreated toxic
discharges from this plant leaching with sludge. There is no
sludge and  there is  no toxic	discharge from the Sulphuric
Acid Plant.
</p><p id="p_69">(6)  The  case	 put  forward	by  the	 R.P.C.B.  that	 the
respondents'   units	do   not    have    the	   requisite
permits/consents required  by the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_21">Water Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_22">Air Act</a> and the
Environment [Protection]  Act is  again unsustainable in law
and  incorrect	as  a  fact.  The  respondents'	 units	were
established before  the amendment of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_23">Section 25</a> of the Water
Act and,  therefore, did  not require  any prior consent for
their establishment.
</p><p id="p_70">(7)  The proper	 solution to  the present  problem  lies  in
ordering a comprehensive judicial enquiry by a sitting Judge
of the	High Court  to find  out the  causes of pollution in
this village  and also to recommend remedial measures and to
estimate the  loss suffered  by the public as well as by the
respondents. While  the respondents are prepared to bear the
cost of	 repairing the	damage, if  any, caused by them, the
R.P.C.B. and  other authorities should be made to compensate
for the	 huge losses  suffered by the respondents on account
of their  illegal and  obstructionist policy adopted towards
them.
</p><p id="p_71">(8)  The decision  in Oleum Gas Leak Case has been explained
in the	opinion of  Ranganath Misra, CJ., in the decision in
<a href="/doc/27098883/" id="a_24">Union Carbide  Corporation  v.	Union  of  India</a>  (1991	 (4)
S.C.C.584). The	 law laid  down in Oleum Gas Leak Case is at
variance  with	the  established  legal	 position  in  other
Commonwealth countries.
</p><p id="p_72">     Sri Bhat  suggested that  in the  larger  interests  of
environment, industry  and public, this Court may direct the
Government of  India to	 constitute, by	 proper legislation,
environment courts all over the country - which courts alone
should be  empowered  to  deal	with  such  cases,  to	give
appropriate  directions	  including  orders  of	 closure  of
industries wherever  necessary, to  make necessary technical
and scientific	investigations, to suggest remedial measures

</p><p id="p_75">     <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_27">Article 48A</a> is one of the Directive Principles of State
Policy. It says that the State shall endeavor to protect and
improve the  environment and  to safeguard  the forests	 and
wildlife  of   the  country.   <a href="/doc/867010/" id="a_28">Article	51A</a>   sets  out	 the
fundamental duties  of the  citizens. One of them is "(g) to
protect	 and   improve	the  natural  environment  including

for living creatures.....".
</p><p id="p_76">     The problem  of  increasing  pollution  of	 rivers	 and
streams in  the country	 - says the Statement of Objects and
Reasons	 appended   to	the  Bill  which  became  the  Water
[Prevention and	 Control of Pollution] Act, 1974 - attracted
the attention  of the State Legislatures and the Parliament.
They realised  the urgency  of ensuring	 that  domestic	 and
industrial effluents  are not  allowed to be discharged into
water courses  without adequate treatment and that pollution
of rivers  and streams	was causing  damage to the country's
economy. A  committee was  set up  in 1962  to draw  a draft
enactment for  prevention of  water pollution. The issue was
also considered	 by  the  Central  Council  of	Local  Self-
Government in  September, 1963.	 The Council  suggested	 the
desirability of having a single enactment for the purpose. A
draft Bill  was prepared and sent to various States. Several
expert committees also made their recommendations meanwhile.
Since an  enactment on the subject was relatable to Entry 17
read with  Entry 6 of List-II in the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution -	and, therefore,	 within the exclusive domain
of the	States -  the State Legislatures of Gujarat, Kerala,
Haryana and  Mysore passed  resolutions as  contemplated  by
<a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_29">Article 252</a>  of the  Constitution enabling the Parliament to
make a	law on	the subject.  On that  basis, the Parliament
enacted the Water [Prevention and Control of Pollution] Act,
1974. [The  State of  Rajasthan	 too  passed  the  requisite
resolution.] <a href="/doc/340671/" id="a_30">Section  24(1)</a> of	the Water  Act provides that
"subject to  the provisions  of this  section, (a) no person
shall knowingly	 cause or  permit any  poisonous, noxious or
polluting  matter   determined	in   accordance	 with	such
standards as  may be  laid down	 by the State Board to enter
whether	 (directly   or	 indirectly)   into  any  stream  or
well.....". <a href="/doc/813302/" id="a_31">Section  25(1)</a>, before  it was amended by Act 53

of the State Board, bring into use any new or altered outlet
for the	 discharge of sewage or trade effluent into a stream
or well	 or begin  to make  any new  discharge of  sewage or
trade effluent	into a stream or well." As amended by Act 53
of 1988,  <a href="/doc/813302/" id="a_32">Section  25</a>  now  reads:  "25(1)  Subject  to	 the

</p><p id="p_80">CONSIDERATION OF THE SUBMISSIONS:
</p><p id="p_81">     Taking up	the objections	urged by  Sri Bhat first, we
find it	 difficult to agree with them. This writ petition is
not really  for	 issuance  of  appropriate  writ,  order  or
directions against  the respondents  but is directed against
the Union  of India, Government of Rajasthan and R.P.C.B. to
compel them  to perform	 their statutory  duties enjoined by
the Acts  aforementioned on the ground that their failure to
carry out  their statutory  duties is  seriously undermining
the right  to life  [of the  residents of  Bichhri  and	 the
affected area] guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_45">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.
If this Court finds that the said authorities have not taken
the action  required of	 them by law and that their inaction
is jeopardizing	 the right  to life  of the citizens of this
country or  of any  section thereof,  it is the duty of this
Court to  intervene. If it is found that the respondents are
flouting the provisions of law and the directions and orders
issued by  the lawful  authorities, this Court can certainly
make appropriate  directions to	 ensure compliance  with law
and lawful  directions made  thereunder. This  is  a  social
action litigation  on behalf  of the  villagers	 of  Bichhri
whose right  to life, as elucidated by this Court in several
decisions,  is	 invaded  and  seriously  infringed  by	 the
respondents as	is established by the various Reports of the
experts called	for, and  filed before,	 this Court.  If  an
industry is  established  without  obtaining  the  requisite
permission and	clearances and	if the industry is continued
to be  run in  blatant disregard  of law to the detriment of
life and liberty of the citizens living in the vicinity, can
it be suggested with any modicum of reasonableness that this
Court has  no power to intervene and protect the fundamental
right to  life and  liberty of the citizens of this country.
The answer, in our opinion, is self-evident. We are also not
convinced of  the plea	of Sri	Bhat that  R.P.C.B. has been
adopting a  hostile attitude  towards his clients throughout
and, therefore,	 its contentions  or the Reports prepared by
its officers  should not  be relied upon. If the respondents
establish and operate their plants contrary to law, flouting
all safety  norms provided by law, the R.P.C.B. was pound to
act. On	 that account, it cannot be said to be acting out of
animus	or   adopting  a   hostile  attitude.  Repeated	 and
persistent violations  call for	 repeated orders. That is no
proof  of  hostility.  Moreover,  the  Reports	of  R.P.C.B.
officials are fully corroborated and affirmed by the Reports
of central  team of  experts and  of NEERI.  We are also not
prepared to  agree with	 Sri Bhat  that since  the Report of
NEERI was  prepared at	the  instance  of  R.P.C.B.,  it  is
suspect. This  criticism is  not only  unfair  but  is	also
uncharitable to the officials of NEERI who have no reason to
be inimical  to the respondents. If, however, the actions of
the respondents	 invite the  concern of	 the experts  and if
they depict  the correct  situation in	their Reports,	they
cannot be accused of any bias. Indeed, it is this Court that
asked NEERI  to suggest	 remedial  measures  and  it  is  in
compliance  with  those	 orders	 that  NEERI  submitted	 its
interim Report	and also  the final  Report. Similarly,	 the
objection of  Sri Bhat	that the  Reports submitted  by	 the
NEERI, by  the Central	team [experts  from the	 Ministry of
Environment and	 Forests, Government  of India] and R.P.C.B.
cannot be  acted upon is equally unacceptable. These Reports
were called  by this  Court and several Orders passed on the
basis of  those Reports. It was never suggested on behalf of
Respondents Nos.4  to 8	 that unless  they are	permitted to
cross-examine the  experts or  the persons  who	 made  those
Reports, their Reports cannot be acted upon. This objection,
urged at  this late  stage of proceedings - after a lapse of
several years - is wholly unacceptable. The persons who made
the said Reports are all experts in their field and under no
obligation either  to the R.P.C.B. or for that matter to any
other  person	or  industry.	It  is	 in  view  of  their
independence and  competence that  their Reports were relied
upon and made the basis of passing Orders by this Court from
time to time.
</p><p id="p_82">     Now coming	 to the	 question of  alleged  pollution  by
Hindustan Zinc Limited [R-9], it may be that Respondent No.9
is also	 responsible for  discharging untreated effluents at
one or	the other point of time but that is not the issue we
are concerned  with in	these  writ  petitions.	 These	writ
petitions are  confined to  the pollution  caused in Bichhri
village on  account of	the activities of the respondent. No
Report among  the several  Reports placed before us in these
proceedings says  that Hindustan Zinc Limited is responsible
for the	 pollution at  Bichhri village.	 Sri Bhat brought to
our notice  certain Reports stating that the discharges from
Hindustan Zinc	Limited were  causing pollution	 in  certain
villages but they are all down stream, i.e., to the north of
Bichhri village	 and we are not concerned with the pollution
in those  villages in  these proceedings. The bringing in of
Hindustan Zinc	Limited in  these proceedings is, therefore,
not relevant. If necessary, the pollution, if any, caused by
Hindustan Zinc	Limited	 can  be  the  subject-matter  of  a
separate proceeding.
</p><p id="p_83">     We may  now deal with the contentions of Sri Bhat based
upon the affidavit of R.P.C.B. dated November 13, 1992 which
has been  repeatedly and strongly relied upon by the learned
counsel in  support of his submission that the entire sludge
has been  properly stored  by  or  at  the  expense  of	 his
clients. It  is on the basis of this affidavit that Sri Bhat
says that  the	subsequent  Reports  submitted	showing	 the
existence of  sludge within and outside their complex should
not be	accepted or acted upon. Let us turn to the affidavit
of R.P.C.B.  dated November 13, 1992 and see how far does it
support Sri  Bhat's contention.	 It is in Para 2(b) that the
sentence, strongly  relied upon	 by Sri	 Bhat occurs,  viz.,
"remaining work	 is likely to be completed by 15th November,
1992". For  a proper appreciation of the purport of the said
sentence, it  would be	appropriate to	read the entire Para
2(b), which  is to  the following  effect: "(b) that all the
six tanks have been entombed with brick toppings. Roofing is
complete on  all tanks	which have  also been  provided with
proper outlets	for the	 exit of  gases which  may form as a
result of  possible chemical  reactions in  the sludge mass.
The tanks  have also  been provided with reinforced concrete
to prevent propping of the roof. Remaining work is likely to
be completed  by 15th  November, 1992." We find it difficult
to read the said sentence as referring to the storage of the
remaining about	 1700 MT  of sludge. When the storage of 720
MT itself  took	 up  all  the  six  tanks  provided  by	 the
respondent, where  was the  remaining  1700  tonnes  stored?
Except relying	upon the  said sentence repeatedly, Sri Bhat
has not	 been able  to tell  us where  this 1700 MT has been
stored, whether	 in tanks  end if  so, who  constructed	 the
tanks and  when and  how were they covered and sealed. He is
also not  able to tell us on what dates the remaining sludge
was stored.  It	 is  evident  that  the	 aforesaid  sentence
occurring in  clause 2(b)  refers to  the proper sealing and
completion of  the said	 tanks wherein	720 MT of sludge was
stored. If,  in	 fact,	the  said  1700	 MT  has  also	been
entombed, it  was not  difficult for the respondents to give
the particulars	 of the	 said storage.	We  are,  therefore,
unable to  agree with  Sri Bhat	 that the subsequent Reports
which repeatedly  and uniformly	 speak of  the	presence  of
sludge within  and outside  the complex	 of the	 respondents
should not  be accepted.  It may be recalled that the Report
of the	team of Central Experts was submitted on November 1,
1993  based   upon  the	  inspection   made   by   them	  in
September/October, 1993. To the same effect is the affidavit
of R.P.C.B. dated October 30, 1993 and the further affidavit
dated December	1, 1993.  These Reports	 together  with	 the
report of  NEERI clearly  establish that  huge quantities of
sludge were  still lying around either in the form of mounds
or placed  in depressions,  or spread  over  the  contiguous
areas and  covered with local soil to conceal its existence.
It is worth reiterating that the said sludge is only part of
the pernicious	discharges emanating from the manufacture of
`H' acid. The other part, which is unfortunately not visible
now [except  in its  deleterious effects  upon the  soil and
underground  water]  is	 the  `mother  liquor'	produced  in
enormous  quantities   which  has   either  flowed   out  or
percolated into the soil.
</p><p id="p_84">     So far  as the  responsibility of	the respondents	 for
causing the pollution in the wells, soil and the aquifers is
concerned, it  is clearly established by the analysis Report
referred to  in the Report of the Central experts team dated
November 1,  1993 [Page	 1026 of  Vol.II]. Indeed, number of
Orders passed  by this	Court, referred to hereinbefore, are
premised  upon	 the  finding	that  the   respondents	 are
responsible for	 the said  pollution. It  is only because of
the said  reason that  they were asked to defray the cost of
removal and  storage of	 sludge. It  is precisely  for	this
reason	that,	at  one	 stage,	 the  respondents  had	also
undertaken the	de-watering of	polluted wells.	 Disclaiming
the responsibility  for the  pollution in and around Bichhri
village,  at  this  stage  of  proceedings,  is	 clearly  an
afterthought.  We  accordingly	held  and  affirm  that	 the
respondents alone  are responsible for all the damage to the
soil, to the underground water and to the village Bichhri in
general, damage which is eloquently portrayed in the several
Reports of  the experts	 mentioned  hereinabove.  NEERI	 has
worked out  the cost  for repairing  the damage at more than
Rupees forty  crores. Now,  the question  is whether  and to
what extent  can the  respondents be  made  responsible	 for
defraying the cost of remedial measures in these proceedings
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_46">Article  32.</a> Before we advert to this question, it may
perhaps be  appropriate to clarify that so far as removal of
remaining sludge and/or the stoppage of discharge of further
toxic	wastes	 are   concerned,   it	 is   the   absolute
responsibility of  the respondents  to store the sludge in a
proper manner  [in the same manner in which 720 MT of sludge
has already  been stored]  and to  stop the discharge of any
other or  further toxic	 wastes from  its  plants  including
Sulphuric  Acid	  Plant	 and   to  ensure  that	 the  wastes
discharged do  not flow	 into or  through the  sludge.	Now,
turning	 to   the  question   of  liability,   it  would  be
appropriate to refer to a few decisions on the subject.
</p><p id="p_85">     In Oleum  Gas Leak Case, a Constitution Bench discussed
this question at length and held thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">     "We  are	of  the	  view	that  an

     threat to	the health and safety of
     the persons  working in the factory
     and  residing  in	the  surrounding
     areas owes	 an  absolute  and  non-
     delegable duty  to the community to
     ensure  that  no  harm  results  to
     anyone on	account of  hazardous or
     inherently dangerous  nature of the
     activity which  it has  undertaken.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">     The enterprise  must be  held to be
     under an obligation to provide that
     the   hazardous	or    inherently
     dangerous activity	 in which  it is
     engaged must  be conducted with the
     highest standards	of safety and if
     any harm results on account of such
     activity, the  enterprise	must  be
     absolutely liable to compensate for
     such  harm	 and  it  should  be  no
     answer to	the  enterprise	 to  say
     that it  had taken	 all responsable
     care and  that  the  harm	occurred
     without any negligence on its part.
     Since the persons harmed on account
     of	 the   hazardous  or  inherently
     dangerous activity	 carried  on  by
     the enterprise  would not	be in  a
     position to  isolate the process of
     operation	 from	 the   hazardous
     preparation  of  substance	 or  any
     other related  element that  caused
     the harm  the  enterprise	must  be
     held strictly  liable  for	 causing
     such harm	as a  part of the social
     cost for  carrying on the hazardous
     or inherently  dangerous  activity.
     If the  enterprise is  permitted to
     carry on an hazardous or inherently
     dangerous activity for its profits,
     the  law  must  presume  that  such
     permission is  conditional	 on  the
     enterprise absorbing  the	cost  of
     any accident  arising on account of
     such   hazardous	 or   inherently
     dangerous	  activity     as     an
     appropriate item  of its overheads.
     Such   hazardous	 or   inherently

     enterprise	   is	 strictly    and
     absolutely liable to compensate all

<p id="p_86">Sri Bhat, however, points out that in the said decision, the
question  whether  the	industry  concerned  therein  was  a
`State' within	the meaning  of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_47">Article	 12</a> and,  therefore,
subject to  the discipline  of Part-III	 of the Constitution
including <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_48">Article  21</a> was left open and that no compensation
as such	 was awarded  by this Court to the affected persons.
He relies upon the observations in the concurring opinion of
Ranganath Misra,CJ.,  in Union Carbide Corporation [1991 (4)
S.C.C. 584].  The learned  Chief Justice,  referred  in	 the
first instance,	 to the propositions enunciated in Oleum Gas
Leak Case  and then made the following observations in Paras
14 and 15:
</p><p id="p_87">     "14. In	M.C.Mehta    case,    no
     compensation was  awarded	as  this
     Court   could    not   reach    the
     conclusion	  that	  Shriram   (the
     delinquent company) came within the
     meaning of `State' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_49">Article 12</a> so
     as to  be liable  to the discipline

     perhaps is	 a good	 guidelines  for
     working  out  compensation	 in  the
     cases  to	 which	the   ratio   is
     intended to apply. The statement of
     the law  ex-facie makes a departure
     from the accepted legal position in

     been shown	 any  binding  precedent

**A distinction	 between the  Oleum Gas	 Leak Case  and	 the
present case  may be  noticed. That was not a case where the
industry was  established or  was being operated contrary to
law as	in the	present case. That was also not a case where
the orders  of lawful  authorities and	Courts were violated
with impunity  as in  this case.  In this  case, there	is a
clear violation	 of law	 and disobedience  to the  Orders of
this Court  apart from the orders of the lawful authorities.
The  facts   stated  above   and  findings  recorded  by  us
hereinafter bear  it out.  This	 Court	has  to	 ensure	 the
observance of law and of its Orders as a part of enforcement
of fundamental rights. That power cannot be disputed. If so,
a question may arise why is this Court not competent to make
Orders necessary  for a full and effective implementation of
its Orders  - and  that includes the imposition and recovery
of cost	 of all	 measures including remedial measures. Above
all,  the   Central  Government	 has  the  power  under	 the
provisions  of	 <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_52">Sections  3</a>   and  <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_53">5</a>	of  the	 Environment
(Protection) Act,  1986 to  levy and  recover  the  cost  of
remedial measures  - as we shall presently point out. If the
Central Government  omits to  do that  duty, this  Court can
certainly  issue   appropriate	directions  to	it  to	take
necessary measures.  Is it  not open  to the  Court,  in  an
appropriate situation,	to  award  damages  against  private
parties	 as   part  of	 relief	  granted   against   public
authorities. This is a question upon which we do not wish to
express any  opinion in	 the absence of a full debate at the
Bar.
</p><p id="p_92">     recover  the   cost  of   remedial	 measures  from	 the
respondents. <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_54">Section  3</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,
1986 expressly	empowers  the  Central	Government  [or	 its
delegate, as  the case may be] to "take all such measures as
it  deems   necessary  or   expedient  for  the	 purpose  of
protecting     and	improving     the     quality	  of
environment.........".	<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_55">Section	  5</a>  clothes   the   Central
Government  [or	 its  delegate]	 with  the  power  to  issue
directions for	achieving the  objects of the Act. Read with
the  wide  definition  of  "environment"  in  <a href="/doc/142996678/" id="a_56">Section  2(a)</a>,
<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_57">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_58">5</a> clothe the central Government with all such
powers as  are "necessary  or expedient	 for the  purpose of
protecting and	improving the  quality of  the environment".
The Central Government is empowered to take all measures and
issue all  such directions  as	are  called  for  the  above
purpose. In  the present  case, the said powers will include
giving directions for the removal of sludge, for undertaking
remedial measures  and also  the power to impose the cost of
remedial measures  on the offending industry and utilize the
amount so recovered for carrying out remedial measures. This
Court  can   certainly	give   directions  to	the  Central
Government/its delegate	 to take  all such measures, if in a
given  case  this  Court  finds	 that  such  directions	 are
warranted. We find that similar directions have been made in
a recent  decision of  this  Court  in	Indian	Council	 for
Enviro-Legal Action  and Ors.  [supra]. That was also a writ
petition  filed	  under	 <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_59">Article  32</a>  of  the  Constitution.
Following is the direction:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">     "It  appears   that  the  Pollution
     Control  Board  had  identified  as
     many as  22 industries  responsible
     for   the	 pollution   caused   by
     discharge of  their effluents  into
     Nakkavagu. They were responsible to
     compensate to  farmers. It	 was the
     duty of  the  State  Government  to
     ensure   that   this   amount   was
     recovered from  the industries  and
     paid to the farmers."
</blockquote><p id="p_93">It is,	therefore, idle	 to contend  that this	Court cannot
make appropriate  directions for  the  purpose	of  ensuring
remedial action. It is more a matter of form.
</p><p id="p_94">     Sri  K.N.Bhat  submitted  that  the  rule	of  absolute
liability is  not accepted  in England or other Commonwealth
countries and that the rule evolved by the House of Lords in
Rylands v.  Fletcher [1866  (3) H.L.330] is the correct rule
to be  applied in  such matters.  Firstly, in  view  of	 the
binding decision  of this Court in Oleum Gas Leak Case, this
contention is  untenable, for  the said	 decision  expressly
refers to the rule in Rylands but refuses to apply it saying
that it	 is not	 suited to the conditions in India. Even so,
for the	 sake of  completeness, we  may discuss	 the rule in
Rylands and  indicate why  that rule  is  inappropriate	 and
unacceptable in	 this country.	The rule was first stated by
Blackburn,J. [Court  of Exchequer  Chamber] in the following
words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">     "We think that the true rule of law
     is, that the person who for his own
     purposes brings  on his  lands  and
     collects and  keeps there	anything
     likely  to	  do  mischief	 if   it
     escapes, must  keep it  in	 at  his
     peril, and,  if he	 does not do so,
     is prima  facie answerable	 for all
     the damage	 which	is  the	 natural
     consequence of  its escape.  He can
     excuse himself  by shewing that the
     escape was owing to the plaintiff's
     default; or perhaps that the escape
     was the  consequence of  vis major,
     or the act of God;.....and it seems
     but reasonable  and just  that  the
     neighbor, who has brought something
     on his  own property  which was not
     naturally there, harmless to others
     so long  as it  is confined  to his
     own property, but which he knows to
     be mischievous  if it  gets on  his
     neighbour's, should  be obliged  to
     make good	the damage  which ensues
     if he does not succeed in confining
     it to his own property."
</blockquote><p id="p_95">The House  of Lords,  however, added  a rider  to the  above
statement, viz.,  that the user by the defendant should be a
"non-natural" user  to attract	the rule. In other words, if
the user  by the defendant is a natural user of the land, he
would not  be liable  for damages.  Thus, the  twin tests  -
apart from  the proof  of damage  to the  plaintiff  by	 the
act/negligence of  the defendants  - which must be satisfied
to attract  this rule  are "foreseability" and "non-natural"
user of the land.
</p><p id="p_96">     The rule  in Rylands  has been approved by the House of
Lords in  the recent  decision in Cambridge Water Company v.
Eastern Counties  Leather,  PLC	 [1994	(2)  W.L.R.53].	 The
plaintiff,  Cambridge	Water  Company,	  was  a   statutory
corporation engaged  in providing public water supply within
a certain  area including  the city  of	 Cambridge.  It	 was
lifting water  from a  bore well  situated at  some distance
from Sawstyn.  The defendant-company,  Eastern Leather,	 was
having a  tannery in  Sawstyn. Tanning	necessarily involves
decreasing of  pelts. For  that purpose,  the defendant	 was
using an oregano chlorine called P.C.E. P.C.E. was stored in
a tank	in the	premises of  the defendant.  The plaintiff's
case was  that on account of the P.C.E. percolating into the
ground, the  water in its well became contaminated and unfit
for human  consumption and  that  on  that  account  it	 was
obliged to find an alternative source at a substantial cost.
It  sued  the  defendant  for  the  resulting  damages.	 The
plaintiff based	 his claim  on	three  alternative  grounds,
viz., negligence,  nuisance and	 the rule  in  Rylands.	 The
Trial Judge  (High Court) dismissed the action in negligence
and nuisance  holding that  the	 defendant  could  not	have
reasonably foreseen  that such	damage could  occur  to	 the
plaintiff. So  far as the rule in Rylands was concerned, the
Trial Judge  held that	the user by the defendant was not an
non-natural user  and hence,  it was not liable for damages.
On appeal, the Court of Appeal declined to decide the matter
on the basis of the rule in Rylands. It relied strongly upon
the ratio  in Ballard  v.  Tomlinson  [(1885)  29  Ch.D.115]
holding that no person having a right to use a common source
is entitled  to contaminate that source so as to prevent his
neighbor  from	 having	 a   full  value  of  his  right  of
appropriation. The  Court of  Appeal also  opined  that	 the
defendant's use of the land was not a natural use. On appeal
by the	defendant, the	House of  Lords allowed	 the  appeal
holding that  foreseability of the harm of the relevant type
by the defendant was a pre-requisite to the right to recover
damages both  under the heads of nuisance and also under the
rule in	 Rylands and  since that  was not established by the
plaintiff, it  has to  fail. The  House of  Lords, no doubt,
held that  the defendant's use of the land was a non-natural
use but	 dismissed the	suit, as stated above, on the ground
that the plaintiff has failed to establish that pollution of
their water  supply by	the solvent used by the defendant in
his premises  was in the circumstances of the case forseable
by the defendant.
</p><p id="p_97">     The Australian  High Court	 has, however, expressed its
disinclination	to   treat  the	  rule	in   Rylands  as  an
independent head for claiming damages or as a rule rooted in
the law	 governing  the	 law  of  nuisance  in	Burnie	Port
Authority v.  General Jones  Pty Ltd.  [(1994) 68 Australian
Law Journal 331]. The respondent, General Jones Limited, has
stored frozen  vegetables in three cold storage rooms in the
building owned	by  the	 appellant,  Burnie  Port  Authority
[Authority].  The  remaining  building	remained  under	 the
occupation of  the Authority. The Authority wanted to extend
the building.  The extension  work was	partly done  by	 the
Authority itself  and partly  by an  independent  contractor
[Wildridge and	Sinclair Pty.Ltd.].  For doing its work, the
contractor used a certain insulating material called E.P.S.,
a highly  inflammable substance.  On  account  of  negligent
handling of  E.P.S., there  was	 a  fire  which	 inter	alia
damaged the  rooms in  which General  Jones had	 stored	 its
vegetables. On	an action  by General  Jones, the Australian
High Court  held by  a majority	 that the  rule	 in  Rylands
having	 attracted    many   difficulties,    uncertainties,
qualifications and  exceptions, should	now be seen, for the
purposes of  Australian	 Common	 Law,  as  absorbed  by	 the
principles of  ordinary negligence.  The Court	held further
that under  the rules  governing negligence,  if a person in
control of  a premises,	 introduces a dangerous substance to
carry on  a dangerous  activity, or allows another to do one
of those  things, owes	a duty of reasonable care to avoid a
reasonably foreseeable	risk of	 injury	 or  damage  to	 the
person or  property of	another. In a case where a person or
the property  of that  other is	 lawfully in a place outside
the premises, the duty of care varies in degree according to
the magnitude  of the  risk involved and extends to ensuring
that such  care is  taken. Applying  the said principle, the
Court  held  that  the	Authority  allowed  the	 independent
contractor to  introduce or  retain a dangerbus substance or
to engage  in a	 dangerous activity  in its  premises  which
substance and  activity caused	a fire	that  destroyed	 the
goods of  General  Jones.  The	evidence,  the	Court  held,
established that  the independent  contractor's work  was  a
dangerous activity  in that it involved real and foreseeable
risk of	 a serious  conflagration unless special precautions
were taken.  In the  circumstances, it	was  held  that	 the
Authority owed a non-delegable duty of care to General Jones
to ensure  that its  contractor	 took  reasonable  steps  to
prevent the occurrence of a fire and the breach of that duty
attracted liability  pursuant to  the ordinary principles of
negligence for the damage sustained by the respondent.
</p><p id="p_98">     On a  consideration of  the two  lines of	thought [one
adopted	 by   the  English  Courts  and	 the  other  by	 the
Australian High	 Court], we  are of  the  opinion  that	 any
principle evolved in this behalf should be simple, practical
and suited  to the  conditions obtaining in this country. We
are convinced that the law stated by this Court in Oleum Gas
Leak Case  is by  far the  more appropriate one - apart from
the fact that it is binding upon us. [We have disagreed with
the view  that the  law	 stated	 in  the  said	decision  is
obiter.] According  to this  rule, once the activity carried
on is hazardous or inherently dangerous, the person carrying
on such	 activity is  liable to make good the loss caused to
any other  person by  his activity  irrespective of the fact
whether he  took  reasonable  care  while  carrying  on	 his
activity. The  rule is	premised upon the very nature of the
activity carried on. In the words of the Constitution Bench,
such an	 activity "can	be tolerated  only on  the condition
that the  enterprise engaged in such hazardous or inherently
dangerous activity  indemnifies	 all  those  who  suffer  on
account of  the carrying  on of such hazardous or inherently
dangerous activity  regardless of  whether it  is carried on
carefully or  not." The Constitution Bench has also assigned
the reason for stating the law in the said terms. It is that
the enterprise	[carrying on  the  hazardous  or  inherently
dangerous activity]  alone has	the resource to discover and
guard against  hazards or  dangers  -  and  not	 the  person
affected and  the practical  difficulty [on  the part of the
affected person]  in establishing  the absence of reasonable
care or	 that the  damage to  him  was	foreseeable  by	 the
enterprise.
</p><p id="p_99">     Once the  law in  Oleum Gas Leak Case is held to be the
law applicable,	 it follows,  in the  light of	our findings
recorded hereinbefore,	that  Respondents  Nos.4  to  8	 are
absolutely liable  to compensate for the harm caused by them
to villagers  in the  affected area,  to the soil and to the
underground water  and hence,  they are	 bound to  take	 all
necessary measures to remove the sludge and other pollutants
lying in  the affected	area [by  affected area, we mean the
area of about 350 he, indicated in the sketch at Page 178 of
NEERI Report]  and also	 to defray  the cost of the remedial
measures required  to restore  the soil	 and the underground
water spruces.	<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_60">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_61">4</a> of Environment [Protection]
Act confers  upon the  Central Government  the power to give
directions of the above nature and to the above effect. Levy
of costs  required for	carrying out  remedial	measures  is
implicit in  <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_62">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_63">4</a> which are couched in very wide
and expansive  language. Appropriate directions can be given
by this	 Court to  the	Central	 Government  to	 invoke	 and
exercise those	powers with  such modulations  as are called
for in the facts and circumstances of this case.
</p><p id="p_100">     The question  of liability of the respondents to defray
the costs  of remedial measures can also be looked into from
another angle, which has now come to be accepted universally
as a sound principle, viz., the "Polluter Pays" Principle.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">     "The   polluter	pays   principle
     demands that the financial costs of
     preventing	 or   remedying	  damage
     caused by pollution should lie with
     the undertakings  which  cause  the
     pollution,	 or  produce  the  goods
     which cause  the  pollution.  Under
     the principle it is not the role of
     government	 to   meet   the   costs
     involved in  either  prevention  of
     such damage,  or  in  carrying  out
     remedial action, because the effect
     of	 this  would  be  to  shift  the
     financial burden  of the  pollution
     incident  to   the	 taxpayer.   The
     `polluter	 pays'	 principle   was
     promoted by  the  Organization  for
     Economic	   Co-operation	     and
     Development [OECD] during the 1970s
     when   there   was	  great	  public
     interest in  environmental	 issues.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">     During this time there were demands
     on	    government	   and	   other
     institutions to  introduce policies
     and mechanisms  for the  protection
     of the  environment and  the public
     from the threats posed by pollution
     in a modern industrialized society.
     Since   then    there   has    been
     considerable  discussion	of   the
     nature   of   the	 polluter   pays
     principle, but the precise scope of
     the principle  and its implications
     for  those	 involved  in  past,  or
     potentially  polluting   activities
     have   never    been   satisfactory
     agreed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">     Despite the  difficulties	inherent
     in	 defining   the	 principle,  the
     European Community accepted it as a
     fundamental part of its strategy on
     environmental matters,  and it  has
     been   one	   of	the   underlying
     principles of  the	 four  Community
     Action    Programmes     on     the
     Environment.  The	 current  Fourth
     Action	 Programme	 ([1987]
     O.J.C328/1)  makes	 it  clear  that
     `the   cost   of	preventing   and
     eliminating   nuisances   must   in
     principle	 be    borne   by    the
     polluter', and  the  polluter  pays
     principle has now been incorporated
     into the  European Community Treaty
     as part  of the new Articles on the
     environment which	were  introduced
     by the Single European Act of 1986.
     <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_64">Article  130R(2)</a>	of  the	  Treaty
     states	 that	   environmental
     considerations are	 to play  a part
     in	 all   the   policies	of   the
     Community, and that action is to be
     based on three principles: the need
     for preventative  action; the  need
     for  environmental	  damage  to  be
     rectified at  source; and	that the
     polluter should pay."</blockquote>

     Polluter Pay?" By Carolyn Shelbourn
</p><p id="p_102">     -	 Journal    of	 Planning    and
     Environmental Law, Aug.1974 issue.]
Thus, according	 to this  principle, the  responsibility for
repairing the  damage is  that of  the	offending  industry.
<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_65">Sections 3</a>  and <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_66">5</a>  empower the	Central Government  to	give
directions and	take measures  for  giving  effect  to	this
principle. In all the circumstances of the case, we think it
appropriate that the task of determining the amount required
for   carrying	  out	 the	remedial    measures,	 its
recovery/realisation  and   the	 task	of  undertaking	 the
remedial measures  is placed  upon the Central Government in
the light  of the provisions of the Environment [Protection]
Act, 1986.  It is, of course, open to the Central Government
to  take  the  help  and  assistance  of  State	 Government,
R.P.C.B. or  such other	 agency or  authority, as they think
fit.
</p><p id="p_103">     The next  question is  what is  the amount required for
carrying out  the necessary  remedial measures to repair the
damage and to restore the water and soil to the condition it
was in	before the  respondents commenced  their operations.
The Report  of NEERI  has worked  out the  cost at wore than
Rupees forty  crores.  The  estimate  of  cost	of  remedial
measures is,  however, not  a technical	 matter	 within	 the
expertise of  NEERI officials.	Moreover, the  estimate	 was
made in	 the year 1994. Two years have passed by since then.
Situation, if  at all,	must have  deteriorated	 further  on
account of  the presence  of - and dispersal of the sludge -
in and	around the  complex of the respondents by them. They
have been discharging other toxic effluents from their other
plants, as reported by NEERI and the central team. It is but
appropriate  that  an  estimate	 of  the  cost	of  remedial
measures be  made now  with notice to the respondents, which
amount should be paid to Central Government and/or recovered
from them  by the  Central Government.	Other directions are
also called  for in the light of the facts and circumstances
mentioned above.
</p><p id="p_104">CONCLUSIONS:
</p><p id="p_105">     From the  affidavits of  the parties,  Orders  of	this
Court, technical  Reports and  other data, referred to above
[even keeping  aside the latest Report of the R.P.C.B.], the
following facts emerge:
</p><p id="p_106">(I)  Silver Chemicals  [R-5] and  Jyoti Chemicals  [R-8] had
manufactured about 375 MT of `H' acid during the years 1988-
</p><p id="p_107">89. This  had given rise to about 8250 m3 of waste water and
2440 tones of sludge [both iron-based and gypsum-based]. The
waste water  had partly	 percolated into  the earth  in	 and
around Bichhri	and part  of it	 had flowed out. Out of 2440
tones of sludge, about 720 tones has been stored in the pits
provided by  the respondents.  The remaining sludge is still
there  either	within	the  area  of  the  complex  of	 the
respondents or outside their complex. With a view to conceal
it  from   the	eyes  of  the  inspection  teams  and  other
authorities, the  respondents have dispersed it all over the
area and  covered it  with earth. In some places, the sludge
is lying  in mounds.  The  story  of  entombing	 the  entire
quantity of sludge is untrue.
</p><p id="p_108">     The units	manufacturing `H'  acid - indeed most of the
units of  the respondents  - had  started functioning, i.e.,
started manufacturing  various chemicals  without  obtaining
requisite clearances/consents/licences.	 They did not instal
any  equipment	for  treatment	of  highly  toxic  effluents
discharged by  them. They  continued to	 function even after
and inspite  of the  closure orders of the R.P.C.B. They did
never carry  out the  Orders of	 this  Court  fully,  [e.g.,
entombing the  sludge] nor  did they  fulfil the undertaking
given by  them to  the Court  [in the  matter of  removal of
sludge and  de-watering of  the wells].	 Inspite of repeated
Reports of  officials and  expert bodies,  they persisted in
their illegal  course of  action in  a brazen  manner, which
exhibits their	contempt for law, for the lawful authorities
and the Courts.
</p><p id="p_109">(II) That even	after the  closure of  `H' acid	 plant,	 the
fourth	respondent  had	 not  taken  adequate  measures	 for
treating the  highly toxic  waste  water  and  other  wastes
emanating from	the  Sulphuric	Acid  Plant.  The  untreated
highly toxic waste water was found - by NEERI as well as the
Central team  - flowing	 through the  dumps  of	 iron/gypsum
sludge creating	 a highly  potent mix.	The  letter  of	 the
fourth respondent  dated January  13, 1996,  shows that	 the
Sulphuric Acid	Plant was working till November 10, 1995. An
assertion is  made before  us that permanent E.T.P. has also
been constructed for the Sulphuric Acid Plant in addition to
the temporary tank which was constructed under the Orders of
this Court.  We express	 no opinion on this assertion, which
even if	 true, is  valid only  for the	period subsequent to
April, 1994.
</p><p id="p_110">(III)	  The damage  caused by	 the untreated	highly toxic
wastes resulting  from the  production of `H' acid - and the
continued  discharge  of  highly  toxic	 effluent  from	 the
Sulphuric Acid	Plant, flowing	through the  sludge  [H-acid
waste] -  is undescribable.  It has  inflicted untold misery
upon the  villagers and	 long lasting damage to the soil, to
the underground water and to the environment of that area in
general. The Report of NEERI contains a sketch, at Page 178,
showing the  area that	has been  adversely affected  by the
production of `H' acid by the respondents. The area has been
divided into  three zones  on the  basis of  the  extent  of
contamination. A  total area  of 350 he has become seriously
contaminated. The water in the wells in that area is not fit
for consumption	 either by  human beings  or cattle.  It has
seriously affected  the productivity  of the land. According
to  NEERI  Report,  Rupees  forty  crores  is  required	 for
repairing the  damage caused  to men,  land, water  and	 the
flora.
</p><p id="p_111">(IV) This Court has repeatedly found and has recorded in its
Orders that  it is  respondents who  have  caused  the	said
damage.	 The  analysis	Reports	 obtained  pursuant  to	 the
directions of the Court clearly establish that the pollution
of the	wells is  on account  of the  wastes  discharged  by
Respondents Nos.4  to 8,  i.e., production  of `H' acid. The
Report of the environment experts dated November 1, 1993 has
already	 been  referred	 to  hereinbefore.  Indeed,  several
orders of  this Court  referred to supra are also based upon
the said finding.

has been defined in very wide and expansive terms in <a href="/doc/142996678/" id="a_70">Section
2(a)</a>  of   the	Environment  [Protection]  Act.	 This  power
includes  the  power  to  prohibit  an	activity,  close  an
industry, direct  and/or carry	out remedial  measures,	 and
wherever necessary impose the cost of remedial measures upon
the offending  industry. The  principle "Polluter  Pays" has
gained almost  universal recognition,  apart from  the	fact
that it	 is stated in absolute terms in Oleum Gas Leak Case.
The law	 declared in  the said decision is the law governing
this case.
</p><p id="p_113">DIRECTIONS:
</p><p id="p_114">     Accordingly, the following directions are made:
</p><p id="p_115">1.   The  Central  Government  shall  determine	 the  amount
required for  carrying out  the remedial  measures including
the removal  of sludge	lying in  and around  the complex of
Respondents 4  to 8, in the area affected in village Bichhri
and other adjacent villages, on account of the production of
`H' acid and the discharges from the Sulphuric Acid Plant of
Respondents 4  to 8.  Chapters-VI and  VII in  NEERI  Report
[submitted in  1994] shall  be deemed  to be  the show-cause
notice	issued	by  the	 Central  Government  proposing	 the
determination of the said amount. Within six weeks from this
day, Respondents  4 to	8 shall	 submit	 their	explanation,
along with  such  material  as	they  think  appropriate  in
support	 of  their  case,  to  the  Secretary,	Ministry  of
Environment and	 Forests, Government of India, [M.E.F.]. The
Secretary  shall   thereupon   determine   the	 amount	  in
consultation with  the experts	of his	Ministry within	 six
weeks of  the submission  of the  explanation  by  the	said
Respondents. The  orders passed	 by the	 Secretary, [M.E.F.]
shall be  communicated to  Respondents 4  to  8	 -  and	 all
concerned -  and shall	also be	 placed before	this  Court.
Subject to  the Orders,	 if any,  passed by  this Court, the
said amount  shall represent  the amount which Respondents 4
to  8	are  liable  to	 pay  to  improve  and	restore	 the
environment  in	  the  area.   For  the	  purpose  of  these
proceedings, the  Secretary, [M.E.F.] and Respondents 4 to 8
shall proceed  on the  assumption that	the affected area is
350 ha,	 as indicated  in the  sketch at  Page 178  of NEERI
Report. In  case of  failure of	 the said respondents to pay
the said  amount, the same shall be recovered by the Central
Government in  accordance with	law. The  factories,  plant,
machinery and all other lmmovable assets of Respondents 4 to
8 are  attached	 herewith.  The	 amount	 so  determined	 and
recovered shall	 be utilised  by the M.E.F. for carrying out
all necessary  remedial measures  to restore the soil, water
sources and  the environment in general of the affected area
to its former state.
</p><p id="p_116">2.   On account of their continuous, persistent and insolent
violations of  law, their  attempts to	conceal the  sludge,
their discharge	 of toxic  effluents from the Sulphuric Acid
Plant which  was allowed  to flow  through the	sludge,	 and
their non-implementation  of the  Orders of this Court - all
of which  are fully  borne out	by  the	 expert	 committees'
Reports and  the findings recorded hereinabove - Respondents
4  to  8  have	earned	the  dubious  distinction  of  being
characterised as  "rogue industries".  They  have  inflicted
untold	misery	 upon  the   poor,  unsuspecting  villagers,
despoiling their  land, their water sources and their entire
environment - all in pursuance of their private profit. They
have forfeited	all claims  for any  consideration  by	this
Court. Accordingly, we herewith order the closure of all the
plants and  factories of  Respondents  4  to  8	 located  in
Bichhri village.  The R.P.C.B.	is directed  to seal all the
factories/units/plants of the said respondents forthwith. So
far as	the Sulphuric  Acid Plant  is concerned,  it will be
closed at  the end  of one  week from  today,  within  which
period Respondent  No.4 shall wind down its operations so as
to avoid  risk of  any untoward consequences, as asserted by
Respondent No.4	 in Writ  Petition (C)	No.76 of 1994. It is
the responsibility  of Respondent  No.4	 to  take  necessary
steps in  this behalf. The R.P.C.B. shall seal this unit too
at the	end of	one week from today. The re-opening of these
plants	shall	depend	upon   their  compliance   with	 the
directions made	 and obtaining	of all requisite permissions
and consents from the relevant authorities. Respondents 4 to
8 can  apply  for  directions  in  this	 behalf	 after	such
compliance.
</p><p id="p_117">3.   So far  as the  claim for damages for the loss suffered
by the	villagers in  the affected  area is concerned, it is
open  to  them	or  any	 organization  on  their  behalf  to
institute suits in the appropriate civil court. If they file
the suit or suits in forma pauperize, the State of Rajasthan
shall not  oppose their	 applications for  leave to  sue  in
forma pauperize.
</p><p id="p_118">4.   The Central  Government shall consider whether it would
not be	appropriate, in	 the light of the experience gained,
that chemical  industries are  treated as  a category apart.
Since the  chemical industries	are the main culprits in the
matter of polluting the environment, there is every need for
scrutinizing  their   establishment  and   functioning	more
rigorously. No	distinction should be made in this behalf as
between a large-scale industry and a small-scale industry or
for that matter between a large-scale industry and a medium-
scale industry.	 All chemical  industries,  whether  big  or
small, should be allowed to be established only after taking
into considerations  all the environmental aspects and their
functioning should  be monitored closely to ensure that they
do not	pollute the environment around them. It appears that
most of	 these industries are water-intensive industries. If
so, the	 advisability of allowing the establishment of these
industries in  arid areas may also require examination. Even
the existing  chemical industries may be subjected to such a
study and  if it  is found  on	such  scrutiny	that  it  is
necessary to take any steps in the interests of environment,
appropriate directions	in that	 behalf may  be issued under
<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_71">Sections 3</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_72">5</a>  of	the  Environment  Act.	The  Central
Government shall  ensure that the directions given by it are
implemented forthwith.
</p><p id="p_119">5.   The Central  Government and  the  R.P.C.B.	 shall	file
quarterly Reports  before this	Court with  respect  to	 the
progress  in   the  implementation  of	Directions  1  to  4
aforesaid.
</p><p id="p_120">6.   The suggestion  for establishment of environment courts
is  a	commendable  one.  The	experience  shows  that	 the
prosecutions launched  in ordinary criminal courts under the
provisions of  the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_73">Water  Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_74">Air  Act</a> and  <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_75">Environment Act</a>
never reach their conclusion either because of the work-load
in those  courts or  because there is no proper appreciation
of the	significance of	 the environment matters on the part
of those  in charge  of conducting of those cases. Moreover,
any orders  passed by  the authorities	under Water  and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_76">Air
Act</a>s and  the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_77">Environment  Act</a> are immediately questioned by
the industries	in courts.  Those proceedings take years and
years to  reach conclusion.  Very often,  interim orders are
granted meanwhile  which effectively disable the authorities
from ensuring  the implementation  of their orders. All this
points to  the need  for creating  environment courts  which
alone should  be empowered  to deal  with all matters, civil
and criminal,  relating to  environment. These courts should
be manned  by legally  trained persons/judicial officers and
should be  allowed to  adopt summary procedures. This issue,
no doubt,  requires to	be studied and examined indepth from
all angles before taking any action.
</p><p id="p_121">7.   The  Central   Government	 may   also   consider	 the
advisability of	 strengthening	the  environment  protection
machinery both at the Center and the States and provide them
more teeth.  The heads	of several units and agencies should
be  made   personally  accountable  for	 any  lapses  and/or
negligence on the part of their units and agencies. The idea
of an  environmental audit by specialist bodies created on a
permanent basis	 with  power  to  inspect,  check  and	take
necessary action not only against erring industries but also
against erring	officers may  be considered.  The idea of an
environmental audit  conducted	periodically  and  certified
annually, by  specialists in the field, duly recognised, can
also be	 considered. The  ultimate idea	 is to integrate and
balance the  concern  for  environment	with  the  need	 for
industrialisation and technological progress.
</p><p id="p_122">     Respondents 4  to 8  shall pay  a sum  of Rupees  fifty
thousand by  way of  costs to  the petitioner  which had  to
fight this  litigation over  a period of over six years with
its  own  means.  Voluntary  bodies,  like  the	 petitioner,
deserve encouragement wherever their actions are found to be
in furtherance	of public  interest. The  said sum  shall be
deposited in  this Court  within two  weeks from  today.  It
shall be paid over to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_123">     Writ Petition  (C) No.967	of 1989	 is allowed with the
above directions with costs as specified hereinabove.
