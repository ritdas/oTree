</p><p id="p_3">	Delay condoned in I.A. No. 443 in I.A. No. 431 in W.P. (C) No. 
13381/84.
</p><p id="p_4">	A purported vertical difference of opinion in the administrative 
hierarchy in CBI between the team of investigating officers and the law 
officers on one hand and Director of Prosecution on the other hand on the 
question as to whether there exists adequate evidence for judicial scrutiny in 
the case of criminal misconduct concerning Taj Heritage Corridor Project 
involving 12 accused including former Chief Minister has resulted in the 
legal stalemate which warrants interpretation of Section 173(2) Cr. PC.
BACKGROUND FACTS:
</p><p id="p_5">	On 25.3.2003, the Uttar Pradesh Government started a project known 
as Taj Heritage Corridor Project (hereinafter referred to as "the project") to 
divert the Yamuna and to reclaim 75 acres between Agra Fort and the Taj 
and use the reclaimed land for constructing food plazas, shops and 
amusement activities in terms of development of Heritage Corridor for Taj 
Trapezium Zone (hereinafter referred to as the "TTZ") at Agra. This led to 
the filing of an I.A. No. 387 in Civil Writ Petition No. 13381/84 pending in 
this Court. Vide Order dated 16.7.2003 this Court observed that, it was 
painful that the concerned persons in power are trying to damage or 
endanger the World Heritage by their hasty/ irregular/ illegal activities. By 
the said order, this Court directed a detailed inquiry as to who cleared the 
project, for what purpose it was cleared, and why it was cleared without the 
sanction of the competent authority. This Court also inquired as to whether 
their exists any illegality or irregularity and, if so, this Court called for the 
names of the concerned officers/ persons. Accordingly by the said order, a 
CBI inquiry was ordered. A report on the preliminary inquiry was called for 
from CBI within four weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	By Order dated 21.8.2003 in I.A. No. 376 in Writ Petition (C) No. 
13381/84 this Court ordered CBI to verify from the assets of  the  officers/ 
persons as to whether there was any flow of funds into their accounts from 
the state exchequer. This order was passed on the basis of the confidential 
report submitted by CBI to this Court under which it was reported that a sum 
of Rs. 17 crores were released from the state exchequer without proper 
sanction of the competent authority.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	By Order dated 18.9.2003 in I.A. No. 376 in Writ Petition (C) No. 
13381/84 this Court after reciting the above facts noted the contents of the 
report submitted by CBI on 11.9.2003, which report recorded the following 
conclusions:
</p><p id="p_8">"15. 	An amount of Rs. 17 crores was unauthorisedly 
released by Shri R.K. Sharma, Secretary, 
Environment, U.P. without the approval of the 
departmental Minister. (Ref. Para 3.1.E.4 page 64 
and para 3.1.E.31, page 81)	
</p><p id="p_9">16.   Contrary to the provisions existing in the State 
Government which require that in case of every 
non-recurring expenditure of Rs. 5 crores and 
above, approval of the Expenditure Finance 
Committee (EFC) of the State Government is 
required, no such approval was either sought or 
obtained before sanctioning the amount of Rs. 17 
crores (Ref. Para 3.1.E.11, page 67).
</p><p id="p_10">17.    An amount of Rs. 20 crores was sanctioned by Shri 
Naseemuddin Siddiqui, the then Minister of 
Environment, U.P. for release without approval of 
DPRs and techno-feasibility reports and without 
clearance of the Expenditure Finance Committee 
(EFC) of the State Government and CCEA, 
Government of India (Ref. Para 3.1.E.39, page 86).
</p><p id="p_11">18.    Shri Siddiqui subsequently tampered with the file 
and made interpolations in the Government records 
with an objective to cover up the fact that he had 
sanctioned Rs. 20 crores on 21/05/2003. (Ref. Para 
3.1.E.40 (1 and 2) page 87).
</p><p id="p_12">19.  Shri Siddiqui and Dr. V.K. Gupta, the present 
Secretary, Environment, U.P. pressurized Shri 
Rajendra, Prasad, Under Secretary, Environment 
Department, U.P. who also tampered with the file 
and made interpolations to cover the fact that the 
Minister had sanctioned Rs. 20 crores. (Ref. Para 
3.1.E.37, page 86).
</p><p id="p_13">20.   Shri K.C. Mishra, Secretary, Environment and 
Forest Government of India tampered with the file 
and made interpolations in Government records in 
order to cover up his omissions of not approving 
the proposals of his Joint Secretary and Special 
Secretary for writing to the State Government for a 
report and to ask them to carry out work only after 
necessary approvals and clearances. He obscured 
some portions of the notes dated 21/10/2002 and 
08/05/2003 of Dr. Saroj, Additional Director, 
Ministry of Environment and Forest so as to show 
that he was not a part of the decision making and 
had not shown his consent to the proposed project. 
</p><p id="p_14">(Ref. Para 3.1.E.42 page 89).
</p><p id="p_15">21.   Central Forensic Science Laboratory has given a 
report that interpolations were made in the files by 
Shri Naseemuddin Siddiqui, the then Minister, 
U.P., Shri Rajendra Prasad, Under Secretary, U.P. 
and Shri K.C. Misra, Secretary, Environment and 
Forests, Government of India (Ref. Para 3.1.G.21, 
pages 106-107 and 3.1.E.44 (5-6), page 90)."
</p><p id="p_16">	Accordingly, this Court inter alia directed CBI to register an  FIR and 
make further investigation in accordance with law. By the said order, CBI 
was also directed to take appropriate steps for holding investigations against 
the former Chief Minister, Ms. Mayawati, and Mr. Nasimuddin Siddiqui, 
former Minister for Environment, U.P.. CBI was also directed to make 
investigations against other officers mentioned hereinabove. By the said 
order the Income Tax department was also directed to cooperate with CBI in 
further investigation. By the said order, CBI was directed to take into 
consideration the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>, the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_2">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 
1988 and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	By order dated 19.7.2004 in I.A. No. 376 etc. in Writ Petition (C) No. 
13381/84 this Court directed CBI to furnish a self-contained note in respect 
of its findings against the officers of the State Government/ Central 
Government. CBI was given eight weeks time to complete the investigation 
in respect of FIR No. RC.18 and three months time was granted to complete 
the investigation in respect of FIR No. RC.19.
</p><p id="p_18">	By Order dated 25.10.2004 in I.A. No. 376 etc. in Writ Petition (C) 
No. 13381/84 this Court noted that two disciplinary enquiries were required 
to be instituted by the State Government against Shri Punia, former Principal 
Secretary to C.M., U.P.. This was because CBI had submitted two distinct 
notes. On 25.10.2004 the departmental enquiry on CBI note I stood 
completed. However, learned counsel appearing for the State of U.P. 
submitted that in the absence of CBI furnishing to the disciplinary authority 
the statement of the former Chief Minister, the second disciplinary 
proceeding could not be initiated by the State against Shri Punia. This aspect 
is important. The case of Shri Punia was that he had acted under oral 
instructions of the former Chief Minister. This was required to be enquired 
into by the departmental enquiry, therefore, the State requested CBI to 
furnish the statement of the former Chief Minister which CBI had collected 
during investigation under RC.18. At that stage, time was sought by the CBI 
on the ground that investigation into RC.18 was nearing completion and that 
CBI was awaiting legal scrutiny of the matter. Therefore, this Court 
adjourned the matter stating that the second disciplinary enquiry against Shri 
Punia arising out of CBI note II stands deferred until availability of the 
statement of the former Chief Minister of the State. That statement was 
ordered to be given to the State Government within three weeks. It was 
further ordered that, if within three weeks CBI failed to make available the 
said statement then the State Government will proceed with the initiation of 
disciplinary enquiry against Shri Punia on the basis of the material available. 
Accordingly, this Court adjourned the matter stating that after legal scrutiny 
the report shall be submitted before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	In the meantime, CBI submitted its report with detailed Annexures 
running into hundreds of pages.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	By order dated 14.3.2005 in I.A. No. 431 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 
13381/84, since the report of CBI was voluminous, this Court after going 
through the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1166317/" id="a_4">Central Vigilance Commission Act</a>, 2003 
(hereinafter referred to as the "CVC Act") directed the records relating to 
prosecution of twelve accused be placed before the Central Vigilance 
Commission (hereinafter referred to as the "CVC") for scrutiny and 
recommendation. CVC was added as a party. Basically this Court wanted 
CVC to analyse the Report of CBI and give to the Court the summary of 
recommendations of various officers in the administrative hierarchy of CBI 
as the Court was informed that there was divergence of opinion between 
them.
</p><p id="p_21">	To complete the chronology of orders passed by this Court, we may 
point out that the Director, CBI submitted his Status Report as on 
31.12.2004 to this Court in which he stated as follows:
"5.  	As regards investigation of RC0062003A0018, it 
is submitted that as there was difference of opinion 
between the officers of CBI in relation to the implication 
of individuals in the case, the matter was referred to the 
learned Attorney General of India through the Ministry 
of Law for obtaining his esteemed opinion in this case. 
The learned Attorney General has since given his 
considered opinion that in absence of any evidence to 
suggest criminal mens rea on the part of any individual 
and due to lack of evidence of any pecuniary benefit to 
any of the officers or any other person, the proper course 
of action would be to take disciplinary action against the 
officers for their omission and misconduct. I have gone 
through the report of investigation, comments of various 
officers including the opinion of the Learned Attorney 
General and I am of the opinion that the evidence is not 
sufficient to launch prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_22">6.	As disciplinary action has already been initiated by 
the authorities concerned on the direction of Hon'ble 
Supreme Court, action will be taken by filing a closure 
report under section 173 Cr. PC in the competent court 
incorporating all the facts/ circumstances revealed during 
the course of investigation."
</p> 
<p id="p_23">CONTENTIONS:
</p><p id="p_24">Shri Krishan Mahajan, learned amicus curiae would submit that in the 
instant case, at the present stage, the question is of investigation and not of 
prosecution. Under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure (Cr. PC), investigation 
consists of :  site inspection, ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of 
the case, discovery and arrest of the suspected offender, collection of 
evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of the 
examination of various persons, the search and seizure and, lastly, formation 
of opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the 
accused before a Magistrate for trial, and if so, taking the necessary steps for 
the same by the filing of a charge-sheet under Section 173 Cr. PC.  Learned 
counsel submitted that the final step in the investigation, namely, formation 
of the opinion is to be of the officer in charge of the police station. This 
authority cannot be delegated although a provision entitling superior officers 
to supervise or participate is there under Sections 158 and 173(3) Cr. PC. 
Learned Counsel urged that the officer in charge of the police station or the 
investigating officer is the sole person who has to form the opinion under 
Section 173 Cr. PC and file the police report. In this connection, learned 
counsel pointed out that in this case Shri D.C. Dwivedi, Deputy 
Superintendent of Police, CBI, Anti Corruption Bureau, Lucknow was the 
I.O.. He had filed the F.I.R. with thirteen sheets attached to it, registering a 
regular case after series of preliminary reports submitted to this Court in I.A. 
Nos. 376/03 and 431/05 filed by the amicus curiae. This case was assigned 
to the I.O. by Shri K. N. Tiwari, Superintendent of Police, CBI, Anti 
Corruption Bureau, Lucknow. According to the learned counsel, the 
functions of the magistracy and the police are entirely different and though 
in the circumstances of a given case the Magistrate may or may not accept 
the report, he cannot infringe upon the jurisdiction of the police by 
compelling the police to change its opinion. Learned counsel submits that a 
field of activity reserved for the police and the executive has been expressly 
carved out under the Cr. PC.
</p>
<p id="p_25">Learned counsel further submitted that, the I.O. works under the entire 
CBI hierarchy; that the S.P. works under his supervisory officer of DIG rank 
in terms of the CBI (Crime) Manual-2005 (hereinafter referred to as the 
"Manual"). But this entire administrative structure of the CBI has to function 
according to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.PC</a> in the matter of investigation, in the 
matter of filing the charge-sheet/ final report under <a href="/doc/1166317/" id="a_7">Section 173(2)</a> and the  
superior officers of CBI cannot substitute the opinion of the S.P. if that 
opinion states that a case on the material gathered during the investigation 
has been made out. Similarly, if the S.P. opines on the basis of the material 
collected that no case is made out, such an opinion cannot be substituted by 
the higher hierarchy of the officers in CBI. In this connection, it is pointed 
out that, in the present case, the FIR registered is for offences under <a href="/doc/1166317/" id="a_8">Section 
120B</a> r/w <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_9">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_10">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_11">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_12">471</a> IPC as also under <a href="/doc/1167128/" id="a_13">Section 13(2)</a> r/w 
<a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_14">Section 13(i)(d)</a> of the P.C. Act, 1988. It was urged that there are no separate 
provisions in the <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_15">Delhi Special Police Establishment Act</a>, 1946 or the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_16">P.C. 
Act</a>, 1988 as to the manner or the steps to be taken in the investigation of 
such offences and, therefore, though the investigation is conducted by the 
CBI, the provisions under Chapter XII of the Cr. PC would equally apply to 
such investigation. Learned counsel submitted that the position of the entire 
hierarchy of CBI in the matter of filing of police report by the S.P. and 
formation of the opinion by the S.P. on the basis of the evidence collected 
during the investigation is to be seen in the context of fair and impartial 
investigation. He is the Officer-in-charge of the police station. Learned 
counsel, therefore, submitted that in a Supreme Court monitored 
investigation the S.P. has to file his report before the Supreme Court only 
and not before the entire hierarchy of CBI whose only role is to supervise  
investigation. This hierarchy of CBI, according to the learned counsel, 
cannot make the S.P. to change his opinion. They cannot substitute the 
opinion of the S.P. with their own opinion. Learned counsel further contend 
that, in a Supreme Court monitored investigation even where the report of 
the S.P. is a closure report and the Director, CBI and Attorney General agree 
with the opinion of the S. P., still it is the duty of the CBI to place the entire 
material before the Supreme Court and it is for the Court to examine and be 
satisfied that the authorities have reasonably come to such conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_26">It was next urged that the Director of Prosecution in the CBI has no 
role to play at the stage of investigation which includes formation of an 
opinion by the S.P.
</p>
<p id="p_27">Shri Rao, learned senior counsel on behalf of the CVC submitted that 
pursuant to the directions of the Supreme Court dated 14.3.2005 CVC had 
examined the records of CBI made available to it. The CVC had also called 
for further information from CBI. After vetting the entire record, CVC had 
submitted its report to this Court on 9.5.2005. Learned counsel submitted 
that under Section 8(1)(a) of the CVC Act, the CVC is empowered to 
exercise superintendence over the functioning of CBI insofar as it relates to 
the investigation of offences alleged to have been committed under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_17">P.C. 
Act</a>, 1988 and, therefore, when the CBI investigates under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_18">P.C. Act</a>, 
1988  against public servants serving in connection with affairs of a State 
Government, such investigation is subject to the superintendence of  CVC. 
This submission was made on behalf of CVC because it was argued on 
behalf of some of the accused that CVC had no power of superintendence of 
cases involving public servants employed in connection with affairs of the 
State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_28">Learned counsel for CVC submitted that in order to fulfill the 
responsibility of exercising superintendence over the functioning of CBI 
insofar as it relates to investigations of offences under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_19">P.C. Act</a>, 1988, 
the CVC is entitled to scrutinize investigation reports of the CBI at any stage 
before filing of charge-sheets/ closure reports. For this purpose, CVC is 
empowered to issue suitable advice in cases under investigation. Such 
advice, according to the learned counsel, is in the nature of an opinion, and 
not a binding direction.
</p>
<p id="p_29">On the facts of the case, learned counsel for CVC urged that, in the 
present case the preliminary inquiry as well as the investigation were 
conducted by the CBI against the former Chief Minister, officers of the State 
Government and others under the direction of this Court. It was the Supreme 
Court which had referred the matter to CVC and, therefore, the CVC was 
bound to submit its report. In the circumstances, learned counsel submitted 
that, it cannot be said that the report of the CVC is vitiated by any illegality 
or irregularity since the Supreme Court has absolute power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_20">Article 
142</a> of the Constitution to pass any order as is necessary for doing complete 
justice in any cause or matter pending before it.
</p>
<p id="p_30">Shri Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 
former Chief Minister submitted that this Court should be loathe to interfere 
in investigation since it is a field of activity reserved for the police and the 
executive. He submitted that, in the present case, we are still at the stage of 
investigation and unless an extraordinary case of gross abuse of power is 
made out, no interference is called for under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_21">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. 
Learned counsel further submitted that, in the present case, CVC had no role 
to play, particularly since the case pertains to conduct of the officers who are 
the employees of the State Government. Learned counsel submitted that 
public servants serving in connection with affairs of the State Government 
fell outside the powers of CVC. Learned counsel submitted that, in any 
event, CVC had no power to direct the manner in which CBI will conclude 
the proceedings. Learned counsel submitted that the opinion as to whether 
the case is made out for judicial scrutiny or not has to be the decision of CBI 
and unless there is gross abuse of power this Court should not intervene in 
the field of investigation under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_22">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. Learned 
counsel urged that, in the present case, there is no such gross abuse of power 
made out, and, therefore, this Court should not interfere under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_23">Article 32</a> of 
the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_31">ISSUE:
</p><p id="p_32">	The key issue which arises for determination in this case is: whether 
on the facts and the circumstance of this case, the Director, CBI, who has not 
given his own independent opinion, was right in referring the matter for 
opinion to the Attorney General of India, particularly when the entire 
investigation and law officers' team was ad idem in its opinion on filing of 
the charge-sheet and only on the dissenting opinion of the Director of 
Prosecution, whose opinion is also based on the interpretation of the legal 
evidence, which stage has not even arrived. The opinion of the Director, CBI 
is based solely on the opinion of the Attorney General after the reference.
</p>
<p id="p_33">CASE LAW ON THE POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE 
HIERARCHY IN CBI IN SUPREME COURT MONITORED CASES:
</p>

<p id="p_34">	In the case of  <a href="/doc/1361495/" id="a_24">H.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh  v.  The State of 
Delhi</a>  this Court held that<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure provides not 
merely for judicial enquiry into or trial of alleged offences but also for prior 
investigation thereof. <a href="/doc/1227639/" id="a_26">Section 5</a> of the Code shows that all offences shall be 
investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with in accordance with<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27"> 
the Code</a>. When information of the commission of cognizable offence is 
received, the appropriate police officer has the authority to enter on the 
investigation of the same. Thus, investigation is a normal preliminary for an 
accused being put up for trial for a cognizable offence. Investigation usually 
starts on information relating to the commission of an offence given to an 
officer in charge of a police station and recorded under <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_28">Section 154</a> of the 
Code. If from information so received or otherwise, the officer in charge of 
the police station has reason to suspect the commission of an offence, he or 
his subordinate has to proceed to the spot to investigate the facts and 
circumstances of the case, and if necessary to take measures for the 
discovery and arrest of the offender. Under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_29">Section 155</a> the officer in charge 
of a police station has the power of making a search in any place for the 
seizure of anything believed to be necessary for the purpose of investigation. 
A subordinate officer may be deputed by him for that purpose.  The 
investigating officer has also the power to arrest the person under <a href="/doc/1764008/" id="a_30">Section 54</a> 
of the Code. It is important to notice that where the investigation is 
conducted not by the officer in charge of the police station but by a 
subordinate officer such subordinate officer has to report the result of the 
investigation to the officer in charge of the police station. If, upon the 
completion of the investigation it appears to the officer in charge of the 
police station that there is no sufficient evidence, he may decide to release 
the suspected accused. If, it appears to him that there is sufficient evidence 
or reasonable ground to place the accused on trial, he has to take necessary 
steps under <a href="/doc/159157/" id="a_31">Section 170</a> of the Code. In either case, on completion of the 
investigation he has to submit a report to the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1187622/" id="a_32">Section 173</a> 
of the Code in the prescribed form. Thus, under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33"> the Code</a>, investigation 
consists of proceeding to the spot, ascertainment of the facts and 
circumstances of the case, discovery  and arrest of the suspected offender, 
collection of evidence and formation of the opinion as to whether on the 
material collected there is a case to place the accused before a Magistrate for 
trial, and if so, taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a 
charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_34">Section 173</a>. The scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_35"> of the Code</a> shows that while it 
is permissible for an officer in charge of a police station to depute some 
subordinate officer to conduct some of these steps in the investigation, the 
responsibility for each one of the above steps is that of the officer in charge 
of the police station (see <a href="/doc/9353/" id="a_36">Section 168</a> of the Code). This Court had 
categorically stated in the above judgment that, the final step in the 
investigation, namely, the formation of the opinion as to whether or not there 
is a case to place the accused on trial is to be of the officer in charge of the 
police station and this function cannot be delegated. This Court 
unequivocally observed that, there is no provision for delegation of the 
above function regarding formation of the opinion but only a provision 
entitling the superior officers to supervise or participate under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_37">Section 551</a> 
(corresponding to <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_38">Section 36</a> of the present Code). This Court further held 
that, a police report which results from an investigation as provided for in 
<a href="/doc/276703/" id="a_39">Section 190</a> of the Code is the material on which cognizance is taken. But 
from that it cannot be said that a valid and legal police report is the 
foundation of the jurisdiction of the court to take cognizance. 
</p>
<p id="p_35">	In the case of <a href="/doc/49832/" id="a_40">Abhinandan Jha &amp; Ors.   v.  Dinesh Mishra</a>   this 
Court held that when a cognizable offence is reported to the police they may 
after investigation take action under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_41">Section 169</a> or Section 170 Cr. PC. If 
the police thinks that there is no sufficient evidence against the accused, they 
may, under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_42">Section 169</a> release the accused from custody or, if the police 
thinks that there is sufficient evidence, they may, under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_43">Section 170</a>, forward 
the accused to a competent Magistrate. In either case the police has to 
submit a report of the action taken, under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_44">Section 173</a>, to the competent 
Magistrate who considers it judicially under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_45">Section 190</a> and takes the 
following action:
</p><p id="p_36">(a)	If the report is a charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_46">Section 170</a>, it is 
open to the Magistrate to agree with it and take 
cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_47">Section 190(1)(b)</a>; or 
decline to take cognizance. But he cannot call upon 
the police to submit a report that the accused need 
not be proceeded against on the ground that there was 
no sufficient evidence.
</p><p id="p_37">(b)	If the report is of the action taken under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_48">Section 169</a>, 
then the Magistrate may agree with the report and 
close the proceedings. If he disagrees with the report, 
he can give directions to the police under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_49">Section 
156(3)</a> to make a further investigation. If the police, 
after further investigation submits a charge-sheet, the 
Magistrate may follow the procedure where the 
charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_50">Section 170</a> is filed; but if the 
police are still of the opinion that there was no 
sufficient evidence against the accused, the 
Magistrate may or may not agree with it. Where he 
agrees, the case against the accused is closed. Where 
he disagrees and forms an opinion that the facts 
mentioned in the report constitute an offence, he can 
take cognizance under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_51">Section 190(1)(c)</a>. But the 
Magistrate cannot direct the police to submit a 
charge-sheet, because the submission of the report 
depends entirely upon the opinion formed by the 
police and not on the opinion of the Magistrate. If the 
Magistrate disagrees with the report of the police he 
can take cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_52">Section 
190(1)(a)</a> or (c), but, he cannot compel the police to 
form a particular opinion on investigation and submit 
a report according to such opinion.
</p>
<p id="p_38">This judgment shows the importance of the opinion to be formed by the 
officer in charge of the police station. The opinion of the officer in charge of 
the police station is the basis of the report. Even a competent Magistrate 
cannot compel the concerned police officer to form a particular opinion. The 
formation of the opinion of the police on the material collected during the 
investigation as to whether judicial scrutiny is warranted or not is entirely 
left to the officer in charge of the police station. There is no provision in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_53"> the 
Code</a> empowering a Magistrate to compel the police to form a particular 
opinion. This Court observed that, although the Magistrate may have certain 
supervisory powers under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_54"> the Code</a>, it cannot be said that when the police 
submits a report that no case has been made out for sending the accused for 
trial, it is open to the Magistrate to direct the police to file a charge-sheet. 
The formation of the said opinion, by the officer in charge of the police 
station, has been held to be a final step in the investigation, and that final 
step has to be taken only by the officer in charge of the police station and by 
no other authority.
</p>
<p id="p_39">	In the case of <a href="/doc/1604039/" id="a_55">Union of India and Ors. v.  Sushil Kumar Modi and 
Ors</a>.  investigation was entrusted to CBI in the fodder scam case by the 
High Court to ensure proper and honest performance of duty by CBI. This 
Court directed CBI officers to inform the Chief Justice of the Patna High 
Court about the progress of the investigation and to obtain his directions if 
so required for conducting the investigation. The Joint Director of CBI 
submitted his report on the investigation carried out by him to the Chief 
Justice of the High Court. The High Court found that the Director was trying 
to interfere with the investigation and, therefore, the High Court directed that 
all reports of the CBI officers shall be submitted directly to the court without 
being forwarded to the Director, CBI. This order of the High Court was 
challenged. It was held that the Director, CBI was responsible and 
accountable for the proper investigation of the case and, therefore, he cannot 
be excluded from the investigation. It was, however, observed that the 
Director, CBI was duty-bound to make a fair, honest and complete 
investigation and officers associated with the investigation have to function 
as members of a cohesive team engaged in common pursuit of such an 
investigation so as to uphold the majesty of the law and preserve the rule of 
law. It was held that, in case of any difference of opinion between officers of 
CBI in respect of the investigation, final decision would not be taken by the 
Director himself or by the Director merely on the opinion of Legal 
Department of the CBI, but the matter would be decided according to the 
opinion of the Attorney General of India for the purpose of investigation and 
filing of the charge-sheet against any such individual. In that event, the 
opinion would be sought from the Attorney General after making available 
to him of the opinions expressed on the subject by the persons associated 
with the investigation as a part of the materials. We quote hereinbelow paras 
13 and 14 of the said judgment:
</p><p id="p_40">"13. We make it clear that in case of any difference of 
opinion between the officers of the CBI in relation to the 
implication of any individual in the crimes or any other 
matter relating to the investigation, the final decision in 
the matter would not be taken by the Director, CBI, 
himself or by him merely on the opinion of the Legal 
Department of the CBI; and in such a situation, the 
matter would be determined according to the opinion of 
the Attorney General of India for the purpose of the 
investigation and filing of the charge-sheet against any 
such individual. In that event, the opinion would be 
sought from the Attorney General after making available 
to him all the opinions expressed on the subject by the 
persons associated with the investigation as a part of the 
materials.
</p>
<p id="p_41">14.  It appears necessary to add that the Court, in this 
proceeding, is concerned with ensuring proper and honest 
performance of its duty by the CBI and not the merits of 
the accusations being investigated, which are to be 
determined at the trial on the filing of the charge-sheet in 
the competent court, according to the ordinary procedure 
prescribed by law. Care must, therefore, be taken by the 
High Court to avoid making any observation which may 
be construed as the expression of its opinion on merits 
relating to the accusation against any individual. Any 
such observation made on the merits of the accusation so 
far by the High Court, including those in Para 8 of the 
impugned order are not to be treated as final, or having 
the approval of this Court. Such observations should not, 
in any manner influence the decision on merits at the trial 
on the filing of the charge-sheet. The directions given by 
this Court in its aforesaid order dated 19.3.1996 have to 
be understood in this manner by all concerned, including 
the High Court."
</p>
<p id="p_42">	This position was clarified in the case of <a href="/doc/1604039/" id="a_56">Union of India and Ors.  v.  
Sushil Kumar Modi and Ors</a>. . It was observed that the nature of the PIL 
proceedings before the Patna High Court in the fodder scam case was 
somewhat similar to the proceedings in Vineet Narain's  case. It was 
observed by this Court that, the performance of the PIL proceedings is 
essentially to ensure performance of statutory duty by the CBI. The duty of 
the court in such proceedings is to ensure that CBI and other government 
agencies do their duty in conformity with law. According to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_57"> the Code</a>, the 
formation of the opinion as to whether or not there is a case to place the 
accused for trial is that of the police officer making the investigation and the 
final step in the investigation is to be taken only by the police and by no 
other authority. It was observed that, in order to ensure compliance of this 
aspect<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_58"> of the Code</a>, the directions were issued from time to time to CBI that 
in case of difference of opinion at any stage during the investigation, the 
final decision shall be of the Attorney General on reference being made to 
him on the difference of opinion between the officers concerned. This Court 
further observed in that case that the High Court was only required to ensure 
that the Director, CBI did not close any investigation based only upon his 
individual opinion, if there be any difference of opinion between the 
Director, CBI and the other officers concerned in the CBI.
</p>
<p id="p_43">	<a href="/doc/1203995/" id="a_59">In Vineet Narain and Ors.  v.  Union of India and Anr</a>.  certain 
measures by way of checks and balances were recommended by this Court 
to insulate CBI from extraneous influence of any kind. It was observed that, 
unless a proper investigation is made followed by a proper prosecution the 
rule of law will lose significance. Accordingly, directions were issued till 
such time as the legislature steps in by way of proper legislation. One of the 
points which arose for determination in that case was the significance of the 
word "superintendence" in <a href="/doc/678485/" id="a_60">Section 4</a> of the Delhi Special Police 
Establishment Act, 1946. It was held that the overall superintendence of  
CBI vests in the Central Government and, therefore, by virtue of <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_61">Section 3</a> 
of that Act the power vested in the Central Government to specify the 
offences or classes of offences which are to be investigated by CBI. But 
once that jurisdiction is attracted by virtue of the notification under           
<a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_62">Section 3</a>, the actual investigation is to be governed by the statutory 
provisions under the general law applicable to such investigation and the 
power of the investigator cannot be curtailed by the executive instructions 
issued under <a href="/doc/731949/" id="a_63">Section 4</a> by the Central Government. The general 
superintendence over the functioning of the Directorate/ department and 
specification of the offences to be investigated by CBI is not the same thing, 
therefore, the Central Government is precluded from controlling the 
initiation and the actual process of investigation. It was held that, the word 
"superintendence" in <a href="/doc/180243/" id="a_64">Section 4(1)</a> cannot be construed in a wider sense to 
permit supervision of the actual investigation of an offence by CBI. 
Therefore, the Central Government was precluded from issuing any 
direction to CBI to curtail or inhibit its jurisdiction to investigate an offence 
specified in the notification issued under <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_65">Section 3</a> by a directive under 
<a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_66">Section 4(1)</a> of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. The 
constitution of the CVC flowed from the judgment of this Court in Vineet 
Narain6 (supra). It is in this judgment that a direction was given to the 
Central Government by this Court for granting statutory status to the CVC. 
</p>
<p id="p_44">	In the case of <a href="/doc/7210086/" id="a_67">Union of India  v.    Prakash P. Hinduja</a> and anr.  
this Court has held that the provision contained in Chapter XII <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_68">Cr.PC</a> shows 
that detailed and elaborate provisions have been made for securing an 
investigation into an offence of which information has been given. The 
manner and the method of conducting the investigation are left entirely to 
the officer in charge of the police station. A Magistrate has no power to 
interfere with the same. The formation of the opinion whether there is 
sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify the 
forwarding of the case to a Magistrate or not, as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_69">Sections 
169</a> and <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_70">170</a>, is to be that of the officer in charge of the police station and a 
Magistrate has absolutely no role to play at this stage. Similarly, after 
completion of the investigation while making a report to the Magistrate 
under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_71">Section 173</a>, the requisite details have to be submitted by the officer in 
charge of the police station without any kind of interference or direction of a 
Magistrate and this will include an opinion regarding the fact whether any 
offence appears to have been committed and, if so, by whom, as provided by 
clause (d) of sub-section (2)(i) of Section 173 Cr. PC. These provisions are 
applicable even in cases under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_72">P.C. Act</a>, 1988 vide <a href="/doc/889478/" id="a_73">Section 22</a> thereof. 
The Magistrate is not bound to accept the final report submitted by the 
police and if he feels that the evidence and the material collected during the 
investigation justify prosecution of the accused, he may not accept that 
report and take cognizance of the offence and summon the accused, which 
would not constitute interference with the investigation as such. In the said 
judgment, it was further observed, relying upon the judgment in Vineet 
Narain6 (supra), that once the jurisdiction is conferred on CBI to investigate 
an offence by virtue of notification under <a href="/doc/581728/" id="a_74">Section 3</a> of the Act, the powers of 
investigation are governed by the statutory provisions and they cannot be 
curtained by any executive instruction issued under <a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_75">Section 4(1)</a> of the Delhi 
Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.
</p>
<p id="p_45">	Analyses of the above judgments show that there is a clear-cut and 
well-demarcated sphere of activities in the field of crime detection and crime 
punishment. Investigation of an offence is the field reserved for the 
executive through the police department, the superintendence over which 
vests in the State Government. The executive is charged with a duty to keep 
vigilance over law and order situation. It is obliged to prevent crime. If an 
offence is committed allegedly, it is the State's duty to investigate into the 
offence and bring the offender to book. Once it investigates through the 
police department and finds an offence having been committed, it is its duty 
to collect evidence for the purposes of proving the offence. Once that is 
completed, the investigating officer submits report to the court requesting 
the court to take cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_76">Section 190</a> Cr.PC and his 
duty comes to an end. Therefore, there is a well-defined and well-
demarcated functions in the field of crime detection and its subsequent 
adjudication by the court. Lastly, the term "investigation" under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_77">Section 
173(2)</a> of the Cr.PC includes opinion of the officer in charge of the police 
station as to whether there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of 
suspicion to justify the forwarding of the case to the concerned court or not. 
This opinion is not legal evidence. At the stage of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_78">Section 173(2)</a> the 
question of interpretation of legal evidence does not arise. In any event, that 
function is that of the courts.

the offence and the necessary information is being sent to 
the court. In fact, the report under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_83">Section 173(2)</a>

	In the case of <a href="/doc/512076/" id="a_85">Kaptan Singh and Ors.   v.  State of M.P. and Anr</a>.  
this Court held vide para 5 as follows:
</p><p id="p_51">"5. From a conspectus of the above decisions it follows 
that the revisional power of the High Court while sitting 
in judgment over an order of acquittal should not be 
exercised unless there exists a manifest illegality in the 
judgment or order of acquittal or there is grave 
miscarriage of justice. Read in the context of the above 
principle of law we have no hesitation in concluding that 
the judgment of the trial court in the instant case is 
patently wrong and it has caused grave miscarriage of 
justice. The High Court was therefore fully justified in 
setting aside the order of acquittal. From the judgment of 
the trial court we find that one of the grounds that largely 
weighed with it for acquitting the appellants was that an 
Inspector of CID who had taken up the investigation of 
the case and was examined by the defence (DW 3) 
testified that during his investigation he found that the 
story as made out by the prosecution was not true and on 
the contrary the plea of the accused (appellants) that in 
the night of the incident a dacoity with murder took place 
in the house of Baijnath by unknown criminals and the 
appellants were implicated falsely was true. It is trite that 
result of investigation can never be legal evidence; and 
this Court in <a href="/doc/1406527/" id="a_86">Vijender  v. State of Delhi</a> (1997)6 SCC 171 
made the following comments while dealing with this 
issue:
</p>	
<p id="p_52">'The reliance of the trial Judge on the result 
of investigation to base his findings is again 
patently wrong. If the observation of the trial 
Judge in this regard is taken to its logical 
conclusion it would mean that a finding of 
guilt can be recorded against an accused 
without a trial, relying solely upon the police 
report submitted under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_87">Section 173</a> CrPC, 
which is the outcome of an investigation. 
</p><p id="p_53">The result of investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_88"> Chapter 
XII of the Criminal Procedure Code</a> is a 
conclusion that an Investigating Officer 
draws on the basis of materials collected 
during investigation and such conclusion 
can only form the basis of a competent court 
to take cognizance thereupon under <a href="/doc/867855/" id="a_89">Section 
190(1)(b)</a> CrPC and to proceed with the case 
for trial, where the materials collected 
during investigation are to be translated into 
legal evidence. The trial court is then 
required to base its conclusion solely on the 
evidence adduced during the trial; and it 
cannot rely on the investigation or the result 
thereof. Since this is an elementary principle 
of criminal law, we need not dilate on this 
point any further'."        (emphasis supplied)


In the case of <a href="/doc/869137/" id="a_90">R. Sarala   v.  T.S. Velu and Ors</a>.  the facts were as 
follows. A young bride committed suicide within seven months of her 
marriage. An inquiry under <a href="/doc/1780091/" id="a_91">Section 174(3)</a> Cr.PC was held. The Magistrate 
conducted the inquiry and submitted a report holding that due to mental 
restlessness she had committed suicide and no one was responsible. He 
further opined that her death was not due to dowry demand. However, the 
police continued with the investigation and submitted a challan against the 
husband of the deceased and his mother for the offence under            
<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_92">Sections 304</a> B and 498 A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_93">IPC</a>. The father of the deceased was not satisfied 
with the challan as the sister-in-law and the father-in-law were not arraigned 
as accused. Therefore, the deceased's father moved the High Court under 
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_94">Section 482</a> Cr.PC. A Single Judge of the High Court directed that the 
papers be placed before the Public Prosecutor. He was asked to give an 
opinion on the matter and, thereafter, the court directed that an amended 
charge-sheet should be filed in the concerned court. This court held as 
follows:
</p><p id="p_54">"In this case the High Court has committed an illegality 
in directing the final report to be taken back and to file a 
fresh report incorporating the opinion of the Public 
Prosecutor. Such an order cannot stand legal scrutiny. 
The formation of the opinion, whether or not there is a 
case to place the accused on trial, should be that of the 
officer in charge of the police station and none else. 
There is no stage during which the investigating officer is 
legally obliged to take the opinion of a Public Prosecutor 
or any authority, except the superior police officer in the 
rank as envisaged in <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_95">Section 36</a> of the Code. A Public 
Prosecutor is appointed, as indicated in <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_96">Section 24</a> CrPC, 
for conducting any prosecution, appeal or other 
proceedings in the court.  He has also the power to 
withdraw any case from the prosecution with the consent 
of the court. He is the officer of the court. Thus the 
Public Prosecutor is to deal with a different field in the 
administration of justice and he is not involved in 
investigation.  It is not the scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_97"> of the Code</a> for 
supporting or sponsoring any combined operation 
between the investigating officer and the Public 
Prosecutor for filing the report in the court."

APPLICATION OF THE ABOVE CASE LAW TO THE FACTS OF 
THIS CASE:
</p>
<p id="p_56">	At the outset, we may state that this Court has repeatedly emphasized 
in the above judgments that in Supreme Court monitored cases this Court is 
concerned with ensuring proper and honest performance of its duty by CBI 
and that this Court is not concerned with the merits of the accusations in 
investigation, which are to be determined at the trial on the filing of the 
charge-sheet in the competent court, according to the ordinary procedure 
prescribed by law. Therefore, the question which we have to decide in the 
present case is whether the administrative hierarchy of officers in the CBI, in 
the present case, have performed their duties in a proper and honest manner.
</p>
<p id="p_57">	As stated above, the formation of the opinion, whether or not there is 
a case to place the accused on trial, should be that of the officer in charge of 
the police station and none else. Under the CBI Manual, the officer in charge 
of the police station is the S.P.. In this connection, we quote hereinbelow the 
CBI Manual, which though not binding on this Court in Supreme Court 
monitored cases, nonetheless, the said Manual throws light on the 
controversy in hand. We quote clauses 6.1 and 19.15 of the CBI (Crime) 
Manual-2005 hereinbelow:
</p><p id="p_58">"DIRECTOR, CBIMatters to be shown to DCBI

6.1	Director, CBI should be informed of all important 
matters and his advice or instructions obtained wherever 
this is considered necessary by Special Director, 
Additional Director, Joint Directors, DIsG, Director of 
Prosecution, Director, CFSL and other Senior Officers. 
In particular, the following matters should be referred to 
him."
</p>
<p id="p_59">"19.15  SP's Report is a very important document and 
should be  prepared personally by the SP in the 
prescribed format. The concerned Departments/ 
Government Undertakings assess the CBI investigation 
of their cases solely on the basis of the SP's Reports. The 
report should be grammatically correct, clear and 
unambiguous. The report should be brief without 
repetitions and should contain all necessary data. The 
internal differences of opinion among CBI Officers 
should not find mention in the SP's Report, which should 
advance all arguments to justify the final order passed by 
the Competent Authority in the CBI. The final 
recommendation should be precise. If sanction is 
required, the relevant Section (including sub-section) of 
law under which sanction is required should be 
mentioned with brief grounds. In some of the cases, 
charge sheets cannot be filed and only complaints by 
certain statutory authorities can be filed in the Court. In 
such cases, the relevant section prescribing the filing of a 
complaint should be mentioned in the SP's Report. It 
should be borne in mind by the SP that the efficiency and 
the quality of work done by the CBI would be viewed 
mainly on the basis of the SP's Report and, therefore, no 
effort should be spared to make it factually correct, 
systematic, cogent and logical."         (emphasis supplied)


	In the present case, the investigating team consisted of the I.O., S.P., 
D.I.G., Joint Director and Additional Director CBI. In the present case, the 
law officers consisted of D.L.A. and A.L.A.. In the present case, the entire 
investigating team as well as the said law officers are ad idem in their mind. 
They have recommended prosecution. It is only the Director of Prosecution 
and the Sr. P.P. who have opined that a closure report should be filed. It may 
be noted that Sr. P.P. does not find place in clause 6.1 which refers to the 
administrative hierarchy of CBI. Further, the Director of Prosecution is the 
only officer who had dissented from the opinion of the investigating team 
including the S.P.. It appears that this opinion is also based only on 
interpretation of legal evidence. Moreover, as can be seen from the Status 
Report dated 31.12.2004, the Director, CBI has not given his independent 
opinion. He has merely relied upon the opinion of the Attorney General. We 
can understand the Director, CBI expressing an opinion and then referring 
the matter to the Attorney General. Under the above circumstances, we are 
of the view that, there was no difference of opinion in the matter of 
investigation between the concerned officers of CBI and, therefore, there 
was no question of the Director, CBI referring the matter to the Attorney 
General of India. As stated by this Court in the case of R. Sarla10 (supra),  
the formation of opinion, whether or not there is a case to place the accused 
on trial has to be of the officer in charge of the police station. One fails to 
understand why an opinion of Sr. P.P. had been taken in the present case. He 
is not a member of the hierarchy. The S.P. is not legally obliged to take his 
opinion. In the circumstances, when there was no difference of opinion in 
the concerned team, the question of seeking opinion of the Attorney General 
did not arise. Lastly, even under clause 19.15 of the CBI Manual it is 
expressly stated that the report of the S.P. should be prepared personally by 
the S.P. and that the internal differences of opinion among CBI Officers 
should not find place in the SP's Report. As stated above, CBI was required 
to follow the procedure in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_98">Cr.PC</a>. The result of the investigation by the 
police is not legal evidence. Keeping in mind the scheme of <a href="/doc/1701577/" id="a_99">Sections 168</a>, 
<a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_100">169</a>, <a href="/doc/1367808/" id="a_101">170</a> and <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_102">173</a> of the Cr.PC, in the facts and circumstances of this case, 
we direct the entire material collected by CBI along with the report of the 
S.P. to be placed before the concerned court/ Special Judge in terms of 
<a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_103">Section 173(2)</a> Cr.PC. The decision to accept or reject the report of the S.P. 
shall be that of the concerned court/ Special Judge, who will decide the 
matter in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_60">	Before concluding two points need clarification. Under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_104">Article 142</a> of 
the Constitution, this Court is empowered to take aid and assistance of any 
Authority for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before 
it. In the present case, at one stage of the matter, voluminous records were 
placed by CBI before this Court along with the recommendations of its 
officers. To vet and analyse the material, this Court essentially directed  
CVC to study the material, analyse the findings and give its 
recommendations as to the manner in which the investigations have been 
carried out. Since CVC has fairly stated before this Court that its advice is 
only in the nature of an opinion which is not a binding direction in this case, 
we are not required to examine the scope of the CVC Act, 2003. Secondly, 
in our earlier order, we have given time to CBI to complete legal scrutiny 
when we were told that there was difference of opinion in the administrative 
hierarchy of CBI. However, after going through the recommendations of the 
above officers, we are of the view, as stated above, that there was no 
difference of opinion of the concerned officers and, therefore, there was no 
question of reference to the Attorney General. We reject the Status Report 
dated 31.12.2004 as it is a charade of the performance of duty by the CBI. 
Thus, a case for judicial review is made out.
</p>
<p id="p_61">We, accordingly, direct the CBI to place the evidence/ material 
collected by the investigating team along with the report of the S.P. as 
required under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_105">Section 173(2)</a> Cr.PC before the concerned court/ Special 
Judge who will decide the matter in accordance with law. It is necessary to 
add that, in this case, we were concerned with ensuring proper and honest 
performance of duty by the CBI and our above observations and reasons are 
confined only to that aspect of the case and they should not be understood as 
our opinion on the merits of accusation being investigated. We do not wish 
to express any opinion on the recommendations of the S.P.. It is made clear 
that none of the other opinions/ recommendations including that of the 
Attorney General of India, CVC shall be forwarded to the concerned court/ 
Special Judge. 
</p>
<p id="p_62">	In the matters after matters, we find that the efficacy and ethics of the 
governmental authorities are progressively coming under challenge before 
this Court by way of PIL for failure to perform their statutory duties. If this 
continues, a day might come when the rule of law will stand reduced to      
"a rope of sand".
</p>
<p id="p_63">The above Interlocutory applications are accordingly disposed of.
