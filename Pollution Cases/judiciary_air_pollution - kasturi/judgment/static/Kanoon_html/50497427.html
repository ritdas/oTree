         ---------------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 28th day of March,2011

                               O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">          The revision petitioners are accused Nos.1,5 and 6 in

C.C.No.105 of 2002 pending before the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Kolencherry, which is a case instituted upon a

private complaint preferred by the first respondent herein. The

challenge in this revision petition is against the order dated

19.9.2009 of the above court by which the learned Magistrate has

found that the complainant had succeeded in making out a prima

facie complaint against the present revision petitioners and the

case would be proceeded against them. The complaint is filed

under <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_1">Section 43(b)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>,1981 (for short 'the Act'). Hence this Criminal

Revision Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.   The allegation in the complaint, which is produced

along with this Crl.R.P. as Annexure-I, is that the complainant is

a resident of the locality in which the first accused/company is

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                       :-2-:
</p>
<p id="p_3">situating and functioning under the provisions of the above Act.

The product of the company is carbon black, which is generally

used as raw materials for the manufacture of tyres, batteries etc.

According to the allegation, the first accused/company, in violation

of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_4">31A</a> of the Act, established and operated Line

III.  According to the complainant, the Line III was established

and operated without obtaining prior consent from the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to for short as

'Board') and because of the absence of sufficient safety measures,

there were emissions of carbon which adversely affected the health

of the local people. Thus, the crux of the allegation is that since

Line III was established and operated without obtaining prior

consent and in violation of the direction issued by the Board,

<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_5">Sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_6">31</a> of the Act are attracted and thereby the

accused,19 in numbers, have committed the offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_7">Section 37</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3. When cognizance was taken, on the basis of the above

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                         :-3-:
</p>
<p id="p_5">complaint and C.C.No.105 of 2002 was instituted in the trial

court, initially the accused therein including the revision

petitioners    preferred    two    Crl.M.Cs.     before   this Court.

Crl.M.C.No.3608 of 2002 is filed by accused Nos.1 to 3 and 14.

Accused Nos.4 to 13 and 15 to 19 preferred Crl.M.C.No.4462 of

2002, challenging Annexure-I complaint and the proceedings of

the learned Magistrate taking cognizance and also against all the

proceedings in C.C.No.105 of 2002. This Court by Annexure XIII

common order dated 1.3.2004 disposed of the above Crl.M.Cs.

With the following directions:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "(1) All proceedings against the accused,
               except accused Nos.1,5 and 6, in CC
               No.105/2002, on the file of the Judicial
               First     Class     Magistrate      Court,
               Kolenchery, are quashed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            (2)    The Member Secretary, Kerala State
               Pollution Control Board, shall produce
               all the relevant records in his possession,
               as would be demanded by the Magistrate,
               before the court below, for the purpose of
               establishing    the   violation   of    the
               provisions under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_8">Section 21</a> and <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_9">31A</a> of
               the Act.</blockquote><p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">            (3) On receipt of the same, the Magistrate

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                         :-4-:
</p>
<p id="p_8">               shall hear both sides, and find out,
               whether there is any prima facie case
               made out for the violation of the
               provisions of the Act, and therefore, these
               accused are to be proceeded under
               <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_10">Section 37</a> of the Act.     On finding the
               same, he shall proceed in accordance
               with law, against these accused, accused
               Nos.1,5 and 6.
</p><pre id="pre_2">            (4)    If an application is moved by the
               accused   for    exempting     them   from
               personal appearance, that be granted,
</pre><p id="p_9">               considering their necessity to be present
               in the company for work or for other
               avocations, as would be sought by them.
</p><p id="p_10">               The accused shall be present in court as
               and when their presence is legally
               required for the disposal of the case."
</p>
<p id="p_11">Thus, it can be seen that, this Court by the above judgment,

quashed all the proceedings against the accused in C.C.No.105 of

2002 except accused Nos.1,5 and 6 who are the revision petitioners

herein.    Thereafter, the learned Magistrate, in the light of the

direction issued by this Court, as per the above common judgment,

considered the entire matter afresh and issued the impugned order

dated 19.9.2009 in C.C.No.105 of 2002 and decided to proceed

against the revision petitioners. It is the above order challenged in

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                       :-5-:
</p>
<p id="p_12">this Crl.R.P.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      4. I have heard Sri.S.Sreekumar, learned counsel appearing

for the revision petitioners and Advocate Sri. Sabu Thozhuppadan,

who is the first respondent herein, in his personal capacity.

</p><p id="p_14">      5. On hearing the arguments of counsel for the revision

petitioners and the first respondent, it appears to me that though

the learned Magistrate has referred to several proceedings and

documents issued by the Board as well as the District Collector and

though the learned Magistrate came to a conclusion that the

averments in the complaint as well as the documents produced on

behalf of the complainant itself are sufficient to make out a prima

facie case against the accused that they have violated the orders

and directions given by the Board on 20.7.2001, by which the

accused were directed to stop the manufacturing operations and

process of the first accused/company within 48 hours from the time

of receipt of the order, I am of the view that the learned Magistrate

miserably failed to consider certain relevant and material

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                      :-6-:
</p>
<p id="p_15">documents, especially in terms of the direction issued by this Court

while issuing Annexure XIII order.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      6. Learned counsel for the revision petitioners vehemently

submitted that had the learned Magistrate considered the entire

documents, the learned Magistrate would not have passed an order

like the impugned one. The first respondent, on the other hand,

submitted that Line III was established and operated without prior

sanction of the Board and the complaint is pending before the trial

court for the last nine years and there is no progress because of the

persistent interference of the accused by way of resorting to

unnecessary legal proceedings. According to the first respondent,

the learned Magistrate is perfectly justified in her order because the

documents produced by the complainant and the averments therein

fully disclosed the offence alleged against the revision

petitioners/accused.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      7.    The case of the complainant is that the revision

petitioners/accused established Line III without obtaining prior

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                      :-7-:
</p>
<p id="p_18">consent from the Board and they have operated Line III without

obtaining prior consent for the same from the Board. It is also the

submission of the first respondent that when the officials of the

Board conducted surprise inspection on 5.4.2001, they found that

the installation of Line III was in progress, but the same was done

unauthorisedly.        Learned counsel for the revision petitioners

submitted that the Board, after inspection on 5.4.2001, issued an

order No.PCB/AZU/71/84 dated 7.4.2001, directing the company

to stop all activities in connection with the unauthorised expansion

and thereafter, the Board issued Annexure II order dated 21.7.2001

direction for closure. According to the revision petitioners, in

pursuance of Annexure-II order- the direction for closure and in

pursuance of the discussion with the Officials of the Board on

23.7.2001, the company made an undertaking dated 25.7.2001, a

copy of which is produced as Annexure-III before the Board. It is

the specific case of the revision petitioners that on furnishing

Annexure III undertaking, the Pollution Control Board issued

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                        :-8-:
</p>
<p id="p_19">Annexure IV order which reads as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                    "In consideration of the undertaking
             given by the Chief of Operations, Philips
             Carbon Black Ltd., Kochi 682303 vide ref. cited
             third and subject to satisfactory compliance by
             the industry therewith, the direction issued vide
             ref.1 that "all manufacturing operations and
             processes in the factory are to be closed down
             within 48 hours of service of this direction" is
             kept in abeyance for four months."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                            (emphasis supplied)

So, according to the learned counsel, in the light of the above

proceedings, it cannot be said that the petitioners have committed

any of the offence as alleged against them, but the learned

Magistrate miserably failed to consider the above documents. It is

also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that

the Division Bench of this Court gave green signal and thus, the

installation was ratified by the decision of this Court in the writ

proceedings.</blockquote><p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">      8. According to me, the above submission of the learned

counsel for the revision petitioners and the submission of the first

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                       :-9-:
</p>
<p id="p_22">respondent has got some force. After the consideration of several

other facts, in paragraph 15 of the impugned order, the learned

Magistrate came to a conclusion that the petitioner has made out a

prima facie case against the accused that they have violated the

orders and direction given by the Kerala State Pollution Control

Board on 20.7.2001, with a direction to stop the manufacturing

operations and process of the first accused/company on the expiry

of 48 hours. It appears that the learned Magistrate miserably failed

to consider the documents viz., Annexure III undertaking dated

25.7.2001 and Annexure IV order dated 25.7.2001 issued by the

Pollution Control Board, though the learned Magistrate had

referred to Anenxure II direction for closure dated 21.7.2001. At

present, this Court is not in a position to say what would have been

the findings of the trial court, had the trial court considered the

above documents in detail. I am not making any observation or

findings regarding the merit of the discussion and findings arrived

at by the learned Magistrate in the impugned order.        Though I

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                      :-10-:
</p>
<p id="p_23">have repeatedly gone through the detailed discussion contained in

paragraph 14 of the impugned order, I failed to see any reference

of the learned Magistrate with respect to the above mentioned

documents, in spite of the fact that the Pollution Control Board, in

terms of the order issued by the learned Magistrate, produced 13

documents before the learned Magistrate by filing a memo dated

22.12.2006. The documents, which I referred to above, covers the

document Nos.IX to XII in the above memo. A copy of the memo

is produced along with the counter affidavit of the first respondent

as Annexure R1(a).      Thus, the above documents are available

before the learned Magistrate, but the same were not considered

while issuing the impugned order.     Therefore, it is just and proper

to direct the learned Magistrate to consider document Nos.IX to

XII produced before her as per Annexure R1(a) memo and to pass

fresh orders in terms of the direction issued by this Court as per the

above indicated common order of this Court. It goes without

saying that the learned Magistrate will ensure that she will consider

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                        :-11-:
</p>
<p id="p_24">the averment and contention of the first respondent that Line III

was established and operated without prior consent of the Board.

</p><p id="p_25">            In the result, this Criminal Revision Petition is disposed

of setting aside the order dated 19.9.2009 in C.C.No.105 of 2002

of the court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kolencherry and

remitting the matter back to the trial court for fresh consideration

of the entire matter and to pass fresh orders after referring to all the

documents now available with the learned Magistrate as evidenced

by Annexure.R1(a) memo particularly document Nos.IX to XII

mentioned therein, after hearing the revision petitioners as well as

the complainant.       It is made clear that the impugned order is set

aside only for the limited purpose of enabling the learned

Magistrate to pass fresh orders as directed above and it is further

made clear that if the learned Magistrate, after considering the

documents which are directed to be considered, is of the opinion

that a prima facie case is made out against the accused and there

are grounds to proceed against the accused on the basis of

Crl.R.P.No.3339 of 2009
                                       :-12-:
</p>
<p id="p_26">Annexure -1 complaint and the documents which are already

produced and particularly referred above, the learned Magistrate is

free to come to the same finding as that of the impugned order

notwithstanding the fact that the said order is set aside by this

Court and the learned Magistrate is directed to pass appropriate

orders untrammelled by any of the observations or findings that

contained in this order. Since the above Calendar Case is pending

before the trial court for the last nine years, the learned Magistrate

is directed to expedite the proceedings and to pass orders as

expeditiously as possible, at any rate within three months from

2.4.2011 on which date, the petitioners are directed to appear

before the learned Magistrate for framing of charge. The learned

Magistrate is also directed to postpone the framing of charge till

the passing of fresh orders as directed above.
