JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

     By this order, we shall dispose of the above three applications

preferred by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (for short

'the Board').
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   A complaint under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_1">Sections 44</a>, <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_2">47</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">88</a> of the Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short the '<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Water

Act</a>') and <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_6">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_7">16</a> of the Environment Protection Act,

1986 (for short the '<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_8">Environment Act</a>') was instituted in the Court of

the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Bhopal by the Board.

According to the Board, it had been declared as the prescribed

authority under the amended Rule 7 (i) of the Municipal Solid

Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 (for short 'the

Rules'). The complaint was instituted by an authorized officer of the

Board, holding the public office, and who is a public servant under

<a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_9">Section 21</a> of the Indian Penal Code (for short the 'Code').

</p><p id="p_4">3.   According   to   the   Board,       the   Central    Government   had

published a notification to enforce the Rules which had come into

force with effect from 25th September, 2000.             The Rules required

that every Municipal Authority would be responsible for collection,

segregation, storage, transportation, processing and disposal of

municipal waste in any form. The Municipal Corporation, Bhopal,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>
 was required to obtain the authorization under the Rules as well as

it was required of the said Authority to improve the existing landfill

sites as per the provisions of these Rules by 31st December, 2001,

to monitor the performance of the waste processing and disposal

facilities, identification of landfill sites for future use and making

the sites ready for use by December, 2002 and to set up the waste

processing and disposal facility by 31st December, 2003. The

Corporation and the persons accused in the complaint had failed to

carry out the said steps.    On the contrary, the Corporation was

disposing of municipal solid waste of Bhopal City at Bhanapura

Trenching Ground without any treatment and in an unscientific

manner, thereby causing pollution and health hazards to the

residents of the nearby areas.     The Corporation and other four

stated accused were defaulters due to non-compliance of the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_10">Environment Act</a> and also for their failure to

manage and dispose of the municipal solid waste in accordance

with the Rules.    The Board had given directions vide its letters

dated 8th January, 2003, 19th November, 2003 and 1st May, 2004.

The accused persons neither replied to the said letters nor carried

out the required steps. The Board even served a notice dated 8 th

December, 2003 on the said accused persons. The Officer of the

Board sought permission to institute the complaint, and the same

was granted against the accused on 12th August, 2004, leading to

the institution of the complaint. Thus, it was prayed in the

complaint that the accused should be punished for violating the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_11">Environment Act</a> and the Rules.            The said

complaint was filed before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>
 who took cognizance of the same and vide its order dated 10 th

December, 2004, summoned the accused persons to face trial

under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_12">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_13">16</a> of the Environment Act. The matter

thereafter remained pending for quite some time, however, vide

order dated 24th June, 2013, passed in Complaint No. 1364/2004,

the complaint case was transferred to the National Green Tribunal

(for short 'the NGT'). That is how the matter comes up for hearing

before this Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.   We have heard learned counsel appearing for the complainant

on the question as to how the present complaint is maintainable

and can be adjudicated upon by this Tribunal. This complaint had

been filed before the Court of the CJM in consonance with the

provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short the

'<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">CrPC</a>'), which is applicable to the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_16">Environment Act</a> in a limited way,

i.e. to the extent of search and seizure, as contemplated under

<a href="/doc/171616267/" id="a_17">Section 10</a> of the Environment Act. The complaint has been filed

under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_18">Section 15</a> read with <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_19">Section 16</a> of the Environment Act, as

stated earlier, which requires that wherever there is a failure to

comply with or a contravention of any provisions of the Act, Rules,

orders or directions, such defaulters shall be liable to be punished

in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_20">Section 15</a> of the Environment

Act. Under <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_21">Section 19</a> of the Environment Act, the jurisdiction to

take cognizance of an offence for such default is specifically and

only vested in the Court. The Court can take cognizance only when

the requirements stated under <a href="/doc/38195017/" id="a_22">Section 19(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/125409775/" id="a_23">19(b)</a> are satisfied,

i.e., the complaint should be moved by an authorized officer and a

notice of not less than 60 days in the prescribed manner, of its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>
 intention to institute such a complaint has been given to the

defaulter. The jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain any suit or

proceeding in respect of any act done, action taken or order or

direction issued by the Central Government or any other authority

or officer in pursuance to any power conferred by or in relation to

its or his functions under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_24">Environment Act</a> is barred in terms of

<a href="/doc/192574007/" id="a_25">Section 22</a> of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   From the cumulative reading of the above provision, it is clear

that it is the court which is entitled to take cognizance of an offence

under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_26">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_27">16</a> of the Environment Act and can punish

the accused if found guilty in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_7">6.   The jurisdiction of this Tribunal is controlled by <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_28">Sections 14</a>

and <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_29">16</a> to <a href="/doc/175098716/" id="a_30">18</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (for short

'the NGT Act').   <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_31">Section 14</a> states that the Tribunal shall have

jurisdiction over all civil cases (emphasis supplied) where a

substantial question relating to environment arises and such

question arises out of the implementation of the enactments

specified in Schedule I.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   Of course, the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_32">Environment Act</a> is one of the Acts stated in

Schedule I to the NGT Act but then it is limited by the words 'all

civil cases'. Thus, the Tribunal will have the jurisdiction only over

the civil cases relating to environment, as stated under Section 14

of the NGT Act. The expression 'civil cases' has intentionally been

used by the Legislature in complete contradistinction to criminal

cases. Once the Legislature restricts the jurisdiction of the Tribunal

only to civil cases, then that jurisdiction is incapable of being

expanded to the cases which are patently and substantially

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   5</span>
 criminal in nature and are controlled or have been instituted under

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_33">CrPC</a>, like filing of a criminal complaint of an

offence, specifically triable by a magistrate in accordance with law.

This Tribunal is a creation of a statute and thus, its jurisdiction will

have to be construed with reference to the language of its

provisions. Being a statutory body, it is bound and controlled by

the provisions of the statute itself. Section 15 of the NGT Act gives

wide jurisdiction to this Tribunal. Under this provision, the

Tribunal can pass an order, give relief and compensation to the

victims of pollution and in relation to other environmental damage

arising under the enactments specified in Schedule I of the NGT

Act. It also gives power to the Tribunal to pass orders for restitution

of property and environment, as the Tribunal may deem fit.

Further, the Act specifically postulates that orders passed by the

Tribunal in exercise of such powers is in addition to the relief paid

or payable under the <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_34">Public Liability Insurance Act</a>, 1991. The

appellate jurisdiction is vested in the Tribunal in terms of Section

16 of the NGT Act. Appeals lie to the Tribunal but only against such

orders, decisions or directions as specified under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_35">Section 16(a)</a> to (j)

of the NGT Act. Section 18 of the NGT Act defines and explains as

to how the application shall be made to the Tribunal and who can

approach the Tribunal for remedies under Sections 14 to 18 of the

NGT Act.    This Tribunal, thus, has no jurisdiction to deal with

criminal cases falling within the purview<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_36"> of the Code</a>.         For the

offences, that are alleged to have been committed in terms of

<a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_37">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_38">16</a> of the Environment Act, a complaint would lie

before and cognizance can alone be taken by the Court of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   6</span>
 competent jurisdiction, i.e. Chief Judicial Magistrate/Magistrate,

competent to try such offences.         The jurisdiction of the Tribunal

further stands excluded as only the cases of civil nature, in

contradistinction to cases of criminal nature, can be adjudicated

upon and settled by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.   We are, thus, of the considered view that this Tribunal has no

jurisdiction to try, adjudicate and punish the accused persons, even

if they are found to be guilty under the provisions of <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_39">Sections 15</a>

and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_40">16</a> of the Environment Act, particularly in light of Section 14 of

the NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.   For the above reasons, we decline to exercise jurisdiction in

these cases and would direct the Registry to return the complaint

cases to the learned CJM, Bhopal, who may proceed with the case

in accordance with law. There shall be no order as to costs.
