    (Respondent No.3) cannot be directly challenged under Section

<p id="p_19">    9                       We have heard learned Counsel. The Counsel for

    the Applicant strongly contends that the Environment Clearance

    is not a valid clearance as no CRZ clearance for the disposal of

    treated effluent into saline water zone of Patalganga River is

    obtained by Respondent No.1 which is a pre-requisite condition

    for the grant of Environment Clearance.                  He further contends

    that the Environmental Clearance in question is subject to

    obtaining prior clearance from the National Board of Wildlife

    (NBWL).            The Counsel for the Applicant, therefore, argues that

    such conditional Environmental Clearance is not legal and valid.

    The Applicant further claims that the Respondent No.1, Industry

    has started carrying out project activities at the site though the

    Environmental                Clearance   clearly   stipulates   that,   without

    obtaining CRZ clearance and the clearance from the National

    Board for Wildlife, no project activities shall be carried out. He

    argued that the EC is bad in law. The Applicant raised serious

    objections regarding the ongoing project activities and associated

    damages caused to the environment. The Applicant also raised

    issue of proximity between the proposed industries, industrial

    area and Karnala Birds Sanctuary.                  Looking to nature of the

    dispute, the Tribunal had formed a Committee vide its Order

         approached the designated Appellate Authority constituted

         under the Water and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>s for any grievance regarding the

         Consent to Establish granted under Provisions of the Water

         (P&amp;CP) Act, 1974 and Air P&amp;CP Act 1981, before approaching

         have been classified as A-I, A-2, A-3, A-4 are not applicable to

         the present location of the industry. MIDC has also submitted

         regarding location of the industry and therefore, the claim of

         the Applicant that the location of the industry is against the

         and clearance from National Board For Wildlife have been

         stipulated.              The   Applicant    strongly    pleaded   that   such

         conditional permissions are illegal as they are not the

         clearance in legal parlance.                 When specifically asked, the

         Counsel            for    Respondent       No.2   has   submitted   a    Office

         Authorities. It is evident from the above provisions of the CRZ

         Notification 2011 read with Section 8(v) of the EIA Notification

         granted after appraising the same for the CRZ considerations.


         19                 Faced with this difficulty, the Counsel for the

         Respondent No1 submits that a small component of their

         project i.e. effluent disposal system only falls in CRZ area and

         attracts CRZ Notification. He further submits that they have

         dated 10th January 2013 to MoEF, prior to grant of

         Environment Clearance on 30th January 2013. He, therefore,

          CRZ and EI Notifications as the project has not yet started.

         This irregularity can be cured by the authorities if the Tribunal

         directs them to do so. This irregularity may not be the cause

         for quashing the EC merely on the ground of procedural flaw.

         The Counsel for Respondent further claims that he has

         already raised objection on ground of limitation because the

         EC has been granted on 30th January 2013 and the said

         application which is not even an appeal under the provisions

         of NGT Act is filed on 29th July 2013 which is beyond

         mandatory period of 90 days from the date of communication

         stipulated under the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_14">National Green Tribunal Act</a>. Therefore,

         he submits that the EC cannot be challenged at this stage by

         the applicant but at the same time, he undertakes that unless

          10th January 2013. It is on record that the Karnala Wildlife

         Sanctuary is only about 1000 m. from this proposed industry.

         This industry has been categorized as red category industry by

         SPCB and likely to cause emissions of various pollutants

         including dust and CS2.               The Tribunal, therefore, finds it

         necessary that the MoEF need to review the air emission

         standards, considering the air dispersion in the area and

         impact thereof on the Wildlife, more particularly birds, by

         conducting specilised study through reputed agency.                   The

         MoEF is accordingly directed to complete the procedural

         formalities for granting or otherwise Environmental Clearance

         as per CRZ Notification 2011 and EI Notification 2006 within

         eight (8) weeks.          In the meantime MoEF shall enquire how

         such procedural lapse has happened.

         submissions made by the Maharashtra Pollution Control

         Board (MPCB).             It is submitted by the counsel of State

         Pollution Control Board on November 12, 2013 that the role of

         MPCB is not activated so far, as it would trigger only after the

         unit becomes functional and the effluent treatment plant is

         commissioned. We do not agree to this contention.                As per

         the provision of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Water Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_16">Air Act</a> the State Board is

         required to ascertain the appropriateness of the Industry

         location before grant of consent under <a href="/doc/88906266/" id="a_17">Section 25</a> read with

         provisions of the <a href="/doc/139918683/" id="a_18">Section 17</a> of these Acts. The provisions of

         the CRZ Notification 2011 are also important, as the section

          3(v)(a) highlight the role of SPCB in deciding the permissible

         activities under the CRZ Notification.            The said proviso is

         reproduced as below :-

<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">                   3.       Prohibited Activities within CRZ - The following are

         declared as prohibited activities within CRZ. :-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                   (v) Setting of an expansion of units or mechanism for
                   disposal of waste effluents except facilities required for.

<p id="p_47">         22                 This provision clearly demonstrate that the role of

         MPCB and its permission starts much before the CRZ or

         Environment Clearance is sought in this case. On perusal of

         the consent to establish granted by the Board, it is noted that

         no reference has been made to NIO report on effluent disposal

         facilities and it is not clear, whether the project proponent has

         made copy of the said report available to SPCB. The said

         consent which is issued in June 2012 is also subject to grant

         of EC. We, therefore, direct the project proponent to submit

         the NIO report to MPCB in next 7 days. We also note that the

         MPCB has not considered the location of the said unit from

         the wildlife sanctioning while fixing the air emission standards

         as required under Section 17 of Air CP&amp;CB) Act, 1981. There

         is no reference in the consent to establish granted by MPCB to

         demonstrate this consideration.

         detailed scientific report in a very short time, without much

         resources made available to the Committee, which was helpful

         in resolving the contentions raised in this application.


         24                 Cumulative result of the foregoing discussion is that

         the application is barred by limitation and therefore, will have

         to be dismissed. Secondly, the application is not merit-worthy

         for the reason that the proposed industrial unit is being

         established in the MIDC area which is not within the

         prohibited limits of RRZ Policy in as much as the location is

         beyond Patalganga River Weir. Respondent No.1 cannot start

         the project activities without obtaining CRZ clearance and

         compliances of other conditions as enumerated in the EC

         granted by the MoEF. The Applicant has not proved that the

         project would cause any environmental damage and as such

         restoration of the environment is necessary.                Hence, the

         application is dismissed.          No costs.
