                     (PIL No. 159/2002), has accorded a hearing to the petitioner in which the Vice
                     Chairman, LAWDA, Member Secretary, Pollution Control Board and Director
                     Tourism Kashmir had been requested to be present. The Committee of Experts has
                     noticed that the Hotel of the petitioner was located on the Dal Lake without any
                     sewage treatment facility and the only sewage facility was through a soakage pit
                     and the septic tank, both of which were ineffective. The Committee of Experts has
                     noticed that disposal of sewage from the hotel was directly flowing into the Dal
                     Lake.

                     Experts has recommended as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                               "Since the hotel is located within Dal Lake area (within the Dal waters) and
                               has been identified for being rehabilitated, the hotel has to be closed down and
                               shifted. Govt of J&amp;K should formulate a policy for rehabilitation of such
                               commercial units. The said Hotel should not be allowed to continue at the
                               present location, even if they establish a modern sewage treatment plant and its
                               effluent conform to the latest standards set by the pollution control board.
                               Being located within the Dal waters, the danger of pollutants leaching into the
                               Lake will always remain.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                               The Govt. of J&amp;K may most expeditiously devise a policy for rehabilitation of
                               commercial units since it does not have one at present. The CoE advises that
                               the Govt. of J&amp;K may examine the policy in this regard available under the
                               Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
                               Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act. 2013. The Policy may cover all cases that
                               fall in the category of commercial units to avoid complaints in future and
                               should be devised urgently.</blockquote>

                     the petitioner has no intention of running the Hotel at the location inasmuch as
                     it adversely impacts the pollution content of the Dal Lake.
</p><p id="p_11">                     11. Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that it is imperative that an
                     immediate policy decision is taken by the Government of Union Territory of
                     Jammu &amp; Kashmir to enable the petitioner to continue with the trade and
                     business to ensure availability of good hospitality to the tourists who visit the
                     valley. It is further submitted that the closure of the petitioner's hotel adversely
                     effects the livelihood not only of the petitioner but several other persons who
                     were employed by the hotel.
</p><p id="p_12">                     12. We have observed that the Committee of Experts has noticed not only the
                     closure of petitioner's hotel but 17 other hotels have also been closed down.
</p><p id="p_13">                     13. We also find that the matter involves a multiple departmental consultation
                     between the Tourism Department, Pollution Control Board, LAWDA and also
                     the Revenue Department.

                     matter for the optimum solution of all the issues arising. It shall be open for the

                     looked into by the Chief Secretary who shall appoint a Committee
                     of officers and the Nodal Department which would be responsible
                     for entire rehabilitation work. This Committee shall prepare the

                     rehabilitation of the relocates from the Dal Lake shall be
