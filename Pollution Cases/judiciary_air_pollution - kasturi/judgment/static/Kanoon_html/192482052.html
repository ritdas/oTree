<p id="p_5">                            4.   Petitioner states that Thermal plant generates electricity by

                      burning coal. It is stated that ash generated in the process of generating

                      electricity is collected and transported in a slurry form (mixed with sea

                      water) to the ash pond which has been created to store ash. It is stated

                      that ash generated by the power plant, i.e., fly ash and bottom ash, are

                      serious pollutants, apart from containing Nickel (Ni), Cadmium (Cd),

                      are also radioactive, depending on the source of coal. It is stated that,

                      storing this ash on plain earth would result in seepage of contaminants

                      into earth, which will result in contaminating ground water and soil. It is

                      submitted that since the contamination caused by the metals mentioned

                      above are dangerous, the first and third respondents have consistently

                      mandated lining of ash ponds with impervious materials such as High

                      Narasimhan, Department of Hydrology, IIT Madras, to study the area and

                      submit a report. Report reveals toxic levels of contamination. Petitioner

                      has placed reliance on the relevant paragraphs of the said report to

                      to indicate the action taken, in accordance with the directions issued, by

                      the Tribunal. Tribunal has constituted another Committee, to inspect the

                          ponds are constructed without proper lining and as a
                          result it is contaminating the land and the ground water
                          and if the fly ash removed from the area is dumped in the
                          existing pond, it would aggravate the position. The
                          learned counsel also argued that Kosathalaiyar Main River
                          which is reported to be heavily silted need to be desilted
                          to enable free flow of water and a direction is to be issued
                          to that effect. It was also submitted that respondents 2
                          and 3 are to be directed to construct adhoc ash ponds
                          with required lining. Mr. Abdul Saleem, the learned
                          counsel appearing for respondents 2 and 3 submitted that
                          they intend to get analysis of the water, including the
                          ground water alone from another laboratory and also the
                          fly ash, as the presence of the heavy metals noted in the
                          report is not correct and in any case presence of heavy

                          3 alone as it is also caused by the nearby polluting

                          proposal is being sent to the government to use the fly
                          ash in preparing bricks, making it mandatory to use such
                          bricks in all government buildings. The learned counsel
                          also submitted that drinking water is to be supplied by the
                          local civic bodies and in any case the pollution is not
                          caused solely by the respondents 2 and 3. The learned
                          counsel also submitted that there is sufficient space in the
                          existing ash pond to enable the deposit of the fly ash
                          which would be removed from the area. On going through
                          the report submitted by the Experts, it is seen that there
                          is high contamination of heavy metals, not only in the
                          water collected but even on the fish and vegetables. As
                          against the prescribed standard of Mercury viz., 0.01
                          mg/l, the river water sample analysis of Kosasthalaiyar
                          River shows that presence of Mercury was 23.18 mg/l,
                          29.1 mg/l, 18.19 mg/l, 22.11 mg/l and 18.18 mg/l. So
                          also   presence   of   Mercury   detected   in   the   samples
                          collected from the backwater shows the percentages as
                          30.28 mg/l, 16.55 mg/l, 24.66 mg/l, 24.99 mg/l and
                          22.18 mg/l. The river water samples analysis also shows
                          that presence of Mercury detected are 16.95 mg/l and
                          18.11 mg/l. The fly ash sample analysis also shows that 3
                          out of 20 samples contained Selenium and all the samples
                          contained Copper with maximum concentration of 40.18
                          and 13 out of 20 fly ash samples contained Chromium
                          with a maximum recorded concentration of 13.71 mg/kg,
                          as against the prescribed standard of 2 mg/l. 6 out of 20
                          samples contained Cadmium, with a maximum recorded
                          concentration of 0.54 mg/kg as against the prescribed
                          standard of 2 mg/l. 6 out of 20 samples contained Lead
                          with the maximum recorded concentration of 6.61 mg/kg,

                          as against the prescribed standard of 0.1 mg/l. Even the
                          analysis of fish, crab and prawn establish the presence of
                          alarming percentage of heavy metals. All the 5 samples of
                          home grown vegetables also found presence of Chromium
                          and Lead. Chromium levels ranging from 1.12 to 5.56
                          mg/kg. It is thus clear that even the ground water there is
                          not fit for consumption. It would be dangerous to
                          consume    such   highly   contaminated   water.   In   such
                          circumstances, some arrangement necessarily has to be
                          made with regard to the drinking water. Though the
                          learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3
                          submits that pollution is not caused by the respondents
                          and as per the report of the Board, there are more than
                          1,000 industries, included in the „red" category operating
                          there causing pollution and it is the duty of the local body
                          to supply the drinking water. Considering the fact that the
                          main pollutant is the fly ash produced by the respondents
                          2 and 3, the principle of „polluter pays" shall necessarily
                          to be applied with regard to supply of drinking water to
                          the people of the locality. The people of the area cannot
                          be directed to drink contaminated water and suffer the
                          consequences, which would adversely affect not only the
                          existing generation but also the future generations to
                          come. In such circumstances, the respondents 2 and 3
                          are directed to provide sufficient drinking water to all the
                          nearby residents, if the local bodies are not supplying
                          sufficient drinking water to them. It is made clear that the
                          water to be supplied should be of drinking water, quality
                          and every household should be supplied with drinking
                          water, in case there is no supply of sufficient quantity of
                          potable drinking water by the local body. It is made clear

                          from the report and the admitted facts that the existing
                          ash pond is not lined. In such circumstances, adding
                          further fly ash removed from the area into that pond
                          would only aggravate the position. The respondents 2 and
                          3 are directed to provide properly lined ash pond on
                          adhoc or permanent basis, so that the fly ash to be
                          removed could be accommodated there. Even if the
                          government mandates that the fly ash is to be used for all
                          brick manufacturing units and such bricks shall be used
                          for construction of all government buildings, it will take
                          time and till then they are to be stored also. In such
                          circumstances, respondents 2 and 3 shall provide ash
                          pond permanent or adhoc with proper lining. The report
                          also shows that the Kosasthalaiyar River Main Channel is
                          heavily silted with fly ash and that is to be desilted for
                          free flow of water. The respondents 2 and 3 are directed
                          to dredge the Kosasthalaiyar Main Channel to remove the
                          fly ash with the aid of respondent no.8. The respondent
                          no.8 shall take steps to desilt the fly ash at the expense of
                          respondents 2 and 3. It is also made clear that once the
                          fly ash is dredged, its removal shall be by the respondents
                          2 and 3 and it shall be kept in a ash pond with proper
                          lining. The report also shows that the workers engaged in
                          the removal of fly ash, pursuant to the order of this
                          Tribunal, continue to work without adequate respiratory
                          or dermal protection. It is also suggested that considering
                          the fact that most of the workers are youngmen with life
                          ahead, exposure could seriously harm their economic
                          prospects and lifespan. The learned counsel appearing for
                          the respondents 2 and 3, on instructions from the officers
                          present, submitted that sufficient protection is provided.

                          But admittedly no dermal protection is provided. The
                          respondents 2 and 3 are therefore directed to provide all

                          and dermal, who remove the fly ash, as otherwise it
                          would cause danger to their life. The respondents 2 and 3
                          are also directed to take steps to remediate, based on the
                          findings in the report, after conducting proper study. The
                          respondents 2 and 3 shall expedite the process of
                          replacing the existing ash pipeline. List the matter on

                          expanded from time to time. The power plant is dumping
                          ash slurry into Buckingham Canal and the backwaters for
                          several years. Though it was brought into notice of the
                          Pollution Control Board several times, no action was taken
                          in this regard. According to the applicant, the ash
                          generated by the Thermal Power Plant (fly ash and
                          bottom ash) are serious pollutants apart from containing

                          in this case. On account of unscientific manner in which
                          fly ash is being handled by the unit, it affects not only the

                          dated 21st December, 2017, where it is observed as
                          follows: “The learned counsel appearing for the applicant
                          submitted that some interim order is warranted, as the
                          report submitted by the Experts discloses a very serious
                          environmental         problem   which    has    to    be    addressed
                          ugently. The learned counsel pointed out that the report
                          shows    that    heavy     metals     including      Chromium    and
                          Mercury are detected not only in the river water and
                          underground water but also even in the vegetables
                          planted in the households. It is submitted that in such
                          circumstances, when the report shows that the even the
                          drinking water is contaminated with heavy metals like
                          Mercury and Chromium, a direction is to be issued to
                          supply drinking water to the nearby residents. The
                          learned counsel also argued that the existing ash ponds
                          are constructed without proper lining and as a result it is
                          contaminating the land and the ground water and if the

                          fly ash removed from the area is dumped in the existing
                          pond, it would aggravate the position. The learned
                          counsel also argued that Kosathalaiyar Main River which
                          is reported to be heavily silted need to be desilted to
                          enable free flow of water and a direction is to be issued to
                          that effect. It was also submitted that respondents 2 and
                          3 are to be directed to construct adhoc ash ponds with
                          required lining. Mr. Abdul Saleem, the learned counsel
                          appearing for respondents 2 and 3 submitted that they
                          intend to get analysis of the water, including the ground
                          water alone from another laboratory and also the fly ash,
                          as the presence of the heavy metals noted in the report is
                          not correct and in any case presence of heavy metals is
                          not due to the activity of the respondents 2 and 3 alone
                          as it is also caused by the nearby polluting industries. The
                          learned counsel also submitted that a proposal is being
                          sent to the government to use the fly ash in preparing
                          bricks, making it mandatory to use such bricks in all
                          government buildings. The learned counsel also submitted
                          that drinking water is to be supplied by the local civic
                          bodies and in any case the pollution is not caused solely
                          by the respondents 2 and 3. The learned counsel also
                          submitted that there is sufficient space in the existing ash
                          pond to enable the deposit of the fly ash which would be
                          removed from the area. 8 On going through the report
                          submitted by the Experts, it is seen that there is high
                          contamination of heavy metals, not only in the water
                          collected but even on the fish and vegetables. As against
                          the prescribed standard of Mercury viz., 0.01 mg/l, the
                          river water sample analysis of Kosasthalaiyar River shows
                          that presence of Mercury was 23.18 mg/l, 29.1 mg/l,



http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                        27</span>

                          18.19 mg/l, 22.11 mg/l and 18.18 mg/l. So also presence
                          of Mercury detected in the samples collected from the
                          backwater shows the percentages as 30.28 mg/l, 16.55
                          mg/l, 24.66 mg/l, 24.99 mg/l and 22.18 mg/l. The river
                          water samples analysis also shows that presence of
                          Mercury detected are 16.95 mg/l and 18.11 mg/l. The fly
                          ash sample analysis also shows that 3 out of 20 samples
                          contained Selenium and all the samples contained Copper
                          with maximum concentration of 40.18 and 13 out of 20 fly
                          ash samples contained Chromium with a maximum
                          recorded concentration of 13.71 mg/kg, as against the
                          prescribed standard of 2 mg/l. 6 out of 20 samples
                          contained    Cadmium,       with   a   maximum      recorded
                          concentration of 0.54 mg/kg as against the prescribed
                          standard of 2 mg/l. 6 out of 20 samples contained Lead
                          with the maximum recorded concentration of 6.61 mg/kg,
                          as against the prescribed standard of 0.1 mg/l. Even the
                          analysis of fish, crab and prawn establish the presence of
                          alarming percentage of heavy metals. All the 5 samples of
                          home grown vegetables also found presence of Chromium
                          and Lead. Chromium levels ranging from 1.12 to 5.56
                          mg/kg. It is thus clear that even the ground water there is
                          not fit for consumption. It would be dangerous to
                          consume     such   highly   contaminated   water.   In   such
                          circumstances, some arrangement necessarily has to be
                          made with regard to the drinking water. Though the
                          learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3
                          submits that pollution is not caused by the respondents

                          to supply the drinking water. Considering the fact that the
                          main pollutant is the fly ash produced by the respondents
                          2 and 3, the principle of "polluter pays” shall necessarily
                          to be applied with regard to supply of drinking water to
                          the people of the locality. The people of the 9 area cannot
                          be directed to drink contaminated water and suffer the
                          consequences, which would adversely affect not only the
                          existing generation but also the future generations to
                          come. In such circumstances, the respondents 2 and 3
                          are directed to provide sufficient drinking water to all the
                          nearby residents, if the local bodies are not supplying
                          sufficient drinking water to them. It is made clear that the
                          water to be supplied should be of drinking water, quality
                          and every household should be supplied with drinking
                          water, in case there is no supply of sufficient quantity of
                          potable drinking water by the local body. It is made clear
                          from the report and the admitted facts that the existing
                          ash pond is not lined. In such circumstances, adding
                          further fly ash removed from the area into that pond
                          would only aggravate the position. The respondents 2 and
                          3 are directed to provide properly lined ash pond on
                          adhoc or permanent basis, so that the fly ash to be
                          removed could be accommodated there. Even if the
                          government mandates that the fly ash is to be used for all
                          brickmanufacturing units and such bricks shall be used for
                          construction of all government buildings, it will take time
                          and till then they are to be stored also. In such
                          circumstances, respondents 2 and 3 shall provide ash
                          pond permanent or adhoc with proper lining. The report
                          also shows that the Kosasthalaiyar River Main Channel is
                          heavily silted with fly ash and that is to be desilted for

                          free flow of water. The respondents 2 and 3 are directed
                          to dredge the Kosasthalaiyar Main Channel to remove the
                          fly ash with the aid of respondent no.8. The respondent
                          no.8 shall take steps to desilt the fly ash at the expense of
                          respondents 2 and 3. It is also made clear that once the
                          fly ash is dredged, its removal shall be by the respondents
                          2 and 3 and it shall be kept in a ash pond with proper
                          lining. The report also shows that the workers engaged in
                          the removal of fly ash, pursuant to the order of this
                          Tribunal, continue to work without adequate respiratory
                          or dermal protection. It is also suggested that considering
                          the fact that most of the workers are young men with life
                          ahead, exposure could seriously harm their economic
                          prospects and lifespan. The learned counsel appearing for
                          the respondents 2 and 3, on instructions from the officers
                          present,    submitted   that    10    sufficient   protection   is
                          provided.    But   admittedly    no    dermal      protection   is
                          provided. The respondents 2 and 3 are therefore directed
                          to provide all the required protection to the workers both
                          respiratory and dermal, who remove the fly ash, as
                          otherwise it would cause danger to their life. The
                          respondents 2 and 3 are also directed to take steps to
                          remediate, based on the findings in the report, after

                          order ignoring the fact that the petitioner can avail effective
                          alternative remedy by filing application, appeal, revision, etc. and
                          the particular legislation contains a detailed mechanism for
                          redressal of his grievance.
</p>
<p id="p_144">                                  46. It must be remembered that stay of an action initiated
                          by the State and/or its agencies/instrumentalities for recovery of
                          taxes, cess, fees, etc. seriously impedes execution of projects of
                          public importance and disables them from discharging their
                          constitutional and legal obligations towards the citizens. In cases
                          relating to recovery of the dues of banks, financial institutions and
                          secured creditors, stay granted by the High Court would have
                          serious adverse impact on the financial health of such
                          bodies/institutions, which (sic will) ultimately prove detrimental to
                          the economy of the nation. Therefore, the High Court should be
                          extremely careful and circumspect in exercising its discretion to
                          grant stay in such matters. Of course, if the petitioner is able to
                          show that its case falls within any of the exceptions carved out in
                          Baburam Prakash Chandra Maheshwari v. Antarim Zila Parishad [AIR
                          1969 SC 556], Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade Marks [(1998)
                          8 SCC 1] and Harbanslal Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. [(2003) 2
                          SCC 107] and some other judgments, then the High Court may, after
                          considering all the relevant parameters and public interest, pass an
                          appropriate interim order.”

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                      “7. Against the order of the Commissioner an order for
                              reference could have been claimed if the appellants satisfied
                              the Commissioner or the High Court that a question of law
                              arose out of the order. But the procedure provided by the Act
                              to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court was bypassed, the
                              appellants moved the High Court challenging the competence
                              of the Provincial Legislature to extend the concept of sale, and
                              invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under
                              <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_86">Article 226</a> and sought to reopen the decision of the Taxing
                              Authorities on question of fact. The jurisdiction of the High
                              Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_87">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is couched in wide
                              terms and the exercise thereof is not subject to any restrictions
                              except the territorial restrictions which are expressly provided
                              in the Articles. But the exercise of the jurisdiction is
                              discretionary: it is not exercised merely because it is lawful to
                              do so. The very amplitude of the jurisdiction demands that it
                              will ordinarily be exercised subject to certain self-imposed
                              limitations. Resort that jurisdiction is not intended as an
                              alternative remedy for relief which may be obtained in a suit or
                              other mode prescribed by statute. Ordinarily the Court will not
                              entertain a petition for a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_88">Article 226</a>, where the
                              petitioner has an alternative remedy, which without being
                              unduly onerous, provides an equally efficacious remedy. Again
                              the High Court does not generally enter upon a determination
                              of questions which demand an elaborate examination of
                              evidence to establish the right to enforce which the writ is
                              claimed. The High Court does not therefore act as a court of
                              appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal, to correct
                              errors of fact, and does not by assuming jurisdiction under
                              <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_89">Article 226</a> trench upon an alternative remedy provided by
                              statute for obtaining relief. Where it is open to the aggrieved
                              petitioner to move another tribunal, or even itself in another
                              jurisdiction for obtaining redress in the manner provided by a
                              statute, the High Court normally will not permit by entertaining
                              a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_90">Article 226</a> of the Constitution the machinery
                              created under the statute to be bypassed, and will leave the
                              party applying to it to seek resort to the machinery so set up.</blockquote>

                      is virtually closed and hearings are only          done,   through   video

                      conferencing. It is the responsibility of the Government of India to make

                      appointments to the National Green Tribunal, Southern Bench as

                      expeditiously as possible, keeping in mind the spirit of the <a href="/doc/91685705/" id="a_91">National Green

<p id="p_148">                            37. In view of the settled decisions, we are of the opinion that

                      distance factor alone cannot persuade us to entertain the writ petition, in

                      the presence of an expert body like the National Green Tribunal, which

                      has been set up only to entertain substantial questions, pertaining to the

                      environmental issues and more particularly, issues relating to violations

                      of the Acts mentioned in the First Schedule.
