ORAL ORDER</pre>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1">1.	This
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India	 has been
filed with a prayer to  issue a writ of mandamus or a direction to
the District Collector, Bhavnagar,  to comply with  order dated
30-12-2009, passed by this Court in Special Civil Application
No.10892 of 2009.
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_2">2.	The
petitioner had earlier filed the above-mentioned petition which came
to disposed of by order dated 30-12-2009 with the following
directions:
</p> 


<p id="p_3"> 11.	In
view of the aforesaid, it appears that the following directions shall
meet with the ends of justice:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_4"> (1)	Respondent
No.2   the Chairman of Gujarat Pollution Control Board shall assign
the work of examining the genuine requirement of the land on the part
of the petitioner keeping in view the conditions to be complied with
under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and
other relevant Act to avoid the pollution in the manufacturing
activity of the petitioning company. Such work shall be assigned to
the Committee of two technical experts and one expert on
administrative side. The petitioner shall make an application for
such purpose to the Chairman of the respondent No.2 Board within two
weeks from today and in response thereto, the respondent No.2 shall
inform the requisite amount to be paid towards services to be
rendered by such Committee within two weeks thereafter and the
petitioner shall deposit the said amount within one week upon such
communication. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_5">(2)	After
the necessary cost and the fee is deposited by the petitioner, the
Committee shall undertake the work and shall submit a detailed report
with the sketch to the District Collector. At the time when the
Committee prepares the report, the petitioner shall be at the liberty
to keep its technical expert present and the District Collector shall
also be at the liberty to keep his officer, not below the rank of
Mamlatdar, present. However, be it noted that the technical expert of
the petitioner or the Mamlatdar's opinion may be considered by the
members of the Committee but such shall not be binding upon the
Committee and the Committee shall be at the liberty to objectively
examine the matter without being influenced by the earlier report
unless found proper by the Committee to that extent and also keeping
in view the requirement to avoid water and air pollution if any.
While considering the aspects of genuine requirement of the land, the
available existing land and the shifting of the treatment plant or
otherwise, if required, etc. shall be considered. The report shall be
submitted by the Committee within six weeks upon the work assigned by
the respondent No.2 to such Committee.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">(3)	The
petitioner shall file an undertaking within two weeks from today to
abide by the directions as given hereinabove and shall further state
in the undertaking that the report shall be binding to the petitioner
and if it is so opined in the said report by the Committee of experts
that the particular area of land is not required, for running the
industry, after shifting of the plant or otherwise, as may be opined
by the Committee, within one month the possession of the Government
land shall be handed over by the petitioner to the Government,
failing which, the petitioner shall not object to the possession
being taken over by the Government Authority as per the report of the
Committee.  
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_7">(4)	Upon
the report received by the District Collector, the District Collector
shall re-examine the matter in light of the report on the aspect of
allotment of the land to the petitioner at the prevailing policy of
the Government at the relevant point of time and after giving
opportunity of hearing, he shall pass an appropriate order in
accordance with law. Such exercise may be complected preferably
within period of three months from the receipt of the report.
However, pending the consideration, it will be open to the District
Collector to take over the possession of the land which is not
genuinely required as per the report of the Committee and as per the
undertaking given by the petitioner read with the earlier directions
as observed hereinabove. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_8">12.	In
view of the aforesaid directions, the orders passed by the Collector
as well as of the State Government, which are impugned in the present
petition would not survive as the matter will have to be considered a
fresh as per the earlier directions.
</p> 

 


 


<p id="p_9">13.	Petition
is disposed of in terms of the aforesaid directions. No order as to
costs. Direct service is permitted. 
</p>

to the order dated 30-12-2009, passed in Special Civil Application
No.10892 of 2009, respondent No.2 Chairman of the Gujarat Pollution
Control Board formed a Committee of two technical experts and one
expert on the administrative side. The petitioner also filed an
Undertaking in terms of paragraph 11(3) of the said order.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">4.	The
Report of the Committee has been produced on record by an
affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of the Gujarat Pollution Control
Board, affirmed on 29-1-2013.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">5.	In
view of the said Report, the Collector Bhavnagar has issued a notice
dated 6-2-2013 to the petitioner to return the excess land
admeasuring 1633.00 sq.mtrs.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_13">6.	A
copy of the notice dated 6-2-2013 has been tendered by the learned
advocate for the petitioner and is taken on the record of the case.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">7.	It
is stated by Ms.Vyoma Jhaveri, learned advocate  for the petitioner
that as per the said notice the petitioner is ready and willing to
