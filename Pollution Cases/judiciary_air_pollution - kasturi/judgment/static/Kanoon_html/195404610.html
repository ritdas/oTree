     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                -3-


                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, C.J. (Oral) :
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.    The petitioner has invoked Articles 226 and 227 of the

Constitution with the prayer to issue a writ of mandamus

directing respondent No.1 to consider representations as well

as reminders filed by him for taking action against the

quarrying as well as crushing of jelly in Sy.No.216 of

Shivapura Village, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District.


</p><p id="p_4">2.    Upon notice being issued, the respondents concerned

have filed their statements of objections and respondent

No.9, against whom serious allegations are made, has stated

on oath that the petitioner has suppressed several true facts

regarding   agreement    of    sale,   dated   28.05.2011    with

respondent No.9 in respect of several parcels of land

including Sy.No.216/2. It is also alleged that after payment

of substantial sale consideration, respondent No.9 has

initiated litigation in the form of OS No.59/2012 before the

Court of Senior Civil Judge and ACJM, Karkala, for specific

performance, which suit is pending.      It is further stated that

the schedule property referred in the writ petition i.e.,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              -4-</span>


Sy.No.216 is government land and there is no quarrying

activity thereat either by respondent No.9 or any other

person, as contended.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.    Thus in short, the petition raises not only questions of

disputed facts but appears to be suppressing certain material

facts and under such circumstances, the petition is not

required to be entertained.        However, in view of the

allegations made about damage to trees and plantation on

account of alleged industrial activity of stone crushing, etc.,

by respondent No.9, the petitioner is permitted to make

appropriate application with all the necessary details to the

local office of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,

even as one complaint already appears to have been made

as early as in August 2013.      It is stated on behalf of the

State Pollution Control Board, respondent No.5, that upon a

proper complaint being received with all the relevant and

essential facts, action will be taken in accordance with law in

respect of violation, if any, of the provisions of the Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.    Upon that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             -5-</span>


statement being made and recorded, the petition does not

survive for any further consideration and accordingly it is

disposed as dismissed, with no order as to cost.
