      By this common order, I shall dispose of Crl. M.C. bearing Nos.

3607-12/2006 and 3613-18/2006. By these petitions filed under



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">  Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                       Page 1 of 13</span>
 <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. the petitioners seek quashing of complaint case

No. 122/03 and No. 120/03 respectively under <a href="/doc/1834702/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> read with

<a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_3">Section 142</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioners also

seek directions to set aside the notice dated 09.03.2006 framed by the

learned Trial Court under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_4">Section 251</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Brief facts relevant for deciding the present petitions are:-

      Two complaint cases under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> read with <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_6">Section 142</a> of

Negotiable Instruments Act were filed by respondent No. 1 against the

present petitioners and respondent No. 2. Complaint Case No. 122/03

relates to the dishonour of cheque No. 104352 dated 15.8.2002, while

complaint case No. 120/03       relates to the dishonour of cheque No.

104353 dated 15.9.2002 of Rs. 5 lakhs each. It is stated in both the

complaints that all these petitioners were involved in the business of

jewellery trade and all of them represented as Director/proprietor of

the business concern namely M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers (Pvt.) Ltd. It is

further stated that the accused persons were liable to make payment

for the jewellery supplied by the complainant. It is also mentioned that

accused No. 1 i.e. Mr. Jugal Kishore, Director/Chairman of M/s Kedar

Nath Ratan Lal had issued post dated cheque bearing No. 104352

dated 15.8.2002 for a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs and another cheque bearing



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">  Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                          Page 2 of 13</span>
 No. 104353 dated 15.9.2002 for the same amount. The said accused

No. 1 as per the complaints kept on assuring accused Nos. 2 to 6 that

the above cheques will be duly honoured on their presentation for

encashment. The accused No. 2 to 6 in discharge of their liabilities

issued    another      post dated   cheque bearing   No.   517960   dated

20.9.2002 for a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs drawn on State Bank of India

Dilshad Garden, New Delhi and cheque bearing No. 517961 dated

20.9.2002 drawn on State Bank of India, Dilshad Garden, New Delhi. It

is further stated that accused Nos. 2 to 6 are directly in charge and

responsible for the conduct of the jewellery business and the entire

transactions pertaining to the outstanding amount of the aforesaid

cheques and hence the complaints were filed under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_7">Section 138</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act against the present petitioners and

respondent No. 6.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the complainant has

not   impleaded M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers Pvt. Ltd. as one of the

accused persons.           Counsel further submitted that although the

petitioner Nos. 3 &amp; 4 are directors of the said company but they could

not have been impleaded as accused persons unless the complainant

had impleaded the company in which they are the directors.      Counsel



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">  Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                        Page 3 of 13</span>
 further submitted that the dishonoured cheques are neither issued by

the said company nor signed by any of the petitioners as the same are

signed by Jugal Kishore who is the Director of M/s Kedar Nath Rattan

Lal and therefore only the said company and Jugal Kishore can be held

liable for the dishonoured cheques and not the present petitioners.

</p><p id="p_4">         Opposing the present petitions, counsel for the respondent

submitted that so far as petitioner Nos. 3 and 4 are concerned it is

admitted position that they are directors in M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers

Pvt. Ltd. and in the complaints filed by the respondent, it has been

stated clearly that they are responsible for the day-to-day affairs of

the said company, M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers Pvt. Ltd., as they have

been dealing with the complainant for the purchase of jewellery

articles.   The contention of the counsel for the respondent was that

since they have been implicated in their capacity as Directors of the

said company therefore the complaints         against them would be

maintainable even in the absence of impleadment of the       company.

Counsel for the respondent further submitted that there is an active

collusion and connivance amongst these      petitioners who have been

dealing with the complainant for the purchase of jewellery items on

behalf of M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers Pvt. Ltd. or sometimes on behalf



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">  Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                       Page 4 of 13</span>
 of some other companies.         Counsel thus submitted that once in the

said two complaints specific allegations have been leveled against the

present      petitioners,   therefore,   the   complaints      filed   by     the

respondent/complainant are maintainable against all of them. Counsel

further submitted that the complainant has already been examined

before the trial court and complainant in his evidence has established

the case against these petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       The complaints under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">Section 138</a> read with <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_9">Section 142</a> of

Negotiable Instruments Act were filed by respondent No. 1 based on

dishonoured cheques for a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs each, which were issued

by the firm M/s Kedar Nath Ratan Lal proprietor Shri Goverdhan

Finance Pvt. Ltd. It is not in dispute between the parties that the

payment of the said cheques was stopped by the drawer and these

cheques were signed by Mr. Jugal Kishore, respondent No. 6 for and on

behalf of the said firm. The present petitioners in the said complaints

have    been      arrayed   as   respondent    Nos.   2   to   6   being      the

Directors/Proprietor of M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers Pvt. Ltd. as the

accused persons. In the complaints the complainant has alleged that

all these accused persons were in charge and responsible for the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">  Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                               Page 5 of 13</span>
 conduct of the business of the said private limited company and the

complainant had been supplying jewellery articles to these accused

persons since 1996-97.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_10">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the

offence by the companies, which is reproduced as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           141.
           (1) Offences by companies. If the person committing an
           offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">section 138</a> is a company, every person
           who, at the time the offence was committed, was in
           charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the
           conduct of the business of the company, as well as the
           company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and
           shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished
           accordingly: Provided that nothing contained in this
           sub- section shall render any person liable to
           punishment if he proves that the offence Was committed
           without his knowledge, or that he had exercised all due
           diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.
           (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section
           (1), where any offence under this Act has been
           committed by a company and it is proved that the
           offence has been committed with the consent or
           connivance of, or is attributable to, any neglect on the
           part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer
           of the company, such director, manager, secretary or
           other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of that
           offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and
           punished accordingly, Explanation.- For the purposes of
           this section,-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           (a) " company" means any body corporate and includes a

</p><p id="p_9">      As would be evident from the above <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_12">Section 141</a>, the criminal

liability for the offence by a company under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">Section 138</a> is fastened

vicariously on the persons referred to in Sub Section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_14">Section 141</a>

by virtue of a legal fiction. Such vicarious liability can be fastened on

the Directors of the company only after impleading the company and

also when the complaint clearly discloses the exact role of the

directors at the time of the commission of crime so as to hold them

vicariously liable for the offence committed by the company.

</p><p id="p_10">      In the facts of the present case the complainant has failed to

implead the said company i.e. M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers Pvt. Ltd. as

one of the accused persons and, therefore, in the absence of the said

company been made a party, the counsel for the respondent failed to

impress upon this Court as to how the complainant could have

impleaded the present petitioners as the accused persons in their

capacity as Directors of the said company. The vicarious liability for the

offence committed by the company under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_15">Section 138</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act could be fastened only when the company

is impleaded as one of the accused persons and not in the absence of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">  Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                           Page 7 of 13</span>
 such company unless there is any legal impediment due to which the

company has not been impleaded.                  It is a settled legal position that

that Penal Statutes are required to be construed strictly and criminal

liability cannot be fastened on any person just in a casual manner. It is

not the case of the complainant that the present petitioners were

impleaded in their personal capacity but in their capacity as Directors

of the said company and as already discussed above in the absence of

impledment of the company itself no vicarious liability of the Directors

would arise. It would be useful to refer to recent decision of the Apex

Court reported in <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_16">K.K. Ahuja vs V.K. Vora and Anr. JT</a> 2009(8) SC

691, especially the following paragraphs:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              The criminal liability for the offence by a company under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_17">section 138</a>, is
       fastened vicariously on the persons referred to in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_18">section
       141</a> by virtue of a legal fiction. Penal statutes are to be construed strictly.
       Penal statutes providing constructive vicarious liability should be construed
       much more strictly. When conditions are prescribed for extending such
       constructive criminal liability to others, courts will insist upon strict literal
       compliance. There is no question of inferential or implied compliance.
       Therefore, a specific averment complying with the requirements of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_19">section
       141</a> is imperative. As pointed out in <a href="/doc/141294/" id="a_20">K. Srikanth Singh vs. North East
       Securities Ltd</a> - 2007 (12) SCC 788, the mere fact that at some point of time,
       an officer of a company had played some role in the financial affairs of the
       company, will not be sufficient to attract the constructive liability under
       <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_21">section 141</a> of the Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_22">section 141</a> provides that a Director, Manager,
       Secretary or other officer, though not in charge of the conduct of the business
       of the company will be liable if the offence had been committed with his
       consent or connivance or if the offence was a result of any negligence on his
       part. The liability of persons mentioned in sub-section (2) is not on account of
       any legal fiction but on account of the specific part played - consent and
       connivance or negligence. If a person is to be made liable under sub-section
       (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_23">section 141</a>, then it is necessary to aver consent and connivance, or
       negligence on his part.

     business of the company" occurs not only in <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_25">section 141(1)</a> of the Act but in
     several enactments dealing with offences by companies, to mention a few -
     <a href="/doc/1989338/" id="a_26">Section 278</a> B of the Income Tax Act, 1961, <a href="/doc/1893901/" id="a_27">Section 22C</a> of Minimum Wages
     Act, 1948, <a href="/doc/259762/" id="a_28">Section 86A</a> of the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948, <a href="/doc/7754/" id="a_29">Section

     <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_35">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. But neither <a href="/doc/1755330/" id="a_36">section 141(1)</a> of the Act, nor the
     pari materia provisions in other enactments give any indication as to who are
     the persons responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of
     the company. Therefore, we will have to fall back upon the provisions of
     <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_37">Companies Act</a>, 1956 which is the law relating to and regulating companies.
     <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_38">Section 291</a> of the said Act provides that subject to the provisions of that Act,
     the Board of Directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such
     powers, and to do all such acts and things, as the company is authorised to
     exercise and do. A company though a legal entity can act only through its
     Board of Directors. The settled position is that a Managing Director is prima
     facie in charge of and responsible for the company's business and affairs and
     can be prosecuted for offences by the company. But insofar as other directors
     are concerned, they can be prosecuted only if they were in charge of and
     responsible for the conduct of the company's business. A combined reading of
     <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_39">Sections 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1202543/" id="a_40">291</a> of Companies Act, 1956 with the definitions in clauses
     (24), (26), (30), (31), (45) of <a href="/doc/328668/" id="a_41">section 2</a> of that Act would show that the
     following persons are considered to be the persons who are responsible to the
     company for the conduct of the business of the company : --

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">             <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_42">Section 141</a> uses the words "was in charge of, and was responsible to
     the company for the conduct of the business of the company". It is evident


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                                          Page 9 of 13</span>
        that a person who can be made vicariously liable under sub-section (1) of
       <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_43">Section 141</a> is a person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of
       the business of the company and in addition is also in charge of the business
       of the company. There may be many directors and secretaries who are not in
       charge of the business of the company at all. The meaning of the words
       "person in charge of the business of the company" was considered by this
       Court in <a href="/doc/50504/" id="a_44">Girdhari Lal Gupta v. D.N. Mehta</a> [1971 (3) SCC 189] followed in
       <a href="/doc/443284/" id="a_45">State of Karnataka v. Pratap Chand</a> [1981 (2) SCC 335] and <a href="/doc/1951626/" id="a_46">Katta Sujatha
       vs. Fertiliser &amp; Chemicals Travancore Ltd</a>. [2002 (7) SCC 655]. This Court
       held that the words refer to a person who is in overall control of the day to
       day business of the company. This Court pointed out that a person may be a
       director and thus belongs to the group of persons making the policy followed
       by the company, but yet may not be in charge of the business of the
       company; that a person may be a Manager who is in charge of the business
       but may not be in overall charge of the business; and that a person may be
       an officer who may be in charge of only some part of the business.
         Therefore, if a person does not meet the first requirement, that is being a
       person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of
       the company, neither the question of his meeting the second requirement
       (being a person in charge of the business of the company), nor the question
       of such person being liable under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_47">section 141</a> does not
       arise. To put it differently, to be vicariously liable under sub- section (1) of
       <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_48">Section 141</a>, a person should fulfill the 'legal requirement' of being a person in
       law (under the statute governing companies) responsible to the company for
       the conduct of the business of the company and also fulfill the 'factual
       requirement' of being a person in charge of the business of the company."

of opinion amongst the two Hon'ble Judges and therefore, the matter

decision of Three Judge Bench is yet to be given. In any event of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> Crl.M.C. No. 3607/2006                                                           Page 10 of 13</span>
 facts of the present case as there the appellant was admittedly              a

signatory of       the dishonoured cheques      and the complainant had

impleaded the appellant, without impleading the company and

therefore,       the question arose whether the impleadment of the

company under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_49">Section 138</a> r/w <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_50">Section 141</a> of N.I. Act for the

prosecution of the Director would be necessary or not. However, in

the facts of the present case it is not in dispute that      none of the

petitioners are signatories to the dishonoured cheques and it is only

Jugal Kishore who had signed the dishonoured cheques that too on

behalf of a different company and not           that company where the

accused are stated to be directors. Another indisputable distinction in

the facts of the present case is that in the entire gamut of the two

complaints, the complainant         has leveled allegations against these

petitioners who were allegedly dealing with the complainant           in the

purchase of jewellery items from time to time and it is not the case of

the complainant that they were dealing with           M/s. Mani    Ratnam

Jewellers Pvt.Ltd.        and the petitioners being directors of the said

company were engaged            in carrying out the transactions in       the

purchase of the jewellery items with the complainant. The petitioners

have not disputed so far as petitioners No. 3 and 4 are concerned that

 they are the Directors of M/s Mani Ratnam Jewellers Pvt. Ltd. but as

discussed above they could have been held liable only when the

offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_51">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act is alleged

to have been committed by the said company and the said Directors

were impleaded for their definite and assigned role in their capacity as

Directors of the said company. It is further not in dispute that none of

these petitioners are holding any position in the company i.e. M/s

Kedar Nath Ratan Lal on whose behalf the dishonoured cheques were

signed by Mr. Jugal Kishore and, therefore, the present petitioners

could not have been made liable for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_52">Section 138</a> of

the Negotiable Instruments Act when they had no connection with the

company on whose behalf the dishonoured cheques were issued. It

would be thus apparent that in the absence of any allegation against

M/s. Mani Ratnam Jewellers Pvt. Ltd., it would be difficult to hold the

present petitioners vicariously     liable for the   offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_53">Section

138</a> r/w <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_54">Section 141</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act.
