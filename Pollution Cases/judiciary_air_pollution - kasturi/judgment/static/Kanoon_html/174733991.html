L. MOHAPATRA, J.              This writ application relates to appointment to the post of
</pre><p id="p_7">Chairman, State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner was a faculty of Botany
Department in Ravenshaw University and thereafter he served as Deputy Controller of
Examinations, Council of Higher Secondary Education, Orissa on deputation. The
petitioner also worked as Deputy Director in the Directorate of Higher Education and
thereafter as Deputy Secretary to Government in the Department of Higher Education.
He also worked as Principal, Rajdhani Junior College. The petitioner was also the Senior
Scientist, Forest and Environment Department, Government of Orissa which is
concerned with Environmental Management and Administration. After serving as Senior
Scientist, the petitioner became the Member Secretary, State Pollution Control Board,
Orissa and continued as such till he attained the age of superannuation. It is stated in
the writ application that the petitioner is also the co-author of books published by the
Orissa State Bureau of Text Book Preparation and Production. He also participated in a
specialized training programme on assessment of hazardous Waste Dump, Sites and
Preparation of Remediation of Plants in Germany and had also participated in a number
of National Conferences and Seminars. Since January 2008 the post of Chairman, State
Pollution Control Board was lying vacant. The then Chief Secretary proposed for
appointment of the then Development Commissioner as the Chairman of State Pollution
Control Board and at the same time an order was passed to constitute a Search
Committee for choosing a suitable person for appointment to the post of Chairman, State
Pollution Control Board on regular basis.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        Section-5 of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 provides for
appointment of a Chairman for the State Pollution Control Board. It is provided that State
Board constituted under the Act shall consist of a Chairman, being a person having
special knowledge or practical experience in respect of matters relating to environmental
protection, to be nominated by the State Government, provided that the Chairman may
be either whole time or part time as the State Government may think fit.
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court constituted an Expert Committee under the
Chairmanship of Prof. M.G.K.Menon to examine and recommend measure for protecting
 the environment from the impacts of generation and trans-boundary movement of large
volumes of hazards waste in the country in a Public Interest Litigation filed in the year
1995. The Committee while making recommendations on the relevant issues also
suggested certain eligibility criteria required to be fulfilled for appointment to the post of
Chairman, State Pollution Control Board. The said report of the Committee was
accepted in principle by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India vide order dated 31.8.2007.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court also constituted a 'Supreme Court Monitoring Committee' to
over see the compliance of those recommendations submitted by the Committee.
Supreme Court Monitoring Committee laid down the qualifications for the candidate for
appointment to the post of Chairman, State Pollution Control Board which are as
follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       1) He should have an understanding of the complexity of the modern Science
          and Technology, Pollution Control matter and Environmental Management
          with a sense of vision and feeling for the future.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       2) He should have an understanding and experience in dealing with legal
          matters.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       3) He should be dynamic with administrative experience of leading a scientific
          group as evinced from his track record.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">3.      In view of the order passed by the Hon'ble Chief Minister to constitute a Search
Committee for choosing a suitable person for appointment to the post of Chairman, State
Pollution Control Board on regular basis, a Search Committee was constituted with the
following as it's member.
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">       1.      Chief Secretary                         .... ...      Chairman

       2.      Chairman, Central Pollution
               Control Board, Delhi                    .. ....     Member

       3.      Development Commission-cum-
               Addl.Chief Secretary                     ......       Member

       4.      Dr.C.R.Mohapatra, Former
               Chairman, SPCB, Orissa                   .......      Member

       5.      Principal Secretary, Forest
               And Environment Department        ......      Member Convener

</pre><p id="p_11">4.      The Committee as per the earlier practice decided to issue an advertisement
calling for applications/nominations for appointment to the said post and such
advertisement was published in English Newspaper and in daily Newspaper 'The
Sambada' and in the departmental website. Applications/nominations were invited from
persons who had worked or were working in the State Government/Central Government
Departments/Public Sector Undertakings and Universities and all the eligible criteria had
also been indicated in the said advertisement. In pursuance of the said advertisement,
the petitioner submitted his application. In total 51 applications were received by the
Search Committee and after short listing, 13 candidates were called for interaction
including the petitioner. The petitioner was called upon to appear before the Search
 Committee for interaction on 23rd April 2011. On 26th April, 2011 the Search Committee
selected and recommended three candidates in order of merit and name of the petitioner
found place at serial no.1 in the panel of the selected candidates prepared by the Search
Committee. After completion of entire selection process, a panel was prepared and the
Principal Secretary, F &amp; E Department on the basis of recommendations made by the
Search Committee proposed the name of the petitioner, who was at Serial No.1 of the
merit list, to the Hon'ble Chief Minister for appointment to the post of Chairman, State
Pollution Control Board for a period of three years. In Annexure-1, the Hon'ble Chief
Minister rejected the panel submitted by the Search Committee and recommended by
the Principal Secretary with the following note.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "None of the recommended persons is found suitable and the panel is rejected.
</blockquote>The Search Committee may recommend a fresh    panel".

<p id="p_12">       Challenging the said order passed by the Hon'ble Chief Minister, this writ
application has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.      Shri Jaganath Patnaik, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner at the
time of hearing drew attention of the Court to paragraph-5 of the writ application and
submitted that the Search Committee constituted in terms of the observation made by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above mentioned case formulated a procedure for
selection of a candidate for appointment to the post of Chairman, State Pollution Control
Board. Numerical weightage in respect of all the important parameters/attributes were
decided to be given at the time of selection. The total mark was kept at 10, out of which
two had been assigned for Ph.D. in Science, M.Tech and ME, six marks for twenty years
service including five years in environment management/pollution control and two marks
for experience in handling legal matters as evinced from the type of work performed.
According to Shri Pattnaik, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, the
Search Committee consisted of creative people having ample knowledge and
experience in administration and environmental affairs. The Search Committee having
such experience, had formulated a procedure for selection of the candidate keeping all
parameters/attributes necessary for a candidate to hold the post of Chairman, State
Pollution Control Board. The Search Committee having selected the petitioner as No.1 in
the panel, there was no reason on the part of the Hon'ble Chief Minister to reject the said
recommendation on the ground that none of the persons is found suitable. When the
Search Committee found the petitioner most suitable for appointment to the said
post and placed the petitioner at serial no.1 in the panel of three selected candidates the
reason for which the Hon'ble Chief Minister found all the three selected candidates
unsuitable is not spelt out in the impugned order. Reliance was placed by Shri Patnaik,
learned Senior Counsel on a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
R.S.Mittal Vrs. Union of India reported in 1995 Suppl(2) Supreme Court Cases 230.
With reference to the said decision, it was contended by the learned Senior Counsel that
where there is a vacancy which can be offered to a selected candidate on the basis of
his merit position, denial of appointment to him without a proper reason is unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_14">         Learned Advocate General appearing for the opposite party submitted that
recommendation of the Search Committee is not binding on the Hon'ble Chief Minister
and it is open for him not to accept the recommendation made by the Search Committee
and direct for preparation of a fresh panel. In the impugned order, the Hon'ble Chief
Minister has only done that and, therefore no fault can be found with the impugned order
passed by the Hon'ble Chief Minister.
</p><p id="p_15"> 6.      Undisputedly, by order of the Hon'ble Chief Minister and in terms of the direction
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, a Search Committee had been constituted for selection of
a candidate to be appointed as Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board on regular
basis. Undisputedly, also the Search Committee consisted of members, who were
competent because of their past experience to select a candidate. It is also not disputed
that 51 applications were received and 13 candidates were short listed for interaction.
The petitioner was one of those thirteen candidates. The Search Committee interacted
with all the thirteen candidates and came out with panel of three candidates in order of
merit for the purpose of appointment to the post. The petitioner was placed at serial no.1
in the panel of the three selected candidates. The Principal Secretary, F &amp; E Department
also forwarded the recommendation of the Search Committee for appointment. From the
impugned order passed by the Hon'ble Chief Minister, it is seen that none of the
recommended persons was found suitable. No reason whatsoever has been assigned in
the impugned order as to why any one of the three empanelled candidates was not
found suitable when they had been selected by the Search Committee keeping in mind
the requirements for appointment to the said post. We therefore called upon the learned
Advocate General to produce the relevant records to find out as to whether any reason
has been assigned in the file for rejecting the panel on account of unsuitability.
</p>
<p id="p_16">7.      From the office note, we find that as per the Government order, Search
Committee was constituted with the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary, Government
of Orissa. Dr.C.R. Mohapatra, the former Chairman of State Pollution Control Board and
the Chairman, Central Pollution Control Board were requested to give their consent to be
members of the Search Committee. From the office note dated 26.4.2010, it appears
that after obtaining consent, the Search Committee was constituted. From the office note
dated 4.4.2011, it appears that under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary the
Committee discussed the modalities for selection of a suitable person for the post of
Chairman, State Pollution Control Board and the Committee also decided to apply two
more criteria to further reduce the number of applicants to be called for interaction.
Thereafter short listing was done and the short listed candidates were requested to
appear for interaction with the Search Committee. From the office note dated 26.4.2011,
it appears that Search Committee held three sittings and selected three candidates in
order of merit for the post after interaction with thirteen candidates through a short listing
process out of 51 applicants whose applications had been received in response to an
open advertisement in the newspapers and on the department's website. The following
are the three candidates, who had been selected by the Search Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_17">1.     Dr.Barada Kanta Mishra (Petitioner)

</p><p id="p_18">2.     Shri Suresh Chandra Mohanty.
</p>
<p id="p_19">3.     Prof.(Dr.) Pramod Chandra Mishra.
</p>
<p id="p_20">        The Principal Secretary in the said note stated that the petitioner, who is at serial
no.1 of the Search Committee panel may, perhaps, be appointed as Chairman, Orissa
State Pollution Control Board for a period of three years from the date of assuming
office. The then Chief Secretary also agreed to the said proposal and the file was placed
before the Hon'ble Chief Minister. The Hon'ble Chief Minister passed the order on
7.7.2011 as quoted above but the record does not disclose any reason on the basis of
which, none of the three candidates selected by the Search Committee was not found
suitable.
</p><p id="p_21"> 8.      The decision relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel Shri Pattnaik appearing
for the petitioner relates to appointment to the post of Judicial Member, Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal. From the said reported judgment, it appears that for appointment to
the above post a Selection Board was constituted headed by a sitting Judge and the
Board prepared a panel of selected candidates and sent its recommendations to the
Central Government for consideration. The Central Government did not make any
appointment and issued fresh advertisement inviting applications for the said post. The
action of the Central Government was challenged before the Tribunal and ultimately the
matter came before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In paragraph-10 of the judgment, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_22">        "The Tribunal dismissed the application by the impugned judgment on the
following reasoning:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (a) The selection panel was merely a list of persons found suitable and does not
           clothe the applicants with any right of appointment. The recommendations of
           the Selection Board were directory and not mandatory and were not
           therefore enforceable by issue of a writ of mandamus by the Court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (b) The letter of Ministry of Home Affairs dated 8.2.1982 which extends the life of
           panel till exhausted is not relevant in the present case. In the circumstances
           the life of the panel in this case cannot go beyond 18 months and as such
           expired in July 1989.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       It is no doubt correct that a person on the select panel has no vested right to be
       appointed to the post for which he has been selected. He has a right to be
       considered for appointment. But at the same time, the appointing authority
       cannot ignore the select panel or decline to make the appointment on its whims.
       When a person has been selected by the Selection Board and there is a
       vacancy which can be offered to him, keeping in view his merit position, then,
       ordinarily, there is no justification to ignore him for appointment. There has to be
       a justifiable reason to decline to appoint a person who is on the select panel. In
       the present case, there has been a mere inaction on the part of the Government.
       No reason whatsoever, not to talk of a justifiable reason, was given as to why
       the appointments were not offered to the candidates expeditiously and in
       accordance with law. The appointment should have been offered to Mr. Murgad
       within a reasonable time of availability of the vacancy and thereafter to the next
       candidate. The Central Government's approach in this case was wholly
       unjustified".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">9.      In view of the above observation made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said
reported case, no reason having been assigned in the order in Annexure-1 as to why the
candidates selected by the Search Committee were not found suitable for appointment,
the said order is liable to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_24">10.    We are conscious of the fact that recommendation of the Search Committee is
not binding on the Hon'ble Chief Minister but at the same time when a panel is rejected
on the ground that the selected candidates were not suitable for appointment to the post,
such observation has to be on the basis of justifiable reasons. No reason whatsoever
having been assigned in the said order in Annexure-1 while coming to a conclusion that
none of the empanelled candidate is suitable for appointment, we find no other option
 except quashing the order in Annexure-1 and remit the matter back to the Hon'ble Chief
Minister for reconsideration of the case in the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court quoted above. The writ application is disposed of accordingly.
</p>
