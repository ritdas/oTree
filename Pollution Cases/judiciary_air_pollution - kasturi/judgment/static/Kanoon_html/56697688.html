                     was being run by the respondents since 1978. The stand taken by the

                     respondents is that the same was set up in the year 1989. So, the

                     industry was set up without getting the consent of the Board and as

                     such there is violation of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_15">Section 25</a> of the Act, which is punishable

                     under <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_16">Sections 44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_17">47</a> of the Act. Mere fact that later on consent

                     was granted is not a ground for dismissing the complaint.

                     given if the application for grant of consent is not refused within 4

                     months. In Exhibit PG, the factum of receipt of request for consent

                     has been admitted.         There is no document on the file that the said

                     consent was ever refused. It was only in the year 1993 that the Board

                     started raising objection. Otherwise also, later on consent was granted

                     by the Board. It is further submitted that the respondents have later on

                     closed the industry. The matter relates to the year 1990 i.e. last about

                     more than 23 years and the complaint was filed in the year 1993 i.e.

                     for the last more that 20 years. So, prayer has been made for dismissal

</p>
<p id="p_31">                                   From the evidence on the file, it emerges out that case of the

                     accused is that the industry was set up in the month of November,

                     1989 and the application was moved in the month of February 1990.

                     the said factual position could not be disputed during the course of

                     arguments.         However, the submission made by counsel for the

                     appellant was that earlier also industry was set up but was carried on

                     by the previous owner. However, the fact remains that the present

                     accused cannot be held liable for the criminal act of the earlier owner.

                     The respondent company after acquiring the company have submitted

                     application for grant of consent. Exhibit PG depicts that request for

                     giving consent was received. The Board has not taken any action

                     against the company till the year 1993. It was only in the year 1993,

                     the objections have been raised regarding not obtaining consent of the

                     Board. <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_23">Section 25</a> (7) envisages that if            a request for obtaining

                     consent is moved and that is not refused or given within 4 months in

                     that case, the same would have been presumed to be allowed. It is

                     also not disputed during the course of arguments that later on consent

                     was granted to the company.

<p id="p_32">                                   According to the assertion made in the complaint itself, JE of

                     the Board has visited the premises of the company in the year 1993.

                     So, he was not in a position to depose about the condition of the

                     discharge of trade effluent from the year 1990-1993.

</p><p id="p_33">                                   It is also not disputed during the course of arguments that the

                     respondent/industry has since been closed.
