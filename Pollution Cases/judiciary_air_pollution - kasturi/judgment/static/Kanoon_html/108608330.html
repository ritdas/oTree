CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH

Date: 06-02-2017

                       Nobody appears on behalf of the petitioner.

                       The matter was listed for out of turn hearing on the

   basis of motion slip filed on behalf of learned counsel for the

   petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                       A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.19693 of 2016 dt.06-02-2017

        respondents no. 2 and 3.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                             The petitioner has moved the Court being aggrieved

        by the order to close the unit and refusal of consent by the Bihar State

        Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to as the 'Board').

</p><p id="p_11">                             Learned counsel appearing for the respondents no. 2

        and 3 submitted that the petitioner has approached the Court after

        inordinate delay as the impugned order was passed in August, 2014,

        whereas the writ petition has been filed in December, 2016. He

        further submitted that there is an alternative statutory remedy in terms

        of <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> of The Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

        1981. As the matter relates to air pollution, which is a serious

        environmental issue, the Court called upon the learned counsel for

        the State to know as to whether the unit is running or has been closed

        in terms of the order impugned of the Board. Learned counsel for the

        respondents no. 2 and 3 submitted that they had communicated to the

        District Magistrate, Patna by letter dated 09.03.2015 requesting him

        to ensure that the factory was closed in terms of the order impugned.

</p><p id="p_12">                             In view of the position aforesaid and the fact that

        nobody appears to press the writ application, the same stands

        dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                             However, learned counsel for the Board as well as

        the State shall ensure that the order impugned is implemented
         Patna High Court CWJC No.19693 of 2016 dt.06-02-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                 3/3</span>




                forthwith, if already not done. It would be the duty of the learned

                counsel for the respondents no. 2 and 3 and the State to communicate

                the order to the concerned authorities for compliance.
