</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Issue raised in these writ petitions being connected, these

writ petitions were heard together and                 are disposed of by

common judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. First I shall deal with WP(c).No.5579/2009. Challenge in

this writ petition is mainly against Ext.P22, an order passed by the

first respondent. The controversy in this writ petition relates to

the proposal of the 3rd respondent Municipality to establish a LPG

powered burning ground in the property in Sy. No.360/3 and

360/4 of Manathala Village.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    It would appear that way back in 1994, the 3rd

respondent Municipality initiated steps for establishing a burning

and burial ground in the plot in question, for which they had

obtained clearance from the District Collector. At that stage some

of the residents of the area filed a suit before the Munciff's Court,

Chavakkad as O.S.No.136/1996. An Advocate Commissioner was

appointed, his report was submitted and evidence was also

recorded. Finally, by judgment dated 27.2.1999, the Munsiff's

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  :2 :</span><p id="p_4">



Court dismissed O.S.No.136/1996 permitting the Municipality to

proceed with the work, subject to the conditions mentioned in the

judgment of which one was that it should only be a burning

ground and not a burial ground. The plaintiffs carried the matter

in appeal before the District Court, Trissur in A.S. NO. 233/1999,

which was also dismissed by judgment dated 7.11.2003 and that

judgment is called in question in R.S.A.No.602/2004 before this

court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4. Petitioners herein are also residents of Manathala Village

in Chavakkad Municipality. They state that they live in close

proximity to the site identified by the Municipality for establishing

the burning ground, subject to the condition imposed by the civil

court in the judgment referred to above. They also state that

initially when they made complaint to the Revenue Divisional

Officer,   an enquiry was conducted       thorough the Tahsildar,

Chavakkad and           Ext.P1 order was passed by the Revenue

Divisional Officer, prohibiting construction activities. It is stated

that the Municipality filed an appeal against Ext.P1 and during

the pendency of the appeal, some of the residents of the area

filed O.P.No.5938/99 before this Court and that Original Petition

was disposed of by Ext.P5 judgment directing that the status quo

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  :3 :</span><p id="p_6">



be maintained till the disposal of appeal against Ext.P1.

</p><p id="p_7">      5. According to the petitioners, during the aforesaid period,

Exts.P6 and P7 reports were submitted by the District Medical

Officer, Trissur on 15.9.2001 and 1.6.2002, concluding that the

site in question is not suitable for establishing a burning ground

as proposed by the Municipality. At about that stage, the appeal

filed by the Municipality against Ext.P1 was heard by the District

Collector and by Ext.P8 order dated 7.6.2002, the District

Collector set aside Ext.P1, but however clarified that the order

will not confer any right on the Municipality to establish a burning

ground contravening the provisions of CRZ notification and other

statutory provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      6. Again another complaint was made by local people to

the Government         which lead to Ext.P10 order, by which    the

Government of Kerala stayed          use of the area as a burning

ground. While the matter was thus pending before the

Government, complaints were made to the Science and

Technology Department and Pollution Control Board. While so, by

Ext.P14 order, without issuing notice, the Government allegedly

vacated Ext.P10 order staying use of the area in question as a

burning ground. That order was challenged before this court in

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                :4 :</span><p id="p_9">



WP(c).No.34653/2003 in which Ext.P15 interim order was passed

staying the operation of Ext.P14 order of the Government. The

writ petition was finally disposed of by Ext.P16 judgment, setting

aside Ext.P14 and directing reconsideration of the matter with

notice to the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      7.   In the meanwhile, the Municipality      issued Ext.P17

tender notice inviting tenders for the construction of a compound

wall and that lead to the filing of WP(c).No. 29848/2005 before

this Court. That writ petition was also disposed of by Ext.P18

judgment, directing that in the absence of any sanction from the

appropriate statutory authorities, the Municipality shall not

proceed with the proposal what so ever to convert the land in

question into a burning ground. In the meantime, by Ext.P20, the

Pollution Control Board granted consent to the Municipality to

establish a burning ground. That order is challenged by the

petitioner in WP(c).No.10467/2008 and the permission granted by

the Coastal Zone Management Authority was challenged in WP

</p><p id="p_11">(c).NO.13043/2008.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      8.   Pursuant to the directions of this court in Ext.P16

judgment, Government issued notice, heard all parties and finally

passed Ext.P22 order dated 5.1.2009. By this order, the

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   :5 :</span><p id="p_13">



Government overruled the objections raised by the petitioners

against opening of a burning bed (gas fired crematorium) by the

Chavakkad Municipality in the site in question. It is challenging

this order that this writ petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_14">      9. The contention raised by the counsel for the petitioners is

mainly that, Ext.P22 order impugned in the writ petition does not

reflect proper consideration of the objections raised by them. It is

also their contention that several documents which were not

produced either at the time of hearing or at any time with notice

to them,have been relied on by the Government. Yet another

contention raised is that in establishing of a crematorium, the

Municipality has not complied with the requirements of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_1">Section

484</a> of the Municipalities Act.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      10.    I heard the arguments of the learned Government

Pleader appearing for respondents 1 and 2 and the learned Sr.

Counsel appearing for the 3rd respondent Municipality.

</p><p id="p_16">      11. The first contention to be examined is whether there

has been        proper consideration of the points urged by the

petitioners.    The sustainability of this contention  has   to be

judged in the light of the contents of Ext.P22 order and keeping in

view the limited scope of examination in a proceedings for judicial

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     :6 :</span><p id="p_17">



review. A reading of the above order shows that in paragraph 5 of

the order, the Government have noticed 13 conditions which were

urged by the petitioners. Proceeding further, each of these

conditions have been dealt with by the Government in the

following manner.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                  1. The Chavakkad Municipality proposes to open
                  an LPG fired burning bed in the proposed site and
                  not a burning and burial ground as alleged by the
                  petitioner. It has been contended on behalf of the
                  petitioners that the site in question is at a distance
                  of 100 meters from the shore line which is
                  declared as a prohibited area for any construction
                  under the Environmental Protection Act. In this
                  connection the Hon'ble Munsiff Court, Chavakkad
                  in its judgment dated 27.2.1999 in O.S.No.136/96
                  has observed as follows.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      "On going through the various provisions in this
                      ACT 9      find that the proposed burial/burning
                      ground cannot be brought in the category of the
                      buildings that are restricted under the provisions of
                      the   environment<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_2">(Protection)    Act</a>.  Further   the
                      Chavakkad Municipality has obtained necessary
                      CRS sanction from Government of Kerala in
                      Science &amp; Technology Department as per Order
                      No.1587/A2/06/S&amp;TD dated 28.12.2007."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">                 2. The second contention that there are other
                 unopposed sites for establishing a cremation
                 ground. It is a fact that two other places were
                 considered for a crematorium. But it was dropped
                 for non receipt of NOC and site approval from DMO
                 (H).
</p>
<p id="p_20">                 3. It is further contended that there other burning
                 grounds adjacent to the Chavakkad Municipality

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   :7 :</span><p id="p_21">



</p><p id="p_22">                 and that there is no further necessity to open a
                 new crematorium. Petitioners have pointed out
                 that there is a burial ground in the Guruvayoor
                 Municipality which is only 5 kms away from the
                 proposed crematorium and that there is another
                 burial   ground    in  the   adjacent     Kadapuram
                 Panchayat which is only at a distance of 2.5 Kms
                 from the proposed burial ground. It is also argued
                 that there is no difficulty to anybody in disposing
                 the dead bodies in the aforesaid burial grounds
                 and therefore there is no necessity for a new
                 crematorium.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                 4.     Government have examined this aspect in
                 detail.   Petitioners  admitted   that    Chavakkad
                 Municipality has no burial ground. Taluk hospital is
                 situated within the Municipality and postmortems
                 are conducted there. It is the contention of the
                 Municipality that unclaimed dead bodies were
                 buried in the site proposed for the crematorium. It
                 has also to be considered that rapid urbanization
                 and further reduction of the extent of properties of
                 individuals due to the division of joint families into
                 independent and separate residences make it
                 impossible to bury or cremate the bodies in the
                 land adjacent to the houses Inconvenience to the
                 neighbours will be high in Municipal areas than in
                 remote Panchayats as the increased density of
                 population and residential houses will be much
                 more in such areas. Recently the electronic media
                 as well as the prim media have reported instances
                 in which poor downtrodden SC families were forced
                 to bury the dead bodies of their family members
                 within the house itself especially in the kitchen.
                 This has created much uproar as it should not
                 happen in a civilized society like ours. The Lok
                 Ayukta as well as the state Human Rights
                 Commission have initiated steps against the local
                 bodies as well as the Government for this highly
                 deplorable state of affairs. Such a situation has to
                 be averted at any cost. Hence         the opinion of

</p><p id="p_25">                 Government is that the Chavakkad Municipality
                 should have a crematorium in its own.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                 5. The petitioners argued that the site in question
                 is not at all suitable for establishing a crematorium.
                 It has to be admitted that the DMO, Trissur as per
                 letters    No.C2-1602201      dated   15.9.2001    and
                 1.6.2002 has opined that the place in question is
                 not suitable for a crematorium. This was mainly on
                 the ground that there are dwelling houses within
                 the distance limits fixed by the law. But in the
                 earlier report given by the DMO, Trissur in 1994 it
                 is stated that the nearest houses numbered XI/47
                 owned by Shri. Velayi, S/o.Raman, Kopra House is
                 situated at a distance of 52 mts from the South
                 Eastern boundary of the site. Further he has stated
                 in unequivocal terms that the site in question is
                 suitable from the public health point of view for
                 establishing a public burning and burial ground.
                 The Kerala Panchayat Raj(Burning and Burial
                 Ground)Rules, 1998 laid down that the position as
                 on the date of application for opening a
                 burning/burial ground has to be taken. It has also
                 been evidenced from the judgment of the Hon'ble
                 Munsiff, Chavakkad in O.S.136/96             that the
                 Municipality has set up a case that there are
                 several authorized occupation of the houses and
                 huts hear the proposed burial ground. The
                 Municipality has also issued notices under the
                 <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_3">Municipalities Act</a> to vacate the premises as
                 unauthorized occupation.         In the light of the
                 aforesaid reason government is of the opinion that
                 the position existed as on 1994 ie at the time of
                 submitting the application is crucial. It is an
                 admitted fact that there was neither dwelling nor
                 sources of water within the prescribed distance
                 limit ie. 50 mts. from the proposed site.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                 6. It is also contended that Municipal building rules
                 lay down that orders regarding a burial grounds
                 have to be issued by the District Collector. The

</p><p id="p_29">                 Kerala Municipalities Act governs the opening and
                 maintaining process of the burning/burial grounds
                 according to which NOC for the construction of the
                 burning ground has to be issued by the District
                 Collector where as the licence has to be issued by
                 the    Municipality    itself. In the  instant  case
                 necessary NOC has already been issued by the
                 District Collector.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                 7.    The contention regarding burning and burial
                 ground Rules 1967 stipulates that there shall not
                 be any dwelling house within 90 mts. of the
                 boundary lines of the proposed burning ground is
                 also devoid of merits. The Kerala Municipality Act
                 1994    alone    is    applicable in  the   case  of
                 Municipalities which stipulates that there shall not
                 be any dwelling houses or water sources within 50
                 mts. of the proposed site. Therefore the above
                 contention of the petitioners is also unsustainable.

</p><p id="p_31">                 8. The next contention is that no paper publication
                 has been made. From the records produced it is
                 seen that the contention of the petitioner is true.
                 But it has to be pointed out that the Chavakkad
                 Municipality has obtained all the necessary
                 sanction from the concerned authorities.

</p><p id="p_32">                 9. The contention that opening and operating a
                 burial ground will pollute the fresh water sources is
                 also without merits. Kerala State Pollution Control
                 Board has given consent to establish an LPG fired
                 crematorium         as        per   consent      NO.
</p><p id="p_33">                 PCB/DO.TSR/CE/53/07          dated  7.7.2007.   This
                 consent was issued under Water(Prevention and

                 and Control of Pollution)Act 1981.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                 10. It is evident that the Municipality has obtained
                 statutory clearances from the Pollution Control
                 Board    and    the    Government    in  Science   &amp;

</p><p id="p_36">                 issued on stringent conditions ensuring that there
                 will not be either air or water pollution a alleged by
                 the petitioner. It is also clear that an LPG fired
                 crematorium will not cause any air or water
                 pollution if at all it is adjacent to the coast.

</p><p id="p_37">                 11. Regarding contention of the petitioner that the
                 proposed site is adjacent to a Tourist spot is also
                 baseless.      On a perusal of the connected
                 documents it is noticed that no evidence to
                 substantiate this arguments has been produced at
                 any stage. Sanction to construct a crematorium or
                 Burning ground will be invariably on strict
                 conditions    such       as   (1)  all  sides   of  the
                 burning/burial ground will be covered with walls
                 and (2) there should be plant and trees within the
                 proposed site. As a result a person standing
                 outside the burning/ burial ground cannot have a
                 view of the same. Further the Municipality has
                 stated that they propose to develop a park in the
                 portion which remains after construct a burning
                 bed in the site in question.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                 12. Another objection raised by the petitioner is
                 that District Medical Officer(H), Trissur has not
                 inspected the site in question. In this context
                 attention is invited to letter No.C2-19091 dated
                 21.10.1994 of the DMO(H) Trissur addressed to the
                 District Collector, Trissur where it is stated that the
                 Deputy District Medical Officer(H) North Zone
                 Trissur has inspected the site in question. A Senior
                 Officer of the stature of a DMO(H), who is heavily
                 pre occupied cannot be expected to make
                 inspections of all such places personally. He has to
                 rely and depend on his subordinates on such tasks
                 Therefore there is not much substance in the
                 above contention.
</p>
<p id="p_39">                 13. It is alleged that the regulation regarding the
                 distance has not been observed in this case. Kerala
                 Municipality Act stipulates that there shall be no

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  :11 :</span><p id="p_40">



</p><p id="p_41">                 dwelling houses or sources of water within a radius
                 of 50 meters from the proposed site. The DMO(H)
                 Trissur has pointed out as early as in 1994 that
                 there is no residential houses or any other
                 institutions situated within a radius of 50 meters
                 from the periphery of the site. Further the
                 Advocate Commissioner appointed by the Hon'ble
                 Munsiff Court, Chavakkad has reported that there
                 are o houses or huts in a distance within 97.4
                 meters    from   the  burning    bed.   The   Kerala
                 Panchayat Raj Act 1998 laid down that the position
                 as on the date of application for a burning/burial
                 ground    has    to   be   considered    in  similar
                 circumstances. From the evidence adduced it is
                 clear that there was neither dwelling houses nor
                 water sources while the Municipality initiated steps
                 to open a burning ground in 1994.
</p>
<p id="p_42">                 14.    Petitioners fear that there will be health
                 hazards by opening of the burning ground. It is a
                 proven fact that the rules and regulations
                 connected with the opening of a burning ground
                 have been observed in this case During 1994 itself
                 the DMO(H), Trissur has pointed out that there are
                 no dwelling houses within 50 mts. of the proposed
                 site. The Pollution Control Board has also issued
                 necessary certificate. It has also to be pointed out
                 that the Municipality proposes to install an LPG
                 fired crematorium which will not cause pollution as
                 apprehended by the petitioners."
</p>
<p id="p_43">     12.     A reading of the above        shows that each of the

contentions raised by the petitioners have been dealt with by the

Government in the light of the materials which were available

before it. By no stretch of imagination can it be said that any

relevant aspect has been omitted or that any irrelevant material

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  :12 :</span><p id="p_44">



has entered into the consideration of the Government. In my

view, all the contentions raised have been properly considered

and the findings arrived at by the Government on each of issues,

are perfectly consistent with the materials which were available

before the Government. For that reason I am not prepared to

accept the contention raised by the counsel for the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_45">      13. It was further contended that many documents which

were not produced either at the time of hearing or any any time

with notice to       the petitioners have been relied on by     the

Government in Ext.P22 order. According to the learned counsel

for the petitioners, the judgment in .OS.136/96, the NOC issued

by the District Collector, Commission Report in the suit, Consent

order issued by the Pollution Control Board, sanction issued by

the Science and Technology Department and Ext.P2 order of the

District Medical Officer were not available before the Government

at the time when the parties were heard. It is stated that the

Government have without notice to them, accepted these

documents and considered the documents and in that view of the

matter, natural justice has been violated. In my view, violation of

principles of natural justice by itself will not invalidate any

executive action unless the person who complains of violation of

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  :13 :</span><p id="p_46">



principles of natural justice is also able to satisfy the court that in

the process, prejudice has been caused to him. In this case,

petitioners have no case that, the documents mentioned above

were not in existence nor do they have a case that the contents

as noticed in Ext.P22 order are factually incorrect. If that be so, I

wonder in what manner can be petitioners contend that any

prejudice has been caused to them.            Further prejudice is a

question of fact, which should be pleaded and proved. In this case

there is neither any pleading nor any proof in this respect.

Therefore this court cannot find that any        prejudice has been

caused and consequently the plea of violation of principles of

natural justice has to fail.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      14. The third contention raised for consideration is whether

the requirements of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_5">Section 484</a> are to be complied with when a

Municipality establishes a burning ground. <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_6">Section 484</a> of the

Municipalities Act provide for licensing of places for disposal of

the dead. This section provides that no new place for disposal of

the dead, whether private or public, shall be opened, formed

constructed or used except on a licence from the Municipality.

Sub section (2) provides that an application for licence under

Section (1) shall be accompanied by a plan of the place to be

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                :14 :</span><p id="p_48">



registered showing the locality, boundary and extent thereof, the

name of the owner or person or community interested therein,

the system of management and such other particulars as the

Municipality may require. Manner in which an application is to be

dealt with is provided in sub Section(3), which was introduced in

to the statute by Act 14 of 1999. This sub section provides that on

receipt of the application the Secretary shall send the application

to the Municipal Health Officer and in his absence to the District

Medical Officer of the Health Department having jurisdiction over

the area and the concerned District Collector for their opinion. It

provides for issuance of a public notice inviting objections and

suggestions, if any, regarding the application. Sub section (4)

provides that once the aforesaid process is completed,

Municipality may grant or refuse to grant license or postpone the

grant of licence until objections are dealt with.     <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_7">Section 485</a>

provides for setting up     crematoria within or without Municipal

area. Sub Section (1) provides that every municipality shall,

where there is no necessary land or arrangement to be used as

burial or burning ground or crematoria, arrange land to be used

as burial or burning grounds or crematoria within or outside the

limits of the Municipal area, by meeting the expenses from the

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                 :15 :</span><p id="p_49">



municipality fund in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_8">Section 484</a>

and may charge rent and fees for the use there from. The proviso

to the section provides that in providing burial and burning

grounds outside the limits of the Municipal area,, the opinion of

the DMO shall be sought and the prior permission of the Local

Self Government Institution,       within the area of which it is

intended to be provided, shall be obtained. Sub Section (3)

provides that where municipality provides any such place, outside

its limit, all the    provisions of the Act and  bye laws framed

thereunder for the management of the places shall apply to such

a place.
</p>
<p id="p_50">      15. From the above provisions, it can therefore be seen

that, if a burning ground is to be established there must be a

licence obtained from the Municipality under <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_9">Section 484</a> of the

Municipalities Act. Question is whether a Municipality is required

to obtain license, if it is establishing a burning ground. In my

view, it need not except in a case where it is proposed to locate a

burning ground, outside the area of the Municipality concerned.

Otherwise, a Municipality will have to make application to itself,

hear objections and by itself decide on the application by itself.

Therefore, on a combined reading of the provisions of the Act, I

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                   :16 :</span><p id="p_51">



am of the view         that if a Municipality is providing a burning

ground within its own area, the question of licence as provided in

<a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_10">Section 484</a> does not apply. At the same time, procedural

formalities which       are prescribed cannot be compromised, to

ensure that public interest is safeguarded. If these requirements

are not complied with, the Municipality will be free to establish a

burial ground, without      any regard to public health, suitability of

the site etc. and the affected general public will have no forum to

ventilate their objections       in the matter.   Such unrestricted

freedom,     affecting    public   interest  cannot   be  conceded.

Therefore, the requirement of getting clearance from the Health

Officer, DMO or the District Collector as the case may be and

issue of public notice or the distance factor specified in <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_11">Section

485A</a> cannot be dispensed with.           In this case, Ext.P2 is the

clearance issued by the District Medical Officer and the District

Collector also has issued NOC which has been taken note of by

the Government in Ext.P22. Similarly, the Municipality had

obtained consent from the Pollution Control Board and it being an

area covered by CRZ notification, has obtained sanction from the

Science and Technology Department as well. Of the various

requirements of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_12">Section 484</a> the only requirement which the

WPC.No.10467/2009 &amp; Ors.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  :17 :</span><p id="p_52">



Municipality can be accused of having not complied with, is the

requirement of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_13">Section 484(3)(b)</a>, which provides for a public

notice inviting objections and suggestions, if any, regarding the

application.     The question is whether       this has caused any

prejudice to the petitioners herein. Here again, fact remains that

petitioners were given an effective opportunity of hearing by the

Government before issuing         Ext.P22 order. In my view, that

opportunity was more       effective and sufficient than a routine

hearing by Municipality for the reason that in an ordinary course

if public notice is issued by the Municipality in pursuance to its

own decision to establish a burning ground, hearing will also be

by    the Municipality only. On the other hand in this case

petitioners were heard by the Government where they raised

their objections and canvassed their respective positions before

an impartial third party. Therefore, no prejudice has been caused

to the petitioners, on account of the fact that there has not been

a public notice in this particular case. Thus, in the peculiar facts of

this case I am not persuaded to think that, absence of public

notice has caused prejudice to the petitioners or that the

petitioners were deprived of their opportunity to raise their

objections regarding the site proposed by the Municipality.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                :18 :</span><p id="p_53">



Therefore, on an over all consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am

not persuaded to think that there has not been any violation of

the provisions under <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_14">Section 484</a> of the Municipalities Act.

</p><p id="p_54">      16. Counsel for the petitioner then contended that even if it

is assumed that the petitioner had an opportunity of hearing, still

fact remains that there are various other complainants who did

not get an opportunity to be heard. In this context, the learned

Senior Counsel for the respondents points out that in terms of

<a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_15">section 485A</a> of the Municipalities Act, no Municipality shall grant

license under <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_16">Section 484</a> for using any place as crematoria for

burial or burning of dead bodies within a distance of 50 meters

from the residential buildings or utilize for such purpose under

<a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_17">Section 485</a>. It is pointed out that the Commissioner appointed by

the Civil Court has found that there wre no houses or huts within

the 94.7 meters from the burning ground. It is pointed out that

the statutorily prescribed distance     being only 50 meters, if at

all anybody is aggrieved by the establishment of the burning

ground or if at all any person who has a legal right to object to

the establishment of a burial ground, such person should be a

It is stated that in view of the fact that, admittedly the nearest

resident is beyond 97.4 meters from the site, none can have a

valid complaint of having not heard in the matter.

</p><p id="p_56">      17. True as contended by the counsel for the respondents

the statutorily prescribed distance from residential premises for

establishing crematoria or burning or       burial ground, is     50

meters. As is seen from paragraph 5 and 13 of Ext.P22 order of

the Ist respondent, the Commissioner has found that there was

no house or hut within a distance of 97.4 meters. In such a factual

situation, the legal right of none can said to be affected by non-

publication of the public notice in terms of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_18">Section 484(3)(b)</a> of

the Municipalities Act.
</p>
<p id="p_57">      18. Learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that while

overruling their objections in Ext.P22 order, the Government have

ignored Exts.P6 and P7 reports submitted by the District Medical

Officer. Ext.P6 is a report submitted by the District Medical Officer

on 15.9.2001. A reading of this report shows that according to

the DMO, the site is objectionable for the reason that the area is

one of the important tourist beach in Chavakkad Municipality, that

visitors used drinking water from the neighboring wells in the

locality and also are using the place as resting place and that on

the western side is sea shore. It is also stated that during raining

season the water will accumulate in the area and the northern

and eastern sides are      thickly populated area. It is also stated

that being a coastal area, the wind is blowing over all time and

therefore during burning time, fumes will pass to the populated

areas. In Ext.P7, the District Medical Officer has only enclose a

copy of Ext.P6 and forwarded the same to the Additional District

Magistrate, Trissur. The question is whether Ext.P6, would have

affected the findings of the Government in Ext.P22. In my view,

the answer has to be in the negative. This is for the reason that a

reading of Ext.P6 gives the impression that the District Medical

Officer was not considering the suitability of site for establishing

a LPG gas fired crematorium. On the other hand it is evident that

the District Medical Officer was considering the suitability of the

site for a burial ground, emanating smoke, fume etc. which can

be the case, if fire wood or such other materials are used. In any

case, the burial ground being an LPG fired one, can have no

impact    either on air or water contrary to what is       stated in

Ext.P6 . Therefore, in my view, Exts.P6 an P7 will not improve the

case of the petitioners in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_59">      19.    Further the counsel also relied on Ext.P3, yet another

report submitted by the Medical Officer in charge of Primary

Health Center to the District Medical Officer. This is dated

26.3.1996. Counsel contends that Ext.P3 talks about existence of

several residential houses in the close proximity of the site

identified by the Municipality.     However, fact remains    that

pursuant to the order passed by the Civil Court         Advocate

Commissioner visited the place and submitted his report. The

findings in Ext.P3 are irrelevant as the finding of the Advocate

Commissioner        was    accepted   by   the  Civil  Court   in

O.S.No.136/1996. Therefore Ext.P3 cannot alter the situation.

</p><p id="p_61">     20.     Ext.P19 is yet another document relied on by the

learned Counsel for the petitioners. This order is issued by the

Local Self Government Department, requiring the Secretaries of

the Local bodies to ensure that the instructions issued in this

order are carried out scrupulously. This order shows that it was

issued pursuant to an order passed by the Apex Court in WP(c).

No.657/95 directing that there should be on immediate ban on

burning of any material on the beaches. Accordingly, Ext.P19 was

issued imposing         a ban on burning any material, whether

hazardous or non-hazardous, on the beaches in the State. The

approved site plan attached to Ext.P20,, shows that, the site in

question is not a part of the beach, but at best is close too the

beach. Further,        in so far as this case is concerned,    the

petitioners have obtained clearance from both Science and

Technology Department and also consent from the Pollution

Control Board, at whose instance Ext.P19 has been issued.

Therefore, Ext.P19 is of no relevance in so far as this case is

concerned. For the aforesaid reasons, Ext.P22 deserves to be

upheld and WP(c).No.5579/2009 has to fail.

</p><p id="p_63">      21. As far as WP(c).No. 10467/2008 is concerned, what is

under challenge is Ext.P23 therein , which is the consent issued

by the Pollution Control Board. The only objection raised by the

petitioners is that the said order was issued without notice to the

petitioners. Similarly, in WP(c).No.13043/2008, what is under

challenge is Ext.P16 therein, an order issued by the Science and

Technology Department, Government of Kerala, granting licence

to the Municipality to establish the burning ground. The objection

raised is that, this too has been issued without notice to the

petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_64">      22. First of all the petitioners have not pursued appellate

remedy that is available to them against consent granted by the

Pollution Control Board. They have        also no case that the

procedures prescribed for issuance of the order have not been

complied with.       The other ground on which these orders are

challenged is by relying on Ext.P19 circular referred to above. I

have already held that Ext.P19 is of no relevance and that the

concerned authorities themselves have considered the matter

and granted permission. Therefore I do not find any reason to

invalidate the impugned order. Therefore WP(c).Nos. 10467/2008

&amp; 13043/2008 are dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_66">      23. In so far as RS.A.No.602/2004 is concerned, the only

grievance highlighted      is that both the trial court and the

appellate court erred in its finding on the question of nuisance

caused to the appellants. However, a reading of paragraph 28 of

the trial court judgment shows that the ground on which the

contention of the plaintiffs has been rejected is that their

grievance is premature and apprehensive.         Having regard to

the fact that even as on date the burning ground has not been

established, in my view the trial court     was   justified  in its

conclusion. Further the aforesaid finding is not conclusive and

even in spite of the said finding, if any nuisance is caused, it is

always open to the plaintiffs to seek redressal of their grievance

before the appropriate court at the appropriate stage. In any

case, the appellants have not succeeded in raising any substantial

question of law for entertaining the second appeal. Therefore RSA

No.602/2004 is only to be dismissed and I do so.

</p><p id="p_68">     In the result, the writ petitions and RSA are dismissed.
