</pre><p id="p_4">            It is contended by the Petitioner that from Annexure P-4 to P-8,

it is evident that various Departments, including Municipal Corporation,

Faridabad, had issued no objection for using the premises as an Industrial

Unit, even a licence to employ upto 950 workers was also granted.

Thereafter, the Unit was running and was fully operational, until one activist

moved complaints to various departments stating that the site in question

cannot be put to any other use, except as a Community Center/Hall. Thus,

some of the permissions were withdrawn and therefore, petitioner moved

application dated NIL, received by the office of Municipal Commissioner,

Faridabad on 27.06.2017 vide Diary No. 5977 for permission to Change the

Land Use of site in question.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.          The application dated 27.06.2017 (P-12) submitted by the

petitioner for the change of the land use and for getting the site plan passed

regarding the Community Centre on Plot No. 68/1 DLF Industrial Area

remove the illegal activities / violations.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.           In the background of the aforestated facts and being aggrieved

against the said orders, the petitioner filed the instant Writ Petition.

However, during the pendency of the writ petition, Respondent No. 1-State

(Urban Local Bodies Department) through Chief Town Planner filed a short

reply by way of affidavit. In the said reply, a communication dated

18.06.2018 (P-16/A) was placed on record alongwith order/ communication

dated 07.08.2018 (P-16/B). In the said Orders dated 18.06.2018 (P-16A) the

matter was referred to the Director General Urban Local Bodies Department

Haryana being the Competent Authority under Section 349(2) of the

Haryana Municipal Corporation Act 1994 for the grant / refusal regarding

the change of land use permissions for the sites falling within the limits of

Municipal Corporation.

<p id="p_8">             In the impugned Order dated 07.08.2016 (P-16B), issued by the

office of the Director-General, Urban Local Bodies, Haryana, it was held

that the petitioner had "illegally converted the plot into industrial use. The

change of land use permission cannot be allowed over such plots of

record the documents (Annexure P-17 to P-21) regarding the regularization

of QRG Hospital which was taken on record by the Order dated 01.11.2018

to support the case of the petitioner that in similar circumstances, the

Respondent Authorities have regularized the case of QRG Hospital

constructed on the site allotted specifically to Vivekanand Ashram for the

establishment of Harijan Residential School and Social Development Centre

Petitioner that similar power has not been exercised in the case of the

Petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.            The Petitioner in view of the subsequent event i.e passing of

order dated 07.08.2018 (P-16/B), moved an application (Civil Misc 12216

of 2019) under Order VI Rule 17 for amending the Writ Petition, which was

have been filed by respondents. In the written statement filed by Respondent

No. 1-State through Principal Secretary Urban Local Bodies Department

Haryana, the Order dated 07.08.2018 (P-16/B) was endorsed and protected.

Regarding the regularization of QRG Hospital, it is averred that the Plot /

Building in question is part of the Licensed Colony and the Department of

Urban Local Bodies Haryana is not the competent authority for the

regularization of such plot / building and further contended that however,

the Municipal Corporation is competent to take action on illegal

construction or misuse of Plot / Building if such Licensed Colony is

transferred to the said Municipal Corporation implying that in respect of the

change of land use / regularization of the changed land use, the competent

Authority is the Director Town and Country Planning under the provisions

of the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of

Unregulated Development Act 1963 ( hereinafter referred to as "1963 Act" )

/ Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act 1975

contended that plot in question is earmarked for Public Amenities /

Community Centre in the sanctioned layout plan. It is contended that the

Director, Urban Local Bodies Haryana, is competent to refuse or accept an

application for change of land use and further that the action taken by them

is correct as per law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">ARGUMENTS:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">7.           By referring to the aforesaid facts, Ld. Counsel for the

petitioner has submitted that sole ground mentioned in the impugned orders

passed by Municipal Corporation Faridabad and Director General, Urban

Local Bodies, Haryana, is that the site in question in the layout Plan of DLF

Industrial Area sanctioned vide drawing No. 483 dated 11.09.1973 has been

earmarked for a Public Amenity / Community Centre and therefore the site

in question cannot be converted into an Industrial Unit. Thus, the

application for change of land use cannot be accepted and further, the

constructions done by petitioner on the basis of revised Building Plans are

illegal and use as industrial purpose are illegal and liable to be removed.

According to submissions made by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner, the

said findings are perverse and liable to be set aside because

</p><p id="p_16">     (a)   As per Section 8 of Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled

           Areas Restriction of Unregulated Development Act, 1963,

           which is pari-materia to Sections 349 of Haryana Municipal

           Corporation Act, 1994, there are no parameters laid down by

           the legislature on the basis of which, CLU application can be

           rejected or accepted. Once that is so, then the discretion has

           to be exercised judiciously by the authority concerned.

           However, the impugned orders lack such application of mind.</p><pre id="pre_4">

</pre><p id="p_17">   (b)   The Impugned orders have been passed by authorities in

         light of Section 3-B of Haryana Development and Regulation

         of Urban Areas Act, 1975, as per which there is a bar on

         permitting erection or re-erection of a building, which has

         been earmarked for a particular usage in a licensed colony.

         However, the authorities have ignored <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_5">Section 23</a> of the 1975

         Act, which enables the Government to exempt any building

         from rigors of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_6">Section 3-B</a> of the Act, 1975 in case where

         there is undue hardship or circumstances exist which render

         it expedient to do so. Circumstances of instant case show

         that not only it is expedient but there is undue hardship

         caused to petitioner as well.
</p>
<p id="p_18">   (c)   The Plot / property in question is situated in DLF Industrial

         Area, Faridabad, which is surrounded by Industries on all

         sites. As per the impugned order dated 14.12.2017 (P-16), it

         is categorically mentioned that the layout of the DLF Industrial

         Area was sanctioned on 11.09.1973 and the present site was

         earmarked as Public Amenity / Community Centre. Since the

         approval of the Layout in the year 1973, there has been no

         change in it despite the present site losing its practical usage

         as a Community Center and has infact never been used as

         such. This is seen from NOC given by Industrial Association

         (P-2 Colly), as per which the building is in shambles and has

         lost its value as far as its usage as a community hall in

         concerned. Thus, by converting the site into an industrial unit,

         by taking the applicable charges, will not cause loss to the

         State / Municipal Corporation Faridabad whereas the

         petitioner is set to be more prejudiced in case Change of

         Land Use is not permitted, as he has taken a loan to the tune

         of more than Rs. 6 Crore for construction of the building, an

         industrial unit which had generated employment was running

         and adding to the revenues for the State / Municipal

         Corporation Faridabad.
</p>
<p id="p_19">   (d)   The counsel for the petitioner referred to the case of

         conversion of a site wherein in similar circumstances, while

         exercising the power of exemption, the HUDA had permitted

         a private hospital namely QRG Hospital to change the land

         use of a site earmarked for Harijan Residential School and

         Social Development Center to a private hospital alongwith

         shops vide letter dated 16.08.2016 (P-15).
</p>
<p id="p_20">   (e)   Similarly, Town and Country Planning Department, which is

         responsible for formulating policies for "controlled areas", has

         previously permitted industrial units within the controlled

         areas to be regularized by invoking the exemption clauses

         provided under the Act, 1963 vide its policy dated

         02.03.2010. Thus, in case Town and Country Planning

         Department is taking such decisions by invoking exemption

Bodies Haryana which is the competent authority under the 1994 Act is

perfectly valid as no change of land use can been permitted in respect of a

Licensed Colony which is developed after approvals through the Town and

Country Planning Department. It is further argued that the parity that has

been sought by petitioner by referring to the case of QRG Hospital, is

without basis as the said exemption was granted by HUDA and not by

Department of Urban and Local Bodies.

evident that the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act 1994 is a self contained

code and provides for the provisions regarding the administration of the

'municipal area' which vests with the Corporation and provides for the

powers, functions, procedures regarding the permission of the erection / re-

erection of the Buildings and the use of the premises, the offences and the

penalties as also the procedure dealing with such offences, the appeals

thereto etc.. There is nothing being brought to the notice of the Court that

the 'controlled areas' so declared under the 1963 Act which stand included

in the municipal limits are excluded from the administration and jurisdiction

of the Municipal Corporation while to the contrary there is a specific

provision as under Sub Section (4) of <a href="/doc/1081844/" id="a_26">Section 3</a> of 1994 Act that all rules,

regulations, notifications, bye-laws, orders, directions and powers issued or

other lay down that the Municipal Corporation is given an area (i.e. the

Municipal Area) of jurisdiction and the Municipal Corporation within that

area exercises all jurisdiction in respect of the administration of that area

concerning the construction, use of land, etc. The Municipal Corporation

also has a power to declare area within its jurisdiction as Controlled areas

and control the use of land by its Planning Scheme. The controlled areas

declared under the 1963 are also included in the municipal limits and in

respect of the developed areas so transferred to the Municipal Corporation,

the said Corporation and the Authorities under the 1994 Act, exercises

complete authority on such areas including the power to sanction / approve

construction - erection / re-erection of land as also the change of land use

it abundantly clear that the provisions for grant / refusal of change of land

use are the same. Both these Acts (1963 and 1994 Act) bar change of land

usage until and unless same are permitted by Competent Authority.

However, these Acts operate in different domains. The provisions of 1994

Act are confined to sites within the Municipal Limits of a township i.e.

within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation, whereas the provisions

of 1963 Act, are applicable to areas outside the municipal limits or any other

area, declared as "controlled area" or "scheduled roads", so as to control ill-

planned &amp; haphazard development. Evidently, in both the Acts there are no

parameters which have been laid down as to under what circumstances, an

application for Change of Land use can be accepted or rejected by the

authority. However, 1963 Act provides for <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_50">Section 7A</a>, which permits the

Government to relax any of the provisions pertaining to change of land use

prescribed in controlled area in exception circumstances. The said power of

relaxation is missing in the 1994 Act.

<p id="p_63">13.         But, it is seen that the Competent Authority's power under

1994 Act to declare a controlled area under the 1994 Act, is restricted by the

provision of 1963 Act, as is enshrined under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_51">Section 346</a> of the 1994 Act.

declaration of the Area as Controlled Area under 1963 Act there would be

the development pursuant thereto would have taken place. It is under

on the specific query by the Court, it was informed by the Counsel for the

petitioner without any opposition from the respondents that before the

enactment of the 1975 Act, the permissions for the development of the

Colony, its layout and other approvals were granted under the 1963 Act and

the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of

Unregulated Development Rules, 1965 made thereunder. During the process

of permissions for the development of a Colony, the layout Plan of the

Colony is also approved which also provides for certain public utility

services and certain amenities. As per <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_54">Section 3B</a> of the Act (which was

inserted vide amendment dated 03.04.2003), no erection or re-erection of

buildings are permitted in a Licensed Colony save as otherwise provided in

approved plans (the Plans which also provide for certain amenities and

utility services to be provided in the Colony. However, considering that

there is an absolute bar, the legislature, in its wisdom, had empowered

(<a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_55">Section 23</a> of 1975 Act refers) the Government to permit relaxation of any

provisions of the 1975 Act, in case it causes:
</p>
<pre id="pre_10">      a)     undue hardship; or

      b)     changed circumstances

</pre><p id="p_64">Thus, either of two situations must arise for the Government to permit a

class of persons or areas to be exempted from the provisions of this Act.

The counsel for the parties are ad idem during the course of arguments that

that the Community Centre is a general amenity and do not come under the

public utility / essential service as some of the amenities are public utility

like the post office, dispensary, police station etc.

             It has also been submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner that

the composite norms for the community sites to be provided in a Colony

were Circulated vide D.T.C.P. Haryana vide Endst No.20028 Dated

24.11.1988 as available on the official website of the Town and Country

Planning Haryana. It is the unopposed argument of the Petitioner that before

24.11.1988, there were no norms for the providing of the community sites in

a colony and the same were provided for in the Layout of Colony as per the

discretion of the colonizer and were not sacrosanct. It is only after

24.11.1988, the composite norms for the providing of the community sites

were made mandatory and were based on the parameters of the density

norms. Thus the mandatory parameters regarding community sites are not

applicable in respect of the DLF industrial Area (where the plot in question

is located) regarding which the layout plan was sanctioned on 11.09.1973

apart from being guided by the provisions like <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_56">Section 23</a> of the 1975 Act.

</p><p id="p_65">14.          Hence, before declining or accepting an application for change

of land use, it is incumbent upon the designated authority i.e. the Director

General Urban Local Body under the 1994 Act to consider the case from all

these angles as well, especially when the property / site is situated within

the Municipal Limits of a township after its completion and the entire taxes

like the House tax and the other municipal taxes are collected by the

Municipal Corporation. It goes without saying that class of persons also

includes a single person.
</p>
<p id="p_66">15.          The additional argument raised by the counsel for the petitioner

is also valid that going by the scheme of the 1963 Act, 1975 Act or even in

respect of the provisions of the 1994 Act and powers therein towards the

declaration of the controlled area and the permission to use the land /

Building therein, the permission for use (including the change of land use as

in present case as industrial use) is given in respect of the entire area applied

for the permission of such use. It is the developer / Colonizer / Licensee

who gives a layout Plan wherein he submits adherence to the requirements

of the norms and specifications regarding the plots (as in present case the

industrial plots) open areas, roads, parks etc.. At the relevant time while

giving the layout Plan of the DLF Industrial Area and giving the open areas,

roads etc., in the year 1973, the colonizer based on his own discretion left

the site / plot for Community Hall, which may have utility in that general

area, granted change of use as 'industrial' though was not legally bound for

such laying of community hall in year 1973 as the composite norms for the

Community Buildings came in the year 1988. As is the general practice and

the legal requirement, the entire area in which development is planned to be

carried out and the permission is sought for the specific use (viz. industrial

use in present case), the entire area is granted such permission and

conversion charge for the entire area is charged. The change of use is

granted for the entire Colony / area for which permission for such use is

applied for and is granted by calculating the entire area for the payment of

conversion charges payable for the permissible and applied change of land

use. In the present case also, the change of land use as Industrial use, is

granted for the entire DLF Industrial Area falling in Sector 31 Faridabad.

What is legally required to be granted in the present case is not to change

the land use of the site / plot on which the Community Hall was sanctioned

but the permission to convert the redundant amenity and community hall

which has outlived its utility to be used as a 'factory' in the approved

Industrial area where the land is permitted way back in 1973 as industrial

use. The permission to convert the building of the Community Hall that has

not been proved of any use and in last over 40 years never been utilized

answered in the affirmative. In this regard reference is taken from the

provisions of Section 3 wherein the Municipal Corporation is constituted

under the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act 1994 and the administration

<a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_68">Section 3</a> of 1994 Act that all rules, regulations, notifications, bye-laws,

orders, directions and powers issued or conferred and all taxes imposed

under the 1994 Act will be applicable on the area included in the Municipal

limits. There is no distinction created under the 1994 Act in respect of the

areas which are declared 'controlled areas' under the 1963 Act and later are

included within the municipal limits of the Municipal Corporation under the

1994 Act regarding the administration of such areas outside the scope and

ambit of the provisions of the 1994 Act.

<p id="p_72">             In regard to the construction and the change of land use,

Chapter XIV of the 1994 Act deals with the "Building Regulations" and

also encompasses with the scope of the words "to erect buildings" as

defined under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_69">Section 249</a> of 1994 Act, to include the conversion of a

building which was never used as a factory and is converted into a factory

as in a present case. Such change / Conversion will thus be read as and dealt

with as a case of erecting of a building. Further under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_70">Section 265</a> of 1994

Act in same Chapter XIV dealing with Building Regulations, the

Commissioner is empowered to permit any person to change or allow the

would reveal that the Commissioner Municipal Corporation is empowered

to grant the change of land use as also the conversion of the use of a

particular building from use as a factory and for erecting the Building for

use as a factory as in the present case.

provides that all rules, regulations, notifications, bye-laws, orders,

Such power of the authorities under the 1994 Act is also saved by virtue of

            A perusal of the said order shows that application for Change

of Land Use was declined without considering the fact that the plot in

question falls in the municipal limits and the Colony has been completed

way back and is under the scope and powers of the Director General Urban

Local Bodies, Haryana. It is also a conceded fact that the layout plan of the

said Industrial Colony in question was approved on 11.09.1973 much ahead

of the enactment of the 1975 Act on 30.01.1975. Any of the powers so

required towards regularization, relaxation and composition are to be dealt

competent authority for regularization of plot in a licensed Colony but the

Municipal Corporation is competent to take action on the illegal

Municipal Corporation Faridabad is exercising all its control and regulatory

</p>
<p id="p_83">19.3.       The Competent Authority while exercising its power to grant

change of land use has for its guidance and reliance the relaxation clauses

that exist under the 1975 Act. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_82">Section 23</a> of the 1975 Act, lays down the

parameters for the consideration of such relaxation. In the instant case, the

to the fact that firstly, the change of land use for the entire DLF Industrial

community hall is not a sacrosanct parameter to be included in the layout

Plan in year 1973 with an obligation / condition for passing the Layout Plan

the composite norms were prescribed only in the year 1988. Thirdly, said

put to use as such. Fourthly, the building on the plot in question was

granted the permission to be run as a 'factory' (i.e. the industrial use) by

the authorities under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_83">Factories Act</a>, the Pollution Control Authorities,

Building Bye Laws etc.. Fifthly, the petitioner's case is for the permission to

convert the 'community hall' as 'factory' i.e. the industrial use in the

Industrial Area, granted permission to change the land to industrial use in

the year 1973. Seen from both angles towards the required conversion or

even for the change of the land use, all parameters for such an action on part

of the authorities were met out in the present case.

19.5         In such circumstances, we do not see any reason to remand the

matter back and direct the Competent Authority to consider the case of

petitioner for the change of the land use / conversion of the 'community

hall' as a 'factory' i.e. the industrial use in the peculiar facts and

circumstances by considering the various aspects in the preceding para 18.4,

as the Competent Authority, Commissioner / Director under the 1994 Act,

as the case may be, has already considered the impugned action / view to be

valid and therefore, it would be an 'empty formality' or "futile attempt" to

relegate the petitioner to another round of litigation as the matter would be

going virtually from "Caesar to Caesar's wife". In support of our view, we

refer to the judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dhampur Sugar

Mills Ltd Vs State of UP and other, 2007(8) Supreme Court Cases 338.

19.6         Coming to the merits of the case and deciding the issue

involved, we find that not only both the ingredients of <a href="/doc/284285/" id="a_84">Section 23</a> of Act,

1975 are meted out in favor of the petitioner, but equity is also heavily tilted

on its side. It is a classic example where the power to exempt was required

to be exercised by considering the unfortunate situation of petitioner.</p><pre id="pre_12">

the Site Plan which was approved on 11.09.1973 i.e. over 47 years ago

when the controversy erupted. It is also not in dispute that the petitioner had

tried to run a Community Hall on the site for nearly 6 years, but was

unsuccessful in his endeavor and there is nothing brought on record by the

respondents that previously a community centre ever functioned on this site.

Furthermore, the said community site was not in pursuance / compliance of

the composite norms issued vide Memo dated 24.11.1988 as required for

Licensing under the 1975 Act and that too in respect of any public utility. It

is further clear that petitioner is seeking permission to run an industrial unit

Thus, there is no chance that there would be chaos caused by permitting

such change of land use.

based and founded upon the legal provisions under the 1975 Act, 1963 Act

or the 1994 Act against the grant of change of the land use in the present

case. Further, the site in the year 1973 was earmarked for the benefit of

adjoining industries in the area. However, a perusal of the no objection

given by the Association of Industries working in the said Industrial Area

would show that they are more than willing to permit another industrial unit

to be set up in the area i.e the disputed site. For ready reference, the relevant

       building for the purpose earmarked in the approved layout

       become an abandoned building. In fact this situation has
       arisen due to the reason that the industrialists operating in this

<blockquote id="blockquote_75">             Thus, it is seen that not only the building constructed thereupon

is "abandoned", the site has outlived its utility. Hence, the most affected

persons, who can be either petitioner's competitors or aggrieved by change

no dispute regarding the fact that there was / is no necessity felt in respect of

such amenity in the last over 40 years and the effort of the Petitioner itself

to gainfully operate the site as a Community Hall failed and proved to be

unviable. The DLF Industrial Association which is the representative body

transferred to the Municipal Corporation and is being levied the taxes, cess

earlier supposedly relevant has been rendered useless for petitioner, the

other occupants of the area as well as for State.

<p id="p_90">             Not only this, if the matter is seen from the angle of undue

hardship, it is apparent that petitioner is bound to fail in his business

endaveours till the time the site is put to use as a Community Hall,

considering the past. It is also not denied that petitioner had spent more than

Rs. 6 Crore on the construction and operation of the building / site as an

industrial site, after getting the site plans approved from Respondent No 2

(M.C Faridabad). Not only that but upon due considerations, there were all

permissions in place to even run the Plot in question as a factory under the

<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_86">Factories Act</a> 1948, generating employment for almost a thousand

employees working there, adding to the economy of the State and the

'consent to operate' issued by the Haryana Pollution Control Board.

Although, it is an admitted position that the Site Plan was wrongly

approved, however, we are required to balance the equities, as on the basis

of NOC, Occupation Certificate, and other No-objections issued by various

department, an industry was set up by petitioner, which was running until

passing of the impugned orders. Thus, the case also falls within the domain

of "undue hardship" as mentioned in <a href="/doc/284285/" id="a_87">Section 23</a> of the Act, 1975.

19.8.        Another factor that persuades us to incline towards petitioner is

the fact that an instrumentality of the State i.e. HUDA has also permitted

similar change of land use by invoking same provisions in the case of QRG

Private Hospital. Although an argument has been raised that HUDA is

of the view that State cannot be permitted to take such divergent stands

regarding its functionalities performing similar functions in similar

circumstances. If HUDA is empowered to consider the cases for change of

land use by applying a pragmatic approach then it is not understandable as

to why the Department of the State / other instrumentalities of the State

cannot apply the same principles. That apart, a perusal of Statement of

Objects and Reasons of Haryana Development Authority Act, 1977

(hereinafter referred as "HUDA Act") alongwith Sections 3(2), 62, 81, 82

and 83 of the HUDA Act gives us a clear understanding. As per Section 62

of the HUDA Act, State Government has the power to notify a Local

Development Authority for the purpose of managing an estate within the

Local Municipal Limits of a township. After the site plans are approved and

colony/sector has been developed, the procedure and circumstances when

change of land use can be permitted are mentioned in Section 81 and 82 of

the HUDA Act. A perusal of said sections leave no manner of doubt that the

designated authority exercises similar power envisaged under corresponding

sections of 1963 and 1994 Acts. However, the power given to designated

authority is again subject to checks and balances as mentioned in Section 83

of the HUDA Act, 1977 which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_76">      " 83. Applicability of Haryana Act 8 of 1975. - The Haryana
      Development and Regulations of Urban Areas Act, 1975, shall
      continue to be applicable in the local development area which
      shall be deemed to be the urban area as defined in clause (o)
      of Section 2 of the said Act and the powers under the said Act
      shall continue to be exercised by the Director, Town and
      Country Planning, Haryana."

Licensed Colony is transferred to the Municipal Corporation then all aspects

of the transferred Colony are to be exercised under the 1994 Act.</blockquote><p id="p_91">

</p><p id="p_92">              In these facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the

case of petitioner lies on a better footing than that of QRG Hospital, where

HUDA had permitted change of land use of a site earmarked for residential

school and other activities for children of Harijan Society into a Private

Hospital with Shops as a commercial venture.
</p>
<p id="p_93">19.9.         One another aspect of the instant case, which has been rightly

shown by petitioner, is the issuance of policies by the Town and Country

Planning department from time to time under the provisions of 1963 Act,

whereby a class of persons are permitted change of land use. Once such

Policy relied upon by petitioner is the policy dated 02.03.2010, whereby all

the illegal industries set up by persons uptill the date of policy were

permitted to get their units regularized on the conditions mentioned therein

within a period of three months. The operative part of the policy dated

02.03.2010 is reproduced as under:
</p>
<p id="p_94">        "     The      Government          has   been       receiving   the
        representations from various industrial associations regarding
        regularization of the Industrial Units which have come up
        within the controlled areas over the years although, these
        have been constructed without taking any permissions under
        the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction
        of Unregulated Development Act, 1963 from the competent
        authority. In number of cases, the Department has initiated the
        proceedings including criminal proceedings in accordance with
        the provisions of the ibid Act.
</p><p id="p_95">        2.    The Government has examined this issue and it is of the
        opinion that removal of these un-authorizedly constructed
        industrial buildings will not only adversely affect the
        livelihood of the owners and its employees/ workers but

      will also have serious negative impact on the industrial
      economy of the State. Therefore, the Government has
      decided to provide an opportunity to these industrial units
      existing within the controlled areas in the State to seek
      regularization. Xxxx"

             Thus, if instrumentality of the State (HUDA) and the

Department of Town and Country Planning of the State are granting

benefits, then we see no reason why the respondent Authorities under the

Municipal Corporation and / or the Department of Urban Local Bodies

could not exercise their powers in favor of petitioner.

</p><p id="p_97">20.          Hence, in view of the attending facts and circumstances of the

instant case and the findings in regard to the Question No. (i), (ii), and (iii),

we are of the view that the impugned orders passed by the authorities are

without application of mind and therefore liable to be quashed.

application dated 27.06.2017 (P-12) in view of the aforementioned detailed

observations is allowed. Respondents are directed to complete the

remaining formalities, if any, qua issuance of change of land use /

conversion of Building Certificate, as envisaged under the Statute/Rules,

within a period of four months from the receipt of the certified order of the

copy of the instant judgment, on acceptance of usual fees charged by them

after adjusting the fee, if any already paid. It is further directed that the

reasons mentioned in the order dated 14.12.2017 (P-16) for declaring the

construction illegal are also set aside, as the construction was declared

illegal in view of the fact that site was yet to be earmarked as an Industrial
