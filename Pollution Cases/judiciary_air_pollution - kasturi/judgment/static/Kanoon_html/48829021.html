           Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 1122 of 2014
                                   ---

           Parmeshwar Prasad son of Shiv Shankar Prasad resident

                                 Versus

4/07.01.2016</pre><p id="p_1">     Heard Mr. Gaurav, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.
           Sanjay Kumar Srivastava, learned A.P.P. for the State.
</p><p id="p_2">           2.    In spite of giving opportunity to the State, no counter affidavit has
           been filed.
</p><p id="p_3">           3.    In this application, the petitioner has prayed for quashing the
           entire criminal proceeding in connection with Khunti P. S. Case No. 33
           of 2013 including the order dated 29.07.2013 passed by the learned
           Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khunti whereby and whereunder
           cognizance has been taken for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_1">Sections
           379</a>/<a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_2">278</a> of the I.P.C., under <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_3">Section 4(i)</a> of the Mines and Mineral
           (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">Regulation) Act</a>, 1916 and under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_5">Section 37</a> Air
           (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_4">           4.    The allegation made in the FIR is that pursuant to a raid
           conducted on 12.03.2013 with respect to different quarries and brick
           kiln, 3 brick kilns were inspected including the one belonging to the
           petitioner and the same were running without the permission as
           required under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_7">Section 37</a> of Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
           1981 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act').
</p><p id="p_5">           5.    Mr. Gaurav, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that so far
           as the FIR is concerned, there is no allegation against the petitioner
           with respect to committing any offence either under the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9"> of
           the Indian Penal Code</a> or under the provisions of Mines and Mineral
           (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_10">Regulation) Act</a>, 1916 and it has been submitted that
           only allegation so far as the petitioner is concerned is running the brick
           kiln without having the required permission as per <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_11">Section 37</a> of the
           Act. Learned counsel further submits that in fact the brick kiln which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            -2-</span>
being run by the petitioner has duly been leased out and the petitioner
has got the licence to carry out his business.          It has also been
submitted that the consent to operate has been obtained by the
petitioner and even on the date the raid was conducted i.e.,
12.03.2013, the petitioner was in possession of the necessary
permission of consent to operate dated 07.03.2013 by the Jharkhand
State Pollution Control Board. Learned counsel further adds that even
otherwise an FIR cannot be instituted under the provisions of the Act in
view of the clear bar as mentioned in <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_12">Section 43</a> of the Act which
depicts that no Court can take cognizance of any offence under this
Act except on a complaint. It has been submitted that the complaint
has been defined under <a href="/doc/255245/" id="a_13">Section 2(d)</a> of the Cr.P.C. and since the
present case has been instituted by way of FIR, the entire criminal
proceeding against the petitioner deserves to be quashed and set
aside.
</p><p id="p_6">6.       Mr. S. K. Srivastava, learned A.P.P., on the other hand, has
submitted that in the raid which was conducted by the authorities, it
was detected that necessary permissions were not obtained by the
brick kiln owners including the petitioner and in such circumstances,
the brick kiln was being run by the petitioner without necessary
approval of law.
</p><p id="p_7">7.       A perusal of the written report submitted by the Assistant Mining
Officer, Khunti dated 12.03.2013 suggests that the only allegation with
respect to the petitioner is of not having the necessary permission to
operate the brick kiln in terms of <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_14">Section 37</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_15">Section 43</a> of
the Act deals with the cognizance of offence and it clearly lays down
that no Court can take cognizance under this Act except on a
complaint made by a Board or any officer authorised in this behalf by it
or any person who has given a notice of not less than 60 days of the
alleged offence and of his intention to make a complaint to the Board
or officer authorised as aforesaid. Admittedly, <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_16">Section 43</a> of the Act
has not been adhered to as cognizance was taken pursuant to
registration of an FIR and completion of investigation on initiation of the
proceeding. In such circumstances, filing of the FIR itself is against
<a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_17">Section 43</a> of the Act and therefore, such FIR at the instance of the
authorities cannot be maintained. Even otherwise, the petitioner as it
appears      had   been    given   a   consent   to   operate   by   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            -3-</span>
                  Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board and on the date of raid
                  conducted by the officials, the consent to operate dated 07.03.2013
                  was in operation. Moreover, the petitioner had the requisite permission
                  to operate his brick kiln as would be evident from the proforma issued
                  by the District Mining Office, Khunti dated 02.02.2013.
</p><p id="p_8">                  8.    The circumstances enumerated above would go to show that the
                  criminal proceeding initiated against the petitioner was without any
                  basis and without verification of the actual facts and the same was also
                  contrary to the provisions envisaged under <a href="/doc/17167057/" id="a_18">Section 43</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_9">                  9.    So far as the provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19"> of Indian Penal Code</a> and Mines and
                  Minerals (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_20">Regulation) Act</a> is concerned, the FIR does
                  not disclose any such offence as against the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_10">                  10.   In such circumstances, therefore I am inclined to allow this
                  application.
</p><p id="p_11">                  11.   Accordingly, this application is allowed and the entire criminal
                  proceeding in connection with Khunti P. S. Case No. 33 of 2013
                  including the order dated 29.07.2013 passed by the Additional Chief
                  Judicial Magistrate, Khunti by which cognizance was taken for the
                  offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_21">Sections 379</a>/<a href="/doc/1368265/" id="a_22">278</a> of the I.P.C., under
                  <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_23">Section 4(i)</a> of the Mines and Mineral (Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_24">Regulation) Act</a>,
                  1916 and under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_25">Section 37</a> Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
                  1981 is hereby quashed and set aside.
