REPORT NO. 109 SUBMITTED BY EPCA (Regarding RFID extension to all

    It is submitted that as to pollution impact of the reduction

in truck entry, the following is the report submitted by the EPCA :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         “Pollution     impact   of   the   reduction   in   truck
         entry”

         EPCA in its report in October, 2015 had
         estimated the pollution impact of the truck
         entering Delhi each night.     This was done by
         estimating   the  number;   age;   category and
         emission factors for the vehicles.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         EPCA   has    now   estimated   the   reduction   in
         pollution load, based on the reduction in the
         numbers of vehicles entering from the 13 points
         and also because of the age limit (less than 10
         years) that is being enforced through the RFID
         pre-registration.      The results from the 13
         points is substantial and suggests that the
         efforts    to    mitigate   pollution    have   been
         rewarded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         There is a 95 per cent reduction in the total
         particulate load from trucks entering from 13
         locations, as compared to 2015. There is 87-94
         per cent reduction in NOx loads from light-heavy
         duty vehicles entering from 13 locations.</blockquote><p id="p_49">

</p><p id="p_50">         To assess the impact of reduction in           number of
         entering goods carries EPCA compared           SDMC data
         for the period 1st Dec 2019 to 1st Jan         2020 with
         a set of survey data conducted during          June-July
         2015 of major entry points.”


    It is agreed to by the learned counsel appearing for EPCA and

the Municipal Corporation that on all the 113 entry points, RFID

should be implemented and that can be done within the budget which

is available.
