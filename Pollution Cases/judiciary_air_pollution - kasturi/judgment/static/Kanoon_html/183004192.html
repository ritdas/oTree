JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

     A simple question of some legal significance as to the

meaning and interpretation of the expression 'residential area'

arises for consideration of the Tribunal in the present case. The

relevant facts giving rise to the present application, are that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                1</span>
 applicant firm is a partnership concern and Mr. Manish Kumar

Mittal is one of the partners of this partnership firm, who has

instituted the present application. This partnership concern

carries on the business of stone crushing. It sought to establish a

stone crushing unit at Bilaua, Tehsil Dabra, District Gwalior.

The applicant made inquiries and was informed by the Panchayat

about a suitable piece of land for the same so that he could

obtain a 'no objection certificate' from the Department concerned.

Based upon the inquiries made, the applicant vide a registered

sale deed dated, 13th October, 2010, purchased the land for

establishing a stone crushing unit. He obtained a certificate from

the Gram Panchayat for the availability of the land in question

situated merely 600 metres away from the residential area. After

purchasing the land, diversion of the land was done under the

provisions of M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1959. The applicant

claims to have obtained permission from the District Trade and

Industry Centre, Gwalior on 28th October, 2010. The applicant

then got a project report prepared and invested a huge amount in

purchasing the machines for the stone crushing unit.        On 1st

June, 2011, the petitioner applied for 'no objection certificate'

from the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board, (for short the

Board). The Regional Officer of the Board vide their letter dated

11th August, 2011, denied the petitioner the grant of no objection

certificate on the ground that a school was existing at a distance

of 450 metres from the site of the stone crusher and as per the

guidelines issued by the Board, the same could not be permitted.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                2</span>
   Under these guidelines, the minimum distance between a

  residential area and a stone crushing unit is to be 500 metres.


</p><p id="p_3">  2.   The only reason given for rejection of the grant of consent of

  the Board was in view of the guidelines issued by the Board in

  furtherance to its meeting dated, 5th January, 2004. Aggrieved by

  the order of the Board dated, 11th August, 2011 and that of the

  appellate authority dated, 13th December, 2011, the applicant

  has challenged the correctness and legality of these orders, inter

  alia, but primarily on the following grounds:


</p><p id="p_4">(a) The guidelines do not have the force of law and are, therefore,

  incapable of being made the basis for declining the consent by

  the Board, which exercises its powers in terms of <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of

  the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short

  "the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_3">Air Act</a>"). The Board discharges statutory functions and is

  bound by the provisions of the law alone.
</p>
<p id="p_5">(b) The expression 'residential area' used in the guidelines does not

  include running of a school. Thus, the limitation of 500 metres,

  as imposed by the guidelines is not applicable to the case of the

  applicant in the face of the admitted facts.
</p>
<p id="p_6">(c) The guidelines issued by various other State Pollution Control

  Boards specifically provide for inclusion of schools or educational

  institutions, which are conspicuous by their absence in the

  guidelines issued by the Board. What is not specifically provided

  for cannot be read into the provisions by implication, particularly

  when this amounts to a restriction or prohibition upon the right

  of the applicant to carry on business.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    3</span>
</p><p id="p_8"> 3.   Reply has been filed on behalf of the respondent. The facts

are not disputed by the respondent. However, on the question of

law, the respondent seriously disputed the correctness of the

contentions of the applicant. According to the respondent, these

guidelines have been framed in furtherance to the judgment of

the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1033226/" id="a_4">Kennedy Valley Welfare

Association v. Ceylon Repatriates Labourers Welfare and Service

Society &amp; Others</a> 2000(2) SCALE 143.       They are binding on all

concerned and the applicant cannot get away from the limitations

and restrictions provided under the guidelines formulated by the

Board. It is further averred in the reply that there are two schools

situated in the area which are located within a distance of 500m

from the said stone crushing unit - (i) Government Primary

School, Chirpura, which was established in the year 1974 and

operates in an area of nearly 2,000 sq.m., having 125 students,

and (ii) Government Middle School, which was established in the

year 2003 and has 65 students on its roll from 6th to 8th

standard. The schools thus, were operating much prior to the

date on which the applicant had even proposed to establish his

stone crushing unit at the premises in question. Admittedly, the

applicant applied for the consent on 1st June, 2011 and cannot

take advantage of his own wrong.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">4.   In view of the contentions raised with reference to the facts

noticed supra, we must first refer to the relevant extracts of the

guidelines, dated 5th January, 2004 that have been framed by the

Board. They read as under:

control and abatement of pollution caused by air. For prevention

and control of the same, the Pollution Control Boards were

constituted by assigning them such powers and functions as are

necessary for achievement of the above objectives. To put it

precisely, the primary and the sole object of the legislature in

constituting such Boards under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a> was,

firstly, to put a check on air pollution and secondly, to ensure the

preservation of the quality of air and providing the same to the

citizens of the country. The provisions of <a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_8">Section 17</a> of the Air Act

state the functions, which the State Boards are expected to

perform, subject to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a> and without

prejudice to the performance of its functions, if any, under the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.          The

legislature, in its wisdom envisaged various specific functions to

be performed by the Boards under clauses (a) to (i) of sub-section

(1) of <a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_11">Section 17</a> of the Air Act. Clause (j) of sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/1232641/" id="a_12">Section 17</a> of the Air Act is the residuary power of the Board,

which is of wide amplitude and empowers the Board to do such

other things and to perform such other acts, as it may deem

necessary for the proper discharge of its functions, and generally

for the purpose of carrying into effect the purposes of this Act.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                 8</span>
 This residuary function of the Board thus has a dual purpose - (i)

to discharge its functions more appropriately as a whole, and (ii)

to carry out the purposes of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_13">Air Act</a>. Whatever is incumbent

in the interest of achievement of these two objects, the Board

would be deemed to have been vested with such powers. There

shall be a direct nexus between the things or acts under the

statute that the Board in exercise of its residuary powers intends

to do or perform for its own purposes. This nexus is essential, but

once such nexus is established and the action of the Board is

found to be in public interest and in consonance with the object

of the Act, the courts would be reluctant to take a view that such

an action or thing was beyond the scope of the power vested in

the Board under <a href="/doc/700405/" id="a_14">Section 17(1)(j)</a> of the Air Act.

</p><p id="p_30">7.   In the present case, the guidelines have been issued by the

Board in discharge of its functions to ensure prevention and

control of air pollution, that may be caused due to operation of

stone crushers. These guidelines have been framed by the Board

for its own purposes as well as for the general public, the

members of which may be interested in establishing and carrying

on the business of stone crushing. It cannot be disputed that the

operation of stone crushers results invariably in discharge of

various air pollutants into the air. Thus, regulating and

controlling   operation   of the   same   is essential to   ensure

maintenance of the prescribed standards in relation to air

quality. These guidelines are binding on the Board as well as on

the interested individuals and they are uniformly applicable to all

concerned.

of the Supreme Court in the case of Kennedy Valley Welfare

the judgment of the Ld. Single Judge of the High Court of

Madras, that had accepted the recommendations of an Expert

Committee thereby, banning operation of stone crushers and

quarries within a radius of 500 metres of residential area and in

'paragraph 5' of the judgment, the Supreme Court itself imposed

that restriction. Paragraph 5 of the judgment reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">          "...No quarrying of blue metal shall be permitted
          within 500 meters of the residential area and
          permitted only if they are beyond the limit of
          500 meters of the residential area and strictly
          follow the procedures required by the Mines and
          Safety regulations. Such quarrying, however,
          can be allowed by the respondent-State only at
          such- places and in such area which do not in
          any manner endanger human life and if there is
          any likelihood of danger to any grass or plant. In
          such cases the state Government after satisfying
          about the requirement of the community at large
          may surrender the need of the environment to a
          limited extent.

          operation of Stone-Crushers and quarries within
          the radius of 500 meters of the residential area.
          The Division Bench was not justified in reducing
          the area restriction from 500 meters to 50

</p><p id="p_34"> 10. After declaration of law by the Supreme Court in Kennedy

Valley Welfare Association (supra) in the year 2000, the Madhya

Pradesh Pollution Control Board met on 5th January, 2004. While

preparing a 100-day Action Plan, it took into consideration the

guidelines prepared by other Pollution Control Boards of the

country, and issued the questioned guidelines, specifically taking

note of the scenario of the stone crushers in the State of Madhya

Pradesh, the extent of pollution being caused by them and the

necessity for issuing such guidelines. The guidelines issued by

the State Board specifically refers to the Civil Appeal No. 10732

of 1995, as decided by the Supreme Court i.e. in Kennedy Valley

Welfare Association (supra). In fact, it was with an intention to

comply with the directions of the Supreme Court that the Board

formulated the guidelines in question.
</p>
<p id="p_35">11. The stone crushers are required to take consent of the

Pollution Control Board for carrying on their activities. It will even

otherwise be just, fair and in the interest of the administration

and transparency that such guidelines are framed and are made

public, so that all concerned are aware of the same. This itself

would help in eliminating the element of arbitrariness in exercise

of the powers by the Board. Thus, for these reasons, we have no

hesitation in holding that the above guidelines dated, 5th

January, 2004 issued by the Board are valid, have the force of

law and are binding on all concerned.

</p><p id="p_37"> 13. The applicability of 'paragraph 3' of the guidelines issued by

the MP Pollution Control Board dated, 5th January, 2004 will

depend upon the interpretation of the expression 'residential

area' in that paragraph. In fact, the meaning and interpretation of

the same is the core controversy in the present case. In order to

illustratively understand the connotation of the expression

'residential area' it is necessary to explain the word 'residence'

first. The Black's Dictionary, 8th ed. says 'residence' means bodily

presence of inhabitants in a given place.

<p id="p_38">14. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/670599/" id="a_15">Jeewanti Pandey v. Kishan Chandra</a>

(1981)4 SCC 517 held that the word 'resides' is a flexible one and

has many shades of meaning, but it must take its colour and

content from the context in which it appears and cannot be read

in isolation. The dictionary meaning of the word 'resides' denotes

the place where a person or where his family eats, drinks or

sleeps.

classifications of the meaning of the word

and temporary residence and the second
classification is based on de facto and de jure

</p><p id="p_47">16.      From the above detailed explanation and meaning given to

these expressions, it is clear that in common usage and in

different decisions, many definitions have been attributed to the

word 'residence'. It is difficult to give an exact definition and

explanation for the term 'residence' as it is flexible and elastic in

nature and it must be read in conjunction with the relevant

provision where it appears and the object that it seeks to achieve.

Having explained these expressions, the significant corollary

thereto, is as to how such expressions shall, when appearing in a

social legislation, be construed. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_22">The Air Act</a> is a welfare legislation

and is intended to protect the citizenry against pollution of air.

Right to clean environment is now recognised as a fundamental

right within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_23">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. In

that sense, it is even a beneficial legislation as it is intended to

provide benefits to the society by ensuring prevention and control

of air pollution. In the case of social welfare and even beneficial

legislation, it is always advisable to adopt the principle of

purposive construction. This doctrine helps in providing an

interpretation to such a provision that the legislature actually

intended including attainment of the object of the statute. At this

stage,    we   may   usefully   refer   to   "Principles   of   Statutory

Interpretation" by Justice G.P. Singh, 13th ed. 2012 where it has

been stated as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_48">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                      14</span>
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">          "A mechanical interpretation of the words and
         application of a legislative intent devoid of
         concept of purpose will reduce most of the
         remedial and beneficent legislation to futility. As
         stated in IYER. J "to be literal in meaning is to
         see the skin and miss the soul."The judicial key
         to construction is the composite perception of the
         deha and dehi of the provision. Even in
         construing enactments such as those prescribing
         a period of limitation for initiation of proceedings
         where the purpose is only to intimate the people
         that after lapse of a certain time from a certain
         event a proceeding will not be entertained and
         where a strict grammatical construction is
         normally the only safe guide., a literal and
         mechanical construction may have to be
         disregarded if it conflicts with some essential
         requirement of fair play and natural justice which
         the Legislature never intended to throw
         overboard. Similarly in a taxing statute provisions
         enacted to prevent tax evasion are given a liberal
         construction to effectuate the purpose of
         suppressing tax evasion although provisions
         imposing a charge are construed strictly where
         being no apriori liability to pay a tax and the
         purpose of charging section being only to levy a
         charge on persons and activities brought within
         its clear terms."

<p id="p_49">17. The principles were further stated in this very book as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">           "Liberal construction was recently adopted in
           interpreting <a href="/doc/1171578/" id="a_24">Section 123</a> (c) of the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_25">Railways Act</a>
           1989 which defines 'untoward accident' to
           include 'accidental falling of a passenger from a
           train carrying passengers'. The question is the
           case was whether the expression 'untoward
           accident' as defined will also cover the case of a
           passenger who fell down and died while trying
           to board the train and his dependants will be
           entitled to compensation under <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_26">Section 124A</a> of
           the Act. In answering this question in the
           affirmative the Court said: No doubt, it is
           possible that two interpretations can be given to
           the expression 'accidental felling of a passenger
           from a train carrying passengers', the first being
           that it only applies when a person has actually
           got inside the train and thereafter falls from the
           train, while the second being that it includes a
           situation where a person is trying to board the
           train and falls down while trying to do. Since

           the provision for compensation in <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_27">Railways Act</a>
          is a beneficial piece of legislation, in our
          opinion, it should receive a liberal and wider
          interpretation and not a narrow and a technical
          one. Hence, in our opinion the latter of the
          abovementioned two interpretations i.e. the one
          which advances the object of the statute and
          serves its purpose should be preferred. It has
          also been held by the Court that in the case of a
          social benefit oriented legislation like the
          <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_28">Consumer Protection Act</a>, the provisions of the
          Act have to be considered as broadly as possible
          in favour of the consumer in order to achieve
          the purpose of the enactment but without doing
          violence to the language.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">           The normal rule of interpretation of statute is
          that normally courts would not add or subtract
          words in the process of interpretation. However,
          this principle is subject to a rare exception. The
          exception is that courts can correct obvious
          drafting errors and so in suitable cases, the
          courts will add or omit or substitute words but
          before interpreting a statute in this way, the
          courts must always ensure three matters - (i)
          intended purpose of the statute in question (ii)
          intention and presumption of the Parliament to
          give effect to that purpose in the provisions in
          question, and (iii) the substance of the
          provisions the Parliament would have made
          although errors had been noticed (Refer Inco
          Europe Limited v. First Choice Distribution
          2000(2) All England Reports 109-115)."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_50">18. The Indian courts have also permitted departure from the

rule of literal construction so as to avoid the statute becoming

meaningless. Normally, it is not allowable to read words in a

statute which are not there but where the alternative allows

either by supplying words which appear to have been accidentally

omitted or adopting a construction which deprives certain

existing words of all meaning, it is permissible to supply the

words - <a href="/doc/27215/" id="a_29">Surjit Singh v. Union of India</a> 1991(2) SCC 87 and <a href="/doc/54600/" id="a_30">Surajul

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">          The principles of statutory construction are
          well settled. Words occurring in statutes of
          liberal import such as social welfare
          legislation and human rights' legislation are
          not to be put in Procrustean beds or shrunk
          to liliputian dimensions. In construing these
          legislations    the    imposture     of   literal
          construction must be avoided and the
          prodigality of its misapplication must be
          recognised and reduced. Judges ought to be
          more concerned with the 'colour', the 'content'
          and the context of such statutes (we have
          borrowed the words from Lord Wilberforce's
          opinion in Prenn v. Simmonds). In the same
          opinion Lord Wilberforce pointed out that law
          is not to be left behind in some island of
          literal interpretation but is to enquire beyond
          the language, unisolated from the matrix of
          facts in which they are set; the law is not to
          be interpreted purely on internal linguistic
          considerations."

<p id="p_54">20. From the analysis of the above principle, it is crystal clear

that in the case of a social or beneficial legislation, the Court or

Tribunals are to adopt a liberal and purposive construction as the

above rule of literal construction. Social or beneficial legislation

is intended to achieve a much greater purpose and the very

purpose of enacting such law could be frustrated by application

 of stringent rules of construction. The purpose, in the present

case, is to ensure clear and pollution-free air quality to the

citizens of the country, and therefore, it is necessary to regulate

carrying on of such businesses which cause or which are likely to

cause pollution of air. Carrying on a business, trade or profession

is a fundamental right guaranteed to an individual in terms of

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_33">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India but such a right is

subject to reasonable restrictions and limitations. The concept of

limitations and reasonable restrictions is not only inbuilt in the

Constitutional scheme of India but is specifically incorporated in

different Articles of the Constitution with emphasis on sub-clause

6 of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_34">Article 19(1).</a> Thus, the applicant cannot contend that he

has the right to carry on the business of stone crushing, free of

restrictions and limitations. Restrictions may be imposed by law

that is in force or which may be enacted by the State in the

interest of general public. The restrictions, inter alia, and in

particular relate to technical qualifications of carrying on any

profession, business or trade. The restriction imposed in relation

to adherence to prescribed parameters of emissions under the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_35">Air

Act</a> thus is a restriction made by law, as the Supreme Court held

in the case of <a href="/doc/1875824/" id="a_36">N.D. Jayal v. Union of India</a> (2004) 9 SCC 362. The

concept of welfare, in a Constitutional democracy, does not mean

that we only have to strive for fulfilment of political theory -

greatest good of greatest number. Our motto from Vedic times

has been Sarva Jan Hitay Sarva Jan Sukhay i.e. benefit of all and

happiness of all.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                               18</span>
</p><p id="p_56"> 21. Thus, while interpreting the expressions used by the Board

in its guidelines for discharging its statutory functions, these

have to be construed liberally, and if necessary, the Tribunal may

even supply the requisite and necessary words or read the words

with such expanded meaning that would help in furthering the

cause of the statute for the larger public good. Now let us revert

to examination of the expression 'residential area'. 'Residential

area' obviously means an area which is being used for residence.

In other words, it is an area where people reside. Residence is

not an expression that can be interpreted or explained in

isolation. It must essentially relate to 'human activity'. Human

activity is of essence for understanding or even explaining the

expression 'residential area'. The ethos of this expression are

activities performed by human beings where they spend time,

breath or sit for a reasonable time. Residential area can hardly

be imagined de hors the human activity. Human activity is the

essence and all regular and frequent activities in the case of living

beings performed by individuals would ultimately connote the

premises as a residential area. The expression 'residential area',

read in the context of the guidelines dated, 5th January, 2004,

cannot be given a meaning which would result in frustrating their

very object and purpose, and also of the relevant provisions of

law. The purpose of providing a distance of 500 metres from the

residential area is to protect the human beings living in that area

and not the buildings per se. The Supreme Court of India upheld

such restriction of banning operations of stone crushers and

quarries within the radius of 500 metres of the residential area.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                 19</span>
 Even in its judgment, the Supreme Court used the expression

'residential area' in its generic sense.
</p>
<p id="p_57">22. Schools, where large number of young children spend larger

part of their day in the normal and regular course of their lives to

receive education would be an area that would essentially fall in

the expression 'residential area'. The guidelines have to be read

collectively and in conjunction with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_37">Air Act</a>.

On a conjunctive reading, it becomes obvious that the purpose is

to protect human beings from their health being adversely

affected as a result of contamination of air by running of stone

crushers at a distance shorter than 500 metres. Education is a

normal    feature   of   human    living.   The   children   spend        a

considerable amount of time in the classrooms and also in the

open area around their schools. It is a matter of common

knowledge that even in small villages, classes are held in the

open area. In other words, the students spend 5 to 6 hours daily

in their schools.
</p>
<p id="p_58">23. At this stage, we notice some of the adverse impacts of such

activity, which have been scientifically analysed, in relation to air

and noise pollution with specific reference to children. Children

are prone to higher effects of air pollution than adults as they

consume much larger quantity of air per unit body weight that

exposes them to higher degree of air pollution. Max Kilber, as

early as in 1932, invented the theory of "Inverse Size Matter

Metabolic Rate Law". This theory supports what we have stated

above. Thus, adverse environmental impacts of running of stone

crushing units in the vicinity of a school cannot be ignored or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                     20</span>
 ousted on the plea of it not being covered under as residential

area.
</p>
<p id="p_59">24. Similarly, the noise generated by the stone crushers will

adversely affect the concentration level of children. Such activity

is likely to hamper their ultimate performance. Noise has a

'masking' effect. Although a subdued noise is understandable in

a quiet room, it is difficult to understand even a raised voice in

noisy environment, like working of a stone crusher. This

drowning or 'masking' occurs as a result of excitation of auditory

nerve cells. In other words, it affects the understanding,

concentration and capacity of the children to attentively listen to

the lectures of their teachers. Persistent noise has long-term as

well as short-term effects on health of children.

</p><p id="p_60">25. The activities of the teachers, students and rest of the staff in

such institutions satisfy the basic ingredients of a 'residential

area'. Such activities get adversely affected by the air and noise

pollution resulting from carrying on of activities like stone

crushing within a short distance.       The purpose of including

'residential area' within the ambit of the prohibition is to

safeguard human existence from the ill effects of environmental

pollution in those areas. All of them have the fundamental right

in terms of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_38">Article 21</a> of the Constitution to breathe fresh air that

is free of pollution. The right of the applicant to carry on the

business of stone crushing is subject to limitations of law. He

cannot find an escape from complying with the law on such

flimsy grounds. His private interest must give in to the public

interest of the students, teachers and staff at large. The conflict

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                 21</span>
 between public interest and private interest has to be resolved on

the touch stone of the maxim Salus populi est suprema lex.

</p><p id="p_61">26. The framers of the guidelines have not used the words

educational, religious or other institutions in 'paragraph 3' of the

guidelines dated 5th January, 2004. This necessarily does not

follow that they intended to specifically exclude all these

expressions from the ambit of residential area. In our considered

view, the expression 'residential area' read in context with the

other paragraphs of the guidelines, its object and the statutory

provision of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_39">Air Act</a> does not justify exclusion, specific or even

implied. This expression has to be construed as inclusive of what

ought to have been spelt out by the framers of the guidelines. The

Tribunal shall have to supply the gaps which are necessary for

attaining the object and purpose not only of the guidelines but

the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_40">Air Act</a> itself. Hence, reading into such institutions where

effective human activity is carried on in its normal course and

persons spend considerable time in such institutions, would by

necessary implication be the part of the extended connotation of

residential area. Thus, we will give liberal construction to the

expression 'residential area' used in paragraph 3 of the guidelines

dated 5th January, 2004 and read into the said expression being

inclusive of school activity or educational activity.

</p><p id="p_62">27. While referring to the prescribed classification of industries,

a feeble attempt was made by the learned counsel appearing for

the applicant to claim that the stone crushing unit was a non-

polluting one. According to him, the Board classifies the

industries into red, the orange and green categories. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                 22</span>
 contention is that the applicant does not fall in red category i.e.

seriously polluting industry but falls in orange category under

item No.22 and thus is a moderate polluter.        After taking the

requisite measures for preventing pollution, the industry should

be permitted to carry on its business despite the condition of 500

metres, as elucidated in the guidelines afore referred. This

contention, however, does not impress us once there is a

prohibition which is not only in the form of restriction under the

guidelines dated, 5th January, 2004 but is even completely

prohibitive under the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case

of the Kennedy Valley Welfare Association (supra). Thus, we have

no hesitation to reject this contention of the applicant as well.

</p><p id="p_63">28. Lastly, it was contended that different State Boards in the

country had used different and specific expressions wherever the

Boards wanted to include educational institutions to which the

prohibitions/restrictions   provided    in   the   guidelines   were

applicable. Unlike other Boards, the Board of Madhya Pradesh

has not specifically included educational institutions in 'para 3' of

the guidelines dated, 5th January, 2004. The said restriction

cannot be applied in the case of the applicant. The Tamil Nadu

Pollution Control Board has also not specifically used the

expression 'educational activity'. However, it has used the word

places of public importance. The Karnataka State Pollution

Control Board, while placing such restrictions, has used the word

'school/educational institution' along with other places. The

Punjab Pollution Control Board has specifically used the words

'educational institutions' along with other places and has also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                    23</span>
 reduced the distance to 300 metres. While relying upon such

clauses contained in different guidelines of various Boards, the

contention of the applicant is that the specific exclusion of the

expression 'educational institution' renders the restriction under

the   guidelines   non-applicable     against   the   applicant.   The

restriction is incapable of being applied against the applicant.

This contention is again equally without merit. After the

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Kennedy Valley

Welfare   Association   (supra)     this   controversy   is   rendered

completely irrelevant. Uniformity in the language of the guidelines

issued by different Boards would help the cause but that would

not ipso facto be of any advantage to the applicant. The applicant

is bound by the law as declared by the Supreme Court as well as

by 'clause 3' of the guidelines dated, 5th January, 2004, issued by

the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. We have held that

the residential area would deem to include an educational

activity. It cannot be excluded on any of the premises advanced

by the applicant. The applicant must not, therefore, be permitted

to carry on the stone crushing activity within 500 metres of the

school area. It is an admitted position before us that the distance

between two schools and the stone crushing unit of the applicant

is less than 500 metres. Emission of dust and other particles

from the stone crushing is inevitable. Its adverse impact on the

health of the young children, teachers and staff is indisputable.

Thus, we see no reason to interfere with the order of the Board

dated 11th August, 2011 and that of the appellate authority dated

13th December, 2011. For the reasons afore recorded, we find no

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                   24</span>
 merits in the present application (appeal). The same is dismissed

while, however, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
