Sewerage Act, 1989 (HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_1">S Act</a>) and Clause 16 of the

agreement entered into between the appellant and the Board.

</p><p id="p_5">2.   The facts giving rise to these appeals are that the appellant-

M/s Vasant Chemicals Limited which is an amalgamation of three

companies is engaged in the manufacture and export of dye

intermediates and other organic chemicals in their units at

Jeedimetla Industrial Estate, Ranga Reddy District, Hyderabad. The

effluents of the appellant industry and other industries were not of

acceptable standards to be let into the sewer line of the Board and

required treatment and therefore, the industrial units in Jeedimetla

Estate decided to establish the Common Effluent Treatment Plant

(CETP). Hence, under the joint efforts of all the chemical units and

other industries including the appellant, a company was formed

namely M/s Jeedimetla Effluents Treatment Limited (JETL) in the

year 1987 to get the effluents treated at their own cost to bring

the quality of the effluents to an acceptable level. The appellant

and the other industrial units made investment by way of shares in

the said company towards its capital. According to the appellant,

it has invested to the extent of more than 29% of the shares in

JETL towards its equity.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.   After treating the effluents to sewer standards as prescribed

under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">(Water Act</a>, 1974) and the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_5">(Environment Act</a>, 1986) between 1988 and 1995, JETL was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                   2</span>
discharging the treated waste water/effluents into the open

drains/nalas in Jeedimetla Area.   After discussion with Hyderabad

Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&amp;SB-the

Board) and the Government of Andhra Pradesh and APPCB, a

dedicated pipeline was laid from the premises of JETL to connect to

the sewerage system of HMWS&amp;SB which is located at a distance

of about 10.38 kilometers at Balanagar at an estimated cost of

Rs.346 lakhs. For the said dedicated pipeline, JETL paid an amount

of Rs.75,00,000/- as its contribution and the balance amount was

contributed by the Board and the Government of Andhra Pradesh.

The pipeline became operational on 31.01.1998.          As per the

direction of APPCB, the industries in IDA Jeedimetla are discharging

their industrial effluents to JETL, which in turn partially treat

effluents and let into the dedicated pipeline connecting JETL and

sewer line at Board’s sewer at Kukatpalli, Balanagar and then

carried to Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) at Amberpet.

</p><p id="p_7">4.   The appellant has obtained bulk water supply connection

from the respondent-HMWS&amp;S Board and the Board accorded

sanction for supply of 36,200 gallons water per day @ Rs.12 per

kilo litre to the appellant-Industry. An agreement was entered into

by the appellant with the respondent-Board on 27.04.1995

stipulating the terms and conditions of supply of water and the

payments required to be made in terms thereto. The agreement

provides that HMWS&amp;SB will supply water to the appellant industry

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                   3</span>
and water charges will be levied for the supply of water as per the

agreement.      Clause 16 of the agreement inter alia provided for

payment of sewerage cess and that the appellant is liable to pay a

sewerage cess in accordance with Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_6">S Act</a>.

Clause 17 of the agreement obligates the appellant to avail the

sewer facility provided by the HMWS&amp;SB if the premises of the

appellant is located at a distance of less than thirty-five meters

from the sewer line of the HMWS&amp;SB.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.      The appellant made representations between 1998 and

February, 2000 stating that levy of sewerage cess was illegal and

contrary to the provisions of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_7">S Act</a> as the appellant is not

discharging its effluents into the sewerage system of the Board.

According to the appellant, the Board insisted upon payment of

the arrears and sought payment of the sewerage cess for the

period January, 1998 to March, 2000 and sought certain amount

towards water cess from 1st January, 1998 to February, 2000 vide

two notices dated 25.01.2000. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant

filed    writ   petitions   in   WP(C)   No.4917/2000   and   WP(C)

No.5044/2000 challenging the notices levying of water cess and

sewerage cess respectively. The writ petitions were dismissed by

the High Court by the common judgment dated 29.10.2003

upholding the levy of sewerage cess by holding that such levy is in

terms of Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_8">S Act</a>. The High Court held that

though the appellant’s premises is not directly connected to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                  4</span>
sewer line of the Board, the industrial effluents of the appellant are

being carried to JETL and after partial treatment at JETL, the same

is let into the sewerage system of the Board. It was further

observed that as per Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_9">S Act</a>, the occupier

of the premises from where the sewerage or effluents are let into

the sewer facility provided by the Board by any means, has to pay

the sewerage cess irrespective of the fact that whether or not the

area is served by sewerage system of the Board. The High Court

pointed out that this statutory liability is incorporated in Clause 16

of the agreement as per which the appellant has to pay sewerage

cess along with water cess @ 20% of the water charges. The High

Court    dismissed    the   writ   petitions   vide   judgement   dated

29.10.2003 holding that the demand notices are not arbitrary and

that do not suffer from any legal infirmities.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.      The appellant filed review petitions being Review MP

No.33154/2003        in   WP(C)    No.4917/2000       and   Review   MP

No.33158/2003 in WP(C) No.5044/2000 before the High Court

which came to be dismissed vide order dated 29.12.2003 on the

ground that the judgment dated 29.10.2003 does not suffer from

any error apparent on the face of the record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.      Mr. V. Giri, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted

that since the premises of the appellant industry is situated in the

area not served by the sewage system of the Board and in terms of

proviso to Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_10">S Act</a>, no sewerage cess is

leviable.    It was contended that since the appellant is covered

under proviso to Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_11">S Act</a>, the statutory

liability cannot be imposed on the appellant on the basis of Clause

16 of the agreement. Without prejudice to the above contentions,

it was urged that under the agreement dated 31.08.2000 between

the JETL and the Board, various charges are levied on JETL which

are in effect sewerage cess and therefore, there cannot be double

levy   for   the   same   service/same   taxable   event   which   is

impermissible under the law. It was contended that the various

documents produced and the contentions raised by the parties in

the review petitions were not considered by the High Court and the

High Court erred in dismissing the review petitions.

</p><p id="p_11">8.     Reiterating the above submissions, on behalf of JETL, Mr.

Guru Krishna Kumar, learned senior counsel submitted that under

the agreement dated 31.08.2000, five different kinds of charges

are levied on JETL by the Board namely:- (i) capital contribution

(clause 4); (ii) sewerage connection charges (clause 4); (iii)

charges towards maintenance of sewer line (clause 28); (iv)

sewerage maintenance and sewerage treatment charges (clause

</p><p id="p_12">28); and (v) sewerage surcharge for effluents above a certain level

(clause 29) and those charges though not christened as sewerage

cess, they are in effect sewerage cess in terms of Section 55 of

HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_12">S Act</a>. It was further contended that various charges levied

on JETL by virtue of the agreement dated 31.08.2000 correspond to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                   6</span>
the sewerage cess under Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_13">S Act</a> and levy of

sewerage cess on the appellant for the same act of discharging of

the same sewage, would therefore amount to a double levy on the

industrial units.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.    On behalf of the respondent Board, learned senior counsel

Mr. Gourab Banerji submitted that the appellant industry, obtaining

bulk water supply from the Board and discharging sewage into the

sewer line of the Board, is liable to pay sewerage cess under

Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_14">S Act</a>. It was submitted that since after

partial treatment at JETL, the effluents are let into the sewer line of

the Board through which the effluents are carried to Sewerage

Treatment Plant (STP) at Amberpet for further treatment, the

appellant is connected to the sewerage system of the Board and is

liable to pay sewerage cess under Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_15">S Act</a>.

It was contended that Clause 16 of the agreement incorporates the

levy under Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_16">S Act</a> and the Rules and

Regulations thereunder and as per the terms of the agreement

also, the appellants are liable to pay sewerage cess. Insofar as the

plea of double taxation, it was submitted that the JETL was not a

party to the writ petitions filed by the appellant and the

subsequent writ petition in WP(C) No.17381/2004 filed by the JETL

inter alia challenging the sewerage surcharge under various

agreements was already dismissed for default by the High Court.

sewage or industrial effluents, as the case may be, are let into the

bulk water supply connection from the Board for the supply of

36,200 gallons of water per day @ Rs.12/- per kilo litre for the

sewer trunk, a dedicated pipeline to the extent of 10.38 kilo meters

from JETL to Kukatpally and Sanathnagar Main Line was laid. The

cost of laying the pipeline is stated to be Rs.346 lakhs out of which

contribution of the JETL was Rs.75 lakhs and the balance amount

was contributed by the Board and the Government of Andhra

</p><p id="p_28">16.   The appellant being an occupier of a “non-domestic premise”

having bulk water supply connection from the Board and “a

consumer of water” and eventually discharging sewage effluents

into the sewer line of the Board, the essential ingredients of

<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_29">Section 55</a> are thus satisfied.    The levy of sewage cess by the

respondent is a statutory levy which the appellant is liable to pay

under Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_30">S Act</a>.       Clause 16 of the agreement

provides for payment of sewerage cess in terms of <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_31">Section 55</a> of

the Act which inter alia stipulates that the appellant is required to

pay sewerage cess in accordance with <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_32">Section 55</a> of the Act. The

sewerage cess of 35% levied by the Board for carrying the sewage

of the acceptable quality through its transmission system is thus

both statutory and in terms of the agreement between the

appellant and JETL.
</p>
<p id="p_29">17.   Contention of the appellant is that it is not liable to pay

sewerage cess to the Board as it is not letting out the sewage

effluents to the sewage system of the Board but is carrying the

effluents in the tanker, lorries and letting it out in the effluent

treatment of JETL and thus is not connected with the sewage line

of the Board. Mr. V. Giri, learned senior counsel for the appellant

contended that the appellant industry is not connected with

cess under Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_33">S Act</a> is not sustainable.

Drawing our attention to the finding of the High Court “that there

is no sewerage line of HMWS&amp;SB connecting the appellant’s

premises to the sewerage system of HMWS&amp;SB…..”, the learned

senior counsel for the appellant submitted that since there is no

sewer or drainage line connecting the appellant industry, proviso

to Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_34">S Act</a> applies and no sewerage cess is

leviable.   It was further submitted that even assuming that the

dedicated pipeline from JETL for carrying its treated effluents to the

sewerage system of the Board at Balanagar is a “sewerage system

of the Board” which is more than two kilo meters from the

premises of the appellant industry, JETL is separately paying the

surcharge and the appellant is not connected with the sewerage

system and therefore, there cannot be levy of sewerage cess on

the appellant under Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_35">S Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_30">18.   As pointed out earlier, admittedly, the appellant has obtained

bulk water supply connection from the Board for supply of 36,200

gallons of water per day @ Rs.12/- per kilo litre. It is also admitted

that the appellant is discharging its industrial effluents into the

Board sewer line. The appellant being an occupier of the premises

who is consuming water and discharging sewage into the sewerage

system of the Board, in terms of Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_36">S Act</a>, is

liable to pay sewerage cess. Though the pipeline from JETL to

Kukutpally/Balanagar is stated to be the dedicated pipeline, as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                   14</span>
pointed out earlier, this was laid at the cost of Rs.346 lakhs, out of

which, JETL has paid only Rs.75 lakhs. The rest of the cost was

borne by the Board and the Government of Andhra Pradesh. It is

pertinent to note that Clause 4 of the agreement dated 31.01.1998

between JETL and the Board categorically stipulates that the

dedicated pipeline from JETL to Kukutpally/Balanagar belongs to

the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_31">19.   As per <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_37">Section 54</a> of the Act, sewage which is likely to

damage or interfere with the free maintenance of the sewerage

system of the Board cannot be passed into the Board sewer and

sewage treatment works. In terms of Section 54 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_38">S Act</a>,

Clause 19 is also incorporated in the agreement dated 27.04.1995

between the appellant industry and HMWS&amp;SB. As per Clause 19

of the agreement, no effluents shall be discharged into the Board’s

sewerage system unless such effluents are treated in accordance

with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_39">Water Act</a>, 1974.           Clause 19 reads as

under:-

Admittedly, JETL is neither a consumer of bulk water supply nor

generating any sewage/industrial effluents of its own.               The

effluents of the appellant industry are not of acceptable standards

for transmission system of the Board. Before the effluents of the

appellant industry are to be let into the sewer line of the Board, the

appellant industry has to get the effluents treated at its own cost

to bring the quality of the effluents to an acceptable level. After

getting partial treatment from JETL, the effluents are let into the

said   dedicated   pipeline   which    belongs    to   the   Board    at

Kukutpally/Balanagar and then they are let into 1000 mm diameter

sewage trunk belonging to the Board through which the effluents

are carried to Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) at Amberpet

measuring a distance of 18.90 kilo meters. The length of the

pipeline from JETL to Amberpet is 29.28 kilo meters. Though the

appellant’s unit is not directly connected with the Board sewer line,

the industrial effluents of the appellant unit partially treated at JETL

are ultimately let into the Board sewer line which is finally carried

to STP at Amberpet. In the light of this admitted factual position,

the appellant is liable to pay sewerage cess under <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_41">Section 55</a> of

the Act. Proviso to <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_42">Section 55</a> of the Act contemplates that the

sewerage cess shall not be levied on the occupier of the premises

if such premises is stated to be in an area which is not served by

the sewerage system of the Board. The proviso implies that the

occupier of such premises cannot use the Board sewer by any

means whatsoever. Therefore, the contention of the appellant that

it is not liable to pay sewerage cess to the Board as it is not

directly letting out sewage effluents into the sewage line of the

Board and that it is carrying its effluents in the tanker, lorries and

letting out in the effluent treatment plant of JETL and thus not

connected with the sewage system of the Board, in our view, is

wholly untenable.     Since the sewage of the appellant is ultimately

let into the sewer line of the Board, the appellant cannot contend

that it is not covered under <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_43">Section 55</a> of the Act and that it is

covered under proviso to <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_44">Section 55</a> of the Act.

Maharashtra and another</a>, (2011) 13 SCC 497, learned senior

counsel for the appellant contended that when a particular cess is

leviable under an enactment and the said enactment exempts a

specific class of persons from paying the said cess, the State

Government cannot make the lessee liable to pay the said cess on

the ground that the agreement was entered into under a different

enactment. Placing reliance upon paras (12) and (20) of the said

any fiscal extraction is required to be constructed strictly in

accordance with the provisions of the charging section and even if

a clause for such payment is incorporated into the agreement as

the agreement is subject to the provision of the relevant charging

section.
</p>
<p id="p_33">21.   The above argument proceeds on the presumptive footing as

if the appellant’s unit is covered under proviso to Section 55 of the

HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_48">S Act</a>. Proviso to Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_49">S Act</a> states that no

charge would be levied in any premises situated outside the

sewage system/not served by the sewerage system of the Board.

It has to be seen whether the appellant is right in contending that

the appellant industry is not connected with the sewerage line of

the Board and that no sewage of the appellant is let into the

sewerage system of the Board and therefore, the appellant is

covered under proviso to Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_50">S Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_37">23.    Let us now consider the effect of the agreement between the

appellant and JETL on the statutory liability of the appellant under

<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_51">Section 55</a> of the Act. The agreement between the appellant and

JETL for partial treatment of appellant’s industrial effluents is the

internal contractual agreement between JETL and the appellant.

The appellant unit is to treat and process the industrial effluents

and bring them down to permissible standard limits in accordance

with the provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_52">Water Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_53">Environment Act</a>, 1986

relating to discharge and disposal of industrial effluents and other

objectionable effluents into sewers before discharging of the

effluents into the Board sewer. The treated effluents should also

have to conform to the IS specification laid down from time to time

for disposal of effluent into the domestic sewer of the Board. To

discharge their contractual obligation in bringing the industrial

effluents to permissible standard limits, the appellant unit entered

into an agreement dated 22.01.1996 with JETL engaging it to treat

its industrial effluents in accordance with the environmental laws

in force. The appellant instead of treating the effluents at its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                  19</span>
premises at its own cost engaged JETL for treating its effluents.

Thus, for its convenience, the appellant unit has entered into an

agreement with JETL for treating its effluents and the charges paid

by them to JETL are towards the treatment of effluents and bring it

to permissible standards. Therefore, the function of JETL is that of

an    intermediary     with     whose     assistance,   the   appellant   is

discharging its statutory obligation.
</p>
<p id="p_38">24.    Admittedly, the appellant’s industrial effluents are carried to

JETL in closed tankers and after partial treatment at JETL, let into

the Board’s sewer line. Admittedly, the effluents of the appellant’s

unit are not of acceptable standards for transmission through the

sewer line of the Board and therefore, the appellant’s industry and

other industries have to get the effluents treated at their own cost

to bring the quality of the effluents to an acceptable level by

treating the same to some extent. The sewerage cess of 35%

levied by the Board is for carrying the sewerage of acceptable

quality through its sewer line and further treating it at STP at

Amberpet.
</p>
<p id="p_39">25.    The sewerage cess aims to recover the cost of treating the

effluents of strength stronger than domestic sewage and to make

the effluents of acceptable quality. In addition to partial treatment

at    JETL,   the   effluents   require   further   treatment   and   their

transmission to Sewer Treatment Plant (STP) at Amberpet situated


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                          20</span>
at 18.90 kms from Bala Nagar which requires huge finance. The

maintenance    of   sewer   line   is   highly   essential   for   proper

transmission of the effluents from JETL to Board’s sewer system at

Amperpet where the Board brings down the industrial effluents to

the tolerance limits. It requires huge amount to maintain the STP

treatment of industrial effluents. Further, it requires high demand

of energy, STP personnel to operate and maintain the system,

skilled and unskilled workers for proper maintenance of the plant.

The respondent-Board unless it collects sewerage cess and other

charges cannot meet the heavy expenditure on the operation and

maintenance of sewerage system. The liability of the appellant to

pay sewerage cess to the Board arises from the Statute and also

by way of an agreement which was agreed upon by the appellant.

There is no merit in the contention of the appellant unit that its

liability has ended upon transferring the industrial effluents to the

respondent-JETL and that it is not connected to the Board’s sewer

line. As discussed earlier, the partially treated effluents of the

appellant’s unit are ultimately let into the sewer line provided by

the Board which is being carried to Amberpet STP for further

treatment and discharge. After partial treatment at JETL, when

appellant’s effluents are let into the Board’s sewage system, the

appellant is not justified in contending that it is not connected to

the sewer line of the Board and hence, covered under the proviso

Act</a> is a statutory levy on the appellant as it satisfies the essential

requirements of <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_59">Section 55</a> of the Act. The agreement/contract

between the appellant’s unit and JETL does not take away the

appellant from the network of the Board’s sewer line and its “ use

and treatment of sewerage” of the Board’s sewerage system.

Where the appellant’s effluents are being eventually sent to the

Board’s sewer, the contention of the appellant that its premises

are not served with a sewer line by the Board defies logic and runs

contrary to the object of the Act. The appellant, being an occupier

of non-domestic premises, is consuming the water provided by the

Board, generating the industrial effluents and using the Board’s

sewer to release them after partial treatment. In such an admitted

position, the appellant cannot escape from the statutory levy by

taking a technical approach and interpreting the proviso as a

general rule where it is merely a qualifying one. As the appellant

eventually lets out its effluents to the Board’s sewerage system,

the appellant is not right in contending that it is covered under

proviso to     <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_60">Section 55</a> of the Act.

system of the Board at Balanagar is construed to be “Sewer”, any

levy of sewerage cess is applicable only to JETL and JETL under its

agreement with HMWS&amp;SB, is paying surcharges and sewerage

charges to HMWS&amp;SB by collecting the said amount from the

appellants and other industries for the said taxable event. It was

submitted that under Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_61">S Act</a>, the sewerage

cess is collected for the – (i) to defray capital cost of sewerage; (ii)

for sewage treatment works undertaken by the Board; and (iii) for

operation and maintenance of the sewerage system.                  It is

contended that under its agreement dated 31.08.2000 with the

Board, JETL is paying various charges like - (i) sewerage

connection charges; (ii) charges towards maintenance of sewer

line; (iii) sewerage maintenance and water treatment charges; and

</p><p id="p_46">(iv) sewerage surcharge for effluents above a certain level.     It was

contended that various charges paid by JETL to the Board is in

essence “sewerage cess”, though it is collected under different

head “sewerage surcharge”.
</p>
<p id="p_47">29.   Taking us through Clause 4 of the agreement with Board

dated 31.08.2000, Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned senior counsel

appearing for JETL submitted that under agreement dated

31.08.2000, various charges are collected and it additionally

provides for levy of surcharge also. It is contended that even

though these charges may not be christened as a sewerage cess,

they are in effect correspond to the essentials of “sewerage cess”

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                     24</span>
in    <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_62">Section 55</a> and a levy of cess from the appellant for the same

act of disposal of the sewage would therefore amount to a double

levy on the industrial units. The learned senior counsel submitted

that sewerage cess cannot be exacted from the appellant because

it is already been paid by JETL. It was urged that various charges

levied on JETL are excessive arbitrary apart from the fact that

there is a double levy.
</p>
<p id="p_48">30.   As rightly contended by learned senior counsel for the

respondent-Board, the plea of double payment of sewerage cess

was never raised in the writ petition filed by the appellant; but it

was raised by way of oral submission before the High Court and

thereafter, by way of review petition. The plea of double levy was

rightly rejected by the High Court inter alia holding that “even

assuming for a moment that the petitioner-company is paying

some amounts to the JETL, it cannot be said that it is towards

sewerage cess”.
</p>
<p id="p_49">31.   As pointed out by the learned senior counsel for the

respondent-Board, JETL never sought to implead itself as a party

respondent in the writ petition filed by the Board.       It is also

pertinent to point out that one Mr. G.K.B. Chowdary who was then

the Managing Director of the appellant-group of companies, was

also the Managing Director of JETL. It passes one’s comprehension

as to why JETL whose Managing Director is the same as the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                 25</span>
Managing Director of the appellant Group of Companies had not

taken any step to get themselves impleaded in the writ petition

before the High Court and raise the plea of double taxation.

</p><p id="p_50">32.   In the Supreme Court, notice was ordered on 07.07.2004 and

permitted the appellant to implead JETL as party respondent. It

was thereafter, JETL filed writ petition in WP(C) No.17381/2004

(24.09.2004) inter alia for various reliefs:- (i) That clauses 28

and 29 of the agreement dated 10.06.2003 between the petitioner

company Jeedimetla Effluent Treatment Limited and HMWS&amp;SB as

shylockin    and      unconscionable,      usurious,      exorbitant,

unconstitutional, ultra vires the powers of the HMWS&amp;SB; and (ii)

That the action of the HMWS&amp;SB in collecting various charges

under Clause 4 of the agreement and other charges levied upon

JETL. The said writ petition that kept pending for many years came

to be dismissed by the High Court’s order dated 21.12.2015 for

non-prosecution.     JETL has also filed WP(C) No.20117/2017

challenging the enhancement of sewerage surcharge and the said

writ petition is also said to have been dismissed on 25.06.2014.

</p><p id="p_51">33. Since,    elaborate   arguments     were   advanced    regarding

“excessive and arbitrary levy on JETL” as well as the plea of

“double levy of sewerage cess”, we have also considered the

matter on merits. Based on three sets of agreements between the

parties, there are three kinds of payments as under:-


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                   26</span>
</p><p id="p_52">  a) Payment of sewerage cess by the appellant to the Board in
      terms of Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_63">S Act</a> and Clause 16 of
      the agreement dated 27.04.1995;
</p><p id="p_53">  b) Payment of treatment and processing service charges by
      the appellant unit to JETL as stipulated in Clause 19 of the
      agreement    between    the   appellant   and   JETL   dated
      01.04.2000; and
</p><p id="p_54">  c) Various charges paid by JETL to the Board pursuant to the
      agreement dated 31.08.2000 and the earlier agreements.

So far as the payment by the appellant unit to the Board, it is the

statutory liability of payment of sewerage cess in terms of

Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_64">S Act</a> and Clause 16 of the agreement which

obligates the appellant unit to pay the sewerage cess in terms of

Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_65">S Act</a>. The appellant having bulk water

supply connection from the Board and being “consumer of water”

and discharging sewage/effluents into the sewer line of the Board,

the payment of sewerage cess by the appellant unit is the

statutory liability under Section 55 of the HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_66">S Act</a> and Clause

16 of the agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_55">34.   Insofar as the charges paid by the appellant to JETL for the

treatment and processing of its effluents, it is purely contractual

pursuant to the agreement entered into between the appellant unit

and JETL dated 01.04.2000 and the earlier agreement dated

22.01.1996. As pointed out earlier, the appellant unit is obligated

to treat and process the industrial effluents and bring them down

to permissible standard limits in accordance with the provisions of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                     27</span>
the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_67">Water Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_68">Environment Act</a>, 1986 before they are let

into the sewer line of the Board. To discharge its statutory as well

as contractual obligation, the appellant unit has entered into

agreement with JETL      for   the treatment and processing of

appellant’s effluents before being let into Board’s sewer line.

Payment of charges by the appellant to JETL is purely contractual

between the parties and the same cannot be considered to be in

deference to the statutory cess/statutory charge which can only be

levied by the Board.    In this regard, the High Court has rightly

observed that assuming that the appellant is paying some amount

to JETL, the same cannot be termed as “sewerage cess”.

</p><p id="p_56">35.   So far as payment of charges by JETL to the respondent

Board, the same is governed by the terms and conditions of the

agreement between JETL and the Board dated 31.08.2000. JETL’s

contention is two fold: - (i) levy of various charges under the

agreement is arbitrary and exorbitant; and (ii) double levy of

sewerage cess. The gist of the terms and conditions of the contract

dated 31.08.2000 between JETL and the Board and various charges

levied are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_57">  1. Clause 4 specifically stipulated that JETL shall be charged
      towards overall proportionate sewerage maintenance and
      sewerage treatment charges being incurred by the Board
      from time to time on the overall sewerage system of the
      Board;
</p>
<p id="p_58">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                   28</span>
</p><p id="p_59">  2. In terms of Clause 4, the Board has levied sewerage
      connection charges @ Rs.4/- per litre for the discharge into
      the Board sewer (6 equal installments of Rs.23.34 lakhs
      each by 10th of each month) – Total Rs.140.04 lakhs;
</p><p id="p_60">  3. Clause 18 stipulates that no treated effluent shall be
      discharged    by    JETL   unless   the   same   is   treated   in
      accordance with the provisions of the Water and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_69">Air
      Act</a>s and the various upper limits of the parameters of the
      treated industrial effluents shall be within the permissible
      standard limits prescribed; Further, Clauses 22 to 24 give
      the Board the right to reject effluents of JETL if they are not
      found to be consistent with the prescribed parameters;
</p><p id="p_61">  4. In terms of Clause 28, an amount of rupees one lakh per
      month is to be paid by JETL towards maintenance of the
      sewer line.        Additionally, JETL has to pay sewerage
      maintenance and sewerage treatment charges @ Rs.6 per
      thousand litres of treated effluents;
</p><p id="p_62">  5. Further, as per Clause 29, a surcharge was also levied on
      JETL for permitting industrial effluents beyond the limits
      prescribed on two important parameters viz. Chemical
      Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS);
      Each    parameter/COD       and     TDS   will   be   considered
      independent for levy the surcharge.
</p>
<p id="p_63">36.   In terms of Rule 4 of Sewerage Rules, the Board shall charge

on the applicants seeking to discharge the trade or industrial

effluents etc. Rule 4 reads as under:-
</p>
      “Sewerage and Industrial Effluents-<p id="p_64">

</p><p id="p_65">      4.     The Board shall charge on applicants seeking to
      discharge their trade or industrial effluents, sullage drain,
      sewer (other than storm sewer or combined sewer) of a
      private party, State Government, Central Government, or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                           29</span>
      local body or local authority, into Board sewers, towards
      the special treatment cost of such sewage and the charges
      shall be as fixed by the Board from time to time, depending
      upon the nature of such sewage and cost of treatment
      involved to bring the same within tolerance limits of
      effluent standards etc. The installation and maintenance
      of required meters for measuring the volume of effluents
      shall be insisted at the cost of the applicants, by the
      board.”


Subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_70">Water Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_71">Environment Act</a>,

1986 and subject to the restrictions of Section 54 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_72">S Act</a>

and in terms of Rule 4 and other terms and conditions, Board has

the right to permit the ‘applicants’ seeking to discharge their trade

or industrial effluents into the Board’s sewer system and Sewerage

Treatment Plant subject to the imposition of costs. The treatment

for letting the trade or industrial effluents into the Board’s sewer

shall be subject to such terms and conditions and in such form of

agreement as may be prescribed in the regulations made by the

Board in accordance with these rules. Having entered into the

agreement with the Board on 31.08.2000 and on prior dates, JETL

cannot turn around and challenge the terms and conditions

imposed upon it by virtue of the agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_66">37.   So far as the various payments made by JETL to the Board,

levy is in terms of Rule 4 of the Sewerage Rules and as per the

contract   and   is   purely   contractual   between   JETL   and   the

respondent Board for letting partially treated the industrial

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                                     30</span>
effluents of the appellant and other units into the Board’s sewer.

Likewise, charges paid by JETL to the Board cannot be said to be in

lieu of the sewerage cess that the appellant unit is liable to pay

which is a statutory liability.   It is pertinent to note that many

industries about fifty units, apart from the appellant unit, discharge

their effluents to the CETP/JETL. The agreement dated 31.08.2000

and the earlier agreements between JETL and the Board are purely

contractual consciously entered into between the parties.

</p><p id="p_67">38.   JETL lets partially treated effluents into the Board’s sewerage

system for further treatment.      As discussed earlier, for further

treatment of sewerage, the effluents are to be taken to Sewerage

Treatment Plant (STP) at Amberpet which is situated at the

distance of 08.30 kilometres from Balanagar.        It requires huge

amount for transmission of the effluents to Board’s sewer system

at Amberpet where the Board brings down the industrial effluents

to tolerance limits. As pointed out earlier, the treatment of

industrial effluents requires high demand of energy, personnel to

operate the system and skilled workers for maintenance of the

plant. Unless the Board collects sewerage charge/sewerage

surcharge, the Board cannot meet the heavy expenditure on the

operation and maintenance of sewerage system.          Various other

members of JETL who discharge sewage into JETL which is

ultimately let into Board sewer line, may or may not be consumers

of water supply by the Board. That apart, members of JETL may

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                   31</span>
have their own source of water supply or they may supplement the

supply of water from the Board through different sources either by

extraction of ground water or supply through tankers which cannot

be quantified by the Board. In pursuance of the provisions of the

HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_73">S Act</a> and the Sewerage Rules and pursuant to the

agreement dated 31.08.2000, the charges are levied on JETL who

in turn collects the charges from its member industrial units who

discharge their effluents into JETL. Therefore, the payments made

by JETL to the Board and the charges in turn collected by JETL from

the appellant and other member units, cannot absolve the

appellant unit from its statutory liability to pay the sewerage cess.

We find no merit in the contention that there is double levy of

sewerage cess.
</p>
<p id="p_68">39.   Levy of sewerage cess being a statutory levy in terms of

Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_74">S Act</a> and Clause 16 of the agreement which

incorporates the statutory levy under Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_75">S Act</a>,

the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench rightly recorded

concurrent findings upholding the levy.        Observing that the

appellant being occupier of the premises, though not directly

connected to the sewer line of the Board, is ultimately letting into

the sewerage system of the Board after partial treatment at JETL,

the High Court was right in holding that the levy of sewerage cess

is in accordance with Section 55 of HMWS&amp;<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_76">S Act</a>. The payment of

sewerage surcharges and the other charges by JETL cannot take

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                  32</span>
away the statutory liability of sewerage cess levied on the occupier

of the premises who consumes water and lets out the sewage into

the Board sewer system. The payment of sewerage surcharge and

other charges by JETL to the respondent-Board will not amount to

double levy and the High Court rightly dismissed the writ petitions

and also the review petitions filed by the appellant. The impugned

order does not suffer from any infirmity warranting interference.

</p><p id="p_69">40.   In the result, these appeals are dismissed.    The arrears of

sewerage cess, if any, to be paid by the appellant within a period

of eight weeks from today with 6% interest with effect from the

date cess fell due. If the arrears are not paid within the stipulated

period of eight weeks, it shall carry interest at the rate of 12%

thereafter.
