</blockquote><p id="p_5">      2.          At the outset, the learned Advocate-General appearing
      for the State of Jharkhand and Mr. Rajiv Sinha, the learned counsel
      appearing for the respondent-Union of India have raised a
      preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition on
      the ground that the petitioner has already availed statutory remedy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>

under <a href="/doc/698051/" id="a_3">Section 30</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development and
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_6">3.            The petitioner has pleaded that on 10.07.1972 it was
granted a non-captive lease for iron and manganese ore for a period
of 30 years, and before expiry of the lease period it applied for
renewal of the mining lease on 09.07.2001, however, no decision
was taken by the respondent-State on the application for renewal.
The petitioner was granted environmental clearance for quantity of
1,00,000 MT per annum on 23.01.2007, which was revised
/modified on 19.07.2013 by which it was permitted mining to the
extent of 8,00,000 MT per annum. In paragraph no. 7 of the writ
petition, the petitioner has asserted that it has been granted all
statutory clearances, however, these documents have not been
produced. In the chart appended to the demand notice dated
12.09.2017 it has been mentioned that the maximum permissible
quantity of minerals to be mined, in terms of judgment in "Common
Cause" [W.P.(C) No. 114 of 2014], was 382 MT per annum from
2000-01 till 2005-06, however, the petitioner has extracted mineral
to the extent of 12,86,624 MT in the year 2005-06. Details of royalty
and other statutory payments have not been disclosed by the
petitioner.
</p><p id="p_7">4.            Partner of the petitioner-firm namely, Sri Raj Kumar
Shah, through whom this writ petition has been filed and supported
by his affidavit, is directed to file his personal affidavit disclosing
the amount of royalty, dead rent/ surface rent and all statutory taxes
paid by the petitioner-firm since 2000-01, year-wise, with
documentary proof thereof. The statutory clearances granted to the
petitioner-firm under Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution)
Act</a>, 1974, Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981,

<p id="p_8">          5.             The Secretary, Department of Industries, Mines and
          Geology, Government of Jharkhand shall also file an affidavit
          disclosing the amount of royalty, dead-rent/surface rent and other
          statutory payments made by the petitioner-firm from 2000-01 till

          disclose the decision taken on the order of remand by the revisional
          authority through order dated 20.09.2017 to the demand raised by
          the State on 02.05.2015.
</p><p id="p_9">          6.             The petitioner has already approached the revisional
          authority challenging the demand notice dated 12.09.2017 which, it
          appears was taken up for hearing on 19.03.2018. In the writ petition
          one of the prayers made by the petitioner is to direct the revisional
          authority to hear the application for interim relief. Mr. Rajiv Sinha,
          the learned counsel for the respondent-Union of India submits that
          several applications by the mining lease holders from the State of
          Jharkhand have been filed which are taken up for hearing together.
</p><p id="p_10">          7.             In the above facts, the revisional authority shall hear the
          petitioner's application in the 2nd week of May, 2018. In the
          meantime, the petitioner shall furnish all necessary details and
          documents within one week by filing supplementary affidavit to its
          Revision Application.

          the parties.
