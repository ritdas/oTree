<p id="p_4">           The writ petition was filed by the petitioner raising

grievance regarding emission of odour, smell and stink by the

industries and other establishments including poultry farms and

seeking issuance of directions to the State to take necessary steps

to prevent air pollution. During the pendency of the writ petition, the

Court was informed that Union of India had issued notification dated

15.03.2011 prescribing norms, parameters and standards of the

ambient air quality emitted by such industries and poultry farms.         In

the meantime, Ministry of Environment and Forests issued

notification dated 16.11.2009 providing national ambient air quality

standards. By an application, certain guidelines were placed on

record by the Central Pollution Control Board [hereinafter referred to

as 'the Central Board'] and counsel appearing for Haryana State

Pollution Control Board [hereinafter referred to as 'the State Board']

submitted that these guidelines were being accepted, in view thereof,

the petition was disposed of. The authorities were directed to take

action against the Units not maintaining standards laid down in the

notification issued by the Central Board. It was further ordered that if

the petitioner finds that guidelines were not being followed by the

industrial units, then it will be at liberty to file a complaint with the

Chairman of the State Board, who shall take action forthwith.

</p><p id="p_5">            The contempt petition was filed pleading violation of

directions dated 03.07.2012 of this Court.

</p><p id="p_6">            The grievance raised by the learned counsel for the

petitioner is that in spite of directions of this Court, Poultry Farm is

still continuing at its original place. The further grievance raised is

that while adopting guidelines of the Central Board, the State Board

has made certain modifications to the policy.

</p><p id="p_7">            Learned counsel for the respondent contends that the

Poultry Farm is continuing, as after inspection, it was found that it

is fulfilling the criteria. He further defends the modification to the

guidelines issued by the Central Board by stating that needful was

done considering the ground realities of the State and to make it

effectively implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            From the pleadings, it is forthcoming that in pursuance to

the legal notice given by the petitioner, a show cause notice was

issued to the Poultry Farm on 12.11.2013. Thereafter, on

27.11.2013, the Poultry Farm was inspected by the Regional Officer

of the State Board and it was found that Unit was not complying with

the standing order dated 27.05.2013. It would be pertinent to note

that standing order was passed following the guidelines of the

Central Board.       It was recommended by the officials to the

Environmental Department, Haryana to take appropriate action

under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_1">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986

[hereinafter referred to as 'the Act']. The action was followed by

issuing various show cause notices under the Water (Prevention &amp;

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 as to why the unit should not be closed.

</p><p id="p_9">             Vide order dated 23.04.2014, on the recommendation,

the Government of Haryana issued directions to the Poultry Farm to

stop the farming activities and not to replace/add any Birds in future.

As the Poultry Farm was not complying with the directions, a

complaint under <a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_4">Section 15</a> and <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_5">19</a> of the Act was filed before the

Environment Court, Faridabad. On 10.11.2015, order of closures

were issued by the State Government directing the Poultry Farm to

dispose of all the existing birds within sixty days. An FIR was lodged

against the Poultry Farm as it was disrupting the inspection by the

officials.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             Aggrieved of the closure order, the Poultry Farm filed an

appeal before the National Green Tribunal [hereinafter referred to as



                                3 of 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">             ::: Downloaded on - 12-01-2020 00:49:03 :::</span>

'the Tribunal'] raising a grievance that guidelines/ standing order was

being complied with and the inspection made by the officials was not

proper. During the pendency of the appeal, inspections were made

by the State Board. The Tribunal vide interim order dated

13.05.2016, directed the Central Board to inspect the Poultry Farm.

A joint inspection was carried out by the Central Board and the State

Board on 25.05.2016. As per the inspection report, it was found that

Poultry Farm was complying with the standing order dated

27.05.2013, as the said guidelines/criteria were not applicable to the

Poultry Farms commissioned prior to the issuance of the standing

order. The appeal was disposed of on 29.07.2016, directing the

Poultry Farm to file fresh application before the State Board, seeking

consent to operate. The Board was directed to deal with the

application expeditiously. The State Board rejected the application

on 28.09.2016. Against the rejection order, appeal was filed before

the Tribunal. The Tribunal, on 01.02.2017, allowed the appeal. The

Poultry Farm was allowed to run for a period of three months. During

the said period, the State Board, had to conduct the inspection to

ascertain as to whether deficiencies pointed out in the notice by the

Board have been removed or not. The State Board on 18.05.2017,

after inspection, gave consent to the Poultry Farm to resume

operations.
</p>
<p id="p_11">              The directions dated 03.07.2012 of this Court that in case

petitioner finds that guidelines are not being followed, a complaint

could be made to the State Board, which shall take stern action,



                                 4 of 8

were duly complied with in this case.           From the facts mentioned

above, it is evident that not only show cause notices were issued,

even inspections were carried out and closure order was also

passed against the Poultry Farm. It is only after the success in the

appeal before the Tribunal and the State Board being satisfied with

regard to the various compliances that a consent for resuming

operations was given.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner submits

that consent to operate has wrongly been given to the Poultry Farm,

as earlier it was rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             The said aspect cannot be gone into the contempt

proceedings. It will not be within the ambit of the contempt

proceedings to go into the challenge to the order giving consent to

operate. Moreso, the Poultry Farm is not impleaded as a party in the

contempt petition, it would be against the principles of natural justice

to make any adverse observations against the person who is not a

party to the litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

contempt Court should restrict itself to the order passed by the Writ

Court and should not take into consideration proceedings before the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             There is no quibble with the said proposition. The

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/154364185/" id="a_6">Er. K. Arumugam Vs. V. Balakrishnan &amp; Ors</a>.

2019 AIR(SC) 818 held that the contempt Court shall restrict itself

within the four corners of the order passed which is alleged to be

violated.
</p>
<p id="p_16">            This itself fortifies the fact that in contempt proceedings,

the challenge posed to the order giving consent to operate and

grievance against the Tribunal's order cannot be entertained.

</p><p id="p_17">            Further reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme

Court in Jhareswar Prasad Paul Vs. Tarak Nath Ganguly 2002(5)

SCC 352. The relevant portion of the order is reproduced below:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                         "The purpose of contempt jurisdiction is to uphold
            the majesty and dignity of the courts of law. Since the respect
            and authority commanded by the courts of law are the greatest
            guarantee to an ordinary citizen and the democratic fabric of
            society will suffer if respect for the judiciary is undermined.
            <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_7">The Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1971 has been introduced under
            the statute for the purpose of securing the feeling of
            confidence of the people in general for true and proper
            administration of justice in the country. The power to punish
            for contempt of courts is a special power vested under the
            Constitution in the courts of record and also under the statute.
            The power is special and needs to be exercised with care and
            caution. It should be used sparingly by the courts on being
            satisfied regarding the true effect of contemptuous conduct. It
            is to be kept in mind that the court exercising the jurisdiction
            to punish for contempt does not function as an original or
            appellate court for determination of the disputes between the
            parties. The contempt jurisdiction should be confined to the
            question whether there has been any deliberate disobedience
            of the order of the court and if the conduct of the party who is
            alleged to have committed such disobedience is contumacious.
            The court exercising contempt jurisdiction is not entitled to
            enter into questions which have not been dealt with and
            decided in the judgment or order, violation of which is alleged




                               6 of 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">            ::: Downloaded on - 12-01-2020 00:49:03 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> COCP No.219 of 2013                                                  -7-</span>

           by the applicant. The court has to consider the direction
           issued in the judgment or order and not to consider the
           question as to what the judgment or order should have
           contained. At the cost of repetition be it stated here that the
           court exercising contempt jurisdiction is primarily concerned
           with the question of contumacious conduct of the party, which
           alleged to have committed deliberate default in complying
           with the directions in the judgment or order. If the judgment or
           order does not contain any specific direction regarding a
           matter or if there is any ambiguity in the directions issued
           therein then it will be better to direct the parties to approach
           the court which disposed of the matter for clarification of the
           order instead of the court exercising contempt jurisdiction
           taking upon itself the power to decide the original proceeding
           in a manner not dealt with by the court passing the judgment
           or order. If this limitation is borne in mind then criticisms
           which are sometimes leveled against the courts exercising
           contempt of court jurisdiction "that it has exceeded its powers
           in granting substantive relief and issuing a direction
           regarding the same without proper adjudication of the
           dispute" in its entirety can be avoided. This will also avoid
           multiplicity of proceedings because the party which is
           prejudicially affected by the judgment or order passed in the
           contempt proceeding and granting relief and issuing fresh
           directions is likely to challenge that order and that may give
           rise to another round of litigation arising from a proceeding
           which is intended to maintain the majesty and image of
           courts."
