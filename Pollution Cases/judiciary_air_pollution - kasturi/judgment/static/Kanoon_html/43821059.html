02/04.02.2020        The present writ petition has been filed for quashing the order as contained

</pre><p id="p_3">            in Reference No. B-2054 dated 31.12.2019 (Annexure-16 to the writ petition)

            passed by the respondent No.2 whereby the petitioner has been directed to pay

            interim environmental compensation of Rs.1,00,00,000/- (One Crore only) and to

            submit the Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs.10,00,00,000/- (Ten Crore only)

            within 30 days from the date of issuance of the said order, failing which Consent to

            Operate issued in favour of the petitioner would be revoked and further direction

            would be issued for closure of the petitioner's unit under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33A</a> of the Water

            (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and under <a href="/doc/74482868/" id="a_3">Section 31A</a> of the Air

            (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981. The petitioner has also made the

            other related prayers.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                     Leaned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned order dated

            31.12.2019 is wholly illegal as the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB)

            has no such power to direct the petitioner to pay interim environmental

            compensation and to submit Performance Bank Guarantee. The petitioner is a

            subsidiary of Orica Limited, Australia which is a world leader in manufacture of

            commercial explosives and has employed more than one thousand persons in

            Gomia,     Jharkhand.    The   petitioner   has   been   complying   all   the   relevant

            environmental laws and is committed to operate its unit in a responsible and

            environmentally sustainable manner. In fact, the impugned order dated 31.12.2019

            has been passed by the respondent-JSPCB after the petitioner approached it with
            an intention to undertake the remedial measures for mitigating the underground

           water pollution in the area.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                  Learned counsel for the respondent-JSPCB, at the outset, submits that the

           present writ petition is not maintainable in view of <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_5">Section 28</a> of the Water

           (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_7">Section 31</a> of the Air

           (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 which provide a forum of appeal

           against the impugned order dated 31.12.2019 passed by the JSPCB.

</p><p id="p_6">                  Having heard leaned counsel for the parties and keeping in view that the

           petitioner has got efficacious/statutory remedy under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_9">Section 28</a> of the Water

           (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_11">Section 31</a> of the Air

           (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 of preferring appeal before the

           appellate authority against the impugned order dated 31.12.2019 passed by the

           Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, I am of the view that the present writ

           petition is not maintainable at this stage. However, if the petitioner approaches the

           appellate authority within a period of 15 days from today by filing a memo of

           appeal along with a limitation petition for condonation of delay in filing the said

           appeal, the appellate authority shall liberally consider the limitation petition and

           shall take up the said appeal on its merit. The petitioner may also file an application

           seeking interim relief before the appellate authority against the impugned order

           dated 31.12.2019 passed by the JSPCB within the aforesaid period which shall be

           considered by the appellate authority without any undue delay. The appellate

           authority thereafter shall proceed to hear the said appeal on its merit and after

           providing due opportunity of hearing to both the sides, shall pass an appropriate

           order in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                  The respondent-JSPCB shall not take any coercive action against the

           petitioner in pursuance of the impugned order as contained in Reference No.

           B-2054 dated 31.12.2019 (Annexure-16 to the writ petition) passed by the

           respondent No.2 till the petitioner's application seeking interim relief is considered

           by the appellate authority.
