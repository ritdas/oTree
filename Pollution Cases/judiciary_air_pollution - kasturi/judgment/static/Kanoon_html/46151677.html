                 W.P. No. 6135/2011 (PIL)
          (Neelesh Dubey v. Government of India and others)

21.01.2015

the respondents 2,3,5 &amp; 7/State.</pre>

respondent No.4.
</p><p id="p_2">      Heard counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_3">      The relief claimed in this petition filed as Public
Interest Litigation is to direct the respondents 1, 5 and 7 to
restrain respondent No.6 to continue with the illegal mining
activity in forest land. Further relief claimed by the petitioner
is to inquire into the matter as to grant of illegal mining
permission in forest land and to take stern action against the
concerned officials of the Revenue Department and Forest
Department, as the case may be, for their acts of commission
and omission.
</p><p id="p_4">      It is noticed that the Under Secretary of the Mining
Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh vide order
dated 10.07.2007 granted prospecting licence in favour of
respondent No.6. On the basis of the said prospecting licence
respondent No.6 approached the District Forest Officer to
grant permission to undertake prospecting on the subject
land. Even the said Authority acceded to the request of
                                                            WP 6135/2011

respondent No.6.
</p><p id="p_5">         According to the petitioner, however, neither the
decision to grant prospecting licence to respondent No.6 in
respect of forest land nor the permission granted by District
Forest Officer can be countenanced and are, in fact, issued
without authority of law. The District Forest Officer has
committed manifest error in granting permission also
because no approval of the Pollution Control Board
Department in respect of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 has been obtained by the licencee. The
petitioner, additionally, has relied on the decisions of the
Apex Court, to buttress the relief claimed in the writ petition,
in the case of <a href="/doc/307206/" id="a_3">Glanrock Estate (P) Ltd. v. State of Tamil
Nadu1</a> and <a href="/doc/1725193/" id="a_4">T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of
India</a> and others2. According to the petitioner, in the light of
the observations in these decisions, neither the Mining
Department, which has granted prospecting licence to
respondent No.6 in respect of forest land nor the District
Forest Officer should have granted permission to carry on
the      intended       activity,   which   inevitably   result    in
contravention of forest laws as well as pollution control
laws.

     petitioner, we deem it appropriate to dispose of this petition
     with a direction to the Principal Secretary, Mining
     Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh and the
     Principal Secretary, Forest Department, Government of
     Madhya Pradesh to reconsider the license/permission granted
     to respondent No.6 in respect of forest land in the light of the
     plea taken by the petitioner in the present petition and, in
     particular, with reference to the dictum of the Apex Court in
     the two decisions referred to above. If the said Authority is
     of the opinion that the said licence/permission has been
     wrongly granted or cannot be allowed to continue further in
     terms of the decisions of the Apex Court, must initiate
     appropriate action in that behalf and take final decision
     expeditiously after following due process and giving
     opportunity to all concerned. The final decision should be on
     its own merits and in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_7">             The Principal Secretary of the respective Department
     shall submit compliance report on or before 31st March,
     2015.
