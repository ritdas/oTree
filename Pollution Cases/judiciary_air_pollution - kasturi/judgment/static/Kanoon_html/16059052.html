<p id="p_1">         1.              The matter pertains to the environment pollution with which we

         are faced with today. Not only the air pollution is being caused

         unabettingly, but we are also faced with the pollution of rivers in the

         country. With respect to the pollution been caused in Delhi and NCR,

         this Court while considering IA No.127792 of 2017 has passed various

         orders and disposed of the application dated 29.1.2018 and while

         taking up the matter relating to the aforesaid Interlocutory Application

         on 14.10.2019 required the Ministry of Environment, Forest and

         Climate Change, Government of India to submit its response along

         with a status report. The matter was thereafter listed on 4.11.2019.

Reason:
</p>



<p id="p_2">         in Delhi and NCR regions. Following order was passed by this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2</span>

on 4.11.2019:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               “We have heard Mr. Bhurelal, who has pointed out about irrigation.
                 We have also heard some experts from the Ministry and the IIT
        and learned senior counsel for the parties and Amicus Curiae.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">               Today everyone is concerned about level of pollution in Delhi and
        NCR region. This is not something new, every year this kind of piquant
        situation arises for a substantial period. It is compounded by the fact that
        year to year in spite of various directions issued by High Court, other
        authorities including this Court the State Governments, Government of
        NCT of Delhi and the corporations of Delhi and nearby States are not
        performing their duties as enjoined upon them. This is a shocking state of
        affairs in which we are put as on today. This is blatant and grave violation
        of right to life of the sizeable population by all these actions and the
        scientific data which has been pointed out indicates that life span of the
        people is being reduced by this kind of pollution which is being created
        and that people are being advised not to come back to Delhi or to leave
        the Delhi due to severe pollution condition which has been created. There
        cannot be large scale exodus. People have to perform their duty in Delhi
        also and people cannot be evacuated from Delhi being a capital city. We
        are at a loss to understand why we are not able to create a situation in
        which this kind of pollution does not take place, that too in a routine
        manner every year. Obviously, it is writ large that the State Governments,
        Government of NCT of Delhi and civic bodies have miserably failed to
        discharge their liability as per the directive principles of State Policy
        which have found statutory expression, they are being made statutory
        mockery and also the directions of this Court and High Courts in this
        regard are being violated with impunity.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">               Time has come when we have to fix the accountability for this kind
        of situation which has arisen and is destroying Right to Life itself in
        gross violation of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. No farmer can
        be said to be having a right under the guise that he is not having
        sufficient time to use the stubble for the purpose of manure, since they
        have less time between two crops, cutting and sowing of next crop. As
        such, they cannot by burning it in their fields, put life of sizeable
        population in jeopardy.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">               It is apparent from the satellite images which have been produced
        before us for the period 30.10.2019 to 04.11.2019. The satellite image
        clearly indicates that in Punjab there is widespread stubble burning which
        has taken place as compared to Haryana, in which only in four districts it
        has taken place. There is some burning in Western U.P. also. It could not
        have taken place even in a singular district or gram panchayat area as we
        live in a civilized country in which such kind of activities which create
        such menacing pollution not only in the area concerned but to the
        neighboring States also, by ill-effects of that people cannot be left to die
        or to suffer various ailments.</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">               Everybody has to be answerable including the top state machinery
        percolating down to the level of gram panchayat. The very purpose of
        giving administration power up to the panchayat level is that there has to
        be proper administration and there is no room for such activities. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>

action is clearly tortuous one and is clearly punishable under statutory
provisions, besides the violation of the Court’s order. In the
circumstances, as widespread stubble burning has taken place, we direct
the States of Punjab and Haryana and adjoining State of Uttar Pradesh
where there is blatant violation which has taken place, to halt it. We
direct the Chief Secretaries of the States of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar
Pradesh to be present in this Court on 06.11.2019 including Chief
Secretary of Government of NCT of Delhi.
</p><p id="p_4">       We direct the Chief Secretaries of the State Governments, District
Collectors, Tehsildars, Director General, IG/SP and other police officers
of the area of concerned police station and the entire police machinery to
ensure that not even a single incident takes place of stubble burning
henceforth. If it is found that any stubble burning has been made not only
that person doing it will be hauled up for the violation of the order passed
by this Court but the entire administration, right from the Chief Secretary,
Commissioner, Collector and all other concerned functionaries and
Panchayats. Gram Pradhan/Sarpanch Panchayat are also directed to
ensure that no such stubble burning takes place.
</p><p id="p_5">       Let the State Governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh
and officials also explain that why they should not be asked to pay the
compensation for tortious liability as they have acquiesced and due to
their failure in preventing stubble burning which is in utter violation of
the Public Trust doctrine, why they should not be held liable to
compensate, and also the incumbents who are burning the stubble in spite
of clear restrictions imposed by this Court and statutory prohibition.
</p><p id="p_6">       We also direct the Sarpanch of each and every Panchayat and SHO
of the concerned area to prepare inventory of the incumbents who have
burnt the stubbles in their fields. We also direct the Sarpanch, Gram
Panchayat as well as the concerned police of the area and local
administration including the Collector and all subordinate authorities to
ensure that no further stubble burning takes place. In case, any stubble
burning takes place responsible machinery from top to bottom and
Sarpanch, Gram Panchayat shall be liable for tortuous act and for not
complying with the order passed by this Court and let the Gram
Panchayat also advise forthwith the villagers not to involve in stubble
burning any more and take appropriate action.
</p><p id="p_7">       We also direct the State Governments, Central Government as well
as the Government of NCT of Delhi to take immediate steps to take care
of the emergent situation due to air pollution which has taken place. No
doubt about it that everybody knows the situation, let the steps be taken
forthwith with the help of the experts. We direct the Government of NCT
of Delhi as well as various corporations to work in tandem and to see that
waste and garbage which is contributing to air pollution is tackled at war
level. The efforts should be made right from today without any loss of
time.
</p><p id="p_8">       Let the EPCA consider as it was suggested by Ms. Aprajita Singh,
learned senior counsel and the learned Amicus Curiae that diesel vehicle
should not enter the Delhi. Let the EPCA immediately take the steps in
this regard as may be considered appropriate as it has the power to do the
needful taking care of the emergent situation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>

<p id="p_9">      With respect to demolition and construction activities we direct that
no demolition and construction activities take place in Delhi and NCR
region. In case it is found that such activity is done, the local
administration as well as the municipal authorities including the Zonal
Commissioners, Deputy Zonal Commissioners shall be personally held
responsible for all such activities. They have to act in furtherance of the
Court’s order and to ensure that no such activity takes place.
</p><p id="p_10">      We are informed that use of coal based industries have been
stopped. In case any violation of this is found the concerned person
including Zonal Deputy Commissioner would be liable for violation of
the order of this Court and liable to be punished for contempt of Court.
</p><p id="p_11">      It was also pointed out by Mr. Sanjiv Sen, learned senior counsel,
that during odd/even scheme in Delhi more use of two wheelers and three
wheelers has taken place and they are being plied more causing equal
pollution, as such no useful purpose is being served by stopping the use
of certain vehicles only on the basis of odd and even numbers. He has
also pointed out that it would be appropriate to stop the use of diesel
vehicle, in case it is necessitated as the diesel vehicles cause more
pollution as compared to petrol and CNG vehicles. Let the Government
of NCT of Delhi explain this aspect and file the data in this regard in the
Court on the basis of the previous experience and whether if three
wheelers and taxies are plying more on road during such restriction and
relevant data be placed.
</p><p id="p_12">      During Odd/Even Scheme what is the difference being caused by
stopping use of four wheelers when various other contributory factors are
not taken care of by Government of NCT of Delhi. An affidavit has been
filed by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, in which in paragraph
10 following facts have been mentioned. Air quality, winter inspections
2019-20 status till 31.10.2019 is extracted hereunder:-

<p id="p_37">       We direct that construction, demolition and activities be stopped
forthwith as well as garbage burning. In case, any person is found in
construction and demolition activity and garbage burning in Delhi and
NCR region, he/she shall be penalized. Any person is doing construction
and demolition activity in violation of this order, shall be penalized with
Rs.1 Lac for such activity. For garbage burning he/she shall be penalized
with Rs.5,000/- and besides liable for violation of the order passed by
this Court to be dealt with in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_38">       With respect to open dumping of waste and garbage, we direct the
Government of NCT of Delhi as well as the concerned Municipal
Corporation to chalk out immediate plan and to ensure that waste and
garbage to be removed to safe places forthwith and also to ensure that no
open dumping takes place. We direct Zonal Deputy Commissioner to be
responsible with other officers in this regard. Let road-maps be prepared
so as to provide proper amenities in order to prevent open dumping of
waste and garbage, and be placed before this Court within four weeks.
</p><p id="p_39">       For taking care of the road dust let water sprinklers/dust
suppressors be used on the roads. An IIT expert suggested about the
appropriate water pressure for the sprinklers. At what pressure water
should be sprinkled so as to reduce the pollution and dust so that it does
not add to the pollution. Let the Corporations act on advice of the expert
of the IIT. Such roads where traffic congestion is more, let traffic plan be
also prepared in such a manner so that there is no extra burden on a
particular road so that traffic congestion is taken care of. It is for the
concerned traffic authorities to take immediate steps in this regard.
</p><p id="p_40">       Since we are fixing the liability on the person responsible for
inaction at the village level as well as three States in the NCR regions as
well as Delhi, let the widest publicity by all means of publication i.e.
Television, Media, newspapers, Radio be made. In Gram Panchayats by
beat of drums also and other modes to ensure that villagers are made
aware of their responsibility and liability towards the other humans so
that they do not involve in such acts. Let the Gram Panchayat, police
station, district and taluk levels by the concerned administration take
steps in this regard. Let the State Governments also take the requisite
steps to extinguish the stubbles which are burning and for that let State
Level High Level Committee meet forthwith and take appropriate
decision and implement it. Steps taken be informed to this Court on
06.11.2019 by the concerned Chief Secretaries of the three States and
Government of NCT of Delhi.
</p><p id="p_41">       Let the concerned authorities of EPCA meet forthwith and take a
call in this regard with respect to industrial activities which are causing
pollution how to control it. We also direct all pollution control Boards of

           industries/activities against norms are put to halt forthwith.
</p><p id="p_42">                 It was also submitted by M/s. Sanjiv Sen and Gopal
           Sankaranarayanan, learned senior counsel that in certain States
           generators are also being used which increase pollution mainly due to cut
           off of the electricity supply. Generators in Delhi also add to pollution in
           Delhi as well as in NCR region. Let the State Governments and
           Government of NCT of Delhi ensure that electricity is not cut so that
           generators are not used and let no generators be used till next date of
           hearing except in emergency/healthcare services.

</p>

<p id="p_45">2.     It was noted by this Court that there is a blatant violation of

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article 21</a> of the Constitution i.e., Right to Life by the serious kind of

pollution which is being caused by various factors including stubble

burning.     The stubble burning in the month of October/November

comprises approximately 40% of the pollution, but for the remaining

period, stubble burning is not the cause of pollution in Delhi and NCR

region. It was noted by this Court that various other factors which

were responsible for causing pollution are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     1. Construction and demolition activities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     2. Open dumping of waste/ garbage.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     3. Unpaved roads/ pits.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     4. Road dust.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     5. Garbage burning.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     6. Traffic congestion.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                   9</span>




<p id="p_46">3.   Various hot­spots in Delhi and NCR regions were identified as

noted in the report. This Court has noted the problem of farmers in

stubble burning as short gap between two crops due to which

agriculturists indulge in stubble burning. We have seen the satellite

images of Punjab where stubble burning was more as compared to

Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh from the records of the previous

years.
</p>

<p id="p_47">4.   We have observed that the entire machinery involved in the

administration has to be held responsible for such a tortious act.
</p>
<p id="p_48">Particularly, in view of the fact that this problem is not new and is

continuing since long, and the authorities have not been able to find a

solution, every year, hue and cry is raised. The same reflects badly on

the administration, its lethargy is writ large by not taking appropriate

action timely and preparing a scheme for its prevention.
</p>

<p id="p_49">5.   In the circumstances, we have issued directions to the Chief

Secretaries of the States of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, and NCT of

Delhi.   This Court has also issued directions to all the authorities

including panchayats and concerned administrative authorities to

ensure that stubble burning does not take place.       Other directions

were also issued to be taken care of by the Environmental Pollution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                          10</span>

(Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA). Considering the precarious

situation, we also restrained demolition and construction activities for

the time being and directed the Municipal Authorities, Zonal

Commissioners and Deputy Zonal Commissioners to take care of the

situation.
</p>

<p id="p_50">6.   Some learned counsels have pointed out the fallacy of the odd­

even scheme also as this was applied to the cars which are

contributing to three percent of the pollution and also 28% caused by

the vehicular pollution and then approximately 50% cars operate in

Delhi even on those days having odd or even numbers. Thus, it was

pointed out that it was not the solution. We have called for certain

data in this regard also.
</p>

<p id="p_51">7.   The matter was taken on 6.11.2019 by this Court.                             We have

heard the Chief Secretaries of various States, including the Attorney

General and passed the following order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">              “Heard Sh. K. K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India,
         Sh. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India, Mr. A.N.S.
         Nadkarni, learned Additional Solicitor General, Mr. P.S. Narasimha,
         learned senior counsel.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">              We have also heard the Chief Secretaries to the States of Punjab,
         Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Govt. Of NCT of Delhi in extensive
         detail, who have appeared today pursuant to our order dated
         04.11.2019. We have also heard Mr. Charanpal Singh Bagri, learned
         counsel appearing for the farmers. We have heard Mr. Bhure Lal as
         well.</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">              We find that in advance, no serious groundwork was made by the
         concerned States where the stubble burning is taking place. This Court
         passed an order on 29.01.2018. The comments and recommendations
         made by EPCA on the report of the Sub-Committee of the High Level
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   11</span>

Task Force on prevention of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and
Western Uttar Pradesh was considered by this court. This Court
directed the High Level Task Force to adhere to the timelines decided
upon by itself and to ensure full compliance by all concerned. This
Court also directed the Union of India to give publicity to the Report
of the High Level Task Force so that the people are aware of the action
been taken. Publicity can be given through print and electronic media
as well. Thus, in the pious hope that stubble burning and its impact on
the environment shall be taken care of, this Court disposed of the
application.
</p><p id="p_53">     The Report of the Sub-Committee of the High Level Task Force
on stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh has
been placed on record, in which a suggestion was made to offer Rs.
100/- per quintal as incentive and disincentive both.
</p><p id="p_54">     The Chief Secretary to the States of Punjab has placed on record
the action plan for control of burning of the crop in the State of Punjab
dated 01.10.2019. However, the same does not contain the proposal to
pay Rs. 100/-. The steps taken by the State of Punjab, pursuant to the
order passed by this Court on 04.11.2019 have been placed on record
by the Chief Secretary, which we take on record, in which a
suggestion has been made to offer financial support in the form of
operational cost of crop residue management equipment to play a
positive role to achieve zero stubble burning. It has been proposed that
the amount of Rs. 100/- per quintal would come to Rs. 2000-2500/-
per acre. It was also stated that there is a crop of approximately 24
quintals per acre.
</p><p id="p_55">     Be that as it may, we direct, in the facts and circumstances of the
case, to take care of the stubble, which has not been burnt by the small
and marginal farmers in the States of Punjab, Haryana, and Western
Uttar Pradesh and to provide them financial support, quantified
amount at Rs. 100/- per quintal of Non-Basmati Paddy, shall be given
to those farmers within seven days from today by the State
Governments to those who have not burnt the stubble.
</p><p id="p_56">     The Central Government has provided the Scheme of Promotion
of Agricultural Mechanization in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar
Pradesh and NCT of Delhi for the period of 2018-19 and 2019-20 with
a total outlay of Rs.1151.80 Crores for in-situ Crop Residue
Management such as Super Straw Management System for Combine
Harvesters, Happy Seeders, Hydraulically Reversible MB Plough,
Paddy Straw Chopper, Mulcher, Rotary Slasher, Zero Till Seed Drill
and Rotavators are promoted with 50% subsidy to the individual
farmers and 80% subsidy for establishment of Custom Hiring Centres
of these machines. The Central Government has disbursed its 100%
share of funds amounting to Rs. 269.38 Crores, Rs. 137.84 crores, Rs.
148.60 Crores and Rs. 28.51 Crores to the States of Punjab, Haryana,
Uttar Pradesh and Central Agencies respectively.
</p><p id="p_57">     It appears from the statements made by the Chief Secretary to the
State of Punjab and Mr. Charanpal Singh Bagri, learned counsel
appearing for the farmers that most of the farmers burning stubble are
of the category of small and marginal farmers in the State of Punjab
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   12</span>

and the Cooperative Societies give the machines on hire basis, which
cannot be afforded by the small and marginal farmers. We have been
assured by the Chief Secretaries to the State of Punjab, Haryana, Utter
Pradesh that they will be dedicating certain machines for the use of
small and marginal farmers. Even operational expenses shall be borne
by the State Governments for the time being till the
methodology/policy is devised to provide proper facilities of machines
dedicated to small and marginal farmers in each of the States. Let
roadmap be prepared for that purpose as it is this class of farmers who
requires a support as it is by way of compulsion and short duration of
time between two crops and they cannot afford the machines which
are valuable, having high cost and there is so much small gap between
two crops that they are forced to burn stubble in the circumstances.
</p><p id="p_58">     As projected by the Chief Secretary that the Government is not
able to provide financial support to these small and marginal farmers,
cannot be accepted. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy of
this country. Its interest cannot be overlooked and self-created
bankruptcy cannot rescue it when the State has the obligation towards
the agriculture. The Central Government is providing the money. The
State Government has contributed to it. They cannot ignore the
interest of the small and marginal farmers. It is the bounden duty of
the Central as well as the State Government to ensure the interest of
these class of farmers is catered and they have the facilities of farming
and harvesting by modern machines. It should not be prerogative of
the chosen few, those who have the money, means and power to afford
these luxuries. It is absolutely necessary that poor farmers are equally
provided with the modern facilities which are necessary to prevent
such incidents of stubble burning and the State Governments’
selfcreated bankruptcy or paucity of funds cannot be a guise, not to
discharge its obligation, as laid by this Court in “Municipal Council,
Ratlam Vs. Vardhichand &amp; Ors.”, reported in AIR 1980 SC 1622. We
have issued the directions to the various States in accordance with the
spirit of the aforesaid decisions.
</p><p id="p_59">     The Central Government has also its role to play in the matter. In
spite of releasing the funds, constituting High Level Committee,
submitting report to the Court on the basis of which this Court has
passed the order on 29.01.2018, nothing happened to prevent the
stubble burning and it has increased this year. Stubble burning took
place last year also. That was enough to put on guard the machinery of
various Governments, but they did not act in the real earnest. That is
why, the incident of stubble burning for want of proper policy has
taken place in utter disregard to Court’s order. Even the suggestions
which were made in the Report, which had been considered by this
Court in January, 2018 that Rs. 100/- to be provided as incentive,
could not be finalised is nothing but the pathetic state of affairs in
which we are put as on today. The total apathy is writ large.
</p><p id="p_60">     The authorities, concerned Committees, the State Governments
ought to have acted to discharge their duties. Directive Principles of
the State Policy have been left out of the purview of the Courts for the
reason that the State Governments should have full freedom to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   13</span>

implement those in the manner it so desires and the Courts may not
become the hurdle in implementing the schemes when they have
found expression in various schemes. The schemes cannot be
permitted to remain dead letter as futility of such schemes is injurious
to the very rule of law and can create anarchy. When schemes have
been framed, they are to be implemented and we fully agree with the
submission raised by the Attorney General for India that for this
pathetic state of affairs, officers cannot escape from their
responsibility and liability. They have to be held liable for their
inaction and for the situation which is being created every year. When
we come to the responsibility of the officers, obviously, each and
every incumbent manning the State Government also becomes
responsible to take steps in the positive direction. To punish farmers is
not an ultimate solution. To provide them the basic facilities, amenities
and modern equipment is the call of the day, which has not taken place
and the benefits which are being given to the cooperative societies are
being usurped mostly by the big farmers. Small and marginal farmers
are still not able to reap the fruits of these schemes/machines. We are
assured by the Chief Secretaries that they will be looking into this
aspect and definitely taking action for allocating these machines to
small and marginal farmers. Let them consider at present even without
charging anything from them. We direct the State Governments to
dedicate these machines, modern equipment for the service of small
and marginal farmers for the time being even if necessary free of cost.
Let concrete steps be taken and action taken report be submitted to
this Court within a period of one month from today by the concerned
State Governments.
</p><p id="p_61">   We have been informed by the Chief Secretary of the State of
Punjab that they have ordered certain machines to be purchased in the
month of July, August and September, 2019. They are receiving the
requisite machines everyday. We expected and it was required that
steps should have been taken timely for procuring these machines and
to make them available before the harvesting season came for the
crop. Now we expect the State Governments to procure the machines
as early as possible and submit a report in this regard within four
weeks from today.
</p><p id="p_62">   It was suggested by the Attorney General that it would be
appropriate to direct the concerned Ministries of the Central
Government as well as the State Governments involved in the matter
to prepare a comprehensive plan to take care of the situation. It is a
welcome suggestion and we accept it. We direct the Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Environment and Forests and the States of
Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and the Government of NCT of
Delhi to prepare a comprehensive scheme to take care of
environmental issues and all such ancillary issues taking care of
providing small and marginal farmers with modern equipment and let
such a scheme be prepared not only for these States but for various
other States where such facilities are lacking and are required to be
provided. For that, modalities may be worked out as per the scheme to
be framed by the Central Government in collaboration/ consultation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                  14</span>

with the various State Governments. Let it be done within three
months from today and the report of the steps to be taken be submitted
to this Court.
</p><p id="p_63">     For the time being, we direct the States of Punjab, Haryana and
Uttar Pradesh to disburse the money and they should not wait for or
write letters to the Central Government to give certain funds for this
purpose. Let it be released forthwith and any noncompliance of the
same would be viewed seriously, is made clear to the concerned Chief
Secretaries, who are present in this Court.
</p><p id="p_64">     We will take a final call on the aspect of finance also when we
consider the detailed report to be submitted by the State Government
and after hearing the other stake holders, including the Central
Government.
</p><p id="p_65">     It has been pointed out by the learned counsel appearing for the
farmers that certain petitions are pending. As prayed jointly, CWP No.
23799 of 2017 titled as “Bhartikisan Union Vs. Union of India and
Others” and CWP No. 15582 of 2018 titled as “Charanpal Singh Bagri
Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.” Filed by the farmers in the High Court of
Punjab and Haryana, they are transferred to this Court for being heard
along with this matter.
</p><p id="p_66">     We have heard the Chief Secretary of Delhi also and have pointed
out the tables extracted in the order dated 04.11.2019 passed by this
Court there are various factors which are contributing to the pollution
in Delhi such as construction and demolition, open dumping of waste,
garbage, unpaved roads/pit, road dust, garbage burning and traffic
congestion. It is apparent from the table extracted in the order dated
4.11.2019 that contribution to large extent is made by the aforesaid
factors and stubble burning in the other States has contributed to 40%
to 44% only. It is the shocking state of affairs that in the National
Capital of Delhi there are unpaved roads/pits. We have not been able
to take care of the road dust in spite of spending huge amount every
year, open dumping and waste, garbage burning is still taking place.
Basically, the Corporation and the Government of NCT of Delhi has
failed to prepare a proper scheme in this regard. When the
garbage/waste can be managed in Pune and Indore very effectively,
why we cannot have a waste management scheme in Delhi,
particularly when it is the capital city and face of India. This is
reflective of a total apathy of the officers and lack of planning and
nonaccountability for the money spent, which is responsible for the
situation in which we are put today. It is only the Monitoring
Committee which is doing its job effectively, otherwise position would
have been much worse. We expect all the authorities to take care of
the situation, we request the Monitoring Committee also to look into
these aspects and compliance is made. We authorize them to look into
these aspects, whether orders of this Court in this regard are being
appropriately carried out or not and submit a report to this Court.
   It has been assured by the Chief Secretary of the NCT of Delhi that
most of the aspects will be taken care of within seven days. They have
made a consultation with the IIT Expert on the pressure with which
water to be sprinkled on the roads and chemicals to be used so as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                           15</span>

         settle the dust. We hope and trust that the statement made by the Chief
         Secretary is carried out in true letter and spirit and let a compliance
         report in this regard be filed in this Court, taking the steps not only
         with respect to these works but various hot spots which have been
         pointed out with respect to Delhi by the Government of NCT of Delhi,
         with respect to other places such as Faridabad, Gurugram etc. we
         direct the concerned Chief Secretary to the States to take care of those
         hot spots and to submit a compliance report of the needful. With
         respect to unpaved roads/pits, there should ideally be no pits/potholes
         as they are cause of various accidents and accidental deaths. There are
         uncovered chambers also which are left. Unpaved roads have also
         contributed to the pollution and dust. Let a concrete plan in this
         regard, notwithstanding colony is legal and has been handed over or
         not, be prepared and submitted to this Court by the Government of
         NCT of Delhi in collaboration with and consultation of the various
         corporations and time frame for that be also stated. In how much time
         they are going to improve the road conditions. Pits/potholes be taken
         care of positively within three weeks from today.
</p>

<p id="p_67">8.   This Court vide order dated 29.1.2018 has directed the

constitution of a High Level Task Force to adhere to the timeline

decided and compliance by all concerned.                    This Court has earlier

directed the Union of India to publish the report of the High Level Task

Force so that people are being aware of the action being taken.
</p>
<p id="p_68">Publicity was to be given in print and electronic media as well. Acting

upon the public trust doctrine imposed upon the authorities, this

Court has disposed of the application. A report of the Sub­Committee

of the High Level Task Force was submitted before this Court in which

suggestion was made to give Rs.100/­ per quintal of incentive and

disincentive both.
</p>

<p id="p_69">9.   Pursuant to the order passed by this Court on 4.11.2019, the

Chief Secretary of Punjab placed on record a suggestion to offer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                   16</span>

financial support in the form of operational cost of Crop Residuary

Management Equipment to play a positive role to achieve zero stubble

burning.   It was proposed that an amount of Rs.100/­ per quintal

would come to Rs.2000­2500/­ per acre as yield is approximately 24

quintal per acre.    Considering the aforesaid, we have directed that

financial support of Rs.100/­ per quintal for Non­Basmati Paddy shall

be given to those farmers who have not burnt the stubble as an

incentive. For in­situ crop residue, Central Government has provided

a scheme of promotion of agricultural mechanization in the States of

Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi.              For the

management of straw 50% subsidy has been provided to the individual

farmers and 80% for the establishment of Custom Hiring Centres for

procuring machines as mentioned in the order.
</p>

<p id="p_70">10.   It was pointed out that marginal farmers and poor farmers burn

the stubble as they do not have means either to purchase or to hire the

machines such as Super Straw Management System for Combine

Harvesters, Happy Seeders, Hydraulically Reversible MB Plough, Paddy

Straw Chopper, Mulcher, Rotary Slasher, Zero Till Seed Drill and

Rotavators, etc.    The interest of these classes of farmers has to be

looked into by the concerned State Government so that they are able to

do harvesting by the modern machines and facilities. This Court has

noted that adequate steps have not been taken by the concerned State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                  17</span>

Governments and the Committees despite the order passed by this

Court. They ought to have discharged their duties.    This Court also

directed the State Government to dedicate certain machines with

modern equipment for the service of small and marginal farmers. A

comprehensive plan was ordered to be prepared to take care of the

situation.   We have directed the Central Government to work in

collaboration and consultation with various State Governments to do

the needful within three months and to submit a report in this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_71">11.   This Court also observed as to why there is no proper system of

disposal of garbage and waste management and the proper scheme

has not been prepared in this regard by NCT of Delhi. When it can be

managed in cities like Pune and Indore effectively, it is disheartening

to note that Chief Secretary has ultimately stated that they have an

arrangement for only 55% of the garbage and waste and not for the

remaining 45% per year. In these circumstances, we have directed the

Monitoring Committee to look after these aspects and to submit a

report with respect to NCT of Delhi.       We have also directed that

unpaved roads, potholes should also be taken care of. Potholes are the

cause of various accidents and accidental deaths. We have directed

that potholes be taken care of within three weeks and for unpaved

<p id="p_72">12.   This Court thereafter took up the matter on 13.11.2019 and

passed the following order :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         “RE : SMOG IN DELHI

                  We have asked the learned counsel appearing for the Union of
         India as well as the Government of NCT of Delhi to convene a
         meeting by tomorrow for working out the feasibility of installation of
         smog towers which take care of the smog within certain range of
         kilometers, to say 3 to 10 kms and place their concrete proposal before
         us as it is an urgent matter from the point of view of Delhi.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                  We direct the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to
         produce the record of each and every day from 02.11.2019, including
         that of 11th and 12th November, 2019, which were not odd/even days,
         till 14.11.2019. The record of the month of October 2019 shall also be
         produced before this Court. The day-to-day record of the last year,

</blockquote><p id="p_73">13.   This Court directed the Union Government and Government of

NCT of Delhi to convene a meeting to consider the feasibility of

installation of Smog Towers.

<p id="p_74">14.   On 15.11.2019 following orders was passed by this Court:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">                “A joint affidavit on behalf of Ministry of Environment, Forest
         and Climate Change and Central Pollution Control Board has been
         given in Court today along with some letters one of which was sent to
         Department of Science and Technology dated 31.10.2019 (Annexure
         R/3) regarding establishment of towers to remove pollution but a final
         decision is required to be taken on the said proposal. The above
         affidavit is taken on record.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                As prayed, let a decision in the matter be taken within seven
         days from today.</blockquote>
<p id="p_75">                With respect to Project Vayu, let the concerned stakeholders
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                   19</span>

file their response as to how much time will be taken to note the
results of the trial and the minimum period required for that. The
requisite affidavit be filed within seven days.
</p><p id="p_76">        We have heard Member Secretary, Central Pollution Control
Board (CPCB) and other senior counsels/counsels appearing for the
parties. The Member Secretary, CPCB has pointed out that pollution
caused due to stubble burning has been reduced to approximately 5%,
however, residue remains of the previous stubble burning that is also
adding to the pollution.
</p><p id="p_77">It was also pointed out that vehicular pollution adds to 28% of the
total pollution of Delhi. Out of that 8% is created by trucks, 1% by
tractors, 3% by buses, 3% by cars, 7% by two-wheelers, 5% by three-
wheelers, 1% by LCVs. He has pointed out that odd-even scheme is
applied to the cars only, which contribute only 3% out of 28% of the
total pollution caused by the vehicular traffic in Delhi. Mr. Mukul
Rohatgi, learned senior counsel has also pointed out that applying
odd-even scheme with respect to cars cannot be said to be a
wholesome solution. However, in the absence of the effective public
transport, two-wheelers and three-wheelers plying has not been
stopped.
</p><p id="p_78">        Another factor which is important for causing environmental
pollution in Delhi and NCR region is said to be construction activities.
Agricultural burning is adding to 4%, industries 30% and the
residential sector in the form of Bio Mass, Kerosene and LPG is
adding to 10% in total.
</p><p id="p_79">        It was also pointed out that there are complaints that some
vehicles are plying illegally using kerosene in Delhi/NCR and Delhi
Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has power and authority to
check such use in Delhi. The DPCC can do the needful in the matter.
We direct DPCC to ensure the random checking is done of three-
wheelers as well as vehicles which are being used in Delhi by
corporations as well as other such bodies etc. as to what kind of fuel is
being used. In NCR region concerned pollution control bodies to do
the checking. In case it is found that Kerosene is used not only the
concerned driver/owner shall be responsible but the officers of the
Department shall also be held responsible for using the kerosene oil.
Let random checking be done of as many vehicles as possible and a
report be submitted to this Court within seven days, of the checking
done in this regard.
</p><p id="p_80">        It was also pointed out by the Member Secretary, CPCB that
there are 13 hot spots which have been identified in Delhi and there
were several other spots in NCR which were also pointed out in the
order dated 06.11.2019. Some steps have been taken to take care of
those hot spots but lot of steps remain to be done. Let the effective
steps be taken so as to remove the pollutants from the hot spots as
ordered by this Court. Hot spots be cleared of the pollutants within a
week, which is a reasonable period as stated by the Member Secretary,
CPCB and compliance affidavit be filed.
</p><p id="p_81">        We have asked Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel
appearing on behalf of the NCT of Delhi, to find out what effective
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                            20</span>

         steps can be taken to curb the pollution in Delhi and NCR Region,
         considering the onset of winter and fog conditions which are going to
         cause serious problem.
</p><p id="p_82">                 We have seen that in spite of imposition of odd-even scheme
         the pollution is increasing in the city of Delhi and the NCR region and
         pollution has reached to very severe level. Drastic steps are required to
         be taken by all concerned working in tandem and to cooperate with
         each other as it is not an adversarial litigation. Let the concerned
         authorities discharge their duties in view of Doctrine of Public Trust
         and rise to the occasion to take care of the pollution which is being
         caused. Let the effective steps be suggested to this Court, as assured,
         on 25.11.2019.
</p><p id="p_83">         It was also pointed out that in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh
         stubble burning is still taking place. Satellite images have been placed
         on record by Ms. Aprajita Singh, learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. A.N.S.
         Nadkarni, learned Additional Solicitor General of India and Mr.
         Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel. In the circumstances, in order
         to ensure that necessary steps are taken and no stubble burning takes
         place, the presence of the Chief Secretary of the State of Punjab,
         Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi is required as lot is
         required to be done and the pollution level is worsening in Delhi and
         NCR region, in spite of orders. We direct the Chief Secretary of the
         above mentioned States/NCT of Delhi to file their respective affidavits
         of the steps taken and to remain present in this Court on 25.11.2019.
</p><p id="p_84">                 We are not dilating further on the odd-even scheme issue as it
         was stated by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel, that as to
         odd-even scheme today is the last day. Be that as it may, let further
         data has to be placed by CPCB as well as the Government of NCT of
         Delhi in this regard.
</p><p id="p_85">                 The Delhi Development Authority (DDA), PWD/CPWD and
         all the Corporations of Delhi cooperate and extend full support to the
         Monitoring Committee, any non-compliance to be viewed seriously by
         this Court.
</p><p id="p_86">                 List on 25.11.2019.“


</p><p id="p_87">15.   It was pointed out by Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel

appearing on behalf of Government of NCT of Delhi that by applying

odd­even scheme with respect to cars alone cannot be said to be a

wholesome solution. In the absence of effective public transport, two­

wheelers and three­wheelers plying have not been stopped.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                    21</span>

<p id="p_88">16.   As a matter of fact, in our opinion, it is absolutely necessary to

have an effective public transport system in order to ensure that plying

of private vehicles is minimized.    Until and unless the Government

fulfills its obligation to provide an effective public transport system,

private vehicles are bound to be plied and adding to the problem.
</p>

<p id="p_89">17.   It was pointed out that 28% of the total pollution is caused by

vehicular traffic. Though pollution by stubble burning was reduced to

5%, one of the major factors for pollution is construction and

demolition activities.   Agriculture burning is adding to 4%, and

industries are causing 30%, residential sector in the form of Bio Mass,

Kerosene and LPG are adding to 10% in total.
</p>

<p id="p_90">18.   This Court also took note of the submission that certain vehicles

were found plying on Kerosene.      This Court has issued appropriate

directions in this regard also.   Thirteen hot­spots were identified in

Delhi and various other spots in NCR. We have issued directions in

this regard also. However, at present status report is required to be

filed by Delhi and NCR region with respect to these hot­spots, which

have been identified and noted in the orders mentioned above.
</p>

<p id="p_91">19.   It was also pointed out to this Court that in winter fog conditions

are going to cause further deterioration of the Air Quality Index (AQI).
</p>
<p id="p_92">This Court thereafter directed the matter to be listed on 25.11.2019.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                            22</span>

<p id="p_93">Following order was passed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        "1. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and the Chief Secretaries
        to the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Govt. of NCT of
        Delhi at length. We find from the Affidavit placed by Mr. A. N. S.
        Nadkarni, learned ASG, that the fire count as on 07.11.2019 has
        increased thereafter in the States of Punjab and Haryana and Uttar
        Pradesh on some of the days. The situation is alarming and indicates
        that the order has not been complied with and for that not only the
        State machinery is responsible, but the farmers are also responsible.
        Considering the aforesaid aspects and also the Air Quality Index, it
        has become necessary to take care of the situation, otherwise such
        incidents are not going to stop in future.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">        2. We are informed by the Chief Secretary to the Govt. of NCT of
        Delhi also that they have arrangements to clean annually the garbage
        and waste to the extent of 55% only and the remaining 45% cannot be
        cleaned in spite of best efforts considering the annual capacity to clean
        the garbage/waste. We have suo moto taken note of the water pollution
        in Delhi and other places as it appears that there are reports that
        impure water is being supplied to the people and there are reports to
        the contrary that samples have been manipulated. We cannot leave the
        matter at that. As a matter of fact, in such a matter of air and water
        pollution, it is the Constitutional duty enjoined upon all the
        stakeholders to do the needful for providing better air and potable
        water. It was also stated by the Chief Secretary to the Govt. of Delhi
        that there are certain problems of governance. The problem of
        governance, if any, cannot come in the way to deal with such matters.
        It is expected from the Government machineries not to enter into the
        rival claims, but to sit down together, work it out how to improve the
        air quality and whether potable water is being supplied or not, and
        how to improve the water management.</blockquote>

<p id="p_94">        3. We are also apprised by the Chief Secretary to the State of Uttar
        Pradesh that they are mainly focusing on eight districts, as with regard
        to those districts this Court has passed the order. He has also reported
        to us that stubble burning incidents, which have been increased, are in
        the Eastern region. It may not affect Delhi and NCR Region. As a
        matter of fact, such approach is not understandable that the State has
        to take care of only those areas for which this Court has issued the
        directions. We take judicial notice of the fact that there are six other
        cities in the country which are reportedly more polluted in air quality
        index than Delhi, out of which three are stated to be in Uttar Pradesh
        only. Hence, we propose to issue notice to all the States to report to us
        what is the Air Quality Index in the various towns. How they are
        discharging their obligations with respect to lifting of the garbage,
        waste etc. and by and large, we can take judicial notice of the fact that
        similar is the situation in virtually several cities in various States. The
        Corporations are not having even the basic arrangements for lifting the
        garbage, which is being generated everyday. It appears to be a case of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                   23</span>

lost priorities. Be that as it may, there are certain cities which are
managing the garbage effectively and efficiently in India, which
indicates that it can be done in effective way but there is lack of
proper planning in that regard.
</p>
<p id="p_95">4. We see Yamuna river virtually turned into a sullage. We take
judicial notice of this situation. Similar is the position with Ganges. As
it proceeds, industrial effluents are being poured in rivers. Sewage is
also being directly put in rivers contributing to the river water
pollution. We direct the Pollution Control Boards of the various States
as well as the Central Pollution Control Board and various
Governments to place before us the data and material with respect to
various rivers in the concerned States, and what steps they are taking
to curb the pollution in such rivers and to management as to industrial
effluents, sewage, garbage, waste and air pollution, including the
water management. We club the ending case of water management
with this matter.
</p>
<p id="p_96">5. It was stated by the Chief Secretary to the State of Punjab that there
are few machines by which stubble can be collected called the bailors
but those machines are concentrated in few districts only. He has
assured us of the fact that such bailors to be provided in different
districts at block levels so that small farmers can use these machines
for removal of the stubble. We direct the States of Haryana and Uttar
Pradesh also to do the needful in this regard. We also issue notice to
various other States as stubble burning is taking place in various other
States also to submit a report as to the stubble burning in their States
and what steps they are taking and what they propose to do in this
regard.
</p>
<p id="p_97">6. With respect to Smog Towers, let a concrete decision be taken
within 10 days from today what kind of towers are required which
may operate successfully and how many such towers are required so
as to take care of the pollution which is being caused in Delhi and
NCR region. The decision be taken not only by the Government of
Delhi, but also by the States of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh,
where the position is reported to have deteriorated.
</p>
<p id="p_98">7. We are informed that Anti Smog Guns were experimented by the
Government of NCT of Delhi which is used as a cannon that sprays
automized water 50 metres into the air to bring down suspended
pollutants. The device is connected to a water tank and it can be taken
to different parts of the city on a vehicle. We require the Government
of NCT of Delhi to report to us what steps they have taken in this
regard to use and acquire these Anti Smog Guns and the outcome of
the experiment which was performed. Let Central Pollution Control
Board (CPCB) also ascertain and submit a report regarding the effect
created by the use of such guns within 10 days.
</p>
<p id="p_99">8. There are other technologies which are being used to control the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                   24</span>

pollution. Oxy Furnaces are being developed to reduce the Ozone
Emissions from industries. Technology of i) Wireless Sensors; ii)
Nanotechnology; iii) Laser methods; (iv) Spectroscopic monitoring
techniques and (v) Chemical methods are also used so as to control the
pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_100">9. We require an IIT expert to be associated by the CPCB and High
Level Committee to be formed by the Central Government including
that of the stakeholders of the Government of NCT of Delhi to work
out on the aforesaid various technologies and how they can be utilised
and their feasibility etc. Let the Committee be constituted within three
days from today and report be filed within three weeks in this regard
with respect to above-mentioned technologies.
</p>
<p id="p_101">10. As we have noted that from last several years, the position of air
pollution is worsening in spite of various orders passed by this Court.
The reports and the scientific data indicating that large section of
people are suffering from the dreaded diseases due to such air
pollution such as Cancer, Asthma and various other diseases. Life span
is adversely affected. Time has come that the various States recognise
right to life is important right. Human life and health have been put in
danger. In such scenario, why they should not be required to pay
compensation to such persons who are being affected by inadequate
arrangement to check the air pollution, non-lifting of garbage, waste
which add ultimately to the pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_102">11. In this case we find that Delhi is lacking the capacity to the extent
of 45% to even clean the garbage/waste which is being generated.
Similar is the situation in various other places. We take note of the
situation which is alarming and time has come to remind the State
machineries as to their duties as all of us are meant to serve the people
of this great country. Our Constitution has envisaged certain Directive
Principles as they are more important rights at the discretion of the
Government. The Courts are not to interfere in that, but dereliction
cannot be to the extent that the very right to life is endangered by the
inaction.
</p>
<p id="p_103">12. We find that the State has to take care of the health and strength of
workers, men and women. Children are given opportunities and
facilities to develop in a healthy manner. The State is duty bound
under <a href="/doc/1975922/" id="a_3">Article 41</a> also to take care of old age, sickness and disablement
etc. The State is also under obligation under <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_4">Article 47</a> to raise the
level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve the public
health. Under <a href="/doc/1452355/" id="a_5">Article 48</a>, the State is duty bound to endeavour to
organise agriculture and animal husbandry with modern and scientific
lines. <a href="/doc/871328/" id="a_6">Article 48A</a> deals with protection and safeguarding of forests
and wild life. <a href="/doc/1644544/" id="a_7">Article 51A(g)</a> confers duty on individuals to protect and
improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and
wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures. <a href="/doc/560422/" id="a_8">Article 51A(h)</a>
requires to develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                   25</span>

inquiry and reform.
</p>
<p id="p_104">13. Not only the basic Fundamental Rights are being ignored with
respect to air and water, problem of governance are being projected,
which cannot come into the way of the basic Fundamental Rights
which a human enjoys, much less to talk of the Fundamental Duties
and Directive Principles contained in the State policy which have
already found statutory expression in the form of Municipal laws,
Prevention of Air Pollution and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a>s and various schemes
framed by the Central Government and State Governments, but we see
neither the air quality has improved nor the water quality in several
States, not to talk of Delhi only. We have called for the report from
Delhi Government where the reports indicate that the contaminated
water is being supplied and also from Bureau of Indian Standards to
submit report in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_105">14. In the aforesaid situation, we have to direct the various State
Governments to submit a report not only as to the air quality but also
as to the quality of water which is being supplied, and water
management system.
</p>
<p id="p_106">15. At the same time, as we find that in spite of various orders passed
by this Court, we are not able to improve the situation of air quality
which we can see at least in Delhi and NCR with certainty. Time has
come to require the State Governments to explain why they should not
be asked to compensate the persons who are being affected by bad air
quality. Obviously, the State is run by the administration, why liability
should not be imposed for such a tort on the concerned machinery also
of the various States which are failing to discharge their basic duties.
This Court in Municipal Council, Ratlam Vs. Vardhichand &amp; Ors.,
reported in (1980) 4 SCC 162 has held they have to take proper and
positive action in this direction. It is their bounden duty to provide
civic amenities, and also to see that self-created bankruptcy does not
come in the discharge of the statutory obligation which are necessary
for existence of human life. We have seen during the course of the
arguments that one State is passing the burden upon the Centre and
then it is stated on behalf of the Central Government that they have
framed scheme and it for the State Governments to implement it. We
expect not only the ‘policy making’ but also its ‘implementation’. Let
the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and the Government of
NCT of Delhi respond, due to the air pollution, why the concerned
Government and its concerned machinery, from top to bottom, should
not be asked to compensate the citizens of Delhi and adjoining areas
for various diseases which are being caused and sufferings and
troubles which are being faced and the report indicates the life span is
being shortened. Let show cause notice be issued to the various State
Governments, and to the Chief Secretaries, to submit reply within six
weeks. Let the matter be listed for consideration on 17.01.2020. The
Chief Secretaries to the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and
Government of NCT of Delhi be personally present on that date.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                           26</span>


<p id="p_107">         16. Besides that, we also issue notice to the learned counsel appearing
         on behalf of the farmers as to show cause why the orders of this Court
         have been violated and why the farmers should not be asked to pay the
         compensation which may be determined by this Court and why the
         burden should not be fastened upon them also.
</p>
<p id="p_108">         17. Let the decision be taken with respect to other technologies
         mentioned in Paragraph No. 8 above as also the decision to be take on
         the smog guns and smoke towers within 10 days from today. List the
         case for consideration of above aspects on 09.12.2019. "
</p>

<p id="p_109">20.   This Court was again apprised of that stubble burning had

increased after 7.11.2019 in the State of Punjab and Haryana and

Uttar Pradesh on some of the days.
</p>

<p id="p_110">21.   Regarding water pollution in Delhi and other places, considering

the reports that impure water was being supplied to the people, which

was not potable, we have directed the concerned authorities to sit

together for improving the quality of the water and methods to improve

water management.
</p>
<p id="p_111">22.   It was pointed out that apart from Delhi, there were six more

polluted cities in terms of AQI than Delhi. We have issued notice to all

the States to improve the quality of Air and what steps the corporation

and other municipal bodies were having for the effective disposal of

garbage. As to the pollution of rivers, this Court has directed to place

the data as to what steps are being taken by various State

Governments to curb the pollution in the rivers as more than 300

rivers are reported to be polluted by way of industrial effluent, sewage,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                   27</span>

etc.
</p>

<p id="p_112">23.    The Chief Secretary of State of Punjab also pointed out that

stubble can be collected by the machines called balors.       They were

concentrated only in a few districts. We were assured that they would

be distributed in different districts and block­level where small farmers

can use these machines for removal of the stubble.
</p>

               construction activities in as much as no construction should be
               permitted during night time (6.00 pm to 6.00 am). The ban
               imposed could be partially lifted by permitting activities during
               day time (6.00 am to 6.00 pm), subject to the criteria stipulated
               in GRAP, wherein strict enforcement of rules for dust control in

             conical cannon that sprays atomized water with thrust up-to 70 meters
             with 360 degrees of rotation of the cannon. The cannon/ gun was also
             equipped to spray atomised water from horizontal range (0 degree)
             upto 60 degrees. The device was connected to a water tanker and
             mounted on a truck trolley to provide mobility. In order to achieve
             objectivity during the experiment, the ambient air quality parameters
             around the area of experiment before, during the experiment at
             different points of time and after the experiment were recorded. The
             following were observed during the experiment:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">        i.   The ambient air quality (PM 2.5) recorded was 20% to 30% less than
             the pre &amp; post experiment hours. The PM 10 also came down by the
             same margin of 20% to 30% during the duration of experiment and the
             effect continued till one hour after the spraying was stopped.

<blockquote id="blockquote_48">       ii.   During the experiment, the atomized water droplets travelled upto 70
             meters approximately and there was no substantial wetting of the
             ground on which it can be concluded that there is optimization of use
             of water and there was very high probability of contact between the
             atomized water droplets and the particulate matter and resultant
             cleansing effect.

Mundaka and Tikri, EPCA first worked with the Delhi Pollution Control

Committee (DPCC) to issue necessary direction for closure, but

directions were not sufficient and the problem of disposal of waste

continues.

and the Delhi MSW Solutions Limited for sending the waste for

incineration. As a result of which 80,000 tonnes of plastic and other

</p><p id="p_183">56.   In view of the report No.106 of EPCA, following aspects have to be

looked into:
</p>
<p id="p_184">(A)    There has to be an identification of dumped waste of plastic,

       industrial or other waste. The waste should not be burnt and

       removed for processing/incineration.

      bodies of NCT of Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh

      have to take action and impose penalty on the offenders

      repeating the offenses and take action against the developers

      and    developers       have     to    be   blacklisted       for   flouting     the

      Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules and

      guidelines framed thereunder.

      Rajasthan,       Haryana       and     Uttar    Pradesh       have     to     ensure

      compliance of the road construction norms.
