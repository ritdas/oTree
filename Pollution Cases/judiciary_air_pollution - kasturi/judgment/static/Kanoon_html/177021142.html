                                               ... RESPONDENTS

(BY SRI D NAGARAJ, ADVOCATE FOR R-1;
 SRI S VIJAY SHANKAR, SENIOR ADVOCATE FOR
 SRI M SHIVAPRAKASH, ADVOCATE FOR C/R-2)

    THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">ARTICLE 226</a> OF
THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO QUASH THE
IMPUGNED DIRECTION DATED 19.12.2018 ISSUED BY
RESPONDENT NO.1 (ANNEXURE-A).

     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS
DAY, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has filed this writ petition seeking to quash

the impugned order dated 19.12.2018 issued by respondent No.1

as per Annexure-A.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.    The petitioner is an industry engaged in the business

of   manufacturing   die   forgings   and   machine   components.

Respondent No.2 filed a complaint with the jurisdictional police

alleging that the activities of the petitioner have been causing

noise of high decibels and vibrations and on account of the same,

cracks have developed in the building of respondent No.2. On the

basis of the said complaint, the Regional Officer of the Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board ('KSPCB' for short) inspected the

premises and filed a report dated 12.03.2018. Thereafter, both the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    3</span>



petitioner and respondent No.2 were called for personal hearing.

As per directions issued by KSPCB on 21.04.2018, petitioner got

installed   additional   anti-vibration   measures   and   reported

compliance by a letter dated 06.08.2018 along with reports as per

Annexure-E. In spite of the same, KSPCB has passed the

impugned order directing the petitioner to close its industrial

operations forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.     Shri. Aditya Sondhi, learned Senior Counsel for the

petitioner submits that before passing the impugned order, the

petitioner was not issued with any notice nor opportunity of

hearing was provided before directing it to close operations of the

industry. He further submits the petitioner has produced reports

regarding ground vibrations as per Annexures-F and G, which

reveal that noise and vibrations in petitioner's factory are within

the prescribed standards. He also submits that the petitioner has

taken additional measures to reduce noise and vibrations and in

spite of the same, KSPCB has passed the impugned order, which

is liable to be set aside.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     4</span><p id="p_6">




</p><p id="p_7">      4.     On the other hand, Shri. D.Nagaraj, learned counsel

for KSPCB supported the impugned order and prayed for

dismissal of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      5.     Shri. S.Vijay Shankar, learned Senior Counsel for

respondent No.2 submits that the writ petition is not maintainable

as there is an alternative remedy provided under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Section 31</a> of the

Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and there is

also a remedy of appealing to the National Green Tribunal.

Referring to the order passed by this Court dated 28.12.2018,

learned Senior Counsel submitted that this petition has been

directly filed in this Court since the Appellate Authority was not

functioning and as the Appellate Authority has been constituted

and it is functioning, this writ petition cannot be entertained.


</p><p id="p_10">      6.     We have heard learned counsel for the parties and

gone through the papers available.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      7.     During the course of submissions, it is pointed out

that the letter dated 06.08.2018 (Annexure-E) addressed by the

petitioner to KSPCB reporting compliance has not been

considered by the Board.          If the said report was taken into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span>



consideration, the Board would have taken altogether a different

decision. There is also material on record to show that petitioner

has taken additional measures to reduce noise and vibrations in

its factory.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">       8.      Though learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.2

submitted that the petitioner should be directed to avail the

alternative remedy since the Appellate Authority has been

constituted now, we are not inclined to do so since this petition is

pending since 2018 and sufficient materials have been made

available by learned counsel for the parties. Further, the letter

addressed      by   the   petitioner   dated   06.08.2018   reporting

compliance has not been considered by respondent No.1 while

passing the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">       9.      In the circumstances, the impugned order dated

19.12.2018 (Annexure-A) is hereby quashed. The matter is

remitted to KSPCB to consider the case of the petitioner afresh in

the light of the compliance report dated 06.08.2018 (Annexure-E)

and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law within two

months from the date of this order.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6</span><p id="p_17">




</p><p id="p_18">      10.    The parties are directed to appear before KSPCB

without awaiting for any notice, on 21.02.2019. They are also

permitted to place relevant materials, if any, for consideration of

the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      The petition is accordingly disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      In view of disposal of the writ petition, the pending

interlocutory applications do not survive for consideration and they

are also disposed of.
</p>
