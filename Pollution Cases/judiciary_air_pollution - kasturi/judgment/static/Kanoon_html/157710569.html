      Shri D.D. Bansal, Advocate for the petitioners.
      None for the respondents.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. has been filed to
invoke the inherent jurisdiction of this Court and to set aside the
order dated 27.05.2009 passed by IInd Additional Sessions Judge,
Ashoknagar, passed in Criminal Revision No. 05/2009 and order
dated 27.02.2009 passed by SDM, Ashoknagar in Criminal Case
No. 02/133/2002.
</p><p id="p_2">      The facts in the short giving rise present petition are that, the
petitioners having constrain relations due to civil litigation
submitted an complaint/application on 28.01.2002 to the then
Collector, Guna alleging that the petitioners are running a Plastic
Industry and installed an area. Machine in the house situated at
Ward No. 18, near Jain Mandir, Subashganj which is causing
pollution and looking to the health problems to the citizens near by.
The SDM has passed an order earlier on 07.12.2001 to close the
industries but in spite of this the several industries are being run.
Hence, it is prayed for closed/removed these industries.
</p><p id="p_3">      Collector Guna, directed the SDM to take action in the
matter under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_2">Section 133</a> of Cr.P.C. The learned SDM in
compliance of the directions issued by the Collector passed
conditional order on 08.02.2002 against the petitioners to close the

                           Vs.
</p><p id="p_4">                 Vipin Kumar and others
Plastic Industries and and saw machine (Aara) and asked to show
cause why this order be not made final.
</p><p id="p_5">      The petitioner/non-applicant No. 1 Subodh Kumar submitted
reply on 26.03.2002 contending that he is not doing any business
but he is an Advocate by profession and contended the allegation
are false. Petitioner No 2 Anil Kumar, who is running the said
business and the non-applicant/petitioner No. 1 has no nexus with
the said business. Non applicant/petitioner No. 1 further contended
that Anil Kumar being unemployed and economical condition of
the family being poor, non-applicant/petitioner No. 2 applied and
was sectioned loan to start the small industry in which he is
manufacturing electric holder, adopter, board etc. and no pollution
is being created by the said industry work. It is also contended that
the business is being run as per provisions of Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981.
</p><p id="p_6">      Learned SDM rejected the preliminary objection of the non-
applicants vide order dated 10.06.2002 and after framing charge of
public nuisance under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_4">Section 133</a> of Cr.P.C and proceeding with
the case after regarding nuisance. The learned SDM passed the
impugned order on 27.02.2009 and directed to close the industries
and remove the saw machine from this premises.
</p><p id="p_7">      Beside    the   said   order   dated   27.02.2009   the   non-
applicant/petitioners preferred Criminal Revision before Second
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                     M.Cr.C. No. 4282/2009                           3</span>
                 Subodh Kumar and others
                            Vs.
</p><p id="p_8">                  Vipin Kumar and others
Additional Sessions Judge and Sessions Judge, Ashoknagar. The
learned Additional Sessions Judge after hearing arguments but
without considering the material available on record dismissed the
revision and confirmed the order passed by SDM vide its impugned
order dated 27.05.2009.
</p><p id="p_9">      During the argument learned counsel for the petitioners
through the statement of AW-3 Manoj Kumar, said that this small
industry running is 14-15 years. It is also claimed that this business
is being run by the petitioner No. 2 Anil Kumar for long period. But
there being a dispute with regard to way between the parties, the
complaint was deliberately made. The business which is being done
for more then 14-15 years could not have been directed to be closed
merely on the complaint of persons having constrain relations due
to civil dispute about encroachment done by the applicants.
</p><p id="p_10">      Learned counsel for the petitioners also submitted that the
report is not relevant and cannot be relied upon against the non-
applicants which was prepared even prior to filing the complaint. It
is submitted that no actual spot inspection was done by learned
SDM before passed the order. On the contrary the non-applicants
got inspected the industry through Pollution Control Board who
after making inspection issued the certificates Ex. D/1 to D/4. The
petitioners further prayed that the learned Court below for care to
certificate issued by pollution Board after making enquiry.

</p><p id="p_12">                  Vipin Kumar and others
      The complaint made by the applicants clearly comes under
the provisions of the Act. <a href="/doc/1180484/" id="a_5">Section 43</a> (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of
Pollution Act</a>, 1981) of the Act is no complaint was made to the
competent authority under the Act nor the complaint has been filed
to the SDM by the Board. In Abdul Hamid Vs. the Gwalior
Rayon Sinlk Mfg. (WVG) Co. Ltd and others reported in 1989
CRI.L.J. 2013 this Court's is held that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">The Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">Air Act</a> are special
        Acts brought on the Statute-book and constitute a
        complete Code for prevention and control of
        water and air pollution by any trade or industry. It
        has expressly been mandated therein that
        notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
        contained in any enactment other than the Acts
        their Provisions have to prevail. Inconsistent
        provisions in any other Act cannot, therefore, be
        permitted to come in the way of the provisions of
        the special Acts and defeat them. In view of the
        express provisions in <a href="/doc/1465283/" id="a_9">Section 52</a> of Air Act and
        <a href="/doc/1122308/" id="a_10">Section 60</a> of the Water Act it has to be held that
        to the extent of inconsistency the provisions of the
        Panel Code, <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_11">General Clauses Act</a> and the Code
        stand repealed. In matters relating to pollution of
        air or Water by trade or industry recourse has to
        be taken to the provisions of the special Acts."</blockquote>

<p id="p_13">      Learned counsel for the petitioners start nuisance argued that
learned SDM made exercised charged under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_12">Section 133</a> of Cr.P.C.
Only in respect of public nuisance and not in respect of private
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                    M.Cr.C. No. 4282/2009                          5</span>

nuisance. According to them, if it is case of private nuisance
namely if the act of someone else causes nuisance to the petitioners
then he should have approached the competent Civil Court for
redressal of his grievance regarding private nuisance and not that
action can be taken under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_13">Section 133</a> of the Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_15">      learned counsel for the petitioners stated on Makhan Lal Vs.
Buta Singh reported in 2003 CRI.L.J. 4147 in which it is held that
the proceedings under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_14">Section 133</a> of Cr.P.C, cannot be initiated
since the small industry has been installed 14-15 years ago. In the
light of statement of AW-3 Manoj Kumar who has stated that this
small industry was installed number of years working for the last
14-15 years. Evidence did not prove that an urgency existed
warranting the taking of action under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_15">Section 133</a> of Cr.P.C. not
provided.
</p><p id="p_16">      In Vasant Manga Nikumba Vs. Baburao Bhikanna Naidu
reported in (1996) 1 SCC (Cri) 27 held that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "The circumstance and the evidence in that
        case did not prove that an urgency existed
        warranting the taking of action under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">Section 133</a>.
        No action can be taken under this section where
        the obstruction or nuisance has been in existence
        for a long period and the only remedy open to the
        aggrieved party was to move the civil court. It was
        also held that <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">Section 133</a> is attracted only in cases
        of emergency and immediate danger to the health
        or physical comfort of the community.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                        Vipin Kumar and others
               Accordingly, on the facts in that case, it was held
               that there was no immediate danger or emergency
               for the removal of the structure offending in that
               case. It is also settled law that recourse to <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_18">Section
               133</a> could not be a substitute for the civil
               proceedings and the parties should have recourse
               to the civil remedy available and should not be
               encourse (sic encouraged) to taking recourse to the
               provisions of Section 133 of the Code."

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            Keeping in view the above, there is no warrant in exercising
      the power under <a href="/doc/983382/" id="a_19">Section 133</a> of the Cr.P.C. even petitioner No. 2
      had sanctioned from Pollution Board.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            Before omega, it would be appropriate to hold that the
      respondents be approached to Green Tribunal in this regard if there
      is public nuisance.
