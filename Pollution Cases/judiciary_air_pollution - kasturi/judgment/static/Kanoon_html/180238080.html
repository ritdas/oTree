</pre><p id="p_1">        This appeal by assessee is directed against the order of CIT(A)-VI, Kolkata dated
29.12.2009. Assessment year involved is 2006-07. Ground of appeal is as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "1. The order of the Ld. CIT(A), Kolkata confirming the action of the Assessing
        Officer is contrary to the law and facts of the case.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        2. On the facts brought on record, the Ld. CIT(A) ought to have held that the learned
        Assessing Officer erred in disallowing deduction claimed u/s. 80IB of the Income
        Tax Act 1961 amounting Rs.1,74,12,766/-."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">2.      The only issue before us is on the disallowance of the claim u/s. 80IB(10) of the I. T. Act.
The facts relevant are that the assessee is a company and during this year, the assessee was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                   2</span>

engaged in construction business and it has claimed to have developed and completed construction
of house building project in the name of Regent Garden at Ghosh para Road, Krishnapur, Kolkata.
The Assessing Officer was of the view that on inspection by ITO, who visited the site project
Regent Garden reported that construction was incomplete till the date of report i.e. on 24.12.2008.
The assessee explained that the construction of 12192 sft. was withheld by Hon'ble High Court
vide its order dated 19.12.2006 in W.P. No.19380 of 2005 filed by all flat owners of the project.
Assessing Officer called for clarification from the Chairman, Rajarhat Gopalpur Municipality.
Chairman has given the details as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "The (G+4) storied building plan of the project has been approved
       provisionally on 10.12.2003 vide Sl. No.1182/03-04. The approval was
       provisional in wanting of the following documents:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       1. Mutation and conversion certificate of land as required under section
       4C of WBLR Act, 1955.

</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">3.     However, Assessing Officer was not satisfied about the completion certificate issued by
the Municipality dated 28.07.2005 as that completion certificate was in the name of Rabindra Nath
Mondal &amp; Ors. Further, the Municipality certifies that the building is fit for occupation. The
contention of the assessee throughout the proceedings is that it had completed the project well
before the stipulated time and subsequently applied for completion certificate from the competent
local authority on 11.07.2005. The said Municipality had issued the completion certificate after
satisfied with that the project was completed. Assessing Officer, however, on going through the
copies of agreement that assesee company had entered into on 15.11.2005 with Vashulinga
Finance Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi found that owner shall complete the construction of the flat of the
intending buyer by December, 2005. Hence, Assessing Officer doubted the completion certificate
and found that the project could not be completed before 11.07.2005 i.e. the date of application for
completion certificate.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     Here the assessee company claims 80IB deduction as the deduction for development of
infrastructure project for that assessee company relied on completion certificate and claims it as it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                   3</span>
                                                                            [ITA No.272/Kol/2010]



qualifies for the deduction. As the completion certificate is in the name of Shri Rabindra Nath
Mondal and others, it is explained that as per assessee's paper book pages 81 and 84, the building
has to be constructed multistoried building complex and the sanction plan has been obtained from
the Municipal Authorities and the copy of such sanctioned plan was available at the time of
agreement and that building has to be constructed as per the plan and deviation is not permitted.
That being the case as contended by Ld. Counsel that the Municipal Authorities being satisfied
that there is no deviation from the plan, issued completion certificate and there is no deviation to
the sanctioned plan and that being the position, Assessing Officer cannot re-agitate the issue as the
Assessing Officer is not the competent person to decide and adjudicate, over and above the
competent authority, who sanctioned the building plan and thereafter issued completion certificate.
The competent Municipal Authorities never charged the assessee for violation or deviation of the
plan which was already sanctioned till date. Hence, Ld. Counsel for the assessee would submit
that the Assessing Officer has overstepped and the competent authority is only the Municipality
and the building has to be constructed as per the terms and conditions of the municipal rules, who
are the competent authority and Assessing Officer cannot transgress and make an independent
opinion than that of the one arrived by the Municipal authorities. Further, the project completion
certificate was in the name of Shri Rabindra Nath Mondal &amp; Ors., Ld. Counsel explained that the
sanctioned plan is part of the agreement to construct the project. Hence, there is no deviation or
there cannot be any fault as the building plan itself is sanctioned in the name of Shri Rabindra
Nath Mondal &amp; Ors. The agreement with builder which is available in assessee's paper book
pages 53 to 67 dated 6th February, 2004 between the assessee and the contractor M/s. RDB
Industries will clearly go to show that the assessee qualifies for the entire project for the claim of
deduction u/s. 80IB(10) of the Act and there is no deviation and the Assessing Officer cannot
attribute any deviation for the stamp of approval given to the assessee by the Municipal
Authorities. Ld. Counsel, therefore, submitted that as per page no. 34 which is the first agreement
dated 19.12.2003 between Shri Rabindra Nath Mondal &amp; Ors. with the assessee vendors of the
other part, the Assessee Goldline Writing Instrument Ltd. particularly qualifies the internal page
4 of assessee's paper book page no. 34 it is mentioned that and whereas the vendors have agreed
to sell and the purchases have agreed to purchase the aforesaid plot of land particularly described
in the Schedule hereunder written together with plans sanctioned thereof in fee simple in
possession and free from all encumbrances or for the price or sum of Rs.48 lacs only. This will go
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                    4</span>
                                                                             [ITA No.272/Kol/2010]



to show the transaction being a genuine transaction and stood explained why the plan was in the
name of Shri Rabindra Nath Mondal &amp; Ors. The indenture between the assessee and the vendors
Shri Rabindra Nath Mondal &amp; Ors. will amply explain the claim of the assessee including the
extent of land which the assessee possesses.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.      Coming to the area of the building, it has been explained that the assessee has purchased
the required one acre which is the condition for claiming 80IB(10), project has also been satisfied
though it was purchased in different occasions actually assesee owns and possesses 63 cottahas,
which is more than once acre is not in dispute. Hence, assessee's claim is that he qualifies that by
way of purchase in addition in the year 2003 four cottahas 22 sft. and 50 cottohas in 2004 and 13
cottahas again in 2004. The date of purchase of land is available in paper book items 2, 3 and 4
i.e. from page no. 15 to 52 of the assessee's paper book. The original sanctioned plan is available
in assessee's paper book at page 206, the copy of the revised sanctioned plan is in assessee's paper
book page 207 and the completion certificate including the completion plan which is dated
28.7.2005, the copy of which is available in page no. 208 of assessee's paper book. This is also
further certified before us that these documents were available before Assessing Officer as well as
the CIT(A).
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.      Coming to the explanation of the Writ Petition filed by the flat owners on the dispute over
extra space available between the flat owners and the assessee by way of Writ is that the assessee
attempted to construct structure on the reserve space which is earmarked for car parking. Further,
for that purpose only assessee on 15.11.2005 entered into agreement with Vasulinga Finance Co.
Ltd. to sell the area. The writ petition by the flat owners will clearly show that the flat owners
have accepted that they were allotted the respective flats and only the dispute which was urged by
the writ petition by the flat owners is opposing the action of the assesee that the excess car parking
space remained unsold which assessee attempted to convert the car parking space to residential
unit.   This is only the dispute between the tenements and the assessee. However, as 80IB
deduction is concerned, assessee within the stipulated time completed the project and allotted the
units to the flat owners. Ld. Counsel took us to the assessee's paper book page no. 9, which is the
P&amp;L Account starts from page no. 6 and the schedule 'K' sales and service, out of the total sale
during the year Rs.7,95,30,103/- the sale of flats and garage itself is to the tune of Rs.7,44,77,748/-,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                   5</span>
                                                                            [ITA No.272/Kol/2010]



therefore, Ld. Counsel contends that where a project ended with 31st March, 2006 the total sale of
flats and garage were almost completed and Ld. Counsel, therefore, submitted that Sec. 80IB
deduction is to be given to the assessee as assesee has completed the project and assessee qualifies
for that also. On the other hand, the Ld. DR would submit that the Assessing Officer investigated
the matter and found that completion certificate contradicted with the report of inspector of the
department, who found on personal inspection that the building was incomplete. The building
plan is only a provisional sanction and the conditions never fulfilled. Further, the completion
certificate dated 28.7.2005 is not in the name of the assessee. It is in the name of Shri Rabindra
Nath Mondal &amp; Ors. Further, the flat owner, Secretary of the Regent Garden informs to the
assessee that the construction was incomplete and were never filed copy of the revised plan. Once
it is incomplete then assesee is not entitled for 80IB deduction. Further with reference to the
agreement with the contractor M/s. RDB Industries, Ld. DR would submit that at the time of
agreement assessee does not own required minimum acre of land. Hence, the assessee is not
entitled to 80IB deduction in view of explanation (1) of sub-section (a) of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">section 80IB(10)</a> of the
Act. Hence, Ld. DR would submit that orders of the lower authorities are to be confirmed by
dismissing the appeal of the assessee.
</p>


<p id="p_7">7.     We have considered the rival submissions and perused the material available on record
including the precedents. Assessing Officer first doubted that there is further construction. For that
Ld. Counsel explained that after completion of the project and after obtaining completion
certificate when the Developer found that it was not easy to sale the garages which were saleable
commodities. He applied for revised sanction plan and started construction in the said project for
converting space for garages in the residential units. The assessee-company was prevented by
some flat owners on this extra space utilization and filed a Writ Petition before the Hon'ble High
Court and then the Inspector visited the site of the project, he found that extra space construction
was going on and hence, reported to the Assessing Officer that the project was incomplete. This is
the reason Assessing Officer denied under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">section 80(B)(10)</a> deduction mainly on the ground that
the construction is not completed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     The construction as per original plan was duly completed and the completion certificate
dated 28.07.2005 from the local authority. That being the position. The CBDT Circular No. F.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                   6</span>
<p id="p_9">                                                                           [ITA No.272/Kol/2010]



No.205/3/2000/ITA dated 04.05.2001 wherein CBDT has clarified that any project which had
been approved by the local authority as housing project should be considered as adequate for the
purpose of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_5">Section 80IB(10)</a>. The decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1775387/" id="a_6">CIT vs.
Brahma Associates</a> [2011] 333 ITR 289 (Bom.) will also support this proposition. Here, in this
case, it is clearly established that the completion certificate has been duly issued by Rajarhat
Gopalpur Municipality in respect of construction of project at Regent Garden. The plan of the
project was sanctioned on 10.12.2003 and completed within 11.07.2005 and the completion
certificate is dated 28.07.2005. That being the position. Once the appropriate authority issued the
completion certificate, it is not warranted on the part of the Assessing Officer to prove the issue
further as per the C.B.D.T. Circular cited (supra), clearly prohibits further prohibit and the
approval of the local authority should be considered as adequate for the purpose of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_7">Section
80IB(10)</a>. It is not disputed that as per original sanctioned plan completion certificate has been
issued by Rajarhat Gopalpur Municipality.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.     The only issue is on the additional space uitilisation which was objected by the flat owners
and the inspection team visited only the extra space construction activity and found that
construction was not completed. That is the matter of dispute between the flat owners and the
assessee and the utilization on conversion of the garages are the dispute pending before the
Hon'ble High Court. But, so far as the deduction under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">section 80IB(10)</a>, it had been made clear
that flat has been constructed and completed as per the sanctioned plan as evidenced by the
completion certificate issued by the local authority on 28.07.2005. Those documents are available
in assessee's paper book at page 208. The original sanctioned plan is in assessee's paper book at
page 206 and the revised sanctioned plan No.1182/02-03 dated 10.12.2003 is available in
assessee's paper book at page 207. Considering the above facts and on careful consideration of the
rival submissions, the assessee who is in the business of construction of housing project in respect
of project at Regent Garden which project was sanctioned for 4 blocks on 50 cottah of land
initially. Thereafter, assessee-company has purchased their requirement of meeting 60 cottah and
in this case assessee has purchased 63 cottah of 'Sali' land from Shri Rabindra Nath Mondal and
others. As clearly available from the agreement, the assessee qualifies for in respect of the size of
the plot of land which is minimum of 1 acre. 50 cottah of land was purchased on 19.12.2003. The

registration. While purchasing this land, this land was purchased alongwith the sanctioned plan
No.1182/2003-04 dated 10.12.2003 as it is more important that the assessee-company not only
purchased the property but altogether with the sanctioned plan for construction.
</p>


<p id="p_11">10.     Then the assessee-company entered into an agreement with M/s. R.D.B. Industries Ltd.,
Contractors for construction of the project. It is evidenced by way of agreement dated 06.02.2004.
Therefore, assessee qualifies the conditions for the eligibility of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Section 80IB(10)</a>.
</p>


<p id="p_12">11.    The only doubt in the mind of Assessing Officer is that assessee does not own minimum
requirement of one acre has been clearly proved by the assessee whereby with relevance to the
copies of documents proved that the project for construction is in the extent of land of 63 cottah.
Further, while purchasing the land together with the land, the sanctioned plan for project
construction was also part of the purchase. Then after purchase assessee entrusted the matter with
the contractor for completing the project within the stipulated time. The next doubt in the mind of
Assessing Officer is that the construction was not completed. That doubt also removed by the
explanation of the assessee that the construction was completed and the local authority has given
completion certificate as per the decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1775387/" id="a_10">CIT vs.
Brahma Associates</a> [2011] 333 ITR 289 (Bom.). This is sufficient compliance. CBDT Circular
relied also, hence, the stand of the assessee. Once the local authority sanctioned housing project it
should be considered as adequate for the purpose of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_11">Section 80IB</a> deduction. Hence, we are of the
view that assessee qualifies for the deduction under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">section 80IB(10)</a>. Once the assessee qualifies
for 80IB being the beneficial provision and as per the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of <a href="/doc/735457/" id="a_13">Bajaj Tempo Limited vs. CIT</a> [1992] 196 ITR 188 (SC) and the decision of Hon'ble
Jurisdictional High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1808379/" id="a_14">Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands Forest &amp; Plantation
Development Corporation Ltd. vs. CIT</a> [2006] 280 ITR 118 (Cal.). This ratio also helps the
contention of the assessee as the assessee is fulfilling all the conditions laid down in <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_15">Section
80IB(10)</a>. The claim of the assessee for the above deduction has to be considered as qualified for
beneficial deduction under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_16">section 80IB</a>. Hence, we are of the view that the order of authorities to
be reversed and the assessee should be given with the deduction claimed under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">section 80IB</a>
amounting to Rs.1,74,12,766/- as the assessee qualifies for the requirement of conditions laid
