<p id="p_16">               The writ petition was filed seeking a writ in the nature of

   mandamus commanding the respondents- 2nd set i.e. the authorities of

   the Bihar State Pollution Control Board to produce the order bearing

   No. 14061 dated 16.8.2012, whereby the grant of No Objection

   Certificate has been refused for running the Crusher Plant and on its

   production be quashed by issuance of a writ of Certiorari. The

   petitioner also seeks a direction in the nature of mandamus to direct
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12422 of 2013 dt.16-01-2018                            2




        the respondent authorities to produce on record letter No. 20 dated

        8.1.2013, whereby his stockist licence has been cancelled. The

        petitioner makes a third prayer for quashing the order dated 13.4.2013

        of respondent no.5, Assistant Director, Mines and Geology, Rohtas at

        Sasaram as communicated vide letter no. 261 dated 12.4.2013,

        whereby the petitioner has been directed to stop operation of his

        crusher plant on grounds that his stockist licence has been cancelled.

        The petitioner alongside makes a prayer to command the respondents

        not to disturb him in running of his stone crusher plant.

</p><p id="p_17">                     Two sets of counter affidavits have been filed responding to

        the issues raised in the writ petition. The counter affidavit on behalf of

        the respondent State in its Mining Department informs that the

        stockist licence was cancelled under Rule 7(1)(g)(iii) of the Bihar

        Minerals (Prevention of Illegal Mining, Transportation and Storage)

        Rules, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules') and the grounds for

        the same is discussed in paragraph 5 in which it is stated that the

        Bihar State Pollution Control Board has since cancelled the 'No

        Objection Certificate' issued by the Board for operating the crusher

        plant, which is a condition precedent for the stockist licence. In other

        words, the cancellation of stockist licence by the Mining Department

        is dependent on the order of the respondent Pollution Control Board in

        cancelling the 'No Objection Certificate' for running the same.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12422 of 2013 dt.16-01-2018                            3




                     The position has been explained by the Board in the

        supplementary counter affidavit so filed on their behalf and

        paragraphs 4 to 7 of the said affidavit is a complete answer to the

        issue in hand. It is explained that the petitioner had obtained a

        'consent to establish' under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and

        <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air

        Act</a>') in the year 2007 and whereafter the petitioner also applied for

        consent to operate from the Board on 18.12.2007 which was granted

        vide No. T-13563 dated 8.12.2008 (which has been incorrectly

        mentioned as 8.12.2012 in the counter affidavit). It is mentioned that

        the said 'consent to operate' order expired on 31.12.2008 and

        whereafter the petitioner applied for the same on 17.11.2008,

        15.4.2010, 4.2.2011 and 17.2.2012. The Board while considering the

        application on 17.11.2008 vide letter No. T-4614 dated 12.5.2009 and

        letter No. T-13923 dated 27.11.2009 required the petitioner to submit

        compliance report of the conditions present in the earlier 'consent to

        operate' order but the petitioner failed to respond to the letters. It is

        thereafter mentioned that the notice of show cause was given to the

        petitioner under <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_3">section 21(4)</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_4">Air Act</a>') on 1.4.2010 and again

        on 14.5.2010 but it was not responded. The petitioner without

        satisfying on the statutory compliance kept on applying unilaterally. It

        is, thus, clarified that since after grant of 'consent to establish', the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12422 of 2013 dt.16-01-2018                             4




        petitioner obtained 'consent to operate' order from the Board only for

        the year 2008 and whereafter there is no order from the Board giving

        permission to the petitioner to operate his crushing plant.

</p><p id="p_18">                     Although Mr. S.B.K.Manglam, learned counsel appearing

        for the petitioner, very expressively argued that no show cause notice

        was issued to the petitioner before such steps were taken, but in my

        opinion where the 'consent to operate' order is a fixed time order, it is

        the responsibility of the licensee to obtain its renewal and a unilateral

        application by the applicant does not serve this purpose. Mr. Manglam

        has referred to the 'consent to establish' order present at Annexure 9

        to the writ petition to submit that before its cancellation the petitioner

        needed a notice but a bare perusal of the 'consent to establish' order

        issued under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of

        Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_6">Section 21</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_7">Air Act</a>' would confirm its

        validity for six months only from the date of issue and within which

        time, the unit is required to obtain a 'consent to operate' order as

        would manifest from the order present at Annexure 9. It is not in

        dispute that following the 'consent to establish' order issued by the

        Board, the petitioner did obtain a 'consent to operate' order under

        <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_8">section 21</a> of 'the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_9">Air Act</a>' on 18.12.2007 which was issued on

        8.12.2008 but it had a validity only until 31.12.2008. The undisputed

        position is that since thereafter the petitioner has never bothered to
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12422 of 2013 dt.16-01-2018                            5




        obtain 'consent to operate' order from the Board. Meaning thereby, he

        has been operating his crusher plant without obtaining permission

        from the Board to run his crusher plant and despite this position, the

        petitioner has been able to run his plant since after 2008 until the

        authorities of the Mining Department realized that the plant was being

        operated without obtaining statutory sanction from the authorities of

        the Pollution Control Board and which has led to the order dated

        13.4.2013 issued by the Assistant Director, Mines and Geology

        directing the petitioner to stop his mining operation. It is again

        undisputed that obtaining a statutory permission from the Pollution

        Control Board is a condition precedent for operating a crusher plant

        and since undisputedly the petitioner does not have the 'consent to

        operate' order from the Pollution Control Board, no infirmity can be

        found either in the action of the Pollution Control Board in not issuing

        a 'consent to operate' order to the petitioner under the enactments in

        question or in the order of the Assistant Director impugned at

        Annexure 7, whereby the petitioner has been directed to stop

        operation of crusher plant forthwith, requiring any interference.

</p><p id="p_19">                     It is for the petitioner to obtain statutory permission from

        the authorities of the Pollution Control Board before he can approach

        the Mining Department for a reconsideration of the matter but until

        such time the petitioner is not entitled to any indulgence.
          Patna High Court CWJC No.12422 of 2013 dt.16-01-2018                      6




                              The writ petition is disposed of.
