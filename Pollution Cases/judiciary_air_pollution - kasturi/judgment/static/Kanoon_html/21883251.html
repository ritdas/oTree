<p id="p_1">1.                 By       this   Application,    the   original     Applicant,    seeks

indulgence of this Tribunal, under <a href="/doc/163209200/" id="a_1">Sections 26</a> and <a href="/doc/106221633/" id="a_2">28</a> of the

National           Green         Tribunal   Act,   2010,   (for     short,   'NGT   Act'),

particularly, against the Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and

Highways and the Director General of Police (DGP), Maharashtra.

His contention, inter alia, is that both these Authorities have failed

to comply with the order passed by this Tribunal in the Original

Application No.36 of 2011. In other words, the present Application

is for implementation of the final order dated 9th January, 2013,

passed by the National Green Tribunal (Principal Bench), New

Delhi, in the Original Application No.36 of 2011.

</p><p id="p_2">2.       It is not necessary to elaborately set out the pleadings of the

parties. Suffice it to say that the Applicant pointed out that by order

dated 9th January, 2013, the National Green Tribunal, (Principal

Bench), Delhi, gave certain directions, while deciding Original

Application No.36 of 2011. Those directions were as follows:

(J) Misc.Appln. No.202 of 2013
</p><p id="p_3">                (i)       We direct the Ministry of Road Transport &amp;

                         Highways to notify the standards for sirens

                         and     multi-toned   horns   used   by   different

                         vehicles either under Government duty or

                         otherwise within a period of 3 months hence.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               (ii)       Based upon the standards to be prescribed by

                         the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways,

                         Government of India, the State of Maharashtra

                         respectively will take adequate step to notify

                         the standards for sirens and multi-toned horns

                         for different zone, within a period of one month

                         from the date of the notification.
</p>
<p id="p_5">               (iii)      The Transport Commissioner, Government of

                         Maharashtra, is also directed to ensure the

                         number of vehicles installed sirens and multi-

                         toned sirens are limited to the bare minimum

                         so as to comply with ambient air quality

                         standards as specified in the Noise Pollution

                         (Regulation &amp; Control) Rules, 2000.

<p id="p_6">               (iv)       The Police Commissioner of Maharashtra is

                         also directed to ensure that no private vehicle

                         should be allowed to use sirens or multi-toned

                         except emergencies and under exceptional

                         circumstances. The Police Commissioner shall

                         further ensure and take precaution to the

                         effect that the residents and residential areas

                         are not affected by indiscriminate use of loud

                         speaker during night time in other words the

                         use of loudspeaker should be strictly restricted

                         to the prevailing Rules and Regulations.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.                 According to the Applicant, the directions enumerated as

above, have not been implemented by the Authorities, and,

therefore, they are liable for penal action, as per <a href="/doc/163209200/" id="a_3">Section 26</a> read

with <a href="/doc/106221633/" id="a_4">Section 28</a> of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. He made

inquiry by filing Applications under the Right to <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">Information (RTI)

Act</a>, 2005. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH),

informed him that the said Ministry was not impleaded as party in

the Original Application No.36 of 2011, and hence, it had no legal

obligation to comply with said directions. The MoRTH, averred that

no steps were taken to comply with the directions indicated as

Direction No.(i), because it was not a party to the Original

Application No.36 of 2011, and was not informed by the National

Green Tribunal, to take such steps. The Applicant has filed relevant

communication dated 7-2-2013, issued by the MoRTH. He alleges

that the MoRTH, has not issued any Notification, nor even draft

Notification, has not been put on the website of the said Ministry.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                            4</span>
(J) Misc.Appln. No.202 of 2013
 So also, the Director General of Police, Maharashtra, has not

complied with the direction No.(iv), as enumerated above.

</p><p id="p_8">4.                 The under Secretary of the MoRTH, has filed reply

affidavit.          It is pointed out that the MoRTH, was not given any

opportunity for hearing and filing of the reply to the Original

Application No.36 of 2011. Nor the copy of Judgment dated 9th

January, 2013, was served on the MoRTH. It was only after the

Application dated 21st January, 2013, was filed by the Applicant

under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_6">RTI Act</a>,2005 that the MoRTH gained

knowledge about such directions passed by the National Green

Tribunal. According to the MoRTH, Rule 119(2) of the Central Motor

Vehicles Rules, 1989, provides for standards of sound signals,

which are required to be approved and prescribed by the 'State

Registering Authority' (SRA). So, it is within domain of the 'State

Registering Authority' to approve the standards of sirens under Rule

119(3) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The MoRTH, has

clarified that the horns to be fitted in the Motor Vehicles, are

already prescribed in Notification, as per Rule 119(2) of the Central

Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, in order to secure compliance of the

provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules,

2000. Thus, MoRTH, submits that it is not liable to any penal

action for non-compliance of the directions issued by the National

Green Tribunal (Principal Bench), Delhi and hence, sought

dismissal of the Application.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.                 The reply affidavit filed by the Respondent No.3, reveals

that although, Rule 119(2) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                           5</span>
(J) Misc.Appln. No.202 of 2013
 1989, does not permit use of multi-toned horns giving a succession

of different notes or with any other sound producing device, yet,

Sub-Rule (3), thereof, permits use of multi-toned horns/sirens,

which may be fitted on ambulance, firefighting vehicles, or vehicles

used by the Police Officers etc. The Respondent No.3, further

submits that the Government of India (GoI), was requested to carry

out amendment in Sub-Rule (3), by fixing of standards of sound

signals.          A communication dated 10-3-2011, was sent for such

purpose to the Secretary, GoI, the Ministry of Shipping, Road

Transport and Highways. However, no such standards have been

specified in Sub-Rule(3), for the standards of sound emanating from

sirens fitted in the vehicles, as permitted under Sub-Rule (3) of Rule

</p><p id="p_10">119. It is further submitted that it will be practically difficult to

measure the specific sound levels of sirens and other equipments,

because such vehicles are moving. The implementation of directions

issued by the Tribunal is, therefore, said to be impracticable.

</p><p id="p_11">6.                 No reply is filed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control

Board (MPCB) and the MoEF. Of course, the directions were not

given to the MoEF in particular, as well as to the MPCB as such.

They have not presumably filed reply affidavits due to lack of such

directions against them.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.                 We have heard Learned Counsel Shri. Ritwick Dutta for

the Applicant, Shri. D.M.Gupte for MPCB and Deputy Transport

Commissioner, Maharashtra State in person. We have also gone

through the affidavit filed by Smt. Dharkar R. Luikang, under

Secretary attached to MoRTH.

<p id="p_13">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                        6</span>
(J) Misc.Appln. No.202 of 2013
</p><p id="p_14"> 8.                 Before we proceed to consider the rival submissions and

the pleadings of the parties, it is important to note that the MoRTH,

was not a party to the Original Application No.36 of 2011, that has

been decided by the National Green Tribunal (Principal Bench), New

Delhi. According to the Applicant, since UoI, through the Secretary

of MoEF, was made a party, it was not necessary to separately add

the MoRTH, as a party to the Original Application. We find it

difficult to countenance this argument advanced on behalf of the

Applicant. There are several Ministries working separately and

independently under the umbrella of Central Government (UoI). It

follows that responsibility is required to be fixed, in accordance with

the subject, which falls within ambit of work of a particular

Ministry. In absence of the MoRTH, as a party to the Original

Application No.36 of 2011, it is difficult to say that there is willful

non-compliance of the direction No.(i), which is issued by the

National Green Tribunal, while deciding the Original Application

No.36 of 2011. The MoRTH, was not required to issue Notification

about standards of sound levels for sirens/multi-toned horns, used

by the different vehicles under the government duty or otherwise.

There is no escape from conclusion that such penal action will not

be appropriate as against the MoRTH.
</p>
<p id="p_15">9.             So far as the Director General of Police is concerned, when

no standards have been prescribed for noise, in the context of the

sirens/multi-toned horns, it is difficult to say that the Director

General of Police, has intentionally failed to comply with the

</p><p id="p_22">12.                A plain reading of Sub-Rule (3), would make it amply

clear that the standards for sirens and multi-toned horns, are

required to be approved by 'Registering Authority' of the concerned

State. It goes without saying that the standards for sirens and

multi-toned horns, ought to be specified and approved by the

'Registering Authority' i.e. the Transport Commissioner, Govt. of

Maharashtra.                     It is the version of Additional Commissioner of

Transport Authority of State that GoI was requested to issue

1989, vide letter dated 10-3-2011, and 13-9-2013 Still, however, no

such amendment is effected. It is admitted, however, that by its

nature, a simple horn is supposed to give temporary short duration

warning over a longer period of time and distance, by giving a

succession of different notes.

deafering effect on the listeners. Most of them are the pedestrians or

the inhabitants of roadside premises. By way of little diversion from

the issue of liability for fixing of standards, it may be said that

"Siren sounds are intended to alert the public that emergency

vehicle is nearby and responding to an emergency. These sounds

should be recognized as the call for the 'right-of-way' of the vehicle."

find that the Respondents, including the MoRTH, have no uniform

opinion about the 'Authority', which should fix such standards. We

may point out that fixation of standards for ambient sound levels or

the sound of regular horns, is quite different from that of fixing of

the standards of sound levels and the horns and that also, by fixing

certain zones and particular hours for use of such sirens/multi-

toned horns, fitted to the vehicles, which come within ambit of Rule

119 (3) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. An approval of

such standards by the 'Registering Authority of the State' in whose

with sirens/multi-toned horns are used. One cannot be oblivions of

the fact that 'State Registering Authorities' are responsible for

registration of the vehicles in the State. The Transport Officer, has

to verify various things viz;               whether the number plate is

appropriately fixed, whether the vehicle is fitted with proper horn,

or it is fitted with the horn of different nature, or tuning for reverse

direction or forward direction, as the case may be. It is for such a

reason that the 'Road Transport Authority' (RTO) , is assigned duty

to     ensure           whether   the   sirens   or   multi-toned   horns,   are

appropriately fitted only on the vehicles, which fall within category

of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 119 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules,

1989. The RTO, cannot allow sirens, which have shrilling effect and

exceeds the decibels, than beyond prescribed approved limits.

 of air pollutants from different industrial plants. The proviso is not

for the purpose of emission of air pollutants from automobiles. The

only deductible conclusion is that the State Pollution Control Board

(MPCB), is required to fix the standards for quality of air pollution,

discharged from the automobiles, in consultation with the Central

Pollution Control Board (CPCB). What appears from the record is

that the MPCB, has not taken such steps. In our opinion, the

directions given by the National Green Tribunal, while deciding the

Original Application No.36 of 2011, are required to be modified, in

keeping with the provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and

Control ) Rules, 2000, the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, and

the relevant provisions of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>,1981. The settled legal position is that the provisions contained

in the special enactment, will prevail over the general provisions

and also the Rules. Consequently, we hold that the MPCB, is

required to fix the standards in consultation with the CPCB, as per

<a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_17">Section 17</a> (g) of the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

implement the earlier directions, yet, we are of the opinion that

those directions require modification by way of clarification.

</p><p id="p_45">19.         We have perused the Noise Pollution (Regulation &amp; Control)

Rules, 2000. These Rules deal with ambient air quality standards,

in respect of noise for different areas/zones, responsibility as to

enforcement of noise pollution control measures, restrictions on use

of horns, sound emitting construction equipments and bursting of

firecrackers. Still, however, those Rules do not prescribe the

standards for noise in the context of sirens and multi-toned horns.

As per Rule-4, the State Government, is under obligation to

maintain the standards of ambient air quality in respect of noise.

Beyond such kind of accountability of the State Government, the

Rules do not give further directive to determine the standards for

noise level qua sirens and multi-toned horns. It is for such reasons
