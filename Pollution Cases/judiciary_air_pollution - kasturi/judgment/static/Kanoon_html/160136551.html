07/ Dated:12th May, 2015
Per Virender Singh, C.J.:


</pre><p id="p_11">            Mr. A.K. Sahani, learned advocate for the petitioner,
submits that several sponge iron industries situated in Marar
Industrial Area of District Ramgarh have been made operational in
connivance with the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (for
short, SPCB) without taking No Objection Certificate from the SPCB
and all these industries are polluting the surrounding areas as
depicted in Paragraph-10 of the petition.
</p><p id="p_12">2.          Mr. A.K. Pandey, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the S.P.C.B. while drawing the attention of the Court to the affidavit
filed by one Mahendra Mahto, Member Secretary, SPCB, Ranchi
states that industries falling in the area of Ramgarh and its
surrounding places, as depicted in Paragraph-4 of the counter
affidavit which play the major role in polluting the area around
Ramgarh township, have been made operational only after all those
units were checked by the task force consisting of the District Mining
Officer,   Mining    Inspector,   the   representative   of   the   Deputy
Commissioner and         the Scientific Assistant of SPCB with other
 concerned officials.
</p><p id="p_13">3.         According to Mr. Pandey, all these units have installed all
the pollution   control devices    including Electrostatic Precipitator
(ESP) with their kiln stack to control dust emission. He states that
these industries have also installed online stack monitoring system.
Even the Bag filters at different pollution generating sources have
also been installed by these units at cooler discharge, product
separation, storage bin, etc.   Therefore, the emission from all these
units have come down within the prescribed limit i.e. 100 mg/Nm 3.
</p><p id="p_14">4.         With regard to certain units, which are operating without
obtaining No Objection Certificates from the SPCB, according to Mr.
Pandey complaints have been filed against them by the Regional
Officer of the Board. He has drawn the attention of the Court to the
list containing the names of all those units against whom the
complaints have been filed or to be filed.
</p><p id="p_15">5.         We are surprised as to why all these units, which have not
obtained No Objection Certificates from the SPCB are still allowed to
continue, whereas if any industrial unit violates any of the restrictions
on use of the industrial plants, as contained in <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the Air
(Prevention of Pollution &amp; <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_2">Control) Act</a>, 1981, the concerned authority
is empowered to close the said unit. Mr. Pandey states that the SPCB
shall look into this aspect and would ensure that appropriate action is
taken against those erring units in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_16">6.         Mr. Sahani, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner states that this redresses the grievance of the petitioner as
projected in this petition at this stage and nothing survives in it for
prosecute if any further.
</p><p id="p_17">7.         Disposed of accordingly.
</p><p id="p_18">8.         Copy of the order shall be provided to the learned counsel
for both the sides.
</p>
