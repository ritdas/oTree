<p id="p_2">                 State Government is the appellant in this appeal.   Respondent

No.1 is the contesting private respondent. Respondent No.2 is a formal party.

</p><p id="p_3">                 2. The State Government has informed the private respondent

that his term as a member of the Syndicate of the 2nd respondent - Cochin

University of Science and Technology, Cochin has expired and therefore, he has

to vacate his seat as a member of the Syndicate of the University. However, the

private contesting respondent is of the view that he can continue to sit and

occupy the Chair as a member of the Syndicate. The tussle between the State

Government and the first respondent has reached the High Court in the form of a

writ petition filed by the private respondent. Learned Single Judge has allowed

the writ petition and thereby has permitted the private respondent to continue to

occupy his chair as a member of the Syndicate of the second respondent

University. The result of the writ petition has brought the State Government

before this Court by filing the writ appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                 3. The private respondent was a member of the Senate of the 2nd

respondent University. He was nominated as such by the State Government in

exercise of its powers under Section 19(iv) of the Cochin University of Science

and <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Technology Act</a>, 1986 (hereinafter for the sake of brevity referred to as Act).

The said nomination was done by the University by issuing a notification dated

7.5.2003. The term of his office as a member of the Senate commenced from

    31.3.2003 and expired only on 13.2.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                    4. The Registrar of Cochin University of Science and Technology

    has issued a notification dated 26.2.2005 pursuant to the letter of the State

    Government dated 26.2.2005 nominating the private respondent as a member to

    the Syndicate of the University as per <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_2">Section 17(1)(viii)</a> of the University Act,

    1986. The nomination so made specifically states that the nomination made is

    against the      vacancy caused by the relinquishment of membership of the

    Syndicate by one Sri.K.Mohammed Ali. The term of office of the nominee is

    subject to Act, 1986. The          notification issued by the University has some

    significance for the purpose of disposal of the writ appeal. Therefore, the said

    notification is extracted in full and it is as under:

    respondent was before this Court in writ petition (c) No.21092 of 2006. Learned

    Single Judge has allowed the writ petition and thereby has declared that the

    orders passed by the State Government dated 7.8.2006 is illegal, invalid and

    contrary to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_7">University Act</a>.       While concluding, the learned

    Single Judge has declared that the petitioner is entitled to continue as a member

    of the Syndicate, in view of         the notification issued by the University dated

    26.2.2005 wherein the University has nominated the private respondent/petitioner

    in the writ petition u/s.17(1) (viii) of the Act. Learned Single Judge has also taken

    into consideration the view expressed by a Division Bench of this Court in the

    case of <a href="/doc/182513782/" id="a_8">Kamaruddin.P.K. vs. Government of Kerala and others</a>, 2000 (1) KLT

</p><p id="p_23">                    7. The State Government while asserting that the learned Single

    Judge was not justified in allowing the writ petition has stated, that, under the

    provisions of the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_9">University Act</a> the State has the power to nominate a person as

    a member of the Syndicate u/s.17(1)(viii) of the Act and if such nomination is

    made under the aforesaid provision, in view of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/972968/" id="a_10">Section 17</a> of

    the Act, the nominated member to the Syndicate can hold the office of the

    member of the Syndicate for a period of four years, and, he shall not be eligible

    for re-nomination and if for any reason, a person is nominated due to death,

    resignation or relinquishment of office of any member of the Syndicate, the

    vacancy that is caused can be filled up by the University in the place of the

    person who had relinquished the office and that can only be done under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_11">Section

    45</a> of the Act and if such nomination is made, the term of office that he would be

    entitled to hold would be the remaining portion of the tenure of the earlier

    incumbent who had vacated the office as a member of the Syndicate.

</p><p id="p_24">                    8. The private respondent has filed a counter affidavit and in that it

    is stated, that, since his nomination was under <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_12">Section 17(1)</a> (viii) of the Act, he

    has every right to continue as a member of the Syndicate for a period of four

    years and therefore, the State Government is not justified in restricting the term

    of the office of the respondent for the remaining portion of the tenure of the

    earlier incumbent who had vacated.

<p id="p_25">                    9. Learned Advocate General appearing for the State Government

    would firstly contend that the private respondent was nominated as a member of

    the Syndicate in view of the vacancy caused by the relinquishment of the office of

    the membership of the syndicate by one Sri.Mohammed Ali, who was nominated

    as a member of the Syndicate. Continuing further, learned Advocate General

    would submit that though in the notification it is stated that the nomination of the

    private respondent is done u/s.17(1)(viii) of the Act, it should be presumed that

    the said nomination is only under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_13">Section 45(1)</a> of the Act and, therefore, the

    nominated member can hold office for the remaining period of the office that

    Sri.Mohammed Ali could have continued as a member of the Syndicate.          In aid

    of this submission, learned counsel has invited our attention to <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_14">Section 17(1)</a> and

    (2) and also <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_15">Section 45</a> of the Act. Learned Advocate General also relies upon

    the observations made by the Full Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/684715/" id="a_16">Babu Raj v.

    State of Kerala</a>, 1994(2) KLT 679, wherein the Full Bench of this Court has

    stated that merely because a rule was not mentioned while granting retrospective

    regularisation for conferring seniority to the respondents therein, it must be

    presumed that such a decision/order is made only in exercise of the power under

    Rule 39 of the Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules. In this regard,

    learned Advocate General invites our attention to the penultimate paragraph of

    the judgment of the Full Bench, which reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   "The aforesaid decision is an authority that the Government

           action in giving retrospective regularisation for conferring seniority to

           the respondents was in exercise of the residuary powers. Such a

           residuary power can certainly be traced to R.39 as quoted above.

           Even if the Rule was not mentioned as such, we are of the opinion

           that the action of the Government can be supported by tracing the

           source of power in the said rule".</blockquote><p id="p_26">




</p><p id="p_27">                   10. Learned Advocate General then invites our attention to the

    observation made by the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1052896/" id="a_17">State of Manipur vs.

    Chandam Manihar Singh</a>, (1999) 7 SCC 503. Reference to the law laid down

    therefore the observations made in the aforesaid decision will be noticed at the

    appropriate stage while discussing the legal issues canvassed by the learned

    years from the date of his nomination in view of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/972968/" id="a_20">Section 17</a> of

    the Act. Learned counsel also relies upon the very same decision on which

    reliance was placed by the learned Advocate General in the case of <a href="/doc/182513782/" id="a_21">Kamaruddin

    v. State of Kerala</a> (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_29">                   12. The question that would arise for consideration and decision of

    this Court is, whether the private respondent is entitled to continue as a member

    of the Syndicate for a period of four years or in the alternative for the remaining

    portion of the tenure of the earlier incumbent in whose place he was nominated.

    To answer the aforesaid legal issue, it would be relevant to notice certain

    provisions of the Act 1986. Chapter IV of the Act provides for the Authorities of

    the University, Staff Council and University Appellate Tribunal. <a href="/doc/940650/" id="a_22">Section 16</a> of the

    Act provides for the Authorities of the University. Under the aforesaid heading,

    the Syndicate, the Senate, the Academic Council, the Faculties, the Boards of

    Studies, the Planning Committee, the Finance Committee and such other boards

    or bodies of the University as may be declared by the Statutes are the authorities

    of the University. <a href="/doc/972968/" id="a_23">Section 17</a> of the Act provides for the Syndicate. <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_24">Section 17(1)</a>

    of the Act states that the Syndicate shall be the chief executive body of the

    University and would consist of the Vice Chancellor, the Pro-Vice Chancellor, the

    Director of Technical Education, the Secretary to Government Higher Education

    Education, the Chairman of the Kerala State Committee on Science and

    Technology, three Deans of Faculties of the University by rotation in the

    alphabetical order of the Faculties in every two years, an expert from the field of

    Industry and Commerce nominated by the Chancellor, five members of the

    Syndicate nominated by the Government of whom one shall be a member of the

    Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe and one shall be a teacher, an official

    representative of the University Grants Commission nominated by the

    Commission and two persons nominated by the Government from among the

    members of the Legislative Assembly of Kerala,             as the members of the

    Syndicate. <a href="/doc/653523/" id="a_25">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act provides that the term of office of the

    members nominated to the Syndicate under items (vii), (viii), (ix) and (x) shall be

    for a period of four years from the date of nomination. The said sub-section also

    prohibits that members so nominated under the aforesaid items are not eligible

    for re-nomination. The proviso appended to the section need not be noticed by

    us, since the said proviso would not throw any light for deciding the issue which

    we have raised for our consideration and decision.

    event of resignation of the members of the Senate, Syndicate, Academic Council

    etc. <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_26">Section 45</a> of the Act provides for filling up of vacancies. The said section is

    applicable not only to the members of the Senate, Academic Council, but also to

    the members of the Syndicate. We say so, for the reason, that, the said section

    clearly speaks of all vacancies among members of any authority or body of the

    University, other than ex officio members. Syndicate is, undoubtedly, a body of

    the University. Such vacancies can be filled up by reason of death, resignation,

    or otherwise of a person who was nominated as a member of the authorities of

    the University. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_27">Section 45</a> of the Act envisages that any person

    appointed or nominated under sub-section (1) shall hold office as member so

<p id="p_32">                   14.    The State Government, in exercise of its powers, can

    nominate or appoint a person to be a member of the Syndicate. If the said

    nomination or appointment is under <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_28">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act, the term of office of

    such a person who is nominated as a member of the Syndicate would be for a

    period of four years from the date of appointment/nomination. If for any reason,

    the State Government chooses to appoint a person in the vacancy which has

    arisen by reason of death, resignation or relinquishment of the membership or

    under any other circumstances, such a person shall hold office as member so

    long as the member in whose place he is appointed or nominated.

</p><p id="p_33">                   15. In the instant case, the private respondent was admittedly

    nominated in the vacancy caused by the relinquishment of the membership by

    Sri.K.Mohammed Ali, though his appointment is stated to have been done under

    <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_29">Section 17(1)(viii)</a> of the Act. The submission of the learned Advocate General

    that under clause (viii) of <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_30">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act, the State Government is

    authorised to nominate five members of the Senate as members of the Syndicate,

    and of the five members one should be a member of the Scheduled Caste or

    Scheduled Tribe and one person should be a teacher. Since the contesting

    private respondent was appointed/nominated in the vacancy caused from the

    relinquishment of a membership by one Mohammed Ali, it requires to be

    construed that the said appointment was made by the State Government in

    exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_31">Section 45(1)</a> of the Act. This assertion of the

    learned Advocate General was disputed by learned counsel appearing for the

    private respondent, who contends that since the nomination of the private

    envisaged u/s.17(2) of the Act,

</p><p id="p_34">                     16. In the instant case, the private contesting respondent was a

    member of the Senate. He was eligible to be appointed as a member of the

    Syndicate in view of <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_33">Section 17(1)(viii)</a> of the Act, for the reason, that, under the

    aforesaid clause it is only the members of the Senate who could be nominated by

    the Government as members of the Syndicate. In the instant case, the private

    respondent was appointed as a member of the Syndicate, but, that

    appointment/nomination was in the place of one Sri.Mohammed Ali, who has

    relinquished his office as member of the Syndicate. Though in the notification it

    is stated that the appointment of the private respondent is under <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_34">Section 17(1)</a>

</p><p id="p_35">    (viii) of the Act, if the entire notification is read, it is clearly discernible that his

    his office. If it is construed in the aforesaid manner, in view of sub-section (2) of

    <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_35">Section 45</a> of the Act, the said member can continue to hold office as a member

    so long only as a member in whose place he is appointed.

    <a href="/doc/182513782/" id="a_36">Kamaruddin v. State of Kerala</a>, to consider a more or less similar issue. That

    was a case where the President of the Cochin University Employees Association,

    aggrieved by the continuation of the two ruling party MLAs in the Syndicate of the

    University after the expiry of the term of their office prescribed under the Act had

    questioned their continuation in the office as members of the Syndicate, on the

    ground that the said continuation is contrary to the provisions of the Act and also

    illegal, irregular etc.. The Court after noticing the notification issued by the State

    University was for a period of four years has opined that the continuation of those

    members as members was not only regular but also in accordance with the

    provisions of the Act.       In the aforesaid case, the State while issuing the

    notification appointing the two ruling party MLAs as members of the Syndicate

    had specifically stated that term of office is for a period of four years and that

    only means that their appointment was u/s.17(1) of the Act. In the peculiar

    death of a member, resignation, relinquishment or otherwise. That only means,

    the State Government is authorised to nominate the members of the Syndicate

    u/s.17(1) of the Act and under special circumstances under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_43">Section 45</a> of the Act.

    (1) of the said Act speaks of term of office of the members of the Board other

    than a member Secretary. It shall be for a term of three years from the date of

    successor enters upon his office. <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_54">Section 5(6)</a> of the Act provides for filling up of

    casual vacancy in the Board. That can be done only by a fresh nomination and

    the person nominated to fill the casual vacancy shall hold the office only for the

    remainder of the term for which the member in whose place he was nominated.

    The question that came up for consideration before the Apex Court was whether

    the chairman of the Board appointed under <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_55">Section 5(6)</a> of the Act to fill up the

    casual vacancy caused on the resignation of the erstwhile Chairman entitled to

    continue as a Chairman for a period of three years as envisaged under <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_56">Section 5</a>

    (1) of the Act or for the remainder of the term of the erstwhile Chairman in whose

    place he was nominated. The Apex Court after considering the provisions of

    <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_57">Section 5(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_58">Section 5(6)</a> of the Act, is of the opinion that if a Chairman

    is nominated u/s.5(6), he shall continue as a Chairman only for the remaining

    period of the erstwhile Chairman in whose place he was nominated. While

    explaining the aforesaid legal position, the Apex court at paragraph 13 has stated

    as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                    "It is obvious that if such removal takes place as per <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_59">Section

            5(3)</a> the vacancy arising out of such termination cannot be anything

            but a casual vacancy depending upon such a contingency. Another

            instance of a casual vacancy is furnished by the provisions of

            sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_60">Section 5</a> which deal with the resignation of the

            members of the Board, other than the member-secretary.           If a

            member including Chairman resigns before his term is over, the seat

            of the Chairman or such other member thereupon shall become

            vacant. But that apart, <a href="/doc/108254/" id="a_61">Section 6(1)</a> deals with disqualification of

            sitting members of the Board. If such disqualification is found to

            have been incurred by any member under sub-section (1) then under

            sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1190849/" id="a_62">Section 6</a> after giving him reasonable opportunity,

            he can be removed from his office prior to the expiry of the usual

            term of his office of three years. That would be a third instance of a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.A. No.2165 of 2007                         - 14 -</span>


           casual vacancy. When such casual vacancies occur, sub-section (6)

           of <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_63">Section 5</a> would start operating and if another member is

           nominated to fill up that vacancy, then his term of office would be for

           the remainder of the unexpired term of the member in whose place

           he steps in by nomination. In the facts of the present case, it is easy

           to visualise that as the earlier Chairman resigned on 10-7-2006 and

           he was nominated as Chairman on 5-5-1995, his regular term of

           office would have expired on 4-5-1998. In the meantime, because of

           his resignation, casual vacancy of Chairman occurred and the said

           vacancy     was   filled up    by   nomination     of  the    respondent

           on16-10-1996. Therefore, the unexpired term of his tenure as a

           substituted nominee Chairman would have continued only up to

           4-5-1998. On that day, by the thrust of sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/292738/" id="a_64">Section 5</a>,

           vacancy of the Chairman could be said to have occurred and till that

           vacancy was filled up in accordance with law by the State authorities,

           the respondent could have continued to hold office beyond 4-5-1998

           till his successor was available to hold that office. It is of course true

           that in the meantime the appellants themselves thought that the

           respondent was liable to removed from office and passed order on

           19-10-1998. That appeared to have been on the assumption that the

           successor was not available to take charge from the respondent. Be

           that as it may, so far as the impugned direction of the High Court is

           concerned and to which exception is taken by learned Senior

           Counsel for the appellants, it is to be stated on the correct

           interpretation of relevant provisions of the Act as mentioned earlier,

           that in case of any casual vacancy of any member of the Board duly

           constituted under <a href="/doc/492974/" id="a_65">Section 4</a>, the successor nominee who fills up

           such vacancy will have only the unexpired period of office available

           in the light of the initial appointment of the original incumbent

           member vice whom he walks in to fill up the vacancy.".</blockquote><p id="p_42">

<p id="p_44">                    22. Under Ext.P2, the petitioner Sri.R.S.Sasikumar, the contesting

    private respondent was nominated as a member of the Syndicate of the

    University against the vacancy caused by relinquishment of membership of the

    Syndicate by Sri.K.Mohammed Ali under <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_74">Section 17(1)(viii)</a> of the Act. The said

    notification is issued by the Registrar of the 2nd respondent University, pursuant

    to the letter issued by the State Government in letter No.6018/B2/2005/Hi.Edn.

    dated 26.2.2005 in exercise of its powers as per <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_75">Section 17(1)(viii)</a> and <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_76">17(1)(x)</a>

    of the Act.      By the said letter, the State Government had nominated the

    contesting private respondent and two others as members of the second

    respondent University.    In the notification, it is specifically mentioned, that, this

    nomination is against the casual vacancy caused by relinquishment of

    membership by Sri.K.Mohammed Ali and the term of office of the nominees

    would be subject to the provisions of the Cochin University of Science and

    <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_77">Technology Act</a>, 1986 and statutes thereunder, unlike in Kamaruddin's case,

    wherein the term of office of the nominated members was for a specific period of

    four years from the date of their nomination as members of the Syndicate.

</p><p id="p_45">                    23. If the nomination to the Syndicate is in the vacancy caused,

    necessarily, the nomination can be only under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_78">Section 45(1)</a> of the Act and as per

    <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_79">Section 45(2)</a> of the Act, the substituted member can hold office as member so

    long only as the member in whose place he was nominated could have been

    entitled to hold the office, if the vacancy had not occurred. In the alternative,

    successor nominee who fills up such vacancy will have only the unexpired period

    of office available to the original incumbent. Therefore, the substituted member

    can continue only up to the term left by the earlier member.       This only means,

    though in the notification it is stated that the nomination is under <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_80">Section 17(1)</a>

</p><p id="p_46">    (viii) of the Act, since it is a nomination made to fill up a casual vacancy on the

    relinquishment of membership of the Syndicate by Mr.K.Mohammed Ali, the

    nominated member can hold office only for the remaining period in whose place

    he is nominated.
</p>
<p id="p_47">

</p><p id="p_48">                    24.    The State Government can nominate members of the

    Syndicate in two different situations. Firstly, under <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_81">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act and

    that would be a fresh nomination, and secondly, on the happening of an event as

    envisaged under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_82">Section 45(1)</a> of the Act. If the nomination is under <a href="/doc/972968/" id="a_83">Section 17</a>

    (1) of the Act, as per <a href="/doc/653523/" id="a_84">Section 17(2)</a>, the nominated member can hold office for a

    period of four years. However, the person so nominated shall not be eligible for

    re-nomination. If, for any reason, the State Government nominates a person in

    the vacancy caused in the eventuality that is envisaged under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_85">Section 45</a>, the

    period of such nomination is governed by <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_86">Section 45(2)</a> of the Act. Therefore, a

    vacancy in the Syndicate which is a continuing body without a specific duration,

    unlike in the case of Senate, Academic Council etc., can be filled up by the State

    Government either by resorting to <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_87">Section 17(1)</a> or under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_88">Section 45</a> of the Act.

    In the instant case, since the nomination is made in the vacancy caused on the

    relinquishment of membership by a member of the Syndicate, the nomination

    could only be under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_89">Section 45</a> of the Act, and, therefore, his term of office can

    only be as determined under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_90">Section 45(2)</a> of the Act, though in the notification

    the notifying authority has stated that his nomination is under <a href="/doc/1694942/" id="a_91">Section 17(1)(viii)</a> of

    the Act.     Mentioning of the wrong provision of the Act will not entitle a person to

    take the benefit of the said provision. If the notification is read in full, the only

    conclusion that can be reached is that the petitioner was nominated in the

    vacancy caused due to the relinquishment of membership of the Syndicate by

    Sri.K.Mohammed Ali and that vacancy caused is filled up by nominating the

    petitioner. It only means, his nomination is made under <a href="/doc/36795/" id="a_92">Section 45(1)</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_49">                    25.  In view of the above discussion, in our opinion, we cannot

    sustain the findings and the conclusions reached by the learned Single Judge

    while allowing the writ petition.     Therefore,   the appeal filed by the State

    Government requires to be allowed and accordingly, it is allowed. The order

    passed by the learned Single Judge is set aside. In the facts and circumstances

    of the case, parties are directed to bear their own costs.
