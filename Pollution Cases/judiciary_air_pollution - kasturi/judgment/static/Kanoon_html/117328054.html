<p id="p_1">            The petitioners are holders of contracts permitting them to

mine minor minerals in the State of Punjab. There common grievance

is that the State of Punjab, by virtue of the impugned notices, has asked

them to either surrender their existing contracts or to execute a fresh

contract at the rate, at which mines within the Districts, have been

given for prospecting of        minor or minerals by auction through

'progressive bidding'; in the absence of any mines having been

auctioned by 'progressive bidding' within the District, at the auction

rate of adjoining District. Since, common questions of fact and law

arise in this bunch of writ petitions, this judgment will decide

Facts

</p><p id="p_2">2.          The Udhyog and Commercial Department, Government of

Punjab, issued E-auction notice dated 10.11.2015 in respect of 83

mines in various Districts of the State of Punjab. This auction was

conducted by following a process of 'reverse bidding'. The petitioners

were successful in this auction. Vide letter dated 04.03.2016 issued by

the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government

of India, environmental clearance was transferred to the respective

petitioners from the Executive Director, Punjab Small Industries and

Export Corporation, Limited.            The General Manager-cum-Mining

Officer, District Industries Centre, SAS Nagar, issued letter dated

14.10.2016 thereafter, granting final approval for operating the quarry

allotted. The petitioners were subsequently granted consent to operate

under the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, and

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, whereafter,

they commenced operation of extraction of minor minerals. On

31.03.2017, another notification was issued for E-auction of 59 mines,

through the process of 'reverse bidding'. According to this notice, the

date of E-auction was 18.04.2017.          However, a fresh notice dated

12.04.2017, was issued postponing the date of E-auction to 24.04.2017.

Vide another notification dated 17.04.2017, the date of E-auction was

further postponed to 05.05.2017. On 19.04.2017, a meeting of the

Cabinet took place, in which a decision was taken, inter alia, to auction

mines of minor minerals by the process of 'progressive bidding'.

Consequently, public notice dated 20.04.2017 was published,

cancelling the auction of 59 mines notified vide notification dated

31.03.2017. A fresh auction notice dated 03.05.2017 was issued for

auction of the aforementioned 59 mines through the process of

'progressive bidding'.     The auction took place on 19.05.2017 and

20.05.2017.    On 27.05.2017, the Director Mining, Industries and

Commerce Department, issued a letter to the General Manager-cum-

Mining Officer of various Districts in the State of Punjab, directing

them to send notices to the contractors, who were successful in the

auction held pursuant to the notice dated 10.11.2015 (the petitioners,

who had secured contracts through auction held by the process of

'reverse bidding') to change their existing contract to one through

'progressive bidding' or to surrender the mining contract in accordance

with Rule 39 of the Punjab Minor Minerals Rules, 2013, (hereinafter

referred to as 'the Rules'). A copy of this letter has been annexed as

Annexure P-10 on the record. Reliance was placed on the Cabinet

decision dated 19.04.2017. It was further stated therein that average

cost of bid received for a mine through 'progressive bid' will be

worked out in the District and will be made applicable to the contract

allotted by the process of 'reverse bidding'. In case, no contract has

been allotted within the district by 'progressive bidding', the average

rate of the adjoining district where contracts have been awarded

through 'progressive bidding' would be made applicable. Pursuant to

this letter, the General Manager-cum-Mining Officer, District

Industries Center, issued letter dated 29.05.2017 to the respective

petitioners giving them seven days' time to submit their option. It was

also stated that in case of non-receipt of any reply within stipulated

time, it would be deemed that the contractor had nothing to say. A

copy of this letter has been annexed as Annexure P-11 with the writ

petition.    The said notices dated 27.05.2017 (Annexure P-10) and

29.05.2017 (Annexure P-11) have been challenged in these writ

petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.           Pursuant to notice issued by this Court, the State filed its

written statement challenging the maintainability of the writ petitions

on the ground that the petitioners were only licensees and had no vested

legal right for seeking a writ in the nature of mandamus and that a writ

petition against a policy decision was not maintainable. On merits, it

was stated that the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development

and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_3">Regulations) Act</a>, 1957, (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), the

Rules and Government Instructions permitted the State Government to

alter the terms of an existing contract. The State Government, in public

interest, was not bound by the terms of a previous contract and that

conditions existed for switch over to process of 'progressive bidding'

because the system of 'reverse bidding' had resulted in creation of a

mining mafia, illegal extraction of minor minerals, reduction in supply

of minor minerals in the market and recurring loss to the State

Exchequer. It is also pleaded that the action of the State is inspired

solely by public interest and is not violative of any rights guaranteed

under Part-III of the Constitution of India. Thus, dismissal of the writ

petitions is sought as they lack merit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Reverse Bidding versus Progressive Bidding

</p><p id="p_5">4.          Before proceeding further, it would be apposite to set-out

the differences between 'reverse bidding' and 'progressive bidding'. In

auctions by 'reverse bidding', the State pre-determines various

components, which the bidder will pay such as royalty, compensation

to land owner, environmental clearance expenses, weightage expenses

etc.   The profit of the bidder is also fixed and is added to the

components hereinbefore mentioned. These various components are

added up to calculate 'pit head sale price', which is the maximum sale

price per ton at which the contractor will sell the minor mineral at the

pit head for transportation to the retail market. Bidding inter se, is for

bidder is granted the contract.             This can be best illustrated by an

example taken from the present case itself. For the quarry of Bassi

Gulam Hussain, District Hoshiarpur, the 'pit head sale price' was

worked out as follows:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">1.    Royalty                                    Rs.30/- per ton
2.    EMF (10% of the royalty)                   Rs.3/- per ton
3.    Compensation of land owner                 Rs.50/- per ton
4.    Labour charges                             Rs.25/- per ton
</pre><p id="p_6">5.    Environmental clearance expenses 0.26 paisa per ton
</p><p id="p_7">6.    Weighbridge expense                        0.62 paisa per ton
</p><p id="p_8">7.    Profit                                     Rs.10/- per ton
      Pit head sale price                        Rs.118.89 per ton rounded of to
                                                 Rs.119/- per ton

</p><p id="p_9">5.             Thus, it is clear that the contractor had a maximum profit of

Rs.10/- per ton, which was reduceable at the time of auction. In case

of tie, i.e. if nobody bids below the maximum 'pit head sale price',

a draw of lots is resorted to for determining the successful bidder.

5A.            As opposed to this, in 'progressive bidding' the cap on the

'pit head sale price' is removed and the bidder is permitted to place his

bid for the value of mine as he deems commercially fit.               The reserve

price is fixed in accordance with the quantity of minor minerals

extractable per year, 1/3rd of which is the earnest money. Resultantly,

the 'pit head sale price' in auctions by 'progressive bidding' could be to

the tune of Rs.3200/- per ton in a particular case. Thus, the 'pit head

sale price' is much higher than when auction is conducted by 'reverse

bidding'.

</p><p id="p_12">6.          At this stage, we may also note that during the course of the

hearing, we had given an option to the petitioners, to surrender their

respective contracts, after receiving in advance the profit for the

balance term of their respective contracts. This could be worked out

very simply by multiplying the quantity of balance extractable minor

mineral by the bid price and subtracting the expenses from it. After

seeking instructions from the petitioners, their learned counsel did not

accept this option given by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">7.          The arguments of both the parties have to be appreciated in

the context of the aforementioned factual matrix.          Broadly, the

submissions on behalf of the petitioners are:-

</p><p id="p_14">(i)         The Cabinet decision dated 19.04.2017 is confined to future

auctions and does not cover the case of the petitioners. The existing

contract holders are not the subject matter of the Cabinet decision and

thus, the impugned letters Annexures P-10 and P-11 are without

jurisdiction. The existing contracts came into being by virtue of a

policy decision of the Cabinet to switch over to 'reverse bidding' and

the change over to 'progressive bidding' can only be done by a policy

decision of the Cabinet;
</p>
<p id="p_15">(ii)        The terms of a subsisting contract cannot be changed in

exercise of administrative powers;
</p>
<p id="p_16">(iii)       The decision of the Cabinet is not in public interest as

minor minerals will become unaffordable;
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_19">(iv)        The impugned decision is arbitrary and unreasonable

inter alia, because it amounts to premature termination of contract

without existence of conditions requisite for terminating a contract;

</p><p id="p_20">(v)         Action is mala-fide, intended to oust the existing licensees;

</p><p id="p_21">(vi)        No opportunity of hearing has been granted before passing

the impugned orders;
</p>
<p id="p_22">(vii)       The changed policy cannot be applied retrospectively; and

</p><p id="p_23">(viii)      There is a violation of the doctrine of legitimate

expectation.
</p>
<p id="p_24">8.          On the other hand, the State submits that the impugned

action has the sanction of law and is in public interest. The action has

been taken to curb the menace of illegal mining, rationalization of

supply and prices and maximization of State revenue. Reference has

been made to various provisions of the Act and Rules, conditions of

licence granted and terms of the notification issued for inviting tenders

for the auctioned mines.
</p>
<p id="p_25">Statutory Scheme:-
</p>
<p id="p_26">9.          Before dealing with the respective arguments, it is

necessary to examine the Statutory Scheme governing the contracts

because that will reveal the scope and extent of the powers of the

Government.     It is not in dispute that the Act, Rules, conditions

mentioned in the contracts signed by the parties in Form-L (part of the

schedule to the Rules), terms of the E-auction notice and notification

petitioners.

regulation includes formulation of the terms and conditions on which a

mining lease or licence or concession is to be granted, the procedure for

obtaining the same, the period for which the concession may be

granted, the terms and conditions of auction, the manner in which the

contract money is payable and the conditions under which termination

of lease/licence may be done. They also provide that the amendments

made to the Rules, Government Rules and Instructions would be

applicable to subsisting contract.

A pertains to 'grant of mining lease', sub Chapter B pertains to 'grant

contracts.' The present case is not of a lease or a short term permit. It

is a case of contract, the maximum period for which as per Rule 34(1),

is five years. Thus, a contract may also be granted for a lessor period

</p><p id="p_73">18.         A bare reading of the aforenoted paragraphs brings out that

para 1.8 pertains to enhancement of revenue after adopting the process

of 'progressive bidding'.         The calculations in this para include

'67 operational mines', which are the mines of the petitioners. The

calculations have been done for consideration by the Cabinet so that an

informed decision may be taken, whether the process of 'progressive

bidding' should be adopted for auction of minor minerals. Once, such

a decision was taken, the clause reproduced above of para 1.9

automatically became operative. Thus, it is fallacious to submit that the

Cabinet decision does not refer to the mines of the petitioners. As a

natural consequence thereof, the argument of the petitioners that the

impugned notices, i.e. Annexures P-10 and P-11, are beyond the

Cabinet decision, must fail. A related argument based on the Rules of

the Business of the State Legislature that a previous policy decision of the

is also liable to be rejected.

<p id="p_74">19.          Law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in

'M.R.F Limited Vs. Manohar Parikar and others, 2010 (11)

SCC 374, which is relied upon by the learned counsel for the

petitioners, has not been violated as the Rules of Business framed under

<a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_8">Article 166 (3)</a> of the Constitution of India have been strictly followed.

The Memorandum placed before the Cabinet (Annexure P-14) was only

for the purpose of re-visiting the earlier policy of auction through

'reverse bidding' and it is factually incorrect to submit that the earlier

decision of the year 2015 was not under consideration.

Terms of contract are immutable

</p><p id="p_75">20.          This argument has to be examined in the light of the

statutory scheme. It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that the

impugned orders, Annexures P-10 and P-11 are purely executive

decisions, which cannot alter the terms and conditions of a subsisting

contract.   Reliance has also been placed upon the decision of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in 'Polymat India (P) Ltd. Vs.

National Insurance Company Limited 2005 (9), SCC 174.                 This

argument has been countered by the State by submitting that the

executive decision is sanctioned by the Act, Rules, terms of the

E-auction and conditions mentioned in Form-L and therefore, is not

illegal. It is further submitted that in exercise of powers of 'regulation'

an existing and subsisting contract may not only be varied, but may

even be destroyed. Additionally, it is stated that a contract cannot fetter

executive powers of the State in public interest. Reliance has been

placed upon 'Dabhol Power Company Vs. Maharashtra State

Electricity Board, Writ Petition No.1205 of 2001, decided on

05.03.2002'     by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court,

</p>
<p id="p_76">21.         The State of Punjab has taken a conscious policy decision

to change the mode of auction. This is a decision taken by the Cabinet,

which is the highest policy-making body of the State.                     It

amounts to an amendment of the existing 'Government Rules and

Instructions' referred to in Condition No.46 of the Notification dated

10.11.2015 (Annexure P-1) and therefore, the said amendment would

apply to subsisting contracts. Thus, the argument of the petitioners that

the terms of a subsisting contract cannot be changed by virtue of an

executive decision, cannot be countenanced. The executive decisions,

i.e. Annexures P-10 and P-11 have been taken pursuant to a decision of

the Cabinet of Ministers dated 19.04.2017 (Annexure P-15). The said

decision is a policy decision and is covered by the expression

'Government Rules and Instructions'. Hence, it can supplant the terms

of a subsisting contract by virtue of Condition No.46 (supra).

Moreover, the freedom of the State to exercise its executive powers for

running its affairs cannot be restricted in any manner by contract. This

                  G.O.No.1290 constituted a grant by itself still, as

                  State Government detected an important source of
                  revenue in the form of granite reserves. It is true that
                  at one point of time the State Government decided to
                  exploit the granite through private parties. However,
                  later on with globalization, the State Government
                  decided to go for global tender. This course of action
                  was open to the State Government. The State
                  Government decided to exploit the granite through its
                  agency, namely, APMDC. The object was to earn
                  commercial profits and revenue. APMDC was given
                  liberty either to excavate the granite on its own or
                  through joint ventures. The land belongs to the State

not strictly applicable in the facts of this case, because no new rules

have been framed by the State in exercise of powers contained in

<a href="/doc/77055124/" id="a_9">Section 15(1)</a> of the Act. Instead, a policy decision has been taken

which, as stated earlier, applies to subsisting contracts. Similarly, the

applicable to the facts of this case to support the proposition being

considered presently.

Cabinet decision not in public interest:

<p id="p_79">24.         The petitioners through their learned counsel vehemently

contend that the policy decision dated 19.04.2017, is not in public

interest because it would result in sky rocketing of prices of minor

minerals. It is submitted that minor minerals are not only required for

creation of necessary infrastructure in the State, but also for

construction activity being undertaken by a common-man. If the prices

sky rocket and minor minerals become unaffordable, immense hardship

would be caused to the common-man. The cost of projects being

executed in public interest would also increase manifold resulting in a

drain on the State Exchequer, which would ultimately affect the

common-man. Thus, according to the petitioners, the common-man

would bear the brunt of the policy, which has been adopted. It cannot

sub-serve public interest by any stretch of imagination.

</p><p id="p_80">25.          This argument has been countered firstly on facts and then

in law. The learned Additional, Advocate General, Punjab, submits

that the prices are not likely to rise because by adoption of the new

policy, the supply of minor minerals would increase greatly because the

contractor would prospect to the maximum possible extent permissible

so as to recover his costs. If adequate supply is available in the market,

the prices will self stabilize and market forces will place a check on

them. Reliance has also been placed on data collected after the new

policy has been brought into effect to show that the retail price of minor

minerals has remained at the same level as earlier and in some Districts

has even reduced. Submissions have also been made regarding the

meaning of 'public interest' and that maximization of State revenue is

also in public interest.

<p id="p_81">26.          We are in agreement with the submissions made on behalf

of the State because the facts support them. The theoretical aspect of

supply and demand need not be gone into. Reliance can be placed on a

</p><p id="p_83">    28.          The objectives with which the policy decision dated

    19.04.2017 (Annexure P-15) has been taken, can be culled-out from the

    Memorandum submitted to the Cabinet (Annexure P-14).                    The

    principle objectives were to curb illegal mining, to reduce spiralling

    prices, to maximize production of minor minerals and to augment State

    revenue. These objectives are in consonance with <a href="/doc/1331994/" id="a_10">Article 39(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_11">(b)</a>

    of the Constitution of India and therefore, we have no hesitation in

    holding that the policy decision dated 19.04.2017 (Annexure P-15) is

    in public interest. The judgment relied upon by learned counsel for the

    State, viz., 'Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy V. State of J&amp;K, 1980 (4),

    SCC 1, is squarely applicable because the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

    held therein that an action taken in furtherance of the directive

principles is in public interest because the concept of public interest

must receive its orientation from the directive principles.

</p><p id="p_84">29.         Thus, although the pit head sale price, in this case, would

increase to a great extent, but the same will not result in increase of

retail price because there is likely to be optimization of production and

reduction in illegal mining because a contractor would protect its

territory from outsiders in his own interest. Moreover, the cartelization

would be reduced if not completely eradicated, because a contractor has

to pay 25% of the annual contract amount as security deposit plus the

contract money for first quarter of the ensuing year in advance. It

would, therefore, be difficult for one person to obtain contracts in

respect of large number of mines because of the cost factor involved,

whereas in the 'reverse bidding method' cartelization was highly

probable due to low cost of auction.
</p>
<p id="p_85">30.         For the foregoing reasons, the argument that the new policy

decision dated 19.04.2017 (Annexure P-15) is not in public interest, is

rejected.

the petitioner is being asked to pay the average of bids in the

District/bids in the neighbouring Districts, whereas a person, who is a

first time bidder may be able to acquire the mine at a much lessor rate

than that payable by the petitioner(s). On the other hand, the State

submits that there is no premature termination in this case as the

petitioner(s) have been given the choice to continue mining under a

different mode of auction. Only if the choice is not acceptable i.e.

continuing operations is not commercially feasible, they can surrender

the contract. Premature termination involves a completely different

connotation. Regarding the argument that equals are being treated as

unequal and therefore, the right of equality under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution of India is being violated, it is stated that persons like the

petitioner(s) are not equal to new bidders who may enter the arena and

thus, there is no question of equals being treated unequally.

</p><p id="p_88">32.         In the earlier part of this judgment, we have held that the

State was entitled to change its policy and such a changed policy is

applicable to existing contracts. The impugned action has been taken

pursuant to a changed policy and therefore, is legal and permissible in

law.   Pursuant thereto, an option has been given to the existing

contractors to either carry on prospecting under the changed conditions

or to exercise their right under Rule 39 and surrender the contract. It is

difficult for us to hold that the first option is no option at all because as

discussed earlier, an option had been given to the petitioners to take the

amount, which they would have earned during the balance period of the

contract in advance and surrender the mine. The petitioners chose to

contest the case instead, clearly indicating that the excuse of inability to

carry on prospecting under changed conditions, was merely a

red herring. Thus, a workable option was given by the State and

therefore, we cannot hold that in fact there was only one option of

surrender available to the petitioners. Moreover, no malafides can

attach to an action taken in exercise of statutory powers and therefore,

there is no arbitrariness involved.
</p>
<p id="p_89">33.         The petitioners are a class apart from new entrants into the

field. They cannot claim to be equal to persons who may choose to bid

for a mine after introduction of the new policy. Unequals cannot seek

protection of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and thus, the

argument is misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_90">No opportunity of hearing:

<p id="p_91">34.         The impugned orders have been passed after the Cabinet

took a policy decision to auction all mines by way of 'progressive

bidding' and to apply the same parameters to the existing contractors.

There is no illegality attached to the said Cabinet decision and the

Cabinet of a State, is free to take policy decisions as it deems fit. The

said policy decision is also applicable to the petitioners. Under the

situation, can the petitioners claim a right of hearing? In our opinion,

the right of hearing, in such a situation, is not vested in the petitioners.

The law permits the Government to change the terms of a contract

during its subsistence and the concept of opportunity of hearing is not

attracted unless some provision of the Acts or the Rules provides for

the same. The petitioners could have claimed a right of hearing in case

there was a termination of their subsisting contract, but such a right

cannot be claimed once we have already held that no premature

termination is involved in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_92">35.         Therefore, we reject this argument as well.

Policy decision cannot apply retrospectively:

</p><p id="p_93">36.         The concept of 'retrospectivity' involves the existence of a

vested right and destruction of the same from an earlier date. There is

no vested right in the petitioners to continue prospecting without any

change in conditions of the contract. Moreover, the petitioners are not

being asked to pay the price determined by 'progressive bidding' with

effect from the date of their contract. We are unable to understand the

basis of the argument of 'retrospectivity'. The terms of the contract are

liable to be changed in accordance with law and the petitioners are

being asked to accept the method of 'progressive bidding'

prospectively. Therefore, this argument is totally misconceived.

Violation of Legitimate expectation:
</p>
<p id="p_94">37.         The petitioners submit that once a contract had been

entered into, it was their legitimate expectation that the same would run

its complete course unless interrupted through termination for violation

of any of the prescribed terms. It is their submission that the State has

not pointed out any violation of terms by the petitioners and therefore,

the legitimate expectation of the petitioners would prevail over the

impugned action. This argument is being noticed only to be rejected.

The underlying principle of Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation is a

promise held out by the State. In this case, no promise has ever been

held out by the State that the terms of the contract would not be

changed during its subsistence. On the contrary, the provisions of the

Act, Rules, E-auction notice and conditions of Form-L show that

statutorily the State could alter the terms of an existing contract. Thus,

the very basis being non-existent in this case, the argument has to be

rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_96">38.         Moreover, it is settled law that legitimate expectation does

not provide an independent enforceable right. It only enables the Court

to test Government action and nothing more. In any case, legitimate

expectation has to yield to public interest.                The decision in

'Sethi Auto Service Station Vs. Delhi Development Authority, 2009

(1), SCC 180, cited on behalf of the State can be referred to in this

regard. It has been held in this judgment that:-

                   legitimate expectation, now accepted in the subjective

Conclusion:
</p>
<p id="p_99">39.        Before parting with this judgment, we may, once again,

make reference to the Statutory Scheme. It is clear that the Statutory

Scheme is to create a 'regulatory regime' in respect of prospecting of

mines and minerals because minerals, both major and minor, are the

wealth of the Nation and their prospecting must be regulated in public

interest. Therefore, mines and minerals must be prospected wisely, so

that optimum revenue can be earned by the State. The word 'regulate'

includes within its meaning not only action prescribed by the statute,

but also embraces within itself the powers incidental to such regulation

including varying or even destroying existing and subsisting contracts.

The case of Dabhol Power Company (supra) can be referred to with

approval in this regard. The issue involved in this case was regarding

the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court to decide disputes between

the Dabhol Power Company and Maharashtra State Electricity Board.

The dispute arose out of the rescission of the power purchase

agreement between the Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra

State Electricity Board, under which a power station was constructed at

Dabhol in the State of Maharashtra in two phases. The import of the

word 'regulate' has been examined as follows:-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">                  'It is thus clear that the word 'regulate' is a word of

                  but also embracing within its fold the powers

                  with an eye single to the public welfare. It would
                  also be seen that the assumption that the power to

 CWP-12664-2017 (O&amp;M) and other connected cases                             52


                 Regulating (Temporary Powers) Act, 1949, was
                 consideration by the Supreme Court <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_15">Section 3(1)</a> read
                 as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_102">                 'The State Government so far as it appears to them to
                 be necessary or expedient for maintaining increasing
                 or securing supplies of essential articles or for
                 arranging       for    their   equitable   distribution    and
                 availability at fair price may, by notified order,
                 provide for regulating or prohibiting the supply,
                 distribution and transfer of essential articles and trade
                 and commodities therein.
</p>
<p id="p_103">                 The dispute which gave rise to the appeals before the
                 Supreme Court pertain to two notified orders passed
                 by the State under <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_16">Section 3(1)</a> purporting to increase
                 electricity rate and the grievance of the appellants
                 was that the State had no authority to change this
                 important term of the contract to the prejudice by
                 taking recourse to <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_17">Section 3(1)</a>.             Repelling this
                 argument the Supreme Court held that:-
</p>
<p id="p_104">                 16. <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_18">Section 3(1)</a> is obviously intended to secure
                 supplies of essential articles and to arrange for their
                 equitable distribution and availability of fair prices.
                 If electrical energy is one of the essential articles
                 mentioned in the Schedule, there can be no difficulty
                 in holding that a notified order can be issued under
                 <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_19">Section 3(1)</a> for regulating the supply of the said
                 energy and making it available at a fair price.
                 Indeed, it is not disputed and cannot be disputed that
                 if electrical energy is produced by a private licensee
                 and is then supplied to the consumers, such a supply

                 would fall within the mischief of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_20">Section 3(1)</a> and the
                 terms on which it can and should be made to the
                 consumers can be regulated by a notified order.
                 There can also be o serious dispute that terms of
                 contract entered into between a private supplier of
                 electrical energy and the consumer could be modified
                 by a notified order. <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_21">Section 3(1)</a> undoubtedly confers
                 power on the State Government to vary and modify
                 contractual terms in respect of the supply or
                 distribution of essential articles. If that be so, on a
                 plain reading of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_22">Section 3(1)</a> it seems very difficult to
                 accept the argument that the supply of electrical
                 energy which is included in <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_23">Section 3(1)</a> if it is made
                 by a private producer should go outside the said
                 section as soon as it is produced by the State
                 Government. The emphasis is not on who produces
                 and supplies, but on the continuance of the equitable
                 distribution and supply of essential articles at fair
                 prices. If the object of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_24">Section 3(1)</a> has in mind is
                 such equitable distribution and availability at fair
                 prices of essential articles, that object would still
                 continue to attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_25">Section 3(1)</a> even
                 though the essential article may be produced by the
                 State and may be supplied by it to the consumers.
                 The words used in <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_26">Section 3(1)</a> are so clear,
                 unambiguous and wide that it would be unreasonable
                 to limit their scope artificially on the ground that by
                 giving effect to the wide language of the section,
                 might reach a result which is not completely
                 harmonious or consistent with the assumed object
                 and purpose of the Act. Indeed, as we have just
                 indicated, if the purpose of the Act is to secure the

                  supply of essential articles at fair prices, it would be
                  irrelevant as to who makes the supply.          What is
                  relevant is to regulate the supply at a fair price.
                  Therefore, we are not prepared to accede to Mr.
                  Setalvad's argument the <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_27">Section 3(1)</a> does not confer
                  on the respondent the power to modify the terms of
                  agreements between it and the appellants.'

</p><p id="p_105">40.         Thus, in exercise of its regulatory powers, the State is

entitled to vary and modify the terms of an existing contract. The

exercise has been undertaken in public interest, so as to rationalize

prospecting of minor minerals. No mala-fides are attributable to the

State. Therefore, the impugned orders are justified on this score as

well.
</p>
<p id="p_106">
</p><p id="p_107">41.         It is also settled that writ Courts rarely interfere with policy

decisions unless a policy suffers from want of authority or is patently

arbitrary, capricious and not informed by reason. The onus is upon the

petitioners to satisfy the conditions referred to and unless they are able

to discharge this burden, the writ Court will not exercise its powers to

set-aside a policy decision.       The petitioners herein have miserably

failed in this regard. Moreover, the Courts are not equipped to examine

the merits and de-merits of different economic policies (procedure of

auction is in the realm economic policy) and therefore, interference in

such a decision can be extremely risky.

</p><p id="p_110">42.               For the aforementioned reasons, we do not find any merit

in these writ petitions and the same are dismissed, however, without

any order as to costs. It is directed that since the petitioners were

litigating before this Court, let they be given one week's time afresh to

exercise their option in terms of the impugned notices.
