                               ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.     These applications arise from the same complaint being

Water Pollution Criminal Case 92/1992, filed by the respondent

no.2-Gujrarat Pollution Control Board (hereinafter to be referred to

as "GPCB) against accused no.1 Company, its Directors and other

personnel. With the consent of the parties, both these applications

are taken up for hearing jointly.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    The facts being common and the applications being preferred

by a Chairman and 2 Directors of the company, the facts are taken

from CR.M.A. 4284/2008.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    This application is filed by the 2 Directors of the accused no.1

company, whereas the other application being CR.M.A. 4285/2008

is filed by the Chairman of the accused no.1 company. Both these

applications are filed under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> for quashing of Water

Pollution Criminal Case no.92 of 1992 pending with the Additional

Chief Judicial Magistrate at Gandevi.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    While admitting these applications, interim relief was granted

and now it is reported that the proceedings are stayed as on date in

connections with this Criminal Case.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.    The facts in brief are that Criminal Case came to be

registered against company and its office bearers on 26.02.1992,

wherein on the same day the Magistrate has issued summons upon

the accused persons.      It appears that an application came to be

moved on behalf of accused no.1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 for discharging the

applicants therein, which came to be rejected by a reasoned order

dated 25.01.2008 and the Magistrate Court proceeded to frame

charge against the accused persons.           It is at this stage that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               Page 2 of 17</span>
       R/CR.MA/4284/2008                                        JUDGMENT



present applications are filed for quashing of the Criminal Case.


</p><p id="p_10">6.    Learned Senior Advocate Mr.Parikh appearing with Mr.

Pandya took this Court through the allegations made in the

Criminal Case and submitted that in the entire complaint, though

only mention of the applicant is in paragraph 3, wherein, it appears

that only cause is applicants were Chairman and Directors of the

company, they are arraigned as accused. It is submitted that

nowhere in the complaint any specific allegation is made so as to

consider the applicants to be responsible for day-to-day functioning

of the company or thereby any role is played by applicants in

commission of the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
6.1   It is submitted that previously, against very company,

complaints of similar nature have been filed and in those

complaints    also        the   applicants    were   faced   with   the   same

allegations however, ultimately all the applications have been

discharged from the said complaints. It is therefore submitted that

even in the present case the applications ought to have been

discharged in any case since the present application is for quashing

and that no role is pointed out against applicants the Criminal Case

qua the applicants being quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
6.2   It is submitted that not only the contents of the complaint but

even the evidence recorded at the pre-charge stage do not disclose

any role of any of the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_13">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     Page 3 of 17</span>
</p><p id="p_14">       R/CR.MA/4284/2008                                JUDGMENT




6.3   Learned Senior Advocate referred to the provisions of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water

Act</a> more particularly <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_3">Section 47</a> and submitted that so as to attract

the provisions of <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_4">Section 47</a>, firstly there has to be a specific

allegation that the applicants were responsible for the conduct and

the business of the company and thereafter it was also necessary to

allege that the offence which is alleged to have been committed by

the company was with the consent or connivance of the applicants.

It is submitted that <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_5">Section 47(2)</a> specifically mentions consent or

connivance or any neglect on the part of any Director, Manager,

Secretary or other Officers of the company such as Director,

Manager, Secretary or other Officers would be deemed to be guilty

of that offence but Sub <a href="/doc/328668/" id="a_6">Section 2</a> does not specify a Chairman or a

professional Director to be held vicariously responsible. It is argued

that there appears to specific purpose for not including Chairman

or Professional Directors in this Section as if the provisions of the

Company's Act are referred to within its own under <a href="/doc/116962889/" id="a_7">Section 267</a> of

the Company's Act that provides for appointment of Managing

Director and whole time Director, it also specifies about their

remuneration and therefore, automatic burden of responsibility of

the functioning of the company for which such persons are

appointed as Managing Director of whole time Director. It is

submitted that there is no specific provisions under the Company's

Act with regards to the Chairman.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
6.4   He thereafter drew attention of this Court to the proceeding



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              Page 4 of 17</span>
          R/CR.MA/4284/2008                                      JUDGMENT



in connection with the previous complaints of the similar nature

and submitted that whether this very company and its Directors

were arraigned as an accused for the same kind of allegation. Some

of the Directors had filed applications before this Court for

quashing and the applications in connection with these Directors

has been allowed thereby quashing the proceedings against them.

He specifically draws attention of this Court to the observations

made in CR.M.A. 1678/1990, which was filed by one of the

Professional Directors of this company and submitted that even

before filing of the complaint it was necessary for the board to

gather      certain      basic   information       in   connection   with   the

involvement of any person with the day-to-day affairs of the

company before impleading such person as an accused.


6.5   Learned senior advocate thereafter referred to judgment of

the Apex Court in the case of Sunil Bharti Mittal Vs. Central

Bureau of Investigation, reported in (2015) 4 SCC, 609, to

contend that that when individual is alleged to have committed an

offence along with the company, there has to be sufficient evidence

of his active role along with criminal intent. It is submitted that in

the instant case, there is no specific allegation of any role having

been played by any of the applicants in committing of the offence.

He thereafter relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the

case of Gunmala Sales Private Limited Vs. Anu Mehta &amp; Ors .,

reported in (2015) 1 SCC, 103, to contend that even in the case of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                    Page 5 of 17</span>
       R/CR.MA/4284/2008                                JUDGMENT



attracting vicarious liability of the Director, the basic requirement

is to make specific averment in the complaint that the accused

person, in his capacity as a Director, was in-charge and responsible

for company for the conduct of his absence.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
6.6   Learned Senior Advocate lastly submitted that in any case of

the matter, it is only the Chairman and the Professional Directors

who are before the Court and all the three of them are now senior

citizens, eighty years of age and therefore, no useful purpose will

be served in prosecuting them when the company and the other

Directors who are responsible for managing the affairs of the

company which is already before the Court of the Magistrate. It is

further submitted that considering the nature of allegations being

pollution in environment, the applicants would volunteer to make

any financial contribution.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">7.    As against this, learned advocate Mr. Vaibhav Vyas appearing

for the GPCB strongly opposed the applicants and contended that

from the allegations made in the complaint there is no doubt that

the company was indulging in an activity which was causing water

pollution and therefore, polluting not only the river but also the

earth and the aquatic life.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
7.1   It is submitted that the paragraph 3 of the complaint is very

specific and that it is specifically alleged that the accused no.2 (an

applicant herein) is the Chairman and others are the Directors and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                              Page 6 of 17</span>
        R/CR.MA/4284/2008                              JUDGMENT



all of them are responsible for the conduct of the business and

administration. He thereafter submitted that in each of the

paragraphs of the complaint allegations are made that all the

accused are jointly responsible for the offence.


7.2   He specifically drew attention of this Court to paragraph 3, 7,

12 and 13 and submitted that the applicants are also responsible

for causing pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
7.3   It is vehemently submitted that there is strong case against

applicants more particularly when the company and the present

applicants were also arraigned as an accused in Criminal Case of

same nature filed by GPCB in previous years for discharge of

effluents.     It is submitted that allegations are made in the

complaint that though the company was granted consent to operate

however, such consent was an conditional one and it was the

responsibility of all the concerned including the applicants that no

breach of such condition is committed. The fact that despite it

being brought to the knowledge of the accused persons still the

accused persons including applicants continue to cause pollution

by discharging the affluent in breach of the condition and

therefore, the case of the applicants is clearly covered under

<a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_8">Section 47(2)</a> as the consent/ connivance of the applicants as is

required to be presumed in view of their continuing to commit the

offence of the same nature.
</p>

7.4   In respect to the contention of the applications that in

previous occasion when the Criminal Case against applicants were

filed of same nature and the Court has discharged them by

reasoned orders, learned advocate for the GPCB submits that such

discharge was on a technical ground and that there is a vital

difference in the allegations made in the complaints where the

applicants are discharged as against allegations made in the

present complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
7.5   Learned advocate for the GPCB has heavily relied upon the

judgment of the Apex Court in case of U.P. Pollution Control

Board V/s Dr.Bhupendra Kumar Modi &amp; Anr., reported in

(2009) 2 SCC 147. He drew attention of this Court to paragraphs

6, 7 and 21 of the judgment and to content that there is no need to

give minute details of the role played by the accused persons in the

complaint and even if prima facie allegations are made that would

be sufficient to take the case out of the purview quashing.


7.6          It is lastly submitted that while rejecting the discharged

applications cogent reasons were given by the Magistrate and

therefore no interference is called for. It is further submitted that

previously also the applications of CR.M.A. 4284/2008 had filed the

2751/1992 against this very complaint and was withdrawn and

therefore this Court may not entertain the application.

</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">10.   The perusal of the complaint would reveal that the complaint

is filed under the sanction of the Chairman of the GPCB alleging

that the accused company was discharging polluted water in huge

quantity by an underground drainage line three kilometers long

into the Kopoli Khadi leading to Ambika river. Referring to various

provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_17">Water Act</a> it is alleged that industry is prohibited

from discharging of polluted water, not only that the accused

company which was granted consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_18">Section 25</a>/<a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_19">26</a> of the

Water Act was obliged to apply with the condition of such consent

order but the accused company is not complying with such

conditions and is discharging the polluted water as mentioned

above. It is also alleged that on previous occasion for the same

reason Criminal Case no. 58 of 1988 was filed under <a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_20">Section 33</a> of

the Water Act, thereafter Criminal Case 162 of 1988 and 712 of

1989 were also filed against the accused company and its office

bearers including the applicants. It is also alleged that when the

inspection was carried out on 03.07.1991 and samples of effluents

were collected and cent to the laboratory for its analysis. The

laboratory had reported that the discharge of effluents is in breach

of the condition mentioned in the consent order.

</p><p id="p_30">11.   The Court has perused the relevant paragraphs, particularly

paragraph 3 wherein it is alleged that the accused no.1 is the

company, accused no.2 is the Chairman, accused no.3 Managing

Director (Shri Madhusudan D. Patel, reportedly expired) and

accused no.4 to 11 be Directors and accused no.12 to be

Production Manager, and therefore                      all these accused were

managing and administering the affairs of the company. Thereafter

the perusal of the entire complaint would reveal that no other

specific allegations are made against the applicant except for the

accused no.12, the Production Manager.

witnesses recorded at the pre-charge stage vide exhibit 211 by the

complainant and exhibit 249 by the Senior Environment Scientist of

regards to the role of any of the applicants. <a href="/doc/55287/" id="a_21">Section 47(2)</a> of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                     "28. We are concerned in this case with Directors
            who are not signatories to the cheques. So far as
            Directors are not signatories to the cheques or who are
            not Managing Directors or Joint Managing Directors are
            concerned, it is clear from the conclusions drawn in the
            abovementioned cases that it is necessary to aver in the
            complaint filed under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_23">Section 138</a> read with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_24">Section
            141</a> of NI Act that at the relevant time when the offence
            was committed, the Directors were in charge of and
            were responsible for the conduct of the business of the
            company. This is a basic requirement. There is no
            deemed liability of such Directors. This averment
            assumes importance because it is the basic and
            essential averment which persuades the Magistrate to
            issue process against the Directors. That is why this
            Court in SMS Pharma (1) observed that the question of
            requirement of averments in a complaint has to be
            considered on the basis of provisions contained in
            <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_25">Section 138</a> and <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_26">141</a> of the NI Act read in the light of
            the powers of a Magistrate referred to in Sections 200
            to 204 of the Code which recognise the Magistrate's
            discretion to reject the complaint at the threshold if he
            finds that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding.
            Thus, if this basic averment is missing the Magistrate is

            legally justified in not issuing process. But, here we are
            concerned with the question as to what should be the
            approach of             a High Court when it is dealing with a
            petition filed under Section 482 of the Code for
            quashing           such a complaint against a Director. If this
            averment is there, must the High Court dismiss the
            petition as a rule observing that the trial must go on? Is
            the High Court precluded from looking into other
            circumstances, if any? Inherent power under Section
            482 of the Code is to be invoked to prevent abuse of
            process of any court or otherwise to secure ends of
            justice. Can such fetters be put on the High Court's
            inherent powers? We do not think so.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">14.   The Supreme Court in the case of Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra)

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             "42. No doubt, a corporate entity is an artificial person
             which acts through its officers, directors, managing
             director, chairman etc. If such a company commits an
             offence involving mens rea , it would normally be the
             intent and action of that individual who would act on
             behalf of the company. It would be moreso, when the
             criminal act is that of conspiracy. However, at the same
             time,        it   is    the    cardinal   principle    of   criminal

             the statute specifically provides so.

             commission of an offence on behalf of a company can
             be made accused, along with the company, if there is
             sufficient evidence of his active role coupled with
             criminal intent. Second situation in which he can be
             implicated is in those cases where the statutory regime
             itself attracts the doctrine of vicarious liability, by
             specifically incorporating such a provision.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             44.     When the company is the offendor, vicarious
             liability    of   the   Directors   cannot   be    imputed
             automatically, in the absence of any statutory provision
             to this effect. One such example is <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_27">Section 141</a> of the
             Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In Aneeta Hada,
             (AIR 2012 SC 2795) (supra), the Court noted that if a
             group of persons that guide the business of the
             company have the criminal intent, that would be
             imputed to the body corporate and it is in this
             backdrop, <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_28">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments
             Act has to be understood. Such a position is, therefore,
             because of statutory intendment making it a deeming
             fiction. Here also, the principle of "alter ego", was
             applied only in one direction namely where a group of
             persons that guide the business had criminal intent,
             that is to be imputed to the body corporate and not the
             vice versa . Otherwise, there has to be a specific act
             attributed to the Director or any other person allegedly
             in control and management of the company, to the
             effect that such a person was responsible for the acts
             committed by or on behalf of the company."

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">15.   Considering the aforementioned provision, this Court is of the

deposition of the witnesses, it is coming on record that the

applicants were not even residing or available at the premises on

day-to-day basis and they were residing in Ahmedabad, far away

from place Gandevi. Therefore to presume consent or connivance

to attract <a href="/doc/1821721/" id="a_30">Section 47(2)</a> as argued by the advocate for GPCB,

cannot be accepted. It is a well known principle of law that

vicarious liability is foreign to criminal law.

<p id="p_34">16.   The Court also finds that in the complaint, reference is made

to previous application being CR.M.A. No. 58 of 1988 under

<a href="/doc/1861091/" id="a_31">Section 33</a> of the Water Act, Criminal Case no. 1662 of 1988 and

Criminal Case 712 of 1989. Criminal Case no.1662 of 1988 is on

record at Annexure 'E' and the Court finds that the accused is same

as in the present Criminal Case. It is found that by reasoned order

dated 04.10.2014, the applicants along with the some of the co-

accused have been discharged. In the Criminal Case no.58 of 1988,

one of the accused who was the Director of the company had filed

CR.M.A. 1678 of 1990 for quashing, which came to be allowed by

order dated 11.09.1997 by this Court. In this order it would be

relevant to mention that the Court observed as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">             The complainant could have obtained the necessary

             responsible only because persons like the present

<p id="p_35">17.   The Court also finds that in the complaint being Criminal

Case no. 712 of 1989, wherein, a Professional Director of this very

company had filed CR.M.A.912 of 2000 for quashing and by order

dated 17.01.2002, this Court had quashed the Criminal Case

no.712 of 2018.           From the record, it is appearing that two

applicants of CR.M.A. 4284 of 2008 are the Professional Directors

engaged in their respective activities at Ahmedabad and would not

be held directly responsible for day-to-day functioning of the

company and it administration.

<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">18.   So far as reliance placed by learned advocate for the GPCB

on the judgment in the case of Bhupendrakumar Modi (Supra) is

specific role of the applicant in day-to-day affairs of the decision

making process.       Moreover, in that case the Supreme Court was

examining the case of a Managing Director who was engaged in

day-to-day affairs and decision making of the company and had

therefore set aside the order of the High Court. In the instant case,

as discussed in the proceedings paras, not only in the complaint

but also even from the pre-charge stage evidences recorded,

specific role of the applicants is not coming out on record. In the

opinion of this Court, a mere mention in paragraph 3 that all of the

accused person are responsible for running and administering the

company, in itself would not be sufficient to construe an offence.

Moreover, nothing is on record to suggest that any notice under

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_33">Water Act</a> was specifically addressed to the

Chairman or the Professional Directors, who are the applicants

before this Court. With no such notice on record, the argument of

the GPCB that the applicants continued to commit the breach of

the condition of consent despite issuance of notice as referred in

the complaint, itself cannot be accepted nor the argument of the

GPCB can be accepted that as there are previous offence

registered against the applicants of the very nature in the very

capacity, still the present complaint was registered, meaning

thereby that there is a consent or connivance on part of the

application under <a href="/doc/55287/" id="a_34">Section 47(2)</a> of the Water Act.       As recorded

earlier, the application have been already discharged in the

previous complaints. Moreover, as the complaint is of same nature

and against the same company, criminal proceedings against the

present applicants are also require to be quashed and set aside.


</p><p id="p_38">19.    Lastly, considering the age of the applicants being eighty

years and the offer made on behalf of the applicants to deposit an

amount for a good cause with the complainant Board, this Court is

of the view that the prosecution of the applicants may not be

continued. It is further directed that the Water Pollution Criminal

Case No. 92 of 1992 is quashed and qua the present applicants

namely Shri Arun P.Patel, Shri Maitre B. Harivallabhdas and Smt.
