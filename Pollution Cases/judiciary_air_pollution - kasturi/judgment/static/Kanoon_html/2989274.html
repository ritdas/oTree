 appropriately provisioned slaughter house, they recommended the

 construction of a full-fedged abattoir. This proposal was frst

 initiated in 1968 when an abattoir near Deonar near Chembur was

 constructed. The Bandra slaughter house was demolished in 1973

 and all animal slaughter operations were shifted to the Deonar

 abattoir. The petition says in paragraph 2 that the licensees found it

 difcult to get proper service at Deonar and that the abattoir there

 was going at a loss. Ultimately, after various representations being

 made to improve conditions and to increase efciency, licensees

 including the Petitioners, persuaded the municipal authorities to

 consider their case for permitting slaughter houses outside the

 Deonar abattoir. The Petitioners agree that they were heard by the

 municipal authorities in 1991. Finally, by a communication dated 6th

 April 1991 the municipal authorities informed the Petitioners that

 they were being granted individual licenses to slaughter sheep and

 goats. There were various conditions set out in this communication,

 a copy of which is at Exhibit "A" to the petition.

 this stage itself. We may only note that the averments in the petition

 that this communication of 6th April 1991 itself stated that the

 Deonar abattoir will be closed are entirely incorrect. There is no

 such statement in the letter in question. We feel it best to reproduce

 the communication in full to avoid all ambiguity.

 granted was for three months only up to 3rd August 1991; that it was

<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26"> 12.     The wording of this impugned communication is the starting

 point of Mr Kurle's assault on it. He says that it was never stated at

 the beginning, i.e., at the time of issuance of the licences on 6th

 April 1991 that this permission was only for three months and that it

 was experimental. No such condition could have been added or

 imputed later. The Petitioners and the licensees having complied

 with all other terms and conditions, the unilateral revocation and

 cancellation of licenses is, in his submission manifestly arbitrary,

 unfair, discriminatory and violative of principles of natural justice

 since no hearing was aforded to the Petitioners.

 permission and the revocation in July 1991. This was at the time

 when the present Petition had been dismissed for default. A

 reference is also made in this judgment to certain Supreme Court

 decisions to which we will presently turn. What is, however,

 important is that a similar Writ Petition appears to have been fled

 by the All Maharashra Khatik Association being Writ Petition No.

 1394 of 2014, in which following the Supreme Court decision in

 Laxmi Narain Modi v Union of India (Writ Petition (C) No. 309 of

 2015) of 27th August 2013, the municipal authorities were ordered

 not to issue licences for slaughter of animals at any place other than

 recognised slaughter or licensed slaughter houses.

 of 2001 and contends that the Petitioners are by no stretch of the

 imagination running illegal slaughter houses. He submits that so

 long as the Petitioners are willing to abide by all conditions including

 as to hygiene and disposal, there is no reason to abruptly discontinue

 the licences granted. Mr Kurle invites our attention to Sections 399

 and 403 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888 ("MMC

</p><p id="p_30"> 15.       Although Mr Kurle has attempted to persuade us on the basis

 of certain statistics collated, we do not believe this would be helpful

 in assisting a challenge mounted invoking a constitutional right or

 entitlement. Similarly, a generalised statement that the Deonar

 abattoir is bad or unhygienic or that there is no adverse incident

 reported is, in our view, neither here nor there.



</p><p id="p_31"> 16.       The limited conspectus of this challenge is, therefore, to the

 withdrawal of the letter of 20th July 1991. At this stage we review

 previous orders. It appears that the Petition was admitted on 8th

 August 1991 and interim relief granted. An appeal against the

 interim order failed. The 3rd Respondent, Jeevan Jagruti Trust,

 sought impleadment and this was allowed after which it fled the

 Motion for interim reliefs. There was some mistake in the order

 made in the Motion in the sense that while dismissing the Motion

 the order referenced the Writ Petition although the Writ Petition

 was not on board. All this was clarifed by the Division Bench by an

 order of 28th February 2003. We need say nothing further in that

 regard. The papers then had to be reconstructed as passage of time

 had damaged the record considerably. This exercise was completed

 by March 2018. The matter was listed periodically. This Court

 by a Bench of which one of us (SC Dharmadhikari J) was a member.

 At that time the present Petition was listed with the Ajay Marathe

 PIL as also All Maharashtra Khatik Association applications. The

 attempt in that order was to more accurately focus the attention of

 all concerned on the relevant statutory provisions and, in that

 context, called for further Afdavits. It would be proftable at this

 stage to reproduce that order for the simple reason that it provides a

 statutory framework and this will be our guide in the following

 judgment as well.

         noticed is that the enactments like the Mumbai Municipal
         Corporation Act, 1888 ("MMC Act" for short), which is a
         pre-constitutional enactment, has now inserted provisions

         or a licensed slaughter-house.

         under the caption "Regulation of Factories, Trades, etc.,
         which mandate that certain articles or animals not to be
         kept and certain trades, processes and operations not to be

         whereunder the Municipal Corporation has to make
         extensive arrangements to set up its own markets. By
         Section 398, which appears under the caption
         "Maintenance and Regulation of Markets and Slaughter-
         houses", which was renumbered by Bombay Act 54 of 1955,
         sub-section (1) thereof says very clearly that all markets and
         slaughter-houses which belong to or are maintained by the
         Corporation shall be called "municipal markets" or
         "municipal slaughter houses". All other markets and
         slaughter-houses shall be deemed to be private. Section 399
         provides for new municipal markets and slaughter-houses,
         and then Section 400 provides for closure of municipal
         markets and slaughter-houses. The Commissioner of the
         Municipal Corporation, with the sanction of the
         Corporation and of the State Government, at any time,
         close any municipal market or slaughter-house, and the
         premises occupied for any market or slaughter-house so
         closed may be disposed of as the property of the
         Corporation.

 denies that the Petitioners have a right of any kind to any licence or

 permission to slaughter goats or sheep attached to their respective

 shops. He submits that there is no case made out for the grant of any

 relief. He also complains of a delay in fling the Petition. In

 paragraph 7 at page 60B, Mr Padalkar states that 6th April 1991

 permission was purely temporary and on an experimental basis. It

 was done in order to fnd out whether the scheme of granting such

 permissions would work successfully without risk or danger to

 public safety and health. He accepts that this kind of a permission

 ran contrary to well-settled and established standing practice since

 the time the Deonar abattoir was commissioned, i.e. that since that

 time there has been a policy in place not to grant any such private

 slaughter chamber permission to any person. His submission is that

 the very object of establishing the abattoir and spending (at that

 time) nearly Rs. 5 crores on it was in the interest of public safety and

 health especially in a densely populated congested metropolitan city

 such as Mumbai. The Deonar abattoir was designed to allow

 appropriate medical examination by veterinary doctors of the

 animals before slaughter and of the bodies after slaughter so that all

 of this could be done conveniently in one place. It was also found

 necessary to concentrate all these activities in a single facility to be

 better able to control hygiene and to ensure that the entire process

 and the meat products were disease free. The object was also to

 prevent unauthorised slaughter at diferent places by private persons

 or agencies, to prevent the private and unauthorised transportation

 of animals for slaughter into the city and to ensure that the product

 was ft for human consumption. In paragraph 8 Mr Paladkar submits

 that it is very difcult to control and supervise slaughter at diferent

 places. If the Petition is accepted, the municipal authorities would

 have to supervise and control 150 to 189 locations and perhaps more

 and would not be able to provide the necessary veterinary

 assistance. He submits that there are always malpractice going on.

 fled a Notice of Motion No. 367 of 2000 and this was ultimately

 allowed on 28th February 2003, and which was the order of

 restoration of the Writ Petition (as mentioned above). He reiterates

 in paragraph 6 that MCGM has not stopped the business of the

 Petitioner members nor revoked, suspended or cancel their licenses

 to sell mutton obtained from the slaughter at the Deonar Abattoir.

 He then speaks about the statutory obligations of the MCGM and

 says that the Respondents have only changed the method of

 slaughtering in the interest of hygiene, civic sanitation and public

 health. There are details about these that are set out in the afdavit

 in paragraph 6 that are not immediately necessary. The substance of

 this averment is that there is no impact on the likelihood of the

 Petitioner's members at all. Any rights that the Respondents

 claimed must be weighed and balanced against the competing

 requirement of safeguarding public health, a statutory obligation

 cast on the MCGM. Finally he points out that the continuance of

 mentions several orders of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board

 and the National Green Tribunal and norms of the Bureau of Indian

 of this afdavit is to suggest that because the Deonar Abattoir is

 allegedly inadequate or substandard and allegedly because the

 no issues of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation can or do

</p><p id="p_66"> 34.      He is at pains to point out that the MCGM's decision not to

 continue that temporary experiment is not vulnerable. By its very

 nature the temporary experimental permission created no right and

 the non-extension of it is therefore not violative of any legally

 enforceable right let alone any fundamental right. The Petitioner

 and its members are at liberty to obtain licenses to vend mutton and

 other meat products. Their source of livelihood is in no way

 curtailed. There is no fundamental right of the nature claimed i.e.

 that the Petitioner and its members are limited to selling only those

 meat products that they generate from in-house slaughter in

 slaughter chambers attached to their respective shops. In fact no

 such fundamental right is specifcally pointed out and it is only

 generally alleged that there is a violation of the Petitioner's right to

 livelihood. Once it is demonstrated that the right to livelihood is not

 in fact curtailed in the slightest, the petition must necessarily fail.

 grant a permission in violation of a contrary to statutory restrictions,

 policies or norms. It is for this reason that the permissions were

 strictly temporary and experimental. Once it was found that there

 continuance posed a danger to public health, public safety,

 sanitation and public hygiene, there would be no question of

 continuing those licenses, because to do so would have involved the

 violation by a statutory corporation of various statutes including its

 governing and constituting statute. The MCGM is of course bound

 by the provisions of MMC Act 1888 and he frst drew our attention

 He points out that in 1970s the original Abattoir was at Bandra

 which is found to be unsuitable and therefore the Deonar Abattoir

 proposal came to be made. As a practicality he states that it is not

 possible for the MCGM to discharge its statutory function if the

 licensed Butchers/Vendors are scattered across the city in large

 numbers. Where they are in one place, then that statutory purpose

 is achieved. He also points out that there is no assertion that the

 Petitioners are indeed compliant with all these regulations or are

 able to comply with them. There is not even an averment and there

 can be no fundamental right to this kind of a trade being done in a

                  nuisance by way of foul smell due to improper
                  handling. It is, therefore, necessary that these
                  units should install pollution control devices

                  standards. Further, it was stated that the

                  utilisation of waste to reduce environmental
                  problems and to maintain hygienic conditions.
                  It is also pointed out that most of the
                  slaughterhouses in the country are very old
                  and operate without basic amenities such as
                  proper fooring, water supply, ventilation, etc.,

 completely correct in his submissions. The law of the land, as

 contrary to the mandate of the statutes as noted above, but explicitly

 and directly in violation of the orders of the Supreme Court (which

 mandated immediate statutory conformity and compliance). To say,

 therefore, as the Petitioners before us do, that the withdrawal of the

 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd vs Wednesbury Corporation.10

 This is the well-known test of 'Wednesbury unreasonableness', and

 it has been steadily applied by our courts. Now whether one

 considers the Wednesbury unreasonableness test or the doctrine of

 proportionality really makes little diference. It is hard to conceive of

 a situation that fails one standard but not the other. The

 fundamental test is that for a challenge to succeed the assailed

 decision must be so unreasonable that no rational person could have

 ever arrived at it. On its own, this carries a secondary requirement:

 there must be a facial demonstration of perversity and Wednesbury

 unreasonableness failure. If one is required to go through some

 convoluted process of reasoning, then there can simply be no

 question of perversity.

 principles of Wednesbury unreasonableness and the doctrine of

 circumstances and have diferent origins. There is an excellent

 Wednesbury on the Terminal Decline?"11 After examining the

 jurisprudential history, the author concludes:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_109">         No demise of Wednesbury

         What emerges from all this, is that in the exercise of the
         power of judicial review in matters concerning human rights
         and fundamental freedoms the intensity of the review is
         greater and there is a lowering of the threshold of
         unreasonableness.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">         The Wednesbury test, long established as a ground of
         judicial review, will be applicable in examining the validity
         of the exercise of administrative discretion. It is not
         apposite in cases of constitutional review. In UK, as there
         was no constitutional review, the Wednesbury test alone was
         applicable; proportionality was not. Proportionality as a
         ground of judicial review in UK, was frst adverted to by
         Lord Diplock in CCSU v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985
         AC 374]. But it sufered a setback in <a href="/doc/861688/" id="a_50">R. v. Home Secy</a>., ex p
         Brind. This was primarily because of the apprehension that
         the application of the doctrine of proportionality would
         convert judicial review into a merits review or an appeal.</blockquote><p id="p_203">
</p><p id="p_204">         But, later while dealing with cases involving human rights,
         the courts in UK adopted tests closely similar to
         proportionality. Now with the passing of the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_51">Human Rights
         Act</a>, proportionality as a ground of review is invoked and
         applied as in other jurisdictions, when the case is one which
         involves human/fundamental rights. It is also true that all
         the tests will produce the same result in many situations. It
         needs to be emphasised that they are fexible doctrines
         depending on the subject-matter and often upon value

         In this background it is submitted that it will be quite
         inappropriate to speak of the decline or demise of the
         Wednesbury test. Certain observations, however, appear to
         require some explanation. The observations of Lord Slynn
         in Alconbury case [2003 2 AC 295] should not be taken and
         read out of context. So also the observation of Lord Cooke

         retrogressive23. Wednesbury is thought to be retrogressive
         only insofar as it suggested degrees of unreasonableness and
         that only an extreme degree will nullify the action. But as
         Lord Cooke himself hastens to add "the depth of judicial
         review and the deference due to administrative discretion
         vary with the subject-matter". If that be the correct position
         then it is natural and inevitable that the threshold of
         unreasonableness justifying judicial intervention and
         invalidation of the impugned act also varies.

         It is submitted that Lord Steyn's enunciation of the law on
         this aspect in Ex p Daly with which all the other Law Lords
         including Lord Cooke agreed and which is now accepted
         and followed lays down the correct legal position.

         Is Wednesbury redundant?
</p>
<p id="p_207">         The further question is whether the doctrine of
         proportionality has subsumed the test of Wednesbury
         reasonableness and rendered it redundant. A close study
         and analysis has to yield a negative answer. As stated the
         proportionality test is a more intense test than Wednesbury,
         both examining reasonableness. While Wednesbury applies
         to    review      of     administrative    action/discretion,
         proportionality is applied to test measures, administrative
         or legislative, which interfere with human rights and

         fundamental freedoms and to evaluate the desirability and
         necessity and sufciency of such interfering measures.

         de Smith, Woolf &amp; Jowell say that the intensity of review
         under the principle of proportionality need not necessarily
         eliminate or even reduce the reserve under the Wednesbury
         test in relation to interference with the merits of a decision.
         Judicial exercise applying the Wednesbury test or the
         proportionality test remains in the nature of a review
         and not an appeal. Proportionality is a more focused and
         enhanced form of perversity which is a part of
         Wednesbury unreasonableness. Outside the feld of
         human rights, proportionality is normally not applied.
         The margin of appreciation in proportionality is not
         very diferent from the threshold under the Wednesbury
         formulation. It varies according to the subject-matter and
         the context. The application of the doctrine of
         proportionality does not necessarily imply the
         abandonment of the Wednesbury principles appropriate
         to judicial review of administrative discretion. In a very
         general sense proportionality is a part and aspect of
         Wednesbury.
</p>
<p id="p_208">         Sir John Laws says that it is a misleading notion that
         Wednesbury can only represent a monolithic standard of
         review and points out that nothing in Lord Greene's classic
         judgment is in the least monolithic. Proportionality and
         Wednesbury need not be institutionalised in rigid terms and
         proportionality need not be a separate category to have
         independent life.

<p id="p_209">         It is submitted that the doctrine of proportionality has not

         great deal of common ground. For example, the

         revocation of a trader's licence would be amenable to a
         successful challenge by judicial review on the ground of
         proportionality as easily as on unreasonableness. Then
         again, if a penalty of life imprisonment was given for an
         ordinary trafc ofence, it would be so outrageous in its
         defance of logic--hence irrational and unreasonable in the
         Wednesbury sense. It would also be grossly disproportionate.
         Such action would be vulnerable to judicial intervention
         both on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness as also
         proportionality. There are also cases in which the
         appropriate test for determining the validity of an impugned
         action will be the Wednesbury test and proportionality will
         not arise.
