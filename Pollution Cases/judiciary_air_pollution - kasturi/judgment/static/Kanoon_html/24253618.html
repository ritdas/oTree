                           ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">        Petitioner/accused No.2 in this petition has sought to

quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.85/2014 on the file of

learned Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, T.Narasipura, for the

alleged offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_1">sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_2">25</a> of the

Water Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Pollution Control Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter

referred to as the "<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_4">Water Act</a>") punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_5">sections 43</a> &amp;

<a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_6">44</a> of the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">        2.   The material allegations against the petitioner is

that, petitioner/accused No.1 is a local body established in

accordance with the provisions of the Karnataka Municipality Act,

1964 and accused No.2 is working as Chief Officer of accused

No.1.    The accused are under legal obligation to provide UGD

system and to treat the sewage effluent generated within the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>


limits of Town Panchayat before discharging into Kabini river

water, in order to maintain the wholesomeness of water, in

accordance with the provisions of the Karnataka Municipality Act

of 1964 and <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_7">sections 24</a>, <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_8">25</a> and <a href="/doc/116785/" id="a_9">26</a> of the Water Act.


</p><p id="p_4">     3(i)   The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board ("KSPC

Board" for short) - respondent herein filed a complaint under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">section 200</a> Cr.P.C., seeking action against Town Panchayat,

T.Narasipura (accused No.1) and petitioner herein (accused

No.2) alleging that, pursuant to the various complaints received

by the respondent on pollution of Kabini River due to discharge

of untreated sewage resulting in pollution of river water

adversely   affecting   the    public   health,   the   Assistant

Environmental Officer of the Regional Officer conducted the

inspection on 28.11.2012 and after giving notice to accused

No.2, mahazar was conducted.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     (ii) During the mahazar, samples were drawn near the new

bridge i.e., from upstream of sewage confluence point of Kabini

river, sewage discharged to Kabini river near new bridge and

downstream of sewage confluence point of Kabini river and were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>


sent to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Regional

Laboratory, Mysore for analysis.     The analysis report received

from the State Board Analyst on 10.12.2012 disclosed that the

levels of suspended solids and BOD were not confirming to the

standards stipulated by the Board. It was observed that sewage

and sullage generated from the Town Panchayat area was being

discharged through open drains into Kabini River area near the

new bridge and polluting the river water and causing health

hazard which is the main source of drinking water to the town

panchayat and other downstream villages. As a result, accused

have committed an offence contravening the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_11">Sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_12">25</a> of the Water Act.       Thus the complainant

sought prosecution of petitioner/accused No.2 and accused No.1

for the above offences punishable under <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_13">sections 43</a> and <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_14">44</a> of

the Water Act.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">        4.     Learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offences

and issued summons to the petitioner/accused No.2 and accused

No.1.        The impugned order of summons and initiation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      5</span>


proceedings against the petitioner herein (accused No.2) have

been questioned before this court on the following grounds:-

</p><p id="p_9">     (i)     The    order   taking       cognizance   and   issuance    of

summons by learned Magistrate is beyond the facts and

circumstances of the case and the law applicable to the facts of

the case;
</p>
<p id="p_10">     (ii)    Petitioner being a public servant has discharged his

duties within the framework of duties and responsibilities

entrusted    to    him   under   the     Act;   and   therefore,   learned

Magistrate was bound by <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_15">section 197</a> of Cr.P.C., not to take

cognizance of the above offences without the previous sanction

of the competent authority.          The complaint against the Town

Panchayat is not preceded with a sanction;

</p><p id="p_11">     (iii)   The allegations made in the complaint pertains to

flow of sewage into the river and failure of accused in taking

steps to construct Under Ground Drainage system and Sewage

Treatment Plant for proper disposal of sewage generated within

the limits of Town Panchayat.          Primarily, construction of Under

Ground Drainage system and Sewage Treatment Plant is a duty

vested with Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>


</p><p id="p_12">      (iv)   The officers of Town Panchayat have no power to

exercise any control over the storm water drains or flow of

sewage through the same;
</p>
<p id="p_13">      (v)    The pollutants are being discharged into Kabini river

through other villages and since pollution had been caused by

other villages, not coming under jurisdiction of accused No.1 -

Town Panchayath, as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, "polluter alone" is liable to be prosecuted;

</p><p id="p_14">      (vi)   Petitioner/accused No.2 cannot be held liable for

non-implementation of any projects envisaged by the State even

if it resulted in violation of any rule of law;

</p><p id="p_15">      (vii) Petitioner/accused No.2 cannot be held vicariously

liable for the acts, commission or omission of the Town

Panchayat;
</p>
<p id="p_16">      (viii) The order of taking cognizance does not indicate

application of mind by learned Magistrate.        Likewise, order of

issuance of process also does not indicate subjective satisfaction

of learned Magistrate about the sufficient ground for issue of

process;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span><p id="p_17">


</p><p id="p_18">      (ix) <a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_16">Section 48</a> of the Water Act creates legal bar on

instituting a complaint against petitioner as alleged offences

were committed without his knowledge;
</p>
<p id="p_19">      (x)    In order to attract provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_17">sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_18">25</a>

of the Water Act, the accused should have knowingly caused or

permitted any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter directly

into any stream or well. In the absence of any material to show

that the petitioner herein has knowingly caused or permitted

discharge of the pollutants in the river, action initiated against

petitioner is impermissible and unsustainable;

</p><p id="p_20">      (xi)   Respondent has failed to exercise power under

section 17 of the Water Act by insisting the Town Panchayath,

T.Narasipura to insist on sewerage disposal mechanism; and

</p><p id="p_21">      (xii) Respondent has ample powers as contemplated

under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_19">section 18</a> of the Water Act to issue necessary directions

or had more than ample powers as contemplated under <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_20">section

23</a> of the Water Act to inspect the polluting areas and to prevent

the situation.   Respondent having failed to perform its duties

cannot be permitted to prosecute the petitioner.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   8</span>


</p><p id="p_22">      5.    Learned counsel appearing for the        petitioner has

argued in line with the above contentions and has emphasized

that that the prosecution of the petitioner without prior sanction

under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_21">section 197</a> Cr.P.C. and section 283 of Karnataka

Municipalities Act, 1964 ("Act" for short) is illegal, untenable and

impermissible. Learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the

penal provisions, but not of alleged violation under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_22">sections 24</a>

and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_23">25</a> of the Water Act.      As such, learned Magistrate had no

jurisdiction to proceed against the petitioner.    The allegations

made in the complaint, if read in entirety, would disclose that

the alleged offences were committed by the Department.

Petitioner herein was not holding the responsible position in the

Department as on the date of alleged commission of offences.

Hence, implication of present petitioner for the alleged offences

is wholly illegal and is liable to be quashed.


</p><p id="p_23">      6.    Placing reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme court in <a href="/doc/1514672/" id="a_24">M.C.Mehta vs. Kamal Nath and Others</a>, (2002)

3 SCC 653, learned Counsel has emphasized that the averments

made in the complaint and the material produced in support
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  9</span>


thereof clearly goes to show that the pollutants are being

discharged into the Kabini river by other villages which fact is

known    to   complainant/respondent.      Complainant     itself   is

empowered under the Act to take action against the persons and

agencies which cause pollution of water bodies.             Hon'ble

Supreme Court has laid down "Polluter Pays" principle and in

view of the said proposition of law, once the activity carried on is

found hazardous or inherently dangerous, only the person

carrying on such activity is liable to make good the loss caused

to any other person by his activity irrespective of the fact

whether he took reasonable care while carrying on his activity.

In view of the above position, the absolute liability for harm to

the environment extends not only to compensate the victims of

pollution but also the cost of restoring the environment of the

damaged environment is on the polluter and under the said

circumstances, the prosecution instituted against the petitioner

is wholly illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Karnataka

Municipalities Act as well as <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_25">Water Act</a>, 1974.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                10</span>


</p><p id="p_24">     7(i)   Meeting   this   argument,     learned   counsel   for

respondent has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in V.C.CHINNAPPA GOUDAR vs. KARNATAKA

STATE POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD &amp; Another               in Criminal

Appeal No.755/2010 dated 10.3.2015 and submitted that the

controversy relating to requirement of sanction for prosecution

of violation of provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_26">Water Act</a> is set at rest by the

Hon'ble Apex Court in the above decision and it is held that,

"There is no specific provision providing for any sanction to be

secured for proceeding against a public servant under the 1974

Act. In the light of the said statutory prescription contained in

<a href="/doc/1577175/" id="a_27">section 48</a>, there is no scope for invoking <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_28">section 197</a> Cr.P.C.,

even though the accused are public servants."

</p><p id="p_25">     (ii)   Further, referring to section 283 of the Karnataka

Municipality Act, learned counsel has emphasized that, in view of

specific allegations made against the petitioner that petitioner

being the public servant, has failed to discharge the obligation

cast on him under the Karnataka Municipality Act, even the

provisions of section 283 of Karnataka Municipality Act is not

applicable to the facts of the case.     In other words, it is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                  11</span>


submission     of   learned   counsel   for   respondent        that   the

requirement of previous sanction of the Municipal Council under

section 283 of Karnataka Municipality Act is contemplated only

when the Municipal Council or any of its officers are sought to be

prosecuted in respect of the act done by them in good faith or

intended to be done under the Karnataka Municipality Act or any

rule or regulation made thereunder.           Since the petitioner is

facing accusations of failure to prevent the pollutants entering

into the lakes and water bodies, requirement of section 283 of

Karnataka Municipality Act is also required under the instant set

of facts.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      (iii)   Further, referring to the provisions of sections 193,

194, 197, 199, 201 and 203 the Karnataka Municipalities Act,

1964 learned counsel submitted that accused are under legal

obligation to provide UGD system and to treat the sewage

effluent generated within the limits of Town Panchayat before

discharging into Kabini river water, in accordance with the

provisions of the Karnataka Municipalities Act under the said

circumstances,      Town   Panchayat    having    failed   to    prevent

discharge of sewage and sullage effluent into Kabini river, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  12</span>


spite of directions issued by the complainant/KSPC Board,

accused No.1 -Town Panchayat and its officers are liable to face

prosecution for violation of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_29">sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_30">25</a> of the Water Act

and thus, sought to dismiss the petitions.


</p><p id="p_27">      8.    I have bestowed my careful thought to the rival

contentions urged at the Bar with reference to the relevant

provisions of law and the decisions relied on by the respective

counsels.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">      9.    The    material    allegations   leveled   against    the

petitioner is that the Town Panchayath, T.Narasipura and its

officials failed to prevent pollution of Kabini river. In the light of

these allegations, the questions that arises for consideration are,

            (1)    Whether failure of accused No.1 -
</p><p id="p_30">            Town Panchayat, T.Narasipura, to prevent
            the pollutants to enter into Kabini river,
            would constitute violation of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_31">sections 24</a> and
            <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_32">25</a> of the Water Act?
</p><p id="p_31">            (2)    Whether the petitioner could be held
            vicariously liable for the acts of commission
            and omission of accused No.1?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 13</span><p id="p_32">


</p><p id="p_33">     10.   <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_33">Section 24</a> of the Water Act deals with prohibition on

use of stream or well for disposal of polluting matter, etc.   It

reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        24. Prohibition on use of stream or well for
        disposal of polluting matter, etc.-- (1) Subject

It is significant to note that the expression used in <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_37">section 24</a>

that, "no person shall knowingly cause or permit any poisonous,

noxious or polluting matter determining in accordance with such

standard as may be laid down by the State Board to enter into

any stream or well or sewer or on land". It is argued, that

petitioner has not caused or permitted any such pollutants to

enter into the lakes and there being no such allegations in the

complaint, the very invocation of provisions of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_38">sections 24</a> and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                 <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_39">18</a></span>


<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_40">25</a> of the Water Act is not tenable.         In other words, the

contention of learned counsel appearing for petitioner is that,

mere failure to prevent the pollution of water bodies does not fall

within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_41">section 24</a> or <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_42">section 25</a> of the Water Act.

Referring to <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_43">section 17</a> of the Water Act, learned counsel has

emphasized that, in view of said provision, inspection of sewage

or trade effluents and taking action for prevention, control or

abatement of discharges of waste into streams or wells under

<a href="/doc/355304/" id="a_44">section 17(1)(l)</a> of the Water Act is the essential function of

respondent - KSPC Board.      In view of the said provision, the

respondent - KSPC Board cannot shift the burden on accused

No.1 - Town Panchayat and on that pretext, the respondent -

KSPC Board having failed to prevent the pollution of the

aforesaid lakes, cannot proceed against Town Panchayat.

if the averments made in the complaint and the allegations made

therein are perused, the specific case of the respondent - KSPC

Board is that, accused No.1 - Board and its officials have failed

to discharge the obligation cast on them under the various

provisions of the Act.      Undeniably, in view of the above

provisions, all drains and sewers having vested with the Town

Panchayat and there being clear allegations that the polluting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                 24</span>


material having been let into the river through these sewers or

drains, even though the pollutants are let into the drains by

various other agencies like other villages not coming under Town

Panchayat of T.Narasipura, yet on account of failure of Town

Panchayat, T.Narasipura to prevent the flow of pollutants into

the Kabini river, it has to be held that accused No.1 - Town

Panchayat has knowingly permitted the pollutants to enter into

Kabini river thereby making out contravention of <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_53">sections 24</a> and

<a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_54">25</a> of the Water Act.       In the light of these discussions, the

contention urged by learned counsel for petitioners that accused

No.1 - Town Panchayath having not caused or permitted

pollutants to enter into the lakes cannot be prosecuted under

<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_55">sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_56">25</a> of the Water Act is liable to be rejected and it

against accused No.2 is that he has committed an offence

useful to refer to a recent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/156383456/" id="a_63">SHIV KUMAR JATIA vs. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI</a> in Criminal

Appeal No.1263/2019 (arising out of S.L.P.(Crl.) No.8008/2018

decided on 23.08.2019. In the said case, a case was registered

for the offence under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_64">sections 336</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_65">338</a> read with 32 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_66">IPC</a>

based on the information that one Gaurav Rishi got admitted in

Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, vide MLC No.2240 of 2013 with the

alleged history of fall from stairs. On investigation, it was found

that the injured Gaurav Rishi fell from the terrace of 6th floor to

4th floor of the hotel i.e., Hyatt Regency.          The case of

prosecution was that terrace was dark and there was no light on

the terrace and hotel staff did not stop them from going there.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                        27</span>


Precisely it is the allegation that there was a lapse on the part of

hotel management in taking safety measures for the guests who

are allowed to terrace area.            The Trial Court having issued

summons to the appellants, the same was sought to be quashed

before the High Court of Delhi under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_67">section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. In

the said proceedings, the High Court considered the case as if

the investigation was pending and proceeded on the basis that,

to attract the ingredients of <a href="/doc/175699/" id="a_68">section 336</a> of IPC, an act done

rashly and negligently, to endanger human life or personal

safety are essential and to attract <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_69">section 338</a> of IPC, in addition

to the above said acts, additional ingredients of grievous hurt

should be alleged and proved. The appellant in the above case

was sued on the ground that he was holding the position of the

Managing Director. In the absence of any specific allegations of

negligence with criminal intent, in that context, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in para 27 and 29 has observed as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">            27.   The      liability    of        the        Directors/the
            controlling   authorities        of    company,         in   a
            corporate     criminal     liability        is    elaborately
            considered by this Court in the case of Sunil
            Bharti Mittal.     In the aforesaid case, while
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                        28</span>

considering     the     circumstances        when
Director/person in charge of the affairs of the
company can also be prosecuted, when the
company is an accused person, this Court has
held, a corporate entity is an artificial person
which acts through its officers, Directors,
Managing Director, Chairman, etc.         If such a
company commits an offence involving mens
rea, it would normally be the intent and action
of that individual who would act on behalf of
the company. At the same time it is observed
that it is the cardinal principle of criminal
jurisprudence   that   there    is   no   vicarious
liability unless the Statute specifically provides
for.   It is further held by this Court, an
individual    who      has     perpetrated     the
commission of an offence on behalf of the
company can be made an accused, along with
the company, if there is sufficient evidence of
his active role coupled with criminal intent.
</blockquote><p id="p_81">Further it is also held that an individual can be
implicated in those cases where statutory
regime itself attracts the doctrine of vicarious
liability, by specifically incorporating such a
provision.
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><p id="p_83">29.    By applying the ratio laid down by this
Court in the case of Sunil Bharti Mittal it is
clear that an individual either as a Director or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                          29</span>

a Managing Director or Chairman of the
company can be made as accused, along with
the   company,     only      if   there   is   sufficient
material to prove his active role coupled with
the criminal intent. Further the criminal intent
alleged must have direct nexus with the
accused.      Further in the case of <a href="/doc/485334/" id="a_70">Maksud
Saiyed vs. State of Gujarat &amp; Ors</a>. this court
has   examined         the    vicarious    liability   of
Directors for the charges leveled against the
Company.       In the aforesaid judgment this
Court has held that,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_71"> the Penal Code</a> does not
contain any provision for attaching vicarious
liability on the part of the Managing Director
or the Directors of the company, when the
accused is a Company, when the accused is a
Company. It is held that vicarious liability of
the Managing Director and Director would
arise provided any provision exists in that
behalf in the Statute.        It is further held that
Statutes indisputably must provide fixing such
vicarious liability. It is also held that, even for
the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of
the complainant to make requisite allegations
which would attract the provisions constituting
vicarious liability.

</p><p id="p_85">      17.    The principles laid down in the above decision, in my

view, squarely apply to the facts of the case. Petitioner/accused

No.2 being the Chief Officer of Town Panchayath/accused No.1 is

liable to be prosecuted for the alleged offences. As a result,

petitioner/accused No.2 is liable for prosecution for the alleged

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_72">sections 24</a> and <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_73">25</a> of the Water

Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_74">Pollution Control Act</a>, 1974 punishable under
