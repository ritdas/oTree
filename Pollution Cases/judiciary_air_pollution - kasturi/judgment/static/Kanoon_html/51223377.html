petitioner No.1 applied to the respondent for grant of
consent in both the Acts submitting online application
No.     64201         dated    05.08.2013.         Thereupon,         the

dated 24.12.2013, which is valid upto 31.10.2014.
Thus, on the inspection-dates i.e. 03.02.2014 and
19.04.2014, the factory is being run on valid consent.
Prior        to   the    said     consent,           petitioner      No.1     had
obtained permission under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_23">Water Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_24">Air

acknowledged that its officers inspected the factory
on 31.07.2014 and found that ETP has been installed
of proper capacity and units, that ETP is found in
operation and that treated effluent water is being
reused for washing and in toilets. It is submitted that
the      respondent             took      the      Bank        guarantee       of
Rs.5,00,000/-           (five     lacs)       from      petitioner     No.1    to

vide letter dated 05.01.2016 (Ex. P/18) certifying that
petitioner No.1 had carried out in time the action plan
in the factory as submitted by it. It is submitted that
since        petitioner    No.1        has      complied        with   all    the
directions and conditions imposed by the respondent,
the prosecution against the petitioners and co-accused
Manish Kumar has become infructuous, and it is also
against the law.

learned senior counsel that petitioner No.2 Ashok
Bhave is the Director of the petitioner No.1 and that
he is not concerned with day to day functions of the
factory for which co-accused Manish Kumar, who is the
plant    manager,         is    solely    responsible.       Hence,   his
prosecution in the case is against the law. It is
submitted that the respondent has authority to cancel
the license of petitioner No.1. Therefore, instead of
launching the prosecution against the petitioners and
co-accused Manish Kumar, the respondent should have
cancelled the license. Upon these submissions, it is
prayed     by    him      to    quash     the    complaint      and   the
subsequent proceedings in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.      In reply, learned counsel for the respondent Shri
Ashish Shroti has conceded that the respondent had
granted consent to petitioner No.1 to run the factory

31.10.2014. However, he has contended that on the
dates of inspections i.e. 03.02.2014 and 19.04.2014,
the officers of the respondent found violations of the
provisions of the Acts, which are mentioned in paras-9
and 10 of the complaint, for which the prosecution is
launched        against        the   petitioners       and    co-accused
Manish Kumar. The respondent sent in the inspection
notes (Annexures Ex.P/4 and Ex.P/8) to the occupier
of the factory with covering letters dated 11.04.2014
and 29.09.2014, which were acknowledged on behalf
of the petitioner No.1 vide letters dated 29.04.2014
and     14.10.2014         (    Annexures        P/7    and    Ex.P/15).
Therefore,        the      subsequent           compliance      of    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>
                                              M.Cr.C. No.13852/2016

conditions by petitioner No.1 will not wipe out the
offences having been committed by the petitioners No.
1, 2 and co-accused Manish Kumar. It is submitted
that the status of petitioner No.2 Ashok Bhave in the
case is an occupier as defined in clause (d) of <a href="/doc/382999/" id="a_25">Section
2</a> of the Water Act and clause (m) of <a href="/doc/840666/" id="a_26">Section 2</a> of the
Air Act. Therefore, he is also responsible for violations
of the provisions of the            Acts as mentioned in the
complaint. It is submitted that the respondent has no
Authority to cancel the license of petitioner No1. It
has only power to prosecute the petitioners and co-
accused    Manish       Kumar   for   the   violations    of   the
provisions of the Acts. Upon these submissions, it is
prayed    by him that this petition           deserves     to be
dismissed being devoid of merits and substance.
</p>
<p id="p_14">9.   I have considered the rival submissions made by
the learned counsel for the parties across the Bar and
perused the entire materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10. Upon the perusal of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_27">Water
Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_28">Air Act</a>, I have found that no provisions
are there whereby the subsequent compliance of the
provisions of the Act having already been violated
would     wipe    out    the    offence(s).    Therefore,      the
prosecution against the petitioners cannot be quashed
on the sole ground that later petitioner No.1 has
complied with the conditions imposed upon it in the
consent letters issued by the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_16">11. From the material on record, it is manifest that
on the basis of inspections dated 03.02.2014 and
19.04.2014,      the respondent issued notices to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 8</span>
                                             M.Cr.C. No.13852/2016

occupier of the factory. The acts of giving notices
prima-facie prove the violations of the provisions of
the Acts by the petitioners and co-accused Manish
Kumar as stated in the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_17">12. Upon the meticulous reading of provisions of the
Acts and the rules made thereunder, I have found that
the respondent has no authority to cancel the license
of petitioner No.1. It has only power to prosecute the
violator(s).
</p>
<p id="p_18">13. Now, I refer to some illuminating decisions of the
Supreme Court wherein the parameters of quashment
of    the    FIR/complaint    and     subsequent    proceedings
thereunder are laid down in exercise of the power
under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_29">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_19">14.     In the case of Zandu Pharmaceutical Works
Ltd. Vs. Mohd. Sharful Haque and another [(2005)
1 SCC 122], the Supreme Court has laid down that the
High        Court   may     exercise    extraordinary       power
conferred under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_30">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. in the
following three circumstances namely:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              (i) to give effect to an order under the
              <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_31">Cr.P.C</a>.,

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of the
              court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              (iii) to secure the ends of justice.</blockquote>

<p id="p_20">       In view of the above propositions of law, I have
examined the entire record and found that none of the
above       circumstances    exists    in   the   instant   case,
warranting the exercise of power by me under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_32">Section
482</a> of the Cr.P.C. to quash the complaint and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             9</span>
                                     M.Cr.C. No.13852/2016

subsequent proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_21">15. In the case of MCD Vs. Ram Kishan Rohtagi
[(1983) 1 SCC 1], the Supreme Court has held thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       "The inherent power should not be
       exercised      to   stifle   a   legitimate
       prosecution. The High Court should refrain
       from giving a prima facie decision unless
       there are compelling circumstances to do
       so. Taking the allegations and the
       complaint as they were, without adding or
       subtracting anything, if no offence was
       made out, only then the High Court would
       be justified in quashing the proceedings in
       the exercise of its power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_33">Section
       482</a> Cr.P.C."</blockquote>

<p id="p_22">     Upon the examination of the complainant in the
light of the aforesaid ratio, I have found that the
complaint prima facie discloses the offences committed
by the petitioners, which are punishable under the
Acts. Hence, the complaint cannot be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_23">16. In the case of Taramani Parakh Vs. State of
M.P. and ors., (2015 Cr.L.J. (SC) 2031) the Supreme
Court has held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "27.1. Though there are no limits of the
       power of this Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_34">Section 482</a> of
       the Code but the more the power, the
       more due care and caution is to be
       exercised in invoking these powers. The
       power of quashing criminal proceedings,
       particularly, the charge framed in terms of
       <a href="/doc/411062/" id="a_35">Section 228</a> of the Code should be
       exercised     very   sparingly  and    with
       circumspection and that too in the rarest
       of the rare cases.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        "27.2. The Court should apply the test as
       to whether the uncontroverted allegations
       as made from the record of the case and
       the documents submitted therewith prima
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 10</span>
                                             M.Cr.C. No.13852/2016

           facie establish the offence or not. If the
           allegations are so patently absurd and
           inherently improbable that no prudent
           person can ever reach such a conclusion
           and where the basic ingredients of a
           criminal offence are not satisfied then the
           Court may interfere.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           27.13. Quashing of a charge is an
           exception to the rule of continuous
           prosecution. Where the offence is even
           broadly satisfied, the Court should be
           more inclined to permit continuation of
           prosecution rather than its quashing at
           that initial stage. The Court is not
           expected to marshal the records with a
           view to decide admissibility and reliability
           of the documents or records but is an
           opinion formed prima facie."</blockquote>

<p id="p_24">     As already stated the learned C.J.M. has taken
the cognizance against the petitioners and co-accused
Manish Kumar vide the order dated 11.08.2015 and the
revision    filed   by   the   petitioners   against   the   said
cognizance was dismissed by the learned Sessions
Judge vide the order dated 25.05.2016 passed in
criminal revision No. 100123/2015. Therefore, in the
light of the aforesaid parameters the complaint cannot
be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_25">17. The Supreme Court in the cases of Indian Oil
Corporation Vs. NEPC India Limited [(2009) 1 SCC
</p><p id="p_26">516)], R. Kalyani Vs. Janak C. Mehta (AIR 1992 SCW
</p><p id="p_27">237), State of Haryana Vs. Bhajanlal (AIR 1992 SCW
</p><p id="p_28">237) and Prashant Bharti Vs. State of NCT of Delhi
(AIR 2013 SC 275) has laid down certain principles of
law for quashing the FIRs/Complaints/Investigations
and subsequent criminal proceedings. After testing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                             11</span>
                                         M.Cr.C. No.13852/2016

contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners on the
touchstone of the said principles of law, I have found
that not a single ground is made out by the petitioners
to    quash   the     complaint    and   the    subsequent
proceedings in the case.
</p>
<p id="p_29">18. Thus, in the totality of circumstances, the legal
position and the fact situation of the case, no ground
is made out by the petitioners for interference under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_36">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_30">19. In the result, this petition must fail and is hereby
dismissed. The interim order dated 17.08.2016 passed
by this court in the instant case stands vacated. It is
made clear that the status of petitioner No.2 as the
occupier of the factory is not decided finally in this
order. Therefore, he has a liberty to challenge his said
status in the course of trial of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_31">20. Accordingly, this petition is finally disposed of.
