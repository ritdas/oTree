<p id="p_1">ORDER
 

S.J. Mukhopadhaya, J. 
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1. The Writ petition was filed in public interest for forbearing the respondents from storage, transport of coal from or through Vadalur, Cuddalore District.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2. According to the writ petitioner, the 7th respondent-The Chettinad Lignite Transport Services Ltd., Vadalur, extracts lignite from mine 1A of the Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) and transport the same to Vadalur Railway Station, wherefrom the coal is transported to the 6th respondent-The STCMS Electric Company (P) Ltd., Chennai. There are more than 100 families reside in Sarvodaya Nagar near the Vadalur Railway Station. The operation of the lignite depot at Vadalur results in high levels of suspended and respirable particulate matter being generated during various points such as, transport from the mine, storage at the bunker unit at Vadalur and transportation from the bunker to the silo by conveyance and transport from the silo to the zero unit. Apart from high risk to the ecology, there is also a high risk of serious human health impacts likely to be caused. The bunker is situated in an area, where there are more than 2400 houses assessed to property tax. There are many more hutments and low income residential housing in the area. The health impacts extend to over 40,000 people reside in and around Vadalur and over 25 villages, situate in the neighbourhood. The grievance of the petitioner is that the first respondent while granting clearance to the Power Plant, was under the impression that the transport of coal by road through lorries would be with adequate dust suppression measure adoption. This appears to be the claim in the Environment Impact Assessment. The matter having come to the notice of the petitioner, has alleged that though he represented the matter to the Government of Tamil Nadu on 23.9.2002, no action was taken.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3. During pendency of the writ petition, the petitioner filed an affidavit wherein it is alleged that he could learn that the 6th respondent Company, though obtained consent for establishment of the Unit in the year 1998 and commenced production activity in the year 2002, no public hearing or Environment Impact Assessment was conducted for the entire project.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">4. The 7th respondent-The Chettinad Lignite Transport Services (P) Ltd., Vadalur, who is in fact the Transporter of lignite from Neyveli to Vadalur, while denied the allegation, has taken the plea that adequate safeguards have been taken to protect from any Environmental hazards apart from other steps taken for transportation of lignite from Neyvely to Vadalur to prevent any pollution. The lignite has very high moisture content and is not prone to fugitive emissions. NLC has been transporting lignite in open conveyors eversince the inception for several decades, but the 7th respondent has been transporting lignite from NLC in trucks, which are properly covered and sealed by tarpaulins. The trucks move along the road in the NLC land to the underground bunker, where the lignite is unloaded. A forced jet spray of water through nozzle has been installed to suppress emanation of any dust particles. The spray of water is inter-locked with dumping platform of the bunker so that it gets activated during unloading of lignite from trucks. The lignite, which is unloaded, is transferred from the bunkers to the silos by covered conveyors. These conveyors are covered on all sides. Water is sprayed through nozzles at transfer points in the conveyors for dust suppression. Any emission from each storage silos is taken to the respective bag filters that can filter particles upto 60 microns size. The clean, filtered and dust free air is released into the atmosphere. It is from the silos that the lignite is loaded into the railway wagons and other actions are taken. The following steps seems to have been taken by the 7th respondent:
</p>  

<p id="p_6">(a) Providing dust suppression system through water spray nozzles for Dump Hopper, Transfer points in the conveyor and loading chutes.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">(b) Bag filters to arrest dust in the silos.
</p> 

<p id="p_8">(c) Covering all hoppers as well as conveyors with G.I. Sheets.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">(d) Provisions of Green Belt around the unit.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">(e) 17 mtrs. x 11 mtrs. Height wind cladding on all three sides of the dump hopper.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">This apart, the 7th respondent also stated that they have taken adequate steps to provide a green belt around the Control Room area as well as developing a green belt cross at dump hopper area.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">5. In the counter affidavit of the 6th respondent it is submitted that the Environmental clearance in favour of the 6th respondent was obtained as back as on 3.5.1994; No Objection Certificate to set up the unit from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was obtained on 24.5.1994; consent to establish the plant under <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_1">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, and consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Section 25</a> of the Water (Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974, were obtained on 2.6.1998. According to the 6th respondent, no hearing was required to be given in public at that stage and in fact a sum of Rs. 1400 crores has been invested for the power project, which is functioning from the end of 2002.
</p> 

<p id="p_13">6. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was asked to inspect and submit a report to find out as to whether the activities of the 6th and 7th respondents are detrimental to the public in general. In its report dated 5.9.2007 while it is stated that the Unit was inspected on 3.9.2007, the following statements are made therein:</p><pre id="pre_1">

     hopper to NLC Mine IA stockpile area
     was a mud/kaccha road with lots of undulation.
     Now 800 Mtrs. of road from dump hopper have
     been converted into cement  concrete road and
     the rest of them have been black topped and
     there is therefore no spillage.
04   Concrete has been laid in the unloading                Complied with.
     platform and in the ramp area.  Water is
     sprayed regularly on the roads from NLC

In the present case, the Environmental Clearance was given in favour of M/s.Neyveli Lignite Corporation, on 23.12.1988, which was subsequently transferred in favour of the 6th respondent. Thereafter, Environmental Clearance in favour of the petitioner was given on 3.5.1994. For more than 8 to 10 years no objection was raised by any individual including the petitioner till the company invested the total amount and started functioning since December, 2002. In any case, the mandate of public hearing was made optional since 3.5.1994.

<p id="p_25">10. From the above said facts it is evident that when the original Environmental Clearance was given in favour of NLC, there was no requirement for public hearing and subsequently when it was issued in favour of the 6th respondent, it was made optional. Again it was on the 10th April, 1997, it was made mandatory. In any case, now more than ten years have passed since the Company started functioning and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board also after due verification, submitted a report in favour of the respondent and hence we are not inclined to decide the issue as raised in the amendment petition in W.P.M.P. No. 18476 of 2003.
