               ===========================
                     W.P(C) No.5089 of 2020
                ===========================
                  Dated this the 24th day of February, 2020

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The case set up in the Writ Petition (C) is as follows:- The

 petitioners are residents at Vadakkencherry, Palakkad. It is stated that

 the 3rd respondent is running a Rice Mill by name M/s. Jayabharath

 Modern Rice Mill, at Vadakkenchery close to the residential properties

 of the petitioners. The 3rd respondent is conducting the said mill in such

 a manner that is causing high amount of pollution by way of discharging

 of untreated effluents, causing serious health hazards to the people of

 the locality. The mill is also producing large amount of paddy dust. It is

 also emanating huge smoke and vapour resulting in spreading of

 pungent smell in the entire neighbourhood, besides the noise pollution.

 Some of the nearby residents like the petitioners approached this Court

 by filing W.P.(C) No. 20046/2010 for a direction to respondents 1, 2 and

 4 to take immediate action against the 3rd respondent, including

 revocation of the consent to operate and various other measures

 suggested in the direction to the 3rd respondent and to restrain the 3rd

 respondent from running the unit without ensuring compliance of the

 conditions stipulated in the consent to operate. Thereupon this Court
 WP(C).No.5089 OF 2020(I)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                 4</span>

 passed an interim order dated 31.1.2010 therein directing the 1 st

 respondent to inspect the premises and file a Report. That though report

 was received, the 3rd respondent is continuing the unit without

 complying with the requirements. This Court also in Ext P6 judgment

 dated 02.06.2017 very clearly observed that it is incumbent on the part

 of the 1st respondent to ensure that the 3rd respondent is continuing its

 operation only in terms of the explicit requirements contained under the

 Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>. However, still the 3 rd

 respondent unit is running in the same manner without complying with

 the requirements contained under the Air (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

 Pollution) Act</a>.        It is in the light of the above averments and

 contentions that the petitioners have filed this Writ Petition with

 following prayers:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "a)     Writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction
                    directing the 1st respondent to immediately stop running of the
                    respondent unit, Modern Rice Mills, Vadakkencherry forthwith; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            b)      issue such other or further orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem
                    just and fit in the circumstances of the case."</blockquote><p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">       2.         Heard Sri.P.R.Venkatesh, learned counsel for the petitioners,

 Sri.T.Naveen, learned standing counsel for the Kerala State Pollution

 Control Board, appearing for R-1                    and Sri. K.J. Manu Raj, learned

 Government Pleader appearing for R4 (District Medical Officer,

 Palakkad). In the nature of the order that is proposed to be passed in

 this petition, notice to R-2 and R-3 will stand dispensed with.

</p><p id="p_4">       3.         Taking note of the facts and circumstances of this case, it is
 WP(C).No.5089 OF 2020(I)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     5</span>

 ordered that in case petitioners have any grievances regarding the

 functioning of the rice mill of the 3rd respondent, then it is for the

 petitioners to file detailed petition in that regard before the 1 st

 respondent Senior Environmental Engineer, Kerala State Pollution

 Control Board, Palakkad, without much delay within a period of two

 weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this judgment.

 Copies of the Writ Petition will also be sent to the 2 nd respondent

 Vadakkenchery Grama Panchayat as well as to the 4 th respondent

 D.M.O. Palakkad and the 3rd respondent Modern Rice Mills,

 Vadakkenchery.     Thereupon 2nd respondent and 4th respondent may

 conduct appropriate enquiries and may furnish their enquiry reports to

 the 1st respondent Kerala State Pollution Control Board and copy of the

 said report should also be given to the 1 st petitioner as well as the 3 rd

 respondent, in advance. This process should be duly completed by R2

 and R4 within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the

 judgment. Thereafter the 2nd respondent should conduct inspection of

 the 3rd respondent's rice mill with due prior notice to the 3 rd respondent

 and may ascertain whether there are any defects to be rectified by the 3 rd

 respondent for abating pollution issues and if it is so found, notice

 should be issued by the 1st respondent to the 3rd respondent and after

 affording reasonable opportunity of being heard to the 3 rd respondent as

 well as the petitioners through their authorized representative or
 WP(C).No.5089 OF 2020(I)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      6</span>

 counsel, if any, the 1st respondent will render a considered decision in

 the matter and if it is found that there are serious rectification issues, it

 should be undertaken by the 3rd respondent for abating pollution issues.

 Then reasonable time by two to three weeks may be granted to the 3 rd

 respondent for rectifying such defects. If the defects are still continuing,

 then the 1st respondent may pass appropriate orders in the matter and

 may consider whether statutory consent to operate the unit should be

 revoked or modified, etc. The entire process in that regard should be

 duly completed by the 1st respondent within six weeks from the date of

 production of a certified copy of this judgment.

</p><p id="p_5">       4.    The Registry will forward the copies of the judgment to the

 2nd respondent Panchayath and 3rd respondent for information, at the

 risk of the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       With above observations and directions, the above Writ Petition(c)

 stands finally disposed of.
