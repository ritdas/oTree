JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR (CHAIRPERSON):
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     In the present appeal, the appellant has raised a

challenge to the order dated 25th January, 2012 passed by the

Ministry of Environment and Forests (for short the "MoEF"),

Government of India, granting Environmental Clearance (for

short the "EC") to the project for setting up a 3x800 MW

Stage-I Kudgi Super Thermal Power Project near village Kudgi,

in Bijapur District, Karnataka. The necessary facts giving rise

to the present appeal can be summed up as under:


</p><p id="p_8">2.   The appellant claims to be a public spirited citizen and

the President of Parisara Raksana Seva Vedike, a Registered

Society, having its office at Masuti, Basavana Bagewadi Taluk,

District Bijapur, Karnataka. The appellant has a property in

the said village and the project proposed by the respondents is

feared to have devastating effects - both long term and short

term - in the region. The appellant claims that he has neither

any personal nor any financial interest in the matter and has

brought the present appeal in the interest of environment and

protection of the area in question. The project proponent, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                              2</span>
 National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (for short the

"NTPC") on or around 28th January, 2009 submitted a

proposal for seeking EC for setting up a 3x800 MW Stage-I

project of ultimate capacity of 4000 MW. On the basis of this

project proposal, the MoEF stated the Terms of Reference (for

short the "TOR") vide letter dated 30th March, 2009. According

to the applicant, while seeking the EC, the NTPC had stated

that the land is mostly barren &amp; rocky and partly agricultural

with single crop cultivation. In its 36th meeting held on 14th-

15th November, 2011, the Expert Appraisal Committee (for

short the "EAC") recommended the project for EC subject to

certain stipulations and specific conditions stated by it. On

the basis of the recommendations of EAC, MoEF, which is the

Regulatory Authority, accorded EC for the project under the

provisions of the Environmental Clearance Regulations dated

14th September, 2006 (for short the "EIA Notification"). The

total land required for Stage-I was stated to be 2440 acres and

the total land notified for acquisition at an elevation of 580 to

590 metres was approximately 2398.36 acres.


</p><p id="p_9">3.   It is the specifically pleaded case of the appellant, that as

per Rights &amp; Tendency Certificates (for short the "RTCs")

(Form 16) substantial lands notified for acquisition clearly

indicate that the lands are "Bagayita" (Garden land) irrigated

by wells and bore wells and yield two crops per year. The final

journal of the measurements      for   the    project   on   30th

September,   2011 indicated that more than 50 per cent of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                 3</span>
 land    was   irrigated   and   the   remaining   land   was    also

agricultural land, mainly dependent upon rain.           As on 3rd

September, 2011, the payments were made for 272 acres of

irrigated land and 472 acres of dry land on the basis of

compensation rates fixed for the two types of land.            Some

photographs have been placed on record by the appellant

showing that the acquired lands as on 4th November, 2011 in

village Kudgi were pieces of the fertile land having irrigation

facilities and yielding two crops for horticultural yields like

grapes, lemon, betel leaves, etc.       This fact is even further

substantiated in the minutes recorded by the EAC (Thermal)

held from 15th April, 2009 to 8th August, 2011.             In the

Memorandum of Understanding dated 12th January, 2009,

NTPC had demanded and Government of Karnataka had

agreed to provide 3000 acres of land which was nearly 230

acres more than that recommended by the Central Electricity

Authority (for short the "CEA"). The excessive land had been

acquired without having any concern for the representations

of the people. The CEA, in its recommendations had stated

that the land for power project shall be strictly as per latest

CEA norms and if they were to apply for a power project of

3x800 MW capacity, the land limit would be 1765 acres.


</p><p id="p_10">4.     The NTPC had made available the Draft Environmental

Impact Assessment Report (for short the "DEIAR") and

summary reports in English and Kannada for the information

of the public to enable them to participate in the Public
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                   4</span>
 Hearing which was arranged on 25th March, 2010. However,

the facts in the DEIAR were not discussed and there was

concealment of facts or submission of false, misleading and

incomplete information/data. The DEIAR did not comply with

the TOR, particularly, on the issue of alternative sites.     The

ash utilization, as mentioned in the DEIAR, was too general

and without any commitment on arrangements and figures.

As per TOR, the Ambient Air Quality (for short the "AAQ") data

to be monitored were for SPM, RSPM, SO2, NOX, Hg and

Ozone. The impact of the project and the resultant AAQ data

of Hg and Ozone were not given without assigning any reason

though these pollutants are of importance from health and

environmental perspectives.     Fuel analysis for heavy metals

that was required, as per TOR, was not furnished. The DEIAR

did not mention the impact of the project on the Krishna River

and Almatti Dam water. DEIAR failed to study the impact on

the environment from the increased movement of the traffic

and increase in other small industrial activities which will be

the direct and indirect result due to the setting up of the

project.   To appropriately determine the location of the AAQ

monitoring stations, the relevant considerations are the

predominant     downwind    direction,    population   zone   and

sensitive receptors including forest area. It is stated that in

the   present   case,   these   factors   were   not   considered

appropriately and thus placement of the monitoring stations is

improper. There should be at least one monitoring station in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                5</span>
 the predominant downwind direction at a location where

maximum ground level concentration is likely to occur.


</p><p id="p_11">5.   The appellant referred to the DEIAR and the stack

releases from 3x800 MW Stage-I mentioned therein, which are

as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><pre id="pre_3">              "SO2                  1064.700 g/sec/unit
              NOx                   654.000 g/sec/unit
              PM                    43.600 g/sec/unit


</pre><p id="p_13">          "The release of the above air pollutants in such
          quantities will cause enormous harm to humans,
          plant life, aquatic life, soil chemistry and water
          bodies without any doubt. In long time, like 20
          years what happens to a nearby water body like
          Almatti dam water, irrigated lands by its water and
          the people who have used that water for drinking
          only time will tell. Along with ash, there is huge
          quantity of SO2 and NOx, the release which under
          certain conditions, produces acidic rain and dry
          acid particulates which settle down and mix with
          rain water. All these factors though not amenable
          for exact scientific analysis, considering the large
          magnitude project, together are conducive for
          causing enormous damage to the environment."


</p><p id="p_14">6.   Besides this, a number of other facts have been specified

in the petition on the basis of which it is stated that grant of

EC to the NTPC is ecologically and socially disastrous and will

have dangerous impact on future generations in violation of

the environmental laws. It is also stated that there was no

Rehabilitation and Resettlement (for short the "R&amp;R") scheme

in place at the time of public hearing to enable the public at

large, particularly the project-affected persons, to put forward

their views in that behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                               6</span>
</p><p id="p_16"> 7.          The appellant has also referred to a 50-km protest walk

from 4th June, 2011 to 26th June, 2011, from Basavana

Bagewadi to Kudul Sangam, in which thousands of persons

from various walks of life had participated. This was to protest

against the diversion of Almatti Dam water for industries, at

the cost of farmers' interest, and acquisition of fertile lands of

the farmers whose livelihood is based on agriculture.


</p><p id="p_17">8.          Referring to the 'Precautionary Principle' and the 'Polluter

Pays Principle', the applicant stated that the statutory

authority must anticipate the environmental measures to

prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation.

Where there are threats of serious and irreversible damage,

lack of scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for

postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation.


</p><p id="p_18">9.          From the above narrated averments, it is clear that the

appellant is challenging the EC granted to the NTPC on, inter

alia, the following grounds:
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">     (i)      The   EC    was   obtained   from    MoEF    by    making

              misrepresentation with regard to the land use/land

              cover of the project area and nature and categorisation

              of the land, claimed to be mostly barren and rocky, as

              opposed to mostly agricultural and fertile land.

</p><p id="p_21">     (ii)     The 'public hearing' was not held in accordance with

              the prescribed procedure. Material information was

              withheld from the public and the objections raised

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                       7</span>
           during the public hearing have not been considered by

          the EAC. It has completely frustrated the advantages

          of the public hearing, as contemplated under the EIA

          Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_22">  (iii)   Various terms of the TOR have not been adhered to.

</p><p id="p_23">          Even the AAQ data collected for grant of EC was not

          from proper locations, as required under the TOR.

          Monitoring stations have not been set up to check

          pollution levels from the downward wind direction, as

          contemplated under the TOR/EC.
</p>
<p id="p_24">  (iv)    The EC had been granted without R&amp;R plan being in

          place. The R&amp;R plan was not put up before the public

          during the public hearing thus depriving a fair

          opportunity     to   the   affected   parties   to   examine

          objectively the pros and cons for establishment of the

          thermal power project even though prescribed at TOR

          Stage by MoEF. The R&amp;R plan, in fact, was not ready

          at the relevant time and was not prepared covering all

          aspects even at the time of grant of EC to the NTPC.

          This has entirely vitiated the process of grant of EC.

</p><p id="p_25">  (v)     The coal source and its quality were changed several

          times including at the stage of EAC recommendations

          as also at the stage of EC. This factor was also ignored

          by different authorities at the relevant time.


        Thus, the authorities have taken into consideration

irrelevant materials while ignoring the relevant considerations.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                     8</span>
</p><p id="p_26"> 10. The appellant has also raised an issue that the TOR,

which were issued as long back as on 3rd March, 2009, had

specifically provided for some of the above matters.


</p><p id="p_27">11. Condition (iv) of the TOR required study of the land use

of the area as well as the project area to be provided.

Condition (xxiv) obligated the NTPC to prepare a detailed R&amp;R

plan/compensation      package    in    consonance     with   the

National/State R&amp;R policy for the project-affected people,

including that due to fuel transportation system/pipeline and

their ROW, if any. This was to be prepared while taking into

account the socio-economic status of the area, homestead

oustees, land oustees and landless labourers. Condition (xi)

provided for the location of the monitoring stations, which

were to be decided by taking into consideration the pre-

determined downward wind direction, population zone and

sensitive receptors including reserved forests. Condition (xxvii)

required the NTPC to prepare an action plan to address issues

raised during the public hearing and allocate the necessary

funds for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">12. To the above case of the appellant, the NTPC has

responded by making legal submissions as well as raising

factual controversies. According to the NTPC, the appellant

had filed Writ Petitions No.32189-190 of 2011 in the High

Court of Karnataka, challenging the acquisition proceedings

selected upon due consideration. The site near Kudgi village

was selected after examining three alternative sites and taking

into   consideration   various   environmental    and    techno-

economic criteria. It was in conformity with the criteria laid

down for selection of thermal power plants. Besides the efforts

 put in by NTPC for selection of the site, the State Government

officials as well as the CEA have also explored the site and the

report of CEA categorically states that the area is mostly

barren and suitable for setting up of a large scale thermal

project. The lands for the power plant concerned were

acquired vide Notifications dated 6th January, 2010 and 20th

April, 2010 and the same were shown in the said notification

as dry and barren land, based on the information contained in

the RTCs of that period. The gazette notification for acquisition

of 2938 acres of land had been published and the entire land

had been categorized as Kushki or dry land by the Government

of Karnataka. The RTCs relied upon by the appellant are of

2011, which are of much later period and may show the

character of the land as changed by the land owners

subsequent    to   the   identification   of   land   and   start   of

acquisition process, which according to the said respondent,

cannot be relied upon. According to NTPC, the said land is not

fit for agricultural purposes. According to this respondent, the

ultimate capacity of the project is 4000 MW while the

Environmental Impact Assessment (for short the "EIA") study

has been undertaken and EC obtained for Stage I i.e. 2400

MW only. Before starting activities for Stage II, NTPC would

approach MoEF for fresh TOR for EIA study and then would

take proper steps in accordance with law and obtain EC from

MoEF for Stage II.

</p><p id="p_35"> 15. In response to the allegation of changes in the source of

coal, it is stated that MoEF had issued a circular dated 1st

November, 2010 stating that the thermal power project with

coal sourcing from dedicated coal blocks shall be considered

for EC only after firm coal linkage was available and the status

of EC/Forest Clearance (for short the "FC") of the linked coal

mine was obtained. Further, the circular dated 19th January,

2011 clarified that the firm coal linkage was required only at

the stage of grant of EC and not at the stage of TOR. Keeping

this in view, initially the source of coal was to be Mand

Raigarh coalfields, to which in-principle approval for allocation

of captive coal blocks to NTPC was considered. NTPC allocated

coal to Kudgi STPP Stage I from its own mines, named

Talaipalli Coal Mine. The EAC meeting appraised the project,

based on coal characteristics and emission characteristics

based on Talaipalli coal. However, as the EC and FC of

Talaipalli coal mine were delayed, the coal linkage was

changed to Pakri Barwadih coal mine for which EC and FC

were already available. As the coal characteristics of Pakri

Barwadih were better than those of Talaipalli, MoEF accorded

the EC, based on Addendum to EIA Report. This change in the

coal mine source would not affect the environmental quality.

In relation to monitoring stations for AAQ, it is submitted that

the TOR for EIA study for Kudgi specifies that the AAQ data

should be provided for one full season. However, the

monitoring has been undertaken for a period of one year from

monitoring results indicate that the AAQ was well within the

National AAQ Standards. According to this respondent, during

the   operation   phase    of   the   project,   four   numbers    of

continuous automatic AAQ monitoring stations shall be set up

in consultation with Karnataka State Pollution Control Board

and continuous monitoring of all AAQ parameters including

Krishna river. Therefore, there will be no impact on the flow

and ecology of Krishna river upstream of the Almatti Dam. The

water proposed to be drawn from Almatti Dam is only 0.014%

of the live water storage capacity on daily basis and 0.41% of

the live water storage capacity on monthly basis. However, the

reservoir of Almatti Dam has a continuous inflow and outflow

of water. The raw water collected from Almatti Dam shall be

subjected to a number of treatment-processes before the same

can be used in various plant usages. The raw water treatment

system proposed to be provided at Kudgi STPP shall consist of

clarification, filtration, demineralization and chlorination. It is

 the EIA notification, and that the EAC was totally correct in

recommending the case to the MoEF. The report of the public

hearing would show that the local villagers and the project-

affected people attended the hearing and expressed their views

in presence of the Chairman of the public hearing and other

officers. No scientific basis was submitted by any villager to

substantiate their apprehensions. However, the public who

attended the hearing walked out of the hearing before NTPC

could respond. The NTPC had provided answers to all the

queries. According to the NTPC, the public hearing is not a

forum to democratically decide the fate of the project. The

decision regarding implementation of the project is based on a

number      of     techno-economic      and        environmental

considerations,   which   are   considered    by    the   various

institutions set up by the Central Government. It is not

necessary to consider each point raised by the public in detail.

The Tribunal can examine whether the EAC had considered in

its report the objections raised by the public or not. However,

the report specifically mentions that the EAC had considered

the said objections and the response of NTPC. In regard to the

current status of the project, it has been stated that the

project activities had been started only after obtaining all

requisite clearances including the EC from the MoEF, and that

the site levelling and infrastructural development work was in

</p><p id="p_41">19. A separate reply has been filed on behalf of MoEF,

Respondent No.1. The stand taken by this respondent is that

NTPC had informed MoEF that the site for the proposed Kudgi

Stage I power project comprised mostly of barren and rocky

land with some areas having single crop agricultural land.

Neither in the EIA report nor in the questionnaire furnished by

the NTPC for appraisal of the said project, it was disclosed

that the proposed site is in command area of Mulwad Lift

Irrigation Scheme, being under implementation at present by

the   State    Government    concerned.     According   to    this

respondent, the site was inspected by the CEA and in the

report dated September, 2008, it was said that the site is at an

elevation of 580-590 metres whereas the minimum draw down

level of Almatti Dam is at 504 metres. The report thus had

identified the site at Kudgi as more suitable. The MoEF does

 not encourage use of fertile agricultural land for industrial

purposes. The EAC comprising of subject matter experts is a

statutory committee, constituted under the EIA Notification by

Respondent No.1, and had duly appraised the above project

for EC, and it was only after assessing the environmental

impacts   due   to   the   proposed   project,   that   the   EAC

recommended the project for EC, subject to adherence of

environmental safeguards for compliance by NTPC.

2011, the EAC deliberated the issues raised in the public

hearing and while granting the clearance vide order dated 25th

January, 2012, stated that the land requirement shall be

strictly in accordance with the CEA norms. The EC is based on

the principle of sustainable development and provides for

sufficient environmental safeguards and mitigating measures.

The EC, according to this respondent, is primarily based upon

the information provided to the answering respondent by the

 High Court of Karnataka, dismissing the Writ Petitions No.

</p><p id="p_47">23. There is no dispute to the fact that the WPs No.32189-

190 had been filed by a registered society along with the

present appellant, who was Petitioner No.2 in those Writ

Petitions. The challenge in those Writ Petitions was to the

MOU    dated     12th   January,   2009   entered   into   between

Respondents No.2, 3 and 6 for setting up the coal based STPP

at Kudgi with the prayer to stop acquisition of the land for the

same purpose, though there was no specific challenge to the

process of acquisition. However, the quantum and purpose of

acquisition was raised as an issue in the Writ Petitions. The

High Court noticed that nearly 60% of the compensation

payable had been distributed to the erstwhile owners of the

land pursuant to the agreed amount of compensation in the

first phase and 10-12% of the compensation payable was

disbursed in the second phase. The petitions also disclosed

that the main dispute revolved around the issue that there

was failure on the part of the NTPC to get the EC, which had

been granted during the pendency of those proceedings. Now,

the present appeal has been filed against the said EC before

this Tribunal.

 ISSUES IN REGARD TO LAND USE/LAND COVER -
</p><p id="p_55">WHETHER ANY MISREPRESENTATION HAS BEEN MADE BY
THE NTPC IN REGARD TO THE NATURE AND
CATEGORISATION OF THE LAND REQUIRED FOR THE
PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IN QUESTION:
</p>
<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">27. According to the NTPC, the site comprises of mostly

barren and rocky land. The NTPC had informed the MoEF at

the stage of TOR that the land proposed to be acquired (about

3000 acres) was mostly barren and rocky and partly

agriculture with single crop.   This statement appears to be

doubtful as it is clear from the proceedings of the public

hearing held on 25th March, 2010 that Kudgi is well known for

its betel leaf crop for more than the last 100 years.        In

addition, onion, grapes, banana, and other crops including

other horticultural products are grown in the area. The major

occupation of most of the families whose land is being

acquired is agriculture and horticulture and it is stated that

the approximate annual income per acre is about Rs. 2 lakhs.

It is seen from the R&amp;R plan (July 2012) presented by NTPC

that the land under acquisition includes 3500 acres of private

land and approximately 20 acres of Government land.          As

mainly the private land being acquired belongs to the farmers,

who are basically dependant on agricultural activities for their

livelihood, they are the affected persons who will be ultimately

forced to migrate to other places in search of their livelihood

due to acquisition of their lands.   It is pertinent to observe

that the EC was granted on 25th January, 2012 whereas the

R&amp;R Plan was prepared by the NTPC in July 2012, which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                              19</span>
 about 6 months after the grant of EC. Even in the EC given by

MoEF on 25th January, 2012, it is stated that the land to be

acquired for the project was comprising of mostly barren and

rocky land with some areas under agricultural land. There is

a mismatch in the figures of actual land required for the

project, as in the EC, it is written that 2440 acres of land will

be acquired whereas in the R&amp;R Plan prepared by NTPC in

2012 and submitted to MoEF, it indicates that about 3500

acres   of   private   land   and   approximately   20   acres   of

Government land is under acquisition.         During the public

hearing, the farmers have opposed the proposed power plant

on their agricultural land on which their livelihood is based

but it appears that no satisfactory answer was given by the

NTPC during the public hearing except mentioning that proper

compensation, as applicable, would be paid to them. In fact,

the MoEF should have looked critically into the aspect of land

acquisition, primarily concerning agricultural land and not

mostly barren and rocky, as has been stated in the documents

submitted to the MoEF by the NTPC. In fact, it amounts to

concealment of facts/suppression of factual information

regarding the type and the nature of land proposed to be

acquired by the NTPC.

<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">28. Mr. Ritwick Dutta, learned counsel for the Appellant, has

stated that the land in question gives two crops and as per

 Government. However, the farmers have installed a number of

pumps for extraction of ground water for irrigation of their

fields. Mr. Dutta also brought to our attention that even the

satellite imagery does not show that the land is barren and

rocky.   In reply to the contention of Mr. Dutta, about the

agricultural land giving two crops, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned

senior counsel for NTPC, stated that as per the revenue

records, it is dry land and the CEA report has indicated that it

is rocky and barren land.

projects, it is mentioned that location of thermal power plant

should be avoided on prime agricultural land.            Learned

Counsel for Appellant, Mr. Ritwick Dutta, while arguing the

matter, stated that there have been a number of instances

wherein the EAC has not agreed to acquisition of fertile

agricultural land for location of power plants and rather has

advised the project proponents to locate alternative land. As

such, had it been known to the EAC that the land in question

is basically agricultural land at the time of the appraisal of the

project, it was quite possible that the EAC/MoEF would have

asked for alternative sites and, quite possibly, may not have

given approval to the present project site in question.        He

further stated that, to avoid rejection at the Scoping Stage

itself, the NTPC deliberately gave a false and misleading

statement that the proposed land is mostly barren and rocky

and only partly agricultural.

that the land in question has been indicated as rocky and

barren in the CEA Report (September 2008) pertaining to the

sites identified by the Government of Karnataka in Bijapur

district for siting of a large thermal power station. It is seen

from the CEA Report that during the site visit, it was noted

that adequate land is available at Kudgi site consisting of

mostly barren land. It is also stated that the Government of

Karnataka had identified an area of about 3384 acres near

Kudgi which is a mix of cultivated and barren land but

nowhere in the CEA Report, it appears to have been

mentioned that it is a rocky land whereas NTPC, while

applying for TOR to MoEF, has stated in the documents that

land is rocky and barren.

</p>
<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">32. The response of NTPC on the issue of character of land is

that the land required for the power plant was being acquired

vide the notifications dated 6th January, 2010 and 20th April,

2010 based on the information contained in the RTCs of that

period which designated the said land to be dry and barren.

Till date, gazette notification for acquiring 2938 acres of land

had been published and the entire land had been categorised

as Kushki or dry land by Government of Karnataka. NTPC has

further clarified that none of the RTCs submitted by the

appellant relate to any wet land or irrigated land. They are all

shown as dry land or land irrigated by wells, and as such, the

said land cannot be termed as prime agricultural land and at

best would remain marginally agricultural land.        Further,

NTPC has undertaken geo-technical investigation in the

project area which indicated that the surface strata consisted

of hard, brownish grey, clayey silt/silt clay with decomposed

rock particles overlaid by weathered rock. The depth of the top

of weathered rock below the ground level varies from 0.10 m to

5.15 m. However, at most of the bore hole locations, (175 out

of 203), the top of weathered rock existed within 1 m from

ground level and at only 3 locations, it exceeded 2 meters. On

the basis of the above findings, NTPC has concluded that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                              23</span>
 surface and sub-surface soil conditions are not conducive to

agriculture in the area marked for the plant. We are not able

to understand this proposition of the NTPC that the soil

conditions are not conducive to agricultural activities as for

such purposes, the requirement of the depth of the soil may

not be more than 6 inches to 12 inches especially for seasonal

crops and horticultural produce such as grapes, pomegranate

and lemon. The appellant, in his submissions, has stated that

even during the public hearing, it was mentioned that the area

was irrigated and was producing a number of agricultural and

horticultural products. He further stated that in the area, a

number of pumps had been installed by the farmers for the

last 40 years which were evident as per the records of Hubli

Electric Supply Company.       Further, it was brought to our

notice by Mr. Dutta, Counsel for Appellant, that satellite

imagery appended to the EIA report did not indicate that

major part of the site was barren. Thus from the above, it may

be concluded that the land in question is not mostly barren &amp;

rocky as informed by NTPC to MoEF, which may be taken as

wilful suppression of facts.

                                       single/commercial crops.




</pre><p id="p_70">34.   Thus, according to the NTPC, the land was mostly

barren and rocky and only partly agricultural with single crop

plantation. This laid down the foundation for consideration

and grant of the EC. In the letter dated 30th March, 2009

written by the MoEF to the NTPC, this fact was taken to be

gospel truth and it was stated that the land was mostly barren

and rocky and partly agricultural with single crop plantation

and there was no homestead at the project site. According to

this letter, the EAC for the project, in its meeting held on 12-

13th March, 2009, had considered the project based on the

information furnished and, the presentation made and the

TOR were prepared accordingly. Under clause (vi) of the TOR,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                              25</span>
 land requirement for Stage I of the project had to be optimized

and furnished. Furthermore, the issues regarding land

acquisition and R&amp;R scheme were directed to be clearly

discussed in the EIA report. According to the appellant, this

was never done and there was no deliberation even during the

public hearing on this issue. Even while granting the EC vide

order dated 25th January, 2012, identical language was

noticed in the opening paragraphs of the order in relation to

land - nature and categorization.
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">35.   It is noticed that the CEA also noticed that the

Government of Karnataka had identified an area of about

3,384 acres near Kudgi, which is a mix of cultivated and

barren land. However, no details of such bifurcation were

provided in that report. The appellant has further relied upon

the document (Annexure R-2/2) filed by NTPC and averred

that a total of 2,938.36 acres of land was agricultural land

while 71.11 acres was the Pot Kharab (barren land). The

respondents have also filed some photographs on record

showing that the land was barren and rocky. From the various

documents on record, it is clear that the land is partly

agricultural and partly barren/rocky. However, a larger part of

the acquired land is agricultural - either irrigated or non-

irrigated. A few photographs have also been placed on record

showing that the over-burdened soil is varying from 0.3 metre

to 2.3 metres. In the DEIAR submitted by the NTPC under

paragraph 3.1.2, it has been shown that the study area
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                             26</span>
 comprises of built-up land, agricultural land, plantations,

waste land and water bodies. In Table 3.1 on Land Use Pattern

of Kudgi Study area, as on 2008, it has been shown as follows:

</pre><p id="p_73">36.    From the above data, it is clear that the use of land is

pre-dominantly for agriculture in that area.


</p><p id="p_74">37.    The revenue records filed clearly show that major part of

the land in question is agricultural land. The source of

irrigation for such land is stated to be tube wells, pump sets,

etc. In the RTC Form No.16, the land undoubtedly has been

declared as garden land and even the names of the crops have

been described as grape, sunflower, lemon, bajra, onion,

maize, etc. There also, the source of water has been shown as

tube wells and pump sets. In these reports, it has also been

reflected that even dry/Kushki land is giving crops. The

appellant has also relied upon the letter dated 3rd September,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                              27</span>
 2012   written   by   the   Special   Land   Acquisition   Officer,

Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (for short the

"KIADB"), Dharwad, which shows that out of 2,938.36 acres of

total agricultural land (Kushki land) under acquisition, more

than 50% of the land is irrigated with wells and bore wells and

the remaining area is under dry cultivation i.e. dependent

solely upon rains, etc. The appellant has also placed

documents to show that the land in the district consists of two

types of soil - the first one is mixed soil with predominantly

black soil and the second one is layered mixed soil

predominantly consisting of red/brown soil. These soils are

suitable for dry crops, and dry and irrigated crops respectively.

This is based upon the document issued by Bijapur District

Statistical Office of Government of Karnataka in July, 2006. It

deserves to be noticed that as per the NTPC R&amp;R Policy, 2010,

'agricultural land' has been defined to include lands being

used for agriculture, horticulture, dairy farming, poultry

farming, pisciculture, breeding of livestock, nursery growing

medicinal herbs, raising of crops, grass or garden produce and

land used by agriculturists for the grazing of cattle. However,

it does not include any land used only for cutting of wood.

This definition in the policy would certainly throw light on the

scope of the agricultural land. It is an inclusive definition and

thus would take within its ambit lands which are not being

used purely for agricultural purposes. The appellant has filed

photographs showing that majority of the land is irrigated and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                 28</span>
 fertile land suitable for double crop-cultivation and the

farmers actually take two crops from such land. From this

documentary      evidence      consisting    of    Government

documentation, it is clear that the NTPC had not correctly

filled in the above columns and these have been so relied upon

by the authorities, particularly MoEF without any verification.

Besides that, land in excess of the stated land is being used

for the project in question. It, thus, further shows that it is

largely agricultural land, which is sought to be acquired and is

intended to be used for the project.
</p>
<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">38.   A perusal of the satellite imagery appended by the EIA

Consultant to the EIA Report on record does not support the

contention of the NTPC that the major part of the project area

is barren. Further the revenue documents as well as the

photographs of the area placed on record by the Appellant

clearly indicate that the area under reference is mostly

agricultural land. Hence the plea taken by the NTPC for

seeking EC for the project, i.e., "most of the area is barren"

clearly indicates that the NTPC misled the EAC. This is also

clear from the observation recorded by the MoEF while issuing

the EC vide document No.J 13012/06/2009-IA.II (T) dated 1st

January, 2012 which states that "most part of the 2440 acres

required for the Stage-I comprises of mostly barren and rocky

with some area under single crop agriculture land". The MoEF

vide its Reply-Affidavit dated 18th May, 2012 concedes that

NTPC had informed the EAC (Thermal Power) that the site
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                              29</span>
 comprises of mostly barren and rocky land with some areas

having single crop agricultural land. Further, it also concedes

that the Committee didn't know that the proposed project site

lies in the command area of Mulwad Lift Irrigation Scheme.


</p><p id="p_77">39.   From the above discussion, it can safely be concluded

that the land in question is primarily not barren and rocky

land, as informed by NTPC and there appears to be improper

disclosure of facts on the part of the NTPC which remained

unverified even till the stage of issuance of the EC.


ISSUE   WITH  REGARD   TO   REHABILITATION  AND
RESETTLEMENT POLICY WITH REFERENCE TO THE FACTS
OF THE PRESENT CASE:
</p>
<p id="p_78">
</p><p id="p_79">40.   R &amp; R is an essential feature of any project which comes

up for consideration before the competent authorities in

accordance with the EIA Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_80">
</p><p id="p_81">41.   If one examines the scheme of the EIA Notification, it

becomes evident that at the time of preparation of the TOR,

the NTPC had to place all relevant material before the EAC.

The EAC is required to address all relevant concerns for the

preparation of EIA Report in respect of the project or activity

for which clearance is sought. Besides the information with

regard to undeveloped or agricultural land, as contemplated in

Appendix I, Form I, the NTPC is also expected to disclose the

effect on the welfare of the people, vulnerable group of people,

who could be affected by the project along with such other

information, the disclosure of which would be significant for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                              30</span>
 the purposes of fair consideration of the project. Furthermore,

the NTPC is required to provide full information and, wherever

necessary, attach explanatory notes with the Form in relation

to land environment, water environment, aesthetics and socio-

economic aspects besides environmental management plan.


</p><p id="p_82">42.   The concept of sustainable development is to drive a

balance   between     environment     on   the   one   hand   and

development on the other. One of the essential facets of this

balancing approach is to find out the impact of development

upon civilization, particularly with reference to human beings.

If as a result of establishment and operation of any project, a

large chunk of land belonging to a large number of persons is

expected to be acquired and they are likely to be displaced in

one form or the other from their livelihood, R &amp; R scheme

would be one of the most pertinent aspects to be considered

by the EAC. This would be a matter which must be elaborately

deliberated upon and the general public must be heard on

such an issue during the public hearing. Formulating an R&amp;R

scheme would be necessary not only in the interest of the

project but also in the interest of the public at large.


</p><p id="p_83">43.   Persuaded by this approach, while drawing up the TOR,

the competent authority stated in paragraph (xxiv) as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "Detailed R&amp;R plan/compensation package in
           consonance with the National/State R&amp;R Policy for
           the project affected people including that due to fuel
           transportation system/pipeline and their ROW, if
           any, shall be prepared taking into account the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                               31</span>
            socio-economic status of the area, homestead
           oustees, land oustees, landless labourers."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_84">44.   As   is   evident   from   the   above,   submission   of   a

comprehensive R&amp;R scheme was of paramount consideration

right from the initial stages of drawing up the TOR till even

after passing of the order of EC. Submission of such scheme,

despite being so significant, had not been submitted by NTPC

even after passing of the order of EC.
</p>
<p id="p_85">
</p><p id="p_86">45. Particularly in the facts of the present case, we may

notice that the TOR given by MoEF required for preparation of

R&amp;R plan, which was an integral part of the DEIAR, which in

turn, was the basis for organising public hearing, as required

under EIA Notification.     But the DEIAR did not contain a

detailed R&amp;R plan at the time of the public hearing, and as

such, it amounts to non-compliance of TOR. Even the EAC,

while considering the project, has noted that the R&amp;R plan is

too general but the EAC recommended the project for EC and

in fact R&amp;R plan was submitted to MoEF only a few months (5

to 6 months) after the EC was granted to the project. Learned

Senior Advocate for the NTPC, Mr. Singh, stated that R&amp;R

policy of NTPC was placed before the public hearing and in the

36th meeting of the EAC held on 14-15th November, 2011, the

project was recommended for grant of EC.          It is, therefore,

evident that the NTPC did not submit the R&amp;R Plan as was

required before EAC/MoEF at the time of appraisal of project

and rather it was submitted about 5-6 months after the EC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                  32</span>
 was accorded by MoEF which is clearly in violation of TOR

conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">46. The appellant also pleads that the concerns regarding the

negative impact of the project on the people, raised by the

participants of the Public Hearing meeting, were not given

consideration by the EAC and the Committee has not applied

its mind while recommending the grant of EC. However, from

the observation recorded in the minutes of the EAC meeting,

i.e., "that the NTPCs have not submitted R&amp;R for Project-

Affected Persons (for short the "PAPs") even though the project

entails large acquisition of private land by KIADB. It was

observed that the sustenance of these poor villagers is based

on the few acres of land either owned or working on the said

land" it does appear that the points raised in the Public

Hearing were considered. However, it may be noted that the

Public Hearing was conducted on 25th March, 2010 much

before the issuance of notification under <a href="/doc/80084128/" id="a_4">Section 28</a> (4), (5) &amp;

(6) of the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Act and as

such the public was not knowing as to whose land was going

to be acquired for the project. In other words, it means that

nobody actually knew who was going to be affected by the said

power project.
</p>
<p id="p_89">47. While deliberating on the EIA report submitted by the

NTPC, the EAC noted that the NTPC had not submitted R&amp;R

Plan for project-affected persons even though the project

entailed large acquisition of private land by KIADB. It was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                             33</span>
 observed that the sustenance of these poor villagers is based

on the few acres of land, which they either own or work on. It

was therefore decided that a comprehensive R&amp;R action plan

with requisite details including financial parameters (for

compensation, scheme for upliftment of marginalized section

etc.) shall be submitted within four months. Accordingly, a

specific condition regarding the R&amp;R was set in the EC.

</p><p id="p_90">48. While issuing the EC dated 25th January, 2012, the

MoEF set a number of conditions for compliance by the NTPC.

As stated above, one of these conditions pertained to the R&amp;R

of the Project-affected persons. The NTPC was directed to

prepare a comprehensive R&amp;R plan for the project-affected

persons in a well spelt time-bound manner. The said

conditions read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          "4. A. Specific Conditions

          (xxxi) A comprehensive R&amp;R action plan with
          requisite details such as details of land losers and
          financial budget for compensation etc. shall be
          submitted to the Regional Office of the Ministry
          within four months. The R&amp;R action plan shall also
          include scheme for upliftment of marginalized
          section that are indirectly affected on account of
          dependence for their sustenance on the land not
          owned by them."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_91">49.    The Ministry of Rural Development (Government of

India) has framed a comprehensive R &amp; R Policy for project-

affected persons in 2007 (NRRP-2007). In the preamble of the

NRRP-2007, it is stated thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          "1.1. Provision of public facilities or infrastructure
          often requires the exercise of legal powers by the
          State under the principle of eminent domain for

 acquisition of private property, leading to
involuntary displacement of people, depriving them
of their land, livelihood and shelter; restricting their
access to traditional resource base, and uprooting
them from their socio-cultural environment". These
have traumatic, psychological and socio-cultural
consequences on the affected population which call
for protecting their rights, in particular of the
weaker sections of the society including members of
the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, marginal
farmers and women. Involuntary displacement of
people may be caused by other factors also.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_92">1.2. There is imperative to recognize rehabilitation
and resettlement issues as intrinsic to the
development process formulated with the active
participation of the affected persons, rather than as
externally-imposed       requirements.       Additional
benefits beyond monetary compensation have to be
provided to the families affected adversely by
involuntary displacement. The plight of those who
do not have legal or recognized rights over the land
on which they are critically dependent for their
subsistence is even worse. This calls for a broader
concerted effort on the part of the planners to
include in the displacement, rehabilitation and
resettlement process framework not only those who
directly lose land and other assets but also those
who are affected by such acquisition of assets. The
displacement process often poses problems that
make it difficult for the affected persons to continue
their earlier livelihood activities after resettlement.
This requires a careful assessment of the economic
disadvantages and social impact of displacement.
There must also be a holistic effort aimed at
improving the all-round living standards of the
affected people.

<p id="p_93">            XXXXX      XXXXX       XXXXX

1.7. It is acknowledged that many State
Governments, Public Sector Undertakings, agencies
and other bodies concerned, either have their own
Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&amp;R) policies or
are in the process of formulating them. The
provisions of the National Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Policy, 2007 (for short the "NRRP-
2007") provide for the basic minimum requirements,
and all projects leading to involuntary displacement
of people must address the rehabilitation and
resettlement issues comprehensively. The State
Governments, Public Sector Undertakings or

             agencies, and other bodies concerned shall be at
            liberty to put in place greater benefit levels than
            those prescribed in the NRRP-2007."
</p>
<p id="p_94">
</p><p id="p_95">50. The above statement makes it amply clear that State

Governments/PSUs and other bodies concerned are obliged to

provide R&amp;R benefits to the affected people at a rate not, in

any case, below that prescribed in the NRRP- 2007 and,

further, the procedure has also to be at par with the NRRP-

2007. This is acknowledged by the NTPC in its own R&amp;R Policy

issued in June, 2010. The considered opinion of the NTPC

regarding the land acquisition as reflected in its R&amp;R policy

(June, 2010) is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       i.   The land that is acquired for power projects is for a
            public purpose and necessitates Rehabilitation and
            Resettlement (R&amp;R) of PAPs, a task often
            accompanied by socio-economic adjustment. The
            PAPs have to involuntarily face the new social set up
            (NTPC R &amp; R Policy June 2010: <a href="/doc/118613726/" id="a_5">Section 1</a>.1.1).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      ii.   The land acquisition and consequent displacement
            disrupts the traditional social system. The changes
            in the land use pattern alter the agro-based rural
            economy and affect the life style of people. This calls
            for a concerted effort to provide means to ensure
            sustainable livelihood of these PAPs, considering
            them as stakeholders (<a href="/doc/118613726/" id="a_6">Section 1</a>.1.2 supra).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     iii.   The Rehabilitation and Resettlement Plan (R&amp;R
            Plan) is to be formulated so that after a reasonable
            transition period, the affected families improve, or at
            least regain their previous standard of living,
            earning capacity and production levels. In case a
            one-time     negotiated    settlement     is  reached,
            individual R&amp;R benefits must be paid at the time of
            payment of land compensation itself (<a href="/doc/118613726/" id="a_7">Section 1</a>.1.3

            make it in line with NPRR-2003 and in light of the

any record of the landless labourers and other artisans, who

have been affected by the project. The fact that more than 80%

LOCATION OF AAQ MONITORING STATIONS AND VARIATION
IN COAL QUALITY - EFFECTS THEREOF:
</p><p id="p_110">59.   The next contention that is raised on behalf of the

appellant before us is that the AAQ monitoring stations are

not located in the downward wind direction so as to provide

correct AAQ analysis. Furthermore, the coal quality has been

varied at different stages i.e. at the stages of submission of

application, the preparation of EIA report and the grant of EC.

The variation of coal quality would result in higher sulphur

emission causing air pollution. There would be significant

difference in the emission rate and the 24-hour maximum

incremental value would be higher.
</p>
<p id="p_111">
</p><p id="p_112">60.   Opposed to this, the submission on behalf of the NTPC

is that at no stage, coal quality and its source were changed so

as to bring the sulphur content higher than 0.5%, which is the

maximum value taken into consideration by the authorities

concerned at any stage till the grant of EC. Reliance has also

been placed upon MoEF's circular dated 19th January, 2011,

which clarifies that a firm coal linkage is required only at the

stage of grant of EC and not at the stage of TOR, which implies

that previous activities may be undertaken with tentative

source of coal and tentative emission characteristics. A firm

coal source is to be provided at the EC stage only. In relation

to monitoring stations, it is stated that wind direction has

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                              43</span>
 been kept in mind while installing the monitoring stations and

there would be no pollution resulting from the project.


</p><p id="p_113">61. As per the TOR granted by MoEF on 30th March 2009,

one of the requirements of the TORs for undertaking detailed

EIA study, was pertaining to the setting up of at least one

monitoring station in the pre-dominant downwind direction at

the location where maximum ground level concentration is

likely to occur [Ref: TOR Condition No. 3(xi)]. A perusal of the

EIA report placed on record and the documents provided by

the appellant regarding the meteorological conditions of the

area vis-à-vis the pre-dominant wind direction at the project

site, it is observed that the selection of the air sampling sites

has been not as per the above requirement. There has been no

sampling site in the zone of down-wind direction. In this

regard, it is important to consider the importance of the TOR

in the present circumstances, in the interest of justice.


</p><p id="p_114">62. Atmosphere, by its nature, has a tendency to maintain

homogenous quality. Hence, until there is a significant source

of pollution, the quality of air would remain almost same in

any direction in a particular area at a particular time. When

air pollution is added from any source, composition of

atmosphere changes. The        concentration of air pollutants

depends not only on the quantities that are emitted from air

pollution sources but also on the ability of the atmosphere to

either absorb or disperse these emissions. The air pollution


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                               44</span>
 concentration varies spatially and temporarily, causing the air

pollution pattern to change with different locations and time

due   to   changes     in   meteorological    and    topographical

conditions. The sources of air pollutants include vehicles,

industries, domestic sources and natural sources. In the

present case, the question of pollution has to be examined

keeping in view the fact that the surrounding areas are green

areas. The pollution emitted from the nearby villages and

traffic is existent but it is likely to be small, which may alter

the AAQ marginally at the local level. Due to dispersion and

dilution in the vast atmosphere, its impact on AAQ of larger

area may not be very significant. However, the downwind

monitoring station would have given the actual prevailing AAQ

level with respect to particulate matter, sulphur-di-oxide and

oxides of nitrogen near human settlements. The data would

have been helpful in providing the prevailing background

pollution levels in the area, which is important to see the

actual impact on the AAQ after the thermal power plant is in

operation. Thus, the requirement of TOR has not been met by

NTPC for reasons best known to it.
</p>
<p id="p_115">
</p><p id="p_116">63. The issue regarding the coal linkage and its quality is to

be handled at the MoEF level, as per circular issued on 19th

January 2011 by MoEF, which stated as below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">           "It is clarified that firm coal linkage is required to be
           ensured at the stage of consideration of grant of EC
           and not at the stage of TOR."
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                                  45</span>
<p id="p_117"> 64. The above circular of MoEF, makes it very clear that firm

coal linkage is essential at the time of grant of EC and not at

the stage of TOR.    However, without the actual information

pertaining to the coal quality, especially in terms of sulphur

and ash-content, it would be unrealistic to work out proper

impact on AAQ due to the proposed power plant. It is stated

by Mr. Ritwick Dutta, learned counsel for the Appellant, that

the sulphur content was taken as 0.35% during the time of

the preparation of EIA Report whereas at the time of grant of

EC the sulphur content was mentioned as 0.5% which is

higher. DEIAR report indicated sulphur content of 0.35% at

the time of the public hearing, showing that there would be

less impact on AAQ on the ambient levels of sulphur dioxide in

the area due to establishment of the power plant in the area.


</p><p id="p_118">65. NTPC, in its submissions, has accepted that there have

been changes in the coal source and coal quality during the

course of the appraisal of the project. In the DEIAR, Southern

Eastern Coal Ltd. was considered as source of coal and while

at the time of EAC meeting, Talaipalli and Pakri Barwadih

Coal Mines of NTPC were considered as coal-sources. Finally,

the EC was accorded with coal linkage from Barwadih Coal

Mines of NTPC, based on Addendum EIA Report submitted by

NTPC to MoEF indicating sulphur content as 0.5% which is

considerably higher than the earlier projected figure of 0.3% at

the time of Public Hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_119">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                                46</span>
</p><p id="p_120"> 66. The appellant has submitted that the environmental

impact on air quality was worked out with less Sulphur

content (0.35%) at time of DEIAR which was placed before the

public hearing, but the Sulphur content was higher in coal

(0.5%) at the time of final EC given by MoEF. Sulphur content

was assumed as 0.35% based on the likely coal linkage from

Mand Raigarh coal field and based on 0.35% sulphur content

in the coal, the impact on AAQ was worked out, whereas at

the time of appraisal of the project and grant of EC by

EAC/MoEF, the sulphur content of the coal was taken as

0.5% due to the coal linkage from the other coal fields which

was on the higher side. In fact, NTPC should have taken the

worst quality of coal into account, especially the sulphur

content should have been taken as 0.5% for working out the

likely impact on the AAQ but the NTPC has taken a lower

sulphur content (0.3%) in coal for working out the impact in

terms of likely increase of sulphur dioxide in the ambient air

levels with the proposed plant at the time of DEIAR.     This

appears to have been deliberately done by the NTPC to project

low impact on AAQ at the time of public hearing, as contended

by the learned counsel of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_121">
</p><p id="p_122">67. The source deliberated upon during the Public Hearing

was different than the one discussed in the EAC meeting.

Later on, the source was again changed during the issuance of

 worst scenario of sulphur content in the coal, the changes in

sulphur content do not seem to matter much in terms of

overall impact on air quality except that at the time of public

may be called for in so far as the question of providing AAQ

monitoring   stations    is   concerned.   The   downward   wind

direction, predominantly being south-east, is evident from the

documents placed on record. These changes have to be

effected upon due visit to the site and ensuring that the AAQ

monitoring stations including on the downwind direction are

situated at such locations that provide a true and correct

picture of AAQ through all the seasons. However, changes in

source and quality of coal may not result in any prejudice to

the environment. It is evident that the worst scenario of

sulphur content in coal has been taken into consideration i.e.

at 0.5%. The change in source of coal or its quality has not

gone above such percentage of 0.5%. Thus, we cannot find

fault with the overall impact on AAQ and the consequential

grant of EC on this ground which has taken into account a

higher level of sulphur content (0.5%) in coal and has put a

condition accordingly.

GENERAL DISCUSSION


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                              48</span>
</p><p id="p_126"> 69. Under the environmental jurisprudence, sustainable

development is a widely accepted principle. In India, it finds

statutory recognition in terms of <a href="/doc/170223725/" id="a_31">Section 20</a> of the National

Green Tribunal Act, 2010.        One of the most significant

precepts to examine sustainable development in the facts of a

given case is the application of the balancing principle or the

principle of proportionality.   The Tribunal has to drive a

balance between the rival factors, the risks associated with

environmental and ecological damage and impact on livelihood

of project-displaced or affected persons on the one hand and

economic and other benefits for the public at large on the

other, upon establishment of the project. A number of factors

need to be considered in this regard. In the framework of

Indian economy, there is a relation between poverty and

environment. Poverty and degraded environment are closely

inter-related, especially where people depend primarily on

natural resources based on their immediate environment for

their livelihood. Restoring natural systems and improving

natural resource management practices at the grass root level

are central to a strategy to eliminate poverty. If we examine, in

the light of the above facts of the present case, then it becomes

evident that the establishment of the thermal power plant at

Kudgi would squarely satisfy the requisites of the doctrine of

proportionality or the balancing principle and thus would fall

within the ambit of permissible sustainable development.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                               49</span>
</p><p id="p_127"> 70. Kudgi is a village located in the Basavana Bagevadi taluk

of Bijapur district in Karnataka, which has a very low per

capita income. There is no large industry or commercial

activity in the district. Thus, the economy of the district and

livelihood of its population is largely dependent on agriculture.

Out of the total geographical area of 10,530 sq.km., 7,760

sq.km. is available for cultivation, which is 74% of the total

area. Of the total area, the district has only 0.19% under

forests. Thus, the ecological sensitivity is also not a serious

cause for not allowing setting up of industry in the district.

Electricity is not only ingrained in modern life but it is also

critical for its continuous existence, as electricity will be the

main source of power produced world-wide. All the modern

energy alternatives are focused on creating electricity by

renewable means, such as wind turbines, solar arrays and

geothermic heating, ultimately using steam to turn large

turbines for producing electricity. Electric power is and will

continue to be one of the most important energy forms

available to the human kind as a whole, and as fossil fuels

steadily run out, more and more dependence upon it will

become     the    standard.     For        economic   development,

industrialization and reducing poverty, electricity has a major

role to play, particularly in the Indian reference.

 establishment of the project. An amount of Rs.134 crores was

allocated for R&amp;R and a major part of it has been distributed.


</p><p id="p_129">72. The economists have reported a systematic relationship

between income changes and environmental quality, the

relationship known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (for

short the "EKC").    The EKC has become standard fare in

technical conversations about environmental policy. Pollution

often appears first to worsen and later to improve as countries'

incomes grow. Because of its resemblance to the pattern of

inequality and income described by Simon Kuznets, this

pattern of pollution and income has been labelled as

Environmental    Kuznets     Curve.   The   logic   of    the   EKC

relationship is intuitively appealing. At the low level of per

capita income found in pre-industrial and agrarian economies,

where most economic activity is subsistence farming, one

might   expect   rather    pristine   environmental      conditions,

relatively unaffected by economic activities, at least for those

pollutants associated with industrial activity. Once income

increases, they prefer to pay for better and cleaner water

quality, better air quality, better sanitation, etc. including

services like sewage and garbage management. Cleaner

technology furthers this cause.

<p id="p_130">
</p><p id="p_131">73. Upon a cogent analysis of the above, it becomes evident

that the present case is not one where the only alternative

available with the Tribunal is to cancel the EC and direct

 complete cancellation of the project. NTPC itself is a public

undertaking and it is the public money, which is at stake. The

principle of balancing would persuade the Tribunal to take an

approach where environmental interests can be protected by

taking certain reasonable and stringent measures and still

ensure that the huge public investment is not permitted to go

waste.   The      area   in   question   needs    development     and

establishment and operationalisation of such a big project is

bound to improve the economy of that area. Certainly, while

permitting     such       development,      the    ecological     and

environmental interests of the area as well as that of the

public at large cannot be permitted to be entirely ignored. At

the same time, irretrievable and irreversible damage to the

environment and ecology cannot be permitted.            Once this is

ensured, permitting the establishment of the TPP would be

sustainable development within the scope of the balancing

principle. Normally, in the present case, the pollution load due

to burning of coal would increase. However, we expect that the

overall impact on environment would be within the prescribed

limits by taking appropriate anti-pollution measures and

strictly complying with the conditions imposed in the order of

EC.

 environmental jurisprudence.          The three principal maxims

governing the field of environment are the sustainable

development,      the   polluter    pays   and    the   precautionary

principles.     Under the Indian environmental jurisprudence,

these   three    principles   are   statutorily   prescribed.   While

permitting industrial development, caution has to be taken

that such development does not disturb the ecology and

environment of the area in question. Furthermore, the

infrastructural development must not adversely affect the

economic and other livelihood activities of the affected

community so as to hamper their livelihood and render them

incapable of resettlement. At this stage, we may also refer to

 most frequently quoted definition is from the
Brundtland Report which states as follows:

"Sustainable development is development that
meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs. It contains within it two key
concepts:
</p><p id="p_136">     The concept of needs, in particular the
essential needs of the world's poor, to which
overriding priority should be given; and
     The idea of limitations imposed by the state of

environment's ability to meet present and future
needs."

<p id="p_137">44. The concept of sustainable development is
rooted in this sort of systems thinking. It helps us to
understand ourselves and our world. The problems
we face are complex and serious - and we can't
address them in the same way we created them.

development, one has to keep in mind the "principle
of proportionality" based on the concept of balance.
It is an exercise in which courts or tribunals have to
balance the priorities of development on the one
hand and environmental protection on the other. So
sustainable development should also mean the type
or extent of development that can take place and
which can be sustained by nature/ecology with or
without mitigation. In these matters, the required
standard now is that the risk of harm to the
environment or to human health is to be decided in
public interest, according to a 'reasonable person's
test. (Refer Research Foundation for <a href="/doc/548962/" id="a_33">Science and

          2013 the Court, while referring to the principles of
          balance inbuilt in the concept of sustainable
          development, elaborated the principles as follows:

</p><p id="p_139">          "228.     I    have    referred   to   the    aforesaid
          pronouncements only to highlight that this Court
          has emphasized on striking a balance between the
          ecology and environment on one hand and the
          projects of public utility on the other. The trend of
          authorities is that a delicate balance has to be
          struck between the ecological impact and
          development. The other principle that has been
          ingrained is that if a project is beneficial for the
          larger public, inconvenience to smaller number of
          people is to be accepted. It has to be respectfully
          accepted as a proposition of law that individual
          interest or, for that matter, smaller public interest
          must yield to the larger public interest.
</p><p id="p_140">          Inconvenience of some should be bypassed for a
          larger interest or cause of the society. But, the
          present case really does not fall within the four
          corners of that principle. It is not a case of the land
          oustees. It is not a case of "some inconvenience". It
          is not comparable to the loss caused to property. I
          have already emphasized upon the concept of living
          with the borrowed time of the future generation
          which essentially means not to ignore the inter-
          generational interests. Needless to emphasize, the
          dire need of the present society has to be treated
          with urgency, but, the said urgency cannot be
          conferred with absolute supremacy over life. Ouster
          from land or deprivation of some benefit of different
          nature      relatively   would    come    within     the
          compartment of smaller public interest or certain
          inconveniences. But when it touches the very atom
          of life, which is the dearest and noblest possession
          of every person, it becomes the obligation of the
          constitutional courts to see how the delicate balance
          has been struck and can remain in a continuum in
          a sustained position. To elaborate, unless adequate
          care, caution and monitoring at every stage is taken
          and there is constant vigil, life of "some" can be in
          danger. That will be totally shattering of the
          constitutional       guarantee     enshrined     under
          <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_38">Article 21</a> of the Constitution."

          nurturing of the vital resources, that still remain,
          are the sine qua non for good environmental
          management. Conservation as an idea is not merely
          confined to retaining whatever that is left, but
          involves a whole range of activities aimed at
          rejuvenation and propagation.
</p><p id="p_144">          2). PROTECTION: Securing the resource and
          insulating it from any shocks of destruction and
          degradation is in contemplation here.
</p><p id="p_145">          3). NON-DEGRADATION:             Ensuring        the
          intrinsic quality of the resources is not lost, while
          putting the same to use, and constitutes the basic
          tenet of proper and scientific resource use.
</p><p id="p_146">          4). ADMINISTRATION that is TRANSPARENT,
          ACCOUNTABLE and PARTICIPATORY is a major
          requirement. This acknowledges the fact that the
          resources cannot be managed from above and
          finding local solutions to environmental problems
          would ensure effective and efficient environmental
          management.
</p><p id="p_147">          5). LAW,      POLICY        AND      PRACTICE     in
          environmental management should emerge from
          and evolve out of people's needs and compulsions
          and be the result of crystallized home spun wisdom.

          aspect of the system of administration. The litmus

unreasonableness,     it   will     require    judicial
intervention and the Courts can set right the
decision making process.
</p>
<p id="p_160">19. This doctrine covers various facets of
arbitrariness. The Courts, more than often, have
applied this principle to examine the merits or
otherwise of the contentions. In the case of
Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v.
</p><p id="p_161">Wednesbury       Corporation 1947      (2)     AELR
680 enunciating the aspects of unreasonableness in
executive action of the public authorities, it was
stated that if the power is exercised so as to give
impression or inference to the Court that there has
been unreasonableness in such action, it is taken in
bad faith extraneous circumstances have been
taken into consideration, there has been disregard
of public policy and relevant consideration have
been ignored then authorities would be said to have
acted unreasonable. Lord Greene, M.R., expressing
the unanimous view observed as under:

<p id="p_162">"He must exclude from his consideration matters
which are irrelevant to the matter that he has to
consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may
truly be said, and often is said, to be acting
"Unreasonably." Similarly, you may have something
so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream
that it lay within the powers of the authority.
WARRINGTON, L.J. I think it was, gave the example
of the red-haired teacher, dismissed because she
had red hair. That is unreasonable in one sense. In
another sense it is taking into consideration
extraneous matters. It is so unreasonable that it
might almost be described as being done in bad
faith. In fact, all these things largely fall under one
head."
</p>
<p id="p_163">     The aforesaid Wednesbury's principle has not
only been adopted in various pronouncements by
the Hon'ble Apex Court, but even its expanded
principles have been applied extensively by other
Courts.    The    apparent   unreasonableness      in
executive action, whatever be its foundations, would
normally invite chastisism upon judicial scrutiny.
The requirement of fairness is in built in every rule
and regulation be it an executive or an
administrative act. This basic rule of law is ab
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                     59</span>
 antique and its application has been consistently
expanded.
</p>
<p id="p_164">20. As already noticed, it is neither evident from
the order nor from any records produced before the
Tribunal that the finding returned in the impugned
order that it was a hilly terrain was well reasoned. It
appears to be a finding that has been recorded on
the basis of certain conjectures and surmises. The
relevant and material documents that had been
produced by the appellant have been ignored. In
other words, relevant considerations have been
ignored while irrelevant and imaginary facts have
been taken into consideration for arriving at the
conclusion, which in our mind, cannot be sustained
in view of the fundamental principle of Wednesbury.
This clearly reflects the element of arbitrariness in
the action of the respondent. The administrative
action which is tainted with the element of
arbitrariness cannot be sustained in law. An
administrative order must be free of arbitrariness
and bias. We cannot help but take note of the legal
proceedings that have repeatedly taken place in the
present case. On all those occasions, the order
passed by the respondent was set aside on one
ground or the other. This Tribunal even directed the
appellant to deposit Rs. 1.5 Lakhs in order to
ensure remedying of the damage caused, if any, to
the ecology or the environment around the site. This
deposit of Rs. 1.5 Lakhs was made subject to the
final order that may be passed by the authorities.
The authorities have not even cared to touch upon
that point in the impugned order. We are of the
considered view that the authorities have compelled
the appellant to approach the court and the
Tribunal time and again, that too, without valid and
good reasons. It is expected of a public authority to
act in accordance with the law, fairly and without
inducing the element of arbitrariness and bias.
There is a specific obligation upon such authorities
to ensure that they do not generate avoidable
litigation. Hence, fairness in their action is a pre-
requisite to ensure an efficacious discharge of their
statutory obligations. In our considered view, the
authorities, in the facts and circumstances of the
present case, have not acted with complete fairness
and have compelled the appellant to approach the
courts and the Tribunal repeatedly, without any
specific fault being attributed to him. Thus, he is
entitled to receive the costs of the present
proceedings".

<p id="p_165"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                                     60</span>
</p><p id="p_166"> 80. The above enunciated law makes it clear that the order of

the authorities has to be a speaking order and must be

founded on relevant and material considerations. If material

factors are ignored, then there is every likelihood that the

order would stand vitiated partly or even in its entirety.     A

number of factors, which have material bearing on the life of

the people, environment and ecology of the area, have not

been made the basis of discussion of the authorities. These

objections had been specifically raised, as noticed above, and

it is not evident from the report as to why they were not

considered at all, or even if partially considered, as to why

they were not certainly considered in their correct perspective.

It may be noticed that R&amp;R plan, post-EC, loses its relevance,

impact and very purpose. The purpose of an R&amp;R plan is to

put people displaced or ousted due to the project on notice

and propose to them as to how their future is expected to be

dealt with upon establishment of the project.


PUBLIC HEARING OR PUBLIC CONSULTATION:
</p>
<p id="p_167">
</p><p id="p_168">81.   The   EIA    Notification   has   different   stages   like

categorization of projects, screening, scoping, appraisal and

grant or refusal of EC.   Screening, as indicated by the very

language of the expression is to screen and scrutinize the

application submitted by the NTPC in accordance with

provisions of the EIA Notification.     Scoping refers to the

process by which the EAC or the State Level Expert Appraisal

 Committee, depending upon the category of the project, would

process the said application, prepare the TOR and submit a

report, as contemplated under the said Notification.


</p><p id="p_169">82.   Public hearing/public consultation is one of the most

significant requirements which the authorities concerned are

required to satisfy before an EC could be issued in accordance

with law. The EIA Notification attaches a specific value and

makes the public hearing/public consultation mandatory,

non-compliance of which could have serious repercussions on

the fate of the application for EC and the order thereupon. At

this stage, we must clarify that public consultation and public

hearings are not synonymous terms. However, the purpose of

both of them is the same i.e. to provide due opportunity to the

project-affected or the project-displaced persons to put up

their grievances in anticipation of the project being established

at the site in question. In terms of regulation 7 (III) (v) of the

EIA Notification, it has been clarified beyond ambiguity that if

the public agency or authority nominated, reports to the

regulatory authority concerned that owing to the local

situation, it is not possible to conduct public hearing in a

manner which will enable the views of the local persons

concerned, to be freely expressed, it shall report the facts in

detail to the regulatory authority concerned, which may, after

due consideration of the report and other reliable information,

decide that the public consultation in the case need not

include the public hearing. The public consultation is stated

 to have two components, firstly a public hearing at the site or

in its close proximity, district-wise and secondly, obtaining

responses in writing from all other persons concerned having

a plausible stake in the project or activity.     Normally, both

public hearing and public consultation are required to be

complied with. However, as afore-noticed, there could be

cases, of course as an exception, where it is not possible to

hold public hearing and only public consultation may serve

the ends for consideration of an application for EC.


</p><p id="p_170">83.   Broadly speaking, public hearing is to provide an

opportunity to the persons likely to be directly affected by the

establishment of the project while the public response, as an

ingredient of public consultation, would be from the persons

who have some interest in the environmental aspects of the

project, but may not even be directly affected persons.


</p><p id="p_171">84.   At the public hearing, various affected persons would

raise their grievances or objections to the project or activity

which the NTPC is expected to answer and also provide due

satisfactory resolution of the problems so posed. In the

present   case,    various   objections   were   raised   by   the

persons/villagers affected by the establishment of the project.

At this stage, we may notice the following objections which

were raised on behalf of the farmers of Kudgi village by

persons present:
</p>
<p id="p_172">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                                                63</span>
</p><p id="p_173"> (a) The total population of Kudgi, Telagi, Masuti and

   Golsangi villages, which are covered under the said

   project is nearly 50,000 and the power project is being

   established very near to the said villages. This will cause

   the noise pollution and will create ill-effects on the

   villagers.
</p>
<p id="p_174">(b) The coal used in the proposed project contains the

   sulphur and due to the continuous burning of the coal,

   there will be increase in temperature by 2 degree

   Celsius in the surrounding area by which the existing

   lands will become barren.
</p>
<p id="p_175">(c) The ash generated due to burning of the coal will fall on

   the crops in the surrounding area, especially on the

   leaves and will affect the chlorophyll pigment present in

   the leaves and interrupt the photosynthetic activity of

   the plants and crops, as a result of which the growth of

   the crops and plants in the area will be retarded.

</p><p id="p_176">(d) The ash generated after the burning of the coal will be

   disposed of in the form of slurry which percolates into

   the land and finally meets the water bodies and water

   sources like nalas, open wells, bore wells existing at the

   downstream of the project and get polluted.

</p><p id="p_177">(e) Kudgi is well known for its betel leaf crop since 100

   years. The betel leaves are very sensitive and delicate.

   The ash particles falling on these leaves may destroy the

   entire crop.

</p><p id="p_179"> (f) The availability of the water at the Almatti dam during

   the summer season is less than 1 TMC and the

   requirement of the water for the proposed project is 5

   TMC. Under such circumstances, it is not possible to

   control the temperature by adopting latest water

   sprinkling technology.
</p>
<p id="p_180">(g) As per the rules and opinion of the scientists, such

   projects should not be established near the villages

   inhabited by the people and by violating the same, it is

   not fair to establish the same and is unacceptable as the

   authorities concerned have disturbed the will of the

   innocent farmers who are ignorant about the project.

</p><p id="p_181">(h) As   per   the   Constitution,   such   project   shall   be

   established at the bank of the rivers or oceans whereas

   the said project is being proposed at the centre of the

   four inhabited villages.

<p id="p_182">(i) The project area mainly consists of irrigated lands and

   our national bird, peacock, existed on the bank of the

   lake area along with other birds and animals and the

   establishment of such project may vanish the generation

   of such species.

    will add to the unhygienic environmental conditions

   resulting in the spread of many diseases.
</p>
<p id="p_184">(k) The entire Kudgi village has to be shifted and the people

   will be forced to migrate to unknown places and will

   become the wanderers, thereby delinking their all the

   past memories, ancestors and cardiac relations that

   they had with their existing places. This type of activity

   will snatch the freedom, peaceful living in their choiced

   place and rights, as guaranteed by the Constitution to

   the citizens of India.
</p>
<p id="p_185">(l) Clarifications were sought on the motto of the proposed

   establishment of the 4000 mw coal based thermal power

   plant at the Kudgi village of Basavana, which is famous

   for cultivation of betel leaves.
</p>
<p id="p_186">(m) There is stiff opposition to the TPP all over and in every

   corner of the world, as it will be dangerous to the

   environment and cause great damage to bio-diversity of

   the area. It will also affect the terrestrial, aquatic and

   aerobic environment.
</p>
<p id="p_187">(n) The establishment of the TPP near Almatti dam will

   affect the dam. During rainy season, the ash slurry will

   be carried away by the storm waters and get deposited

   at the dam whereby the stored water at the dam cannot

   be utilised. About 4 to 6 ft. deep ash will get deposited

   in the river every year and it is not known which type of

    technology will be adopted to de-silt the ash from the

   river.
</p>
<p id="p_188">(o) The major occupation of most of the families whose

   lands are being acquired is agriculture and horticulture.

   The approximate annual income per acre of land by

   cultivating the crops like betel leaf, onions, grapes and

   bananas etc. is about Rs.2 lakhs. Now such people are

   losing their lands and they have to migrate to other

   places like refugees and have to search for respectable

   means of livelihood and employment at different places,

   which is not possible.

   against the MLAs, NTPC officials and Pollution Control

   Board and other officers present in the meeting and

   went away by completely opposing the power project.

   The      Deputy   Commissioner       and   the    President,

   Environmental     Public   Hearing   Committee,    Bijapur,

   while addressing the meeting said that the appeals,

<p id="p_194">86.   From the above, it is clear that an appropriate R&amp;R

scheme was not available at the time of the public hearing.

Also, the other objections raised at the public hearing were not

properly answered during the public hearing. The Committee

concluded that major issues had been noticed but it is evident

that the nature and category of the land, location of

monitoring stations, shifting of coal and deficiencies in the

R&amp;R plan were not dealt with in consonance with the TOR.

The R&amp;R plan, which was to be prepared within four months,

in fact, had not been placed before the competent authorities

at the time of consideration or even after the grant of the EC.

The objections raised at the public hearing were intended to

 bring to the fore the problems and difficulties which the

affected persons were to face as a result of the establishment

of the project which may be even beyond the environmental

issues. The Public Hearing Committee is expected to hear and

record its opinion so as to bring before the EAC the essence of

the public hearing and providing pros and cons of the project

in question. If this is not strictly adhered to, the EAC would be

kept in the dark in relation to the actual position or ground

realities at the site in relation to the project. This, besides

being a legal flaw in the compliance with the EIA Notification,

also deprives the affected persons of a valuable right.


</p><p id="p_195">87.   It is now contended before us that there was no

scientific basis submitted by the villagers to substantiate their

apprehensions. This, to our mind, is a clear misappreciation of

the scheme under the EIA Notification. Onus is not on the

objectors to prove their objections by leading scientific

evidence at that stage. It is the duty of the EAC to examine

the worth of the objections raised and the consequences

thereof. It was, in fact, for the NTPC to show that the various

apprehensions of the objectors were not well-founded, and

that the project is not likely to do any environmental damage

or cause deprivation of the livelihood and income of the

project-affected persons. The onus squarely lies upon the

NTPC to bring the establishment and operation of the project

within the ambit of balanced sustained development.

fairness and [WP (Civil) No. 9340/2009] the
requirement of the administrative decision-making
body to furnish reasons for its decision. The
ultimate question is whether the non- compliance
with any of the above procedural requirements
vitiates the grant of environmental clearance to
Respondent No.3.

public hearing a meaningful one with full
participation of all interested persons who may have
a point of view to state. The above clauses
operationalise the de-centralised decision making in
a democratic set up where the views of those who
are likely to be affected by a decision are given a say
and an opportunity to voice their concerns. This
procedure is intended to render the decision fair
and participative and not thrust from above on a
people who may be unaware of the implications of
the decision. In the above background, it is not
possible to agree with the stand of the Respondents
1 and 3 that there is no requirement in terms of the
above clauses to make available the Executive
Summary of the EIA Report Project to the persons
likely to be affected at least 30 days in advance of
the public hearing. If their participation [WP (Civil)
No. 9340/2009] has to be meaningful, informed and
meaningful, then they must have full information of
the pros and cons of the proposed project and the

record the objections, the case of the project proponent and

their reasoned views on the subject.
</p>
<p id="p_203">90. Reference can also be made to another judgment of Delhi

High Court in the case of Samarth Trust v. Union of India and

Ors. [Writ Petition (Civil) No.9317 of 2009] wherein while

discussing      what   is    the     purpose   of     a    public   hearing

contemplated under the environmental laws, it was held that

"A public hearing is a form of participatory justice giving a

voice to the voiceless (particularly to those who have no

immediate access to courts) and a place and occasion to them

to express their views with regard to a project." The nature

and scope of a public hearing has to be participatory, objective

and in accordance with the manner prescribed under the EIA

Notification.    It   must    give    adequate      notice    for   effective

participation.    Public     hearing    must     be       conducted    in   a

disciplined     manner, faithfully with video-recording done

truthfully. Recording of the minutes of the public hearing

must be fair.
</p>
<p id="p_204">
</p><p id="p_205">91. Examined in the light of the above stated principles in

the present case, the most serious objections are in relation to

the category and nature of the land, absence of complete and

comprehensive R&amp;R plan, effects of the location of AAQ

stations and source and quality of the coal, which find no

 mention, much less appropriate discussion in the public

hearing minutes.
</p>
<p id="p_206">
</p><p id="p_207">92. Moreover, even in the recommendatory findings, these

issues are conspicuous by their absence or have not been

appropriately dealt with. Grant of EC is not only intended to

lay down conditions with regard to such essential features of

the project but also to ensure that appropriate remedy or relief

is provided to the persons displaced by the project or whose

lands are acquired. This undoubtedly has prejudicially

affected the entire purpose of the public hearing and

consequently the order passed thereupon.




RELIEF:
</p>
<p id="p_208">93. The above discussion on the various legal and factual

aspects of the present case brings us to the last issue as to

what   relief   can   the   Tribunal   grant   in    the   facts   and

circumstances of the present case. The defects in the process

of grant of EC crept in right at the initial stages and have

proceeded till the end. We have already held that there was

an improper declaration in regard to the nature and category

of the land acquired for the project. Furthermore, during the

public hearing, there was non-declaration and non-disclosure

of material factors like R&amp;R scheme, source and quality of coal

and location of AAQ monitoring stations.            It had adversely

affected the interests of the persons likely to be affected by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                                                    74</span>
 project. The EAC, while recommending the establishment of

the project, did not seriously dwell upon these very material

issues and even permitted that the R&amp;R scheme could be

declared within four months of the recommendation. Despite

this, R&amp;R scheme was not presented even after the passing of

the order of the EC.         Thus there has been violation of the

provisions of the EIA Notification and violation of the

prescribed procedure. As opposed to this, the Tribunal cannot

ignore the fact that huge public money has already been

invested in the project, large scale acquisition has been

completed and even majority of the land owners have been

paid compensation. The basic development has taken place

and contracts for establishment for the project have been

awarded. Cancellation of the project and setting aside of EC

in its entirety may result in wastage of substantial public

funds as well as rendering the entire development project

ineffective.    The project, if properly completed with due

protection     in   regard   to   environmental   issues   and   the

rehabilitation schemes, would help in improvement of socio-

economic conditions of the area in question and the people

living therein. It would also help in increasing the per capita

income, as already noticed. The project would go a long way

in uplifting the economy, the ecology and the environmental

conditions of the area as well as providing adequate R&amp;R

scheme    to    the   project-affected   and   displaced   persons.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                                                  75</span>
 Economic growth has a direct nexus with the improvement in

environmental measures.

principle of sustainable development, we have to pass

directions which will ensure compliance with all the conditions

that may be imposed for protection of environment, ecology

and prevention of pollution in the proposed order granting the

EC. There has to be a definite and unambiguous R&amp;R scheme

in place before the project can be permitted to be fully

established and completely made operational.        Thus, while

partially allowing this main application, we pass the following

order &amp; directions for their strict compliance by all concerned

in the given facts and circumstances:

matters of the proposed project, as it may consider necessary,

whether or not specifically covered under this judgment.

recommend imposition of compensation or any other sum

payable for causing environmental degradation, and/or for

improper disclosure of facts in its application and non-

compliance of the terms and conditions of the TOR, the EC,

including non-timely furnishing of R&amp;R scheme by the NTPC.

compensation for acquisition of their land, including the

persons otherwise displaced.
