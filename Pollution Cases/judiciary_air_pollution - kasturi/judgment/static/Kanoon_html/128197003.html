              A.MUHAMED MUSTAQUE, J.
          =========================
                  W.P(C).No.29508 of 2013
          ============================
            Dated this the 08th day of April, 2015

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner entered in the service of Kerala State Pollution

Control Board as Assistant Engineer on 28.07.1978. The petitioner

thereafter was promoted on higher cadre and finally was appointed

as full time Member Secretary of the Kerala State Pollution Control

Board on 16.04.2005. While petitioner officiating Member

Secretary, he was appointed as Chairman of the Board. The date

of superannuation of the petitioner was on 31.03.2010.           The

petitioner was appointed as Chairman of the Board on 31.08.2009.

The petitioner was removed from the post of Chairman as per

Government order dated 20.11.2010.          Petitioner was able to

continue after the superannuation on account of his appointment

as Chairman of the Board. The petitioner was terminated in terms

of Rule 5(3) of Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

1974. Petitioner approached this Court for disbursal of pensionary

benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   In this matter, a third party got impleaded as per

I.A.No.14381 of 2014.      He points out that at his instance,

petitioner along with others were trapped while accepting bribe of

W.P(C).No.29508 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>


`15,00,000/-. It is further submitted that petitioner challenged

his removal from service as per I.A.No.11235 of 2010 and same

was dismissed.        It is also submitted that Government has

granted permission for him to initiate criminal action against

the writ petitioner. The intervener opposed granting terminal

benefits to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.     The Board filed a counter affidavit through Member

Secretary. In the counter in para 5, it is stated as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "As the petitioners service for the period

           from 01.04.2010 to 21.11.2010 was not treated as

           re-employment, he continued to receive the same

           salary which he was receiving earlier. Hence

           Government was also addressed to consider the

           same to fix the salary for the above period vide

           letter No.PCB/E2/949/10 dated 07.12.2011 which

           is produced herewith and may be marked as

           Ext.R2(d)"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">It is also stated in the counter, Board has sanctioned provisional

pension to the petitioner with effect from 22.11.2010. In the

counter affidavit filed by the Board, it would reveal that Board

could not pay the pensionary benefits to the petitioner on

account of the delay in responding to their request by the

Government for treating the period from 01.04.2010 to

21.11.2010.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>


</p><p id="p_6">      4.    The right to obtain pensionary benefit is a right to

property as stated in the judgment of the Supreme Court in

State of Jharghand Vs. Jitendra Kumar Srivastava (2013

(3) KLT 782(SC)). There is no proceeding concluded against

the petitioner for declining pensionary benefits. The criminal

case against the petitioner is also not concluded. If any loss is

caused to the State or Board on account of payment of terminal

benefits, same has to be protected. Therefore, with a liberty to

recover the same and without prejudice to the ongoing criminal

prosecution, petitioner shall be paid his terminal benefits. The

petitioner's claim for reckoning the period from 01.04.2010 can

be decided only after obtaining the views of the Government.

</p><p id="p_7">      In the light of the above, the following directions are

issued:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (i)    The terminal benefits shall be paid to

          the petitioner, treating the date of superannuation

          on 31.03.2010, within a period of two months fromt

          eh date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                (ii)   The   benefit   of   the   period  from

          01.04.2010 till 20.11.2010 can be reckoned only

          based on the decision of the Government.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                (iii)  Government shall take a decision for

          reckoning    the   period    from     01.04.2010  till

          20.11.2010 within a period of four months.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>


</p><p id="p_9">                (iv)   The payment of terminal benefits will

          not exculpate the petitioner from any of the

          criminal charges levelled against him nor will

          absolve him from any liability to the State or to the

          Board from proceeding for recovery.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     The Writ Petition is disposed of . No costs
