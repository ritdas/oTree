</p><p id="p_2">                   The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with
          Khunti P.S. Case No. 137 of 2015, corresponding to G.R. Case No. 393
          of 2015, registered for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_1">Sections 379</a>,
          <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_2">414</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 21 of Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of
          Pollution) Act</a>, Under Section 54 of Jharkhand Minor Minerals
          Concessions Rules, 2004 &amp; Under <a href="/doc/1195854/" id="a_5">Section 4(1)</a> of Mines &amp; Minerals
          ( Development &amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_6">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957.
</p><p id="p_3">                   It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the
          petitioner that the petitioner is the proprietor of Dandoul Stone Mine
          &amp; Crusher and he was running the crusher on the basis of a valid
          mining lease executed on 8.1.2015, which was valid for a period of
          ten years. It has further been submitted that after obtaining the
          mining lease, necessary application was made before the Jharkhand
          State Pollution Control Board for obtaining No Objection Certificate. It
          has also been submitted that the petitioner had obtained the Consent
          to Establish by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, Ranchi on
          10.08.2015 and on the basis of inspection report it was subsequently
          granted the Consent to Operate on 28.08.2015. Learned counsel
          submits that in view of <a href="/doc/159582911/" id="a_7">Section 29</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control
          of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981, the petitioner had already made an
          application before the Pollution Control Board and in view of proviso
          to Sub Section (2) of <a href="/doc/159582911/" id="a_9">Section 29</a>, the petitioner would be deemed to
          have permission to operate Crusher Machine with the consent of the
          Board. Learned counsel therefore submits that since after making an
          application for giving consent to operate, the petitioner had started to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -2-</span>
operate his crusher plant and therefore there being no offence made
out, the petitioner deserves anticipatory bail. Learned counsel has
referred to the order passed in A.B.A. No. 3545 of 2015, in which the
owner of the seized vehicle has been granted anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_4">         Mrs.   Richa   Sanchita,   learned   counsel   appearing    for
Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, at the request of the Court,
has put in appearance and has submitted that <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_10">Section 19</a> of the Air
(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 deals with the power
to declare air pollution control areas. It has been submitted that in
the year 1988, by a gazette notification, the entire State was
declared an air pollution control area and therefore in terms of
<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_12">Section 21</a> of the Act, deemed operation of an industrial plant is
applicable only when any person is operating an industrial plant
immediately before an air pollution control area is declared as such. It
has further been submitted that in view of <a href="/doc/196860895/" id="a_13">Sections 19</a> and <a href="/doc/95877183/" id="a_14">20</a> of the
Act, the petitioner was precluded from starting his production before
the necessary consent to operate issued by the Pollution Control
Board after due inquiry.
</p><p id="p_5">         It is not in dispute that the petitioner had obtained a lease
valid for a period of 10 years and had also made an application
before the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board for giving him
permission to operate the plant. <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_15">Section 21</a>, which has much been
harped upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner is with respect
to restrictions on use of certain industrial plants wherein it has been
envisaged that no person shall without the previous consent of the
State Board, establish or operate any industrial plant in an air
pollution control area. Admittedly, the consent to operate was given
by the Pollution Control Board on 28.08.2015 after the institution of
the FIR wherein it was alleged that Crusher Machine was already
operating when it was alleged that stone chips were loaded in the
truck from the crusher plant of the petitioner. The FIR further
discloses that Crusher Machine was running without taking consent
and the same in absence of consent or no objection certificate from
Pollution Control Board was against <a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_16">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 could not have operated.
Moreover, it has been alleged that only three challans for three trucks
were in existence whereas the petitioner had sold eight trucks
materials which also substantiates the allegation with respect to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                -3-</span>
<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_18">section 379</a> and <a href="/doc/94452/" id="a_19">414</a> of IPC.
</p><p id="p_6">          In the circumstances, enumerated above, I am not inclined
to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Hence his prayer for
anticipatory bail is, accordingly, rejected.
</p>
