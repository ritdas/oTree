MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                 3


                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">D.H.WAGHELA, CJ (Oral)

</p><p id="p_2">1.    Learned       counsel    Mr.V.Y.Kumar       appears    for

respondent Nos.2 and 4.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    Learned counsel for the petitioners fairly conceded

that out of the prayers made in last paragraph of the

petitions, only prayers (k) and (l) are surviving, in view of

the   fact   that   1st   respondent's   plant   at   Yelahanka,

Bangalore, has been closed since 24.08.2013 and the

consent given to the plant earlier under the provisions of

the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

have since then not been renewed.          As far the prayers

contained in (k) and (l), the petitioners propose to have the

petitions transferred to the appropriate Bench of the

National Green Tribunal for appropriate adjudication.


</p><p id="p_4">3.    Learned counsel for the respondents having no

objection, the petitions are disposed as transferred to the

National Green Tribunal, with liberty to the petitioners to

apply for suitable amendments to the petitions. The

Registry shall do the needful for transferring the petitions

to the Chennai Bench of the National Green Tribunal, as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 4</span>

early as practicable.     Accordingly, the petitions stand

disposed as far as this Court is concerned.       It is further

clarified at the instance of learned counsel for the

petitioners that in case the plant in question resumes its

operation, it would be a fresh cause of action for the

petitioners or any other affected body if its operations are

carried   on   in   violation   of   the   provisions   of   the

environmental laws.
