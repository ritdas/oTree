<div class="doc_bench">Bench: V Aggarwal</div>

<p id="p_1"><a href="/doc/90469007/" id="a_1">JUDGMENT

 

V.S. Aggarwal, J</a>.
</p>
  

<p id="p_2"> 1. By   this   common    judgment,   Criminal   Revision
 Nos.441/2002, 442/2002,   443/2002  and444/2002   can
 conveniently be disposed together.  Since it was not disputed
 that  question involved in all the petitions is  identical,
 therefore, for sake of convenience, the facts are being taken
 from Crl.R.441/2002 - Bhupinder Tandon versus Vikas Mangla. 
</p>  

<p id="p_3"> 2. The revision petitions have been directed against the
 order passed by  the Metropolitan  Magistrate,  Karkardooma
 Courts,  Shahdara,  Delhi dated 1.3.2002.  The learned trial
 Court dismissed  the application filed by  the  petitioners
 praying for their discharge. 
</p> 
  

<p id="p_4"> 3. The  relevant facts are that the respondent had filed
 a  complaint  under Section 138 read with <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_2">Section 142</a> of  the
 Negotiable  Instruments Act, 1881 (for short "the Act").   It
 had  been alleged that M/s. Pavilion Telematics India  Limited
 is  a limited company.   Narender Tandon  is the  Director
 besides  the petitioners.  The petitioners were stated to  be
 taking active part in running the business of the company and
 are  in charge of the affairs and responsible for the  conduct
 of  the business of the company.  Certain goods are stated to
 have  been  purchased by the company. Narender  Tandon  had
 issued two cheques, which were dishonoured on presenting the
 same. The  said cheques were issued with the knowledge  and
 consent of the petitioners.  After due notice and other legal
 formalities, the complaint, as such, had been filed. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_5"> 4. The petitioners filed an application for dropping the
 proceedings  against them.  They pleaded that the  complaint,
 as  against them, is not maintainable because they ceased  to
 be the Directors of the company from 30.10.1999 and 30.6.1997
 respectively. Furthermore,  it  was alleged that  there  is
 nothing  to  show  that  at the  relevant  time,  both these
 petitioners  were  in-charge  and were responsible  for  the
 conduct  of  the business of the company.  Consequently,  the
 rigours of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_3">Section 141</a> of the Act are not attracted. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_6">  5. Needless  to  state that the application was  opposed
 and  the learned trial Court held that so far as the question
 as  to whether the petitioner had ceased to be the  directors
 of the company is concerned, the matter will be decided after
 recording  of evidence.   So far  as the  fact  that   the
 petitioners were not alleged to be connected with the affairs
 of  the  company  or that they were not responsible  for  the
 conduct  of  business of the company is concerned, the trial
 Court found that  necessary  averments  existed  in   the
 complaint.  Hence the present revision petitions. 
</p>
  

<p id="p_7"> 6. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_4">Section  141</a> of the Act deals with the situation when
 the  offence  is  purported  to have been  committed  by  the
 companies.  It unfolds itself in the following words: 
</p>   

<p id="p_8"> 141.   Offences by companies.-- (1) If  the
person committing an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> is a company, every person who, at the time of
offence was committed, was in charge of,  and
was  responsible  to,  the   company  for  the
conduct of  the business of the  company,  as
well  as  the company, shall be deemed to  be
guilty of the offence and shall be liable  to
be proceeded against and punished accordingly;
.Provided  that nothing contained  in
this  sub-section  shall   render  any person
liable to  punishment if he proves  that  the
offence was committed with out his knowledge or
that  he  had exercised all due diligence  to
prevent the commission of such offence. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_9"> (2)  Notwithstanding  anything contained  in
sub-section  (1), where any offence under this
Act  has been committed by a company and it is
proved that  the offence has  been  committed
with  the  consent  or connivance  of, or  is
attributable  to,  any neglect on the part  of
any  director, manager,  secretary  or other
officer  of  the   company,  such   director,
manager, secretary or other officer shall also
be  deemed  to be guilty of that  offence  and
shall  be  liable to be proceeded against  and
punished accordingly.  
</p> 
 

<p id="p_10"> Explanation.   --  For the purposes  of  this
section.  - 
</p> 
   

<p id="p_11"> (a)  "company" means any body corporated  and
includes  a  firm  or other  association  of
individuals;  and  
 
 

</p><p id="p_12"> (b) "director",  in relation to a firm, means a
partner in the firm.   
</p> 
 

<p id="p_13">  7. Perusal  of the aforesaid would clearly show that  if
 the  offence  is  purported  to have been  committed  by  the
 company,  at  that  time  a person who was  in charge  of  and
 responsible to the company for conduct of the business of the
 company  as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty
 of  the said offence also.  There is a proviso to sub-Section
 (1)  of  <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_6">Section  141</a> that he can prove his innocence if  he
 establishes  that  the offence  was  committed  without  his
 knowledge  or that  he had exercised all  due diligence  to
 prevent the commission of such offence. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_14">  8. The attention of the Court was drawn to the fact that
 the  petitioners  had resigned from the company  before  the
 alleged  cheques had been issued and, therefore, they can not
 be  held  responsible in this regard. But, so far  as  this
 Form-32  in  pursuant to <a href="/doc/531455/" id="a_7">Section 303</a> of the Companies Act  is
 concerned,  indeed, it is to be established during the course
 of  trial  if the said persons ceased to be directors before
 the  said offence is stated to have been committed.  At  this
 stage, expressing of any opinion would embarrass either party
 because  final finding in this regard can not be given. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_15">  9. The main contention in this regard, however, was that
 there is  no averment in the complaint that at the  relevant
 time,when  the offence was committed, the petitioners  were
 in charge  or  were responsible to the company for conduct  of
 the  business of the company. It was asserted that  in  the
 absence of any specific averment, indeed, the company qua the
 petitioners is liable to be dismissed. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_16">  10. To  appreciate the said controversy, reference  can
 well  be  made to some of the precedents cited at the Bar  in
 the  case  of MAHENDRA  PRATAP SINGH RATRA  &amp; ANR. versus
 M/S. N.K. METALS &amp; amp;  ANR,  1999 (1) CRIMES 181. In  the cited
 case, this  Court  found that cheques in question  had  been
 issued by one Shri Ajit Singh Ratra. There was no  averment
 or  allegation that the other persons, who were  Petitioners
 before this Court were directly or indirectly in charge of and
 responsible  to  the  company for conduct of  its  day-to-day
 business.   Their  contention, therefore, that the  complaint
 could not  proceed against them, was accepted.   This Court
 held : 
</p><p id="p_17">  ....."There  is no averment or allegation  in
the  complaint or pre-summoning evidence  even
to  obliquely  suggest that  the  petitioners/
Directors  were at any point of time  directly
or  indirectly in charge of and responsible to
the  company for the conduct of its day-to-day
business  or any material on record which  may
even remotely suggest that the alleged offence
was  committed with the consent or  connivance
of,  or was attributable to any neglect on the
part  of  the petitioners.  In the absence  of
such  an  averment/evidence,  in my  view  the
petitioners  cannot be roped in under  <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_8">Section
141</a> of the Act." 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_18">  11. In  another  decision, rendered by this Court in  the
 case of SMT. SARASWATHY AMMA &amp; ANR.  versus M/S.SWIL LIMITED &amp;
 ANOTHER,  2000 (1) JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL CASES 42,  a  similar
 question  had come up for consideration.  It was  held  that
 merely because a person is a director of the company will not
 make  him liable.  There should be specific averment  against
 him  pertaining to ingredients of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_9">Section 141</a> of the Act.  It
 was held: 
</p><p id="p_19">  ....."Simply because a person is a director of
the  company  or a partner of a firm, it  does
not  necessarily mean that he fulfills both the
above requirements   such    to   make   him
vicariously  liable.   There must be  specific
accusation   against  each  of the   persons
arraigned  an accused that such person was  in
charge of and responsible for the conduct  of
the business of the company or the firm at the
relevant  time when the alleged  offence  was
committed  by  the company or the  firm.   The
said  requirement  cannot be left to the  wild
imagination of the complainant." 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_20">  12. It  has  to  be  remembered   that  in the  case  of
 Smt.Saraswathy Amma (supra), this Court even noted that  the
 petitioners  before  the Court had executed General Power  of
 Attorney in favor of another and inference further was drawn
 that therefore, they would not be the persons in charge of and
 responsible  for  the conduct of business  of the  company.
 Herein too there is no specific averment that has been made. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_21">  13. Similar  findings had been arrived at in the case  of
 SMT.K.JANAKI  MANOHARAN AND ANOTHER versus M/S.GAYATRI SUGAR
 COMPLEX  LTD. AND  ANOTHER, 2001  CRI.L.J.52.   The Andhra
 Pradesh  High Court the same view that every director is  not
 liable for  the offence committed by a company and  specific
 and clear assertions should be made. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_22">  14. Similar  view prevailed with the Kerala High Court in
 the  case  of P.K.KURIAN versus R.SANKARA RAMAN AND  ANOTHER,
 2002  CRI.L.J.478 that there should be specific averments  in
 this regard. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_23">  15. Two decisions of the Supreme Court on the subject can
 also  be taken note of.  In the case of U.P.POLLUTION CONTROL
 BOARD versus M/S.MOHAN MEAKINS LTD.  &amp; ORS, 2000 III AD (SC)
</p><p id="p_24"> 254.The  Supreme Court was dealing with Water  (Prevention
 and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control  of  Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 with  respect  to  the
 offences  by the companies.  The provisions are  para-materia
 with  the  present  Act.   The Supreme Court  held  that  for
 issuing of process only the allegations in the complaint have
 to be looked into.  The averments made were that Chairman and
 Directors  were responsible for the acts of the company.  The
 Supreme  Court held that the complaint can continue  as  the
 necessary ingredients in this regard were satisfied. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_25">  16. Similarly,   in  the  case   of   K.P.G. NAIR versus
 M/S.JINDAL  MENTHOL  INDIA  LTD., 2001 (2)  CRIMES  132,  the
 Supreme  Court reiterated that averments must indicate  that
 when the crime was committed the person, who is being arrayed
 as an accused, was in charge of and responsible to the company
 for  conduct of business of the company.  In paragraph 8, the
 following conclusions have been recorded : 
  "8.From  a perusal of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Section 141</a>, it  is
evident that  in  a   case  where  a  Company
committed  offence under <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Section 138</a>, then not
only  the Company but also every person who at
the  time when the offence was committed,  was
in  charge  of and  was  responsible  to  the
Company for the conduct of the business of the
Company shall be deemed to be guilty of  the
offence and liable to be proceeded against and
punished  accordingly. It   follows  that  a
person other than the Company can be proceeded
against under those provisions, only if  that
person was in charge of and was responsible to
the Company for the conduct of its business." 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_26">  17. From  the  aforesaid facts, certain  conclusions  can
 conveniently  be  drawn,  namely,  that  the  complaint  must
 contain  averments to attract the rigour of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_13">Section 141</a>.   It
 is  not necessary that precise words of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Section 141(1)</a> of the
 Act should be reproduced.  The court has to see the averments
 and  thereafter conclude as to whether necessary  ingredients
 have  been  averred  to prompt the court to proceed  in  this
 regard.   It will all depend upon the facts and circumstances
 of each case. If the conclusion is that there is no averment
 and a person is unnecessarily being harassed, the court would
 certainly  not permit the abuse of process of law but if  the
 necessary  averments  exist,  which are  mandatory,  in  that
 event, as had been noted by the Supreme Court in the case of
 U.P. Pollution Control Board (supra),   the complaint  can
 continue. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_27"> 18. Reverting back to the facts of the case.  It is clear
 that complainant   had  specifically  pleaded   that   the
 petitioners  are  the directors of the  company.   They  are
 taking active part  in the running of the business  of  the
 company  and  are  in charge of the affairs  and  are  equally
 responsible  for  the conduct of business  of the  company.
 Furthermore, it was averred that the cheques have been issued
 by  the  company during the course of business and  this  had
 been  done with the knowledge of the present petitioners, who
 are the directors for discharge of their liability.  In other
 words, the  necessary ingredients had been  pleaded, which
 promoted  the court to issue the notice.  It is not  one  of
 those cases  where it could be inferred that the  averments
 lacked clarity  or  suffers from  ambiguity or  necessary
 ingredients   pertaining   to the   offence are   missing.
 Therefore, there is no ground to interfere. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_28">  19. For  these  reasons, the petitions must fail and  are
 dismissed in liming.
