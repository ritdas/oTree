</pre><p id="p_1">                                (Order of the Court was made by M.M.SUNDRESH, J.)

                            This writ petition has been filed by the sixth respondent before the

                      National Green Tribunal in Original Application No.8 of 2018 (SZ),

                      aggrieved over the interim order passed, by which, direction was issued for

                      the constitution of Joint Committee with the participation of Central

                      Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred as 'CPCB') and the

                      Puducherry Pollution Control Committee (hereinafter referred as 'PPCC').

                      Incidentally, the private respondent before us, who was the petitioner

                      before the Tribunal, was also permitted to take part during the inspection.



</p><p id="p_2">                            2. The aforesaid order is sought to be assailed before us on the

                      premise that no opportunity was given to put forth the case of the

                      petitioner. Learned Senior Counsel would submit that the main contention

                      of the private respondent is that the petitioner has not established the

                      Mechanised Coal Handling System. However, the same has been done,

                      pursuant to which the PPCC has given consent to operate. Had this fact

                      been brought forth before the Tribunal, the order would not have been

                      passed. Consequently, it has been submitted that <a href="/doc/965097/" id="a_1">Section 16</a> of The Air

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                            4</span>
                      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">(Prevention of Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 cannot be pressed into

                      service as it is for the State Boards to undertake the aforesaid exercise

                      under <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_3">Section 17</a> read with <a href="/doc/22265957/" id="a_4">Sections 23</a> and <a href="/doc/35230679/" id="a_5">24</a> of the Act. Incidentally,

                      learned Senior Counsel submitted that the Tamil Nadu State Pollution

                      Control Board has got no role to play and, therefore, the said authority is

                      not required to be a part of the Joint Committee.



</p><p id="p_3">                            3. Learned counsel appearing for the private respondent has

                      submitted that <a href="/doc/154953334/" id="a_6">Section 16</a> has to be read along with <a href="/doc/174199280/" id="a_7">Section 17</a>. There was

                      already a joint inspection conducted which has given the outer limit for the

                      purpose of establishing Merchandise Coal Handling System. The power of

                      the Tribunal is rather wide. The establishment of the Merchandise Coal

                      Handling System coupled with consent came into being subsequent to the

                      filing of the Original Application before the Tribunal, though consent was

                      granted earlier. Therefore, no interference is required.



</p><p id="p_4">                            4. By way of reply, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

                      petitioner would submit that without giving opportunity to the petitioner,

                      liberty was given to the authority to take appropriate action based upon the

                      inspection to be made when the petitioner had obtained all necessary

                      consents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                            5</span>


</p><p id="p_6">                            5. Insofar as the constitution of Committee is concerned, we are of

                      the view that the order of the Tribunal does not require interference with

                      specific reference to the Joint Inspection to be made by the CPCB and the

                      PPCC. After all, the power of the Tribunal is plenary qua environmental

                      issues. We also note that such an exercise was already undertaken at an

                      earlier point of time. Therefore, the order of the Tribunal has to be seen in

                      the context of the earlier decision made pursuant to the joint inspection

                      made. It is not as if the petitioner was not aware of the earlier direction

                      made and complied by the Joint Committee. In such view of the matter, we

                      do not find any error with respect to the joint inspection ordered in the

                      presence of the CPCB and the PPCC.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">                            6. However, we make it clear that the role of the CPCB is rather

                      limited as against the PPCC. We do not wish to go much into those things.

                      The report has to be made jointly by both the authorities. They should sit

                      together and prepare the report. Neither the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control

                      Board nor the State of Tamil Nadu has any role to play at this juncture.

                      Therefore, we make it clear that the said authorities are not required to be

                      part of the Committee. As of now, they have not expressed any grievance.

                      In fact, we are of view at this stage that the authority is not required.



http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                             6</span>
                      However, we do not find anything wrong in the presence of the private

                      respondent along with the Committee during the inspection. After all, it is

                      the private respondent who has raised the issues before the Hon'ble

                      Tribunal, therefore, his presence will help the Committee in filing its report.

                      Though it has been stated that the private respondent has to render

                      assistance to the Committee, it has to be construed that his role is to point

                      out the alleged violation, if any. Accordingly, we clarify the presence of the

                      private respondent to that extent.

<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                            7. The only other question to be considered is with respect to the

                      proposed action to be taken. We feel that such an action can be taken after

                      the report is filed before the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal. We request

                      the Hon'ble Tribunal to hear the parties, namely, the petitioner herein and

                      the private respondent, who is the applicant before it, on the report to be

                      filed, copies of which to be furnished, and thereafter pass appropriate

                      orders. Similarly, the petitioner has to be heard before initiating any action

                      on the report.
