                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANANDAN SINGH
                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">8   19-08-2013                  After marathon arguments for days, this Court has

                 felt the necessity to involve the Central Pollution Control Board

                 (for short „the Central Board‟) in the matter only because this

                 Court has now gathered an impression that the actions of the

                 Bihar State Pollution Control Board (for short „the State Board‟),

                 at least in this matter, have not been above board. The word
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.9064 of 2013 (8) dt.19-08-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         2/12</span>




             „Board‟ used for it is, in a way, misnomer, as, on a resolution of

             only five members present, out of twelve, taken as far back as on

             22.04.1986, the Chairman stands delegated to exercise all the

             power of the State Board, as it had then. The original records of

             the State Board, connected with the present case, produced by the

             learned counsel and perused by the Court, showed that, there was

             hardly any independent application of mind by the Chairman in

             the matter at any point of time, apart from endorsing the notings

             of his subordinates by putting his initials only or just by putting a

             note „as proposed‟. Coupled with this state of affairs there, its

             vacillating stand, first supporting the case of the petitioner

             company all the way, on the basis of facts and figures collected in

             an inspection held by its officials, before the Division Bench in a

             P.I.L, filed on behalf of the residents of the locality, represented

             by the petitioners there and the intervenors here, and also its stand

             in favour of the petitioner before the Ministry of Environment and

             Forest, Government of India, and then a total somersault in its

             stand here, supporting the stand of the residents of the locality, on

             the basis of an exparte „surprise inspection‟ held on their

             protests/representations, shows that the functionaries of the State

             Board cannot, at least, be taken to be immune from influences and

             pressures, so as to earn confidence of this Court for deciding the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court CWJC No.9064 of 2013 (8) dt.19-08-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         3/12</span>




             issues in the case on their affidavits and reports. As the situation

             now appears to exist, the State Board, having become defunct by

             delegating its powers to the Chairman, is, in fact, being run by the

             subordinate officials, with mechanical approval of the proposed

             actions/decisions by its Chairman. Above all, the delegation of all

             the powers of the Board to the Chairman by five members, out of

             twelve, and giving him absolute authority, prima facie, itself may

             be in the teeth of, and contrary to, the spirit and purpose of <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_1">section

             4</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974,

             laying down for constitution of the Board by members with varied

             experiences and from different sections.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                             It was not a difficult proposition to pin down the

             State Board to its earlier stand, presented before the Division

             Bench, supporting the petitioner company on affidavit, under the

             principles of promissory estoppel, but for the fact that the matter

             relates to sensitive arena of environmental pollution and likely

             health hazard, for time immemorial, to the people of the State in

             general and the residents of the locality in particular. Hence, this

             Court is of the opinion that, the legal fiction not withstanding that

             „a court is expert of all experts‟, it should not attempt to take a

             plunge into the field by super-imposing its opinions and findings

             in the matter, which should be left only for an expert body.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Patna High Court CWJC No.9064 of 2013 (8) dt.19-08-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                         4/12</span>




</p><p id="p_3">                              The State Board has laid down some norms, in the

             form of a „Guidelines‟, which may or may not be statutory, but

             has been held valid by another Division Bench of this Court.

             Hence the same has to be followed by all entrepreneurs proposing

             to set up any industry to which the Guidelines may be applicable.

             At least this much is clear that these „Guidelines‟ are meant for

             protection of environment and prevention of possible health

             hazard to the people for generations. In the circumstances, this

             Court is really surprised with the stand of the State Board that the

             norms have been relaxed for the two other asbestos manufacturing

             units in operation from before, only on the ground that they are

             running in the respective industrial areas. Does it mean that, in

             spite of the entire State of Bihar having been declared „Air

             Pollution Control Area‟ long back, the industries running in the

             industrial areas in the State are not required to follow the norms

             and are permitted to cause environmental pollution and health

             hazard to the people residing around the industrial areas and to

             their coming generations ? Does any pollution control board, in

             the present case, represented by one individual only, has, or

             should have, the power to relax the norms, meant to control

             environmental pollution and safeguard the humanity from health

             hazards and any recurrence of Bhopal Gas Tragedy ?
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Patna High Court CWJC No.9064 of 2013 (8) dt.19-08-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                         5/12</span>




</p><p id="p_4">                             In these circumstances, this Court has no other

             option than to fall back upon the Central Pollution Control Board,

             the only body upon which this Court can place reliance for

             assistance in the matter. Accordingly, on the request made by this

             Court, learned counsel for the petitioner has added Central Board

             with its appropriate description as party respondent no.8 in this

             case.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                             It was informed to this Court that Mr. Umesh

             Narayan Dubey, learned counsel is in the panel of Central Board

             and represents the Board in this Court in the matters in which it is

             a party. Accordingly, on the request of this Court, he is present in

             the Court and accepts notice on behalf of the Central Board for

             necessary communication of this order and a copy of the

             pleadings to the Central Board.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                             After careful consideration of the matters in which

             this Court requires assistance of the Central Board, this Court

             formulates some queries for the Central Board to answer and

             issues some directions for it and others to comply. They are:-

</p><p id="p_7">             (i)     -     Whether the norms contained in the Guidelines framed

                            by the State Board are in conformity with all India

                            norms and with the same yardsticks and the same

                            requirement of specifications for establishment of an

                            industry ?
</p>
<p id="p_8">             (ii) -        Whether any State Pollution Control Board has the

                            liberty to relax the norms in favour of any industry,

                            already running or about to be established, in an

                            industrial area, or elsewhere ?
</p>
<p id="p_9">             (iii) -       The Central Board shall also take into account the

                            provisions of Item 27 of Schedule-I of the

                            Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, providing for

                            parameters for emissions for all types of Asbestos

                            manufacturing units and shall express its opinion

                            regarding its effect and import on established norms

                            for setting up of an Asbestos manufacturing unit as

                            applicable in the Country.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             (iv) -        The Central Board is directed to constitute a committee

                            of at least five of its qualified and experienced

                            and shall, if necessary, cordon off such area for such

                            representative of the State Board, one representative

                            of the petitioner along with its technical staff to aid

</p>
<p id="p_19">                             At this stage Mr. Kanth, learned senior counsel

             appearing for the petitioner, submits that it must be clear that this

             order is being passed by this Court only for its assistance by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> Patna High Court CWJC No.9064 of 2013 (8) dt.19-08-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                         9/12</span>




             Central Board and should not be treated as a concession or to have

             been passed with the agreement of the petitioner. He also submits

             that the impugned notice was issued to the petitioner only on

             account of alleged violation of norms of distance found in the

             inspection held on 10.4.2013 and the impugned order recalling

             „No Objection Certificate‟ (NOC) was also passed accordingly.

             Hence, any enquiry by the Committee of the Central Board should

             be confined only to the measurement of the distance and not

             beyond that. He also submits that, permitting the Committee to

             hold inspection in reference to the established norms shall amount

             to opening the entire matter again, which shall be in the realm of

             public interest and beyond the orders of the Division Bench.

</p><p id="p_20">                             This Court is unable to accept the said submissions

             of Mr. Kanth. As indicated in this order earlier, this Court has

             found that the conduct of the State Board in the matter did not

             appear to be above board. This only has necessitated involvement

             of the Central Board in the matter. Hence it will not be proper for

             this Court to disbelieve only that part of the report of the State

             Board which is against the petitioner and accept the part which

             may be in its favour. Hence, in the opinion of this Court, the said

             Committee of the Central Board is necessarily required to be

             given a free hand in inspection, measurement and report in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17"> Patna High Court CWJC No.9064 of 2013 (8) dt.19-08-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                         10/12</span>




             matter. Moreover, in view of the order of the Division Bench,

             petitioner was also at liberty to approach it in the said PIL itself to

             enable the Division Bench to monitor the matter. But instead of

             approaching the Division Bench, petitioner itself has chosen to

             file this fresh writ application in this Court. Hence, it cannot raise

             a grievance that this Court is taking the matter to the realm of

             public interest or proceeding beyond the orders of the Division

             Bench, by passing this order in the circumstances elaborated

             above.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                             Mr. Kanth had earlier also drawn the attention of this

             Court to the communication of the Ministry of Environment and

             Forest dated 23.2.2012 to the petitioner giving its clearance with

             conditions and also enclosing a copy of the minutes of the Expert

             Appraisal Committee held in its meeting dated 26-27th September,

             2011. He has drawn the attention of this Court to the said

             documents today also. He submits that the said Expert Appraisal

             Committee had in fact visited and inspected the site of the

             petitioner on 15th of September, 2011 during the pendency of the

             PIL and had recorded its conclusions and recommendations in

             which it had found the project site as per the siting guidelines of

             the State Board. However, he accepted that the said Committee,

             during its inspection of the site, had visualized the distance of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19"> Patna High Court CWJC No.9064 of 2013 (8) dt.19-08-2013</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                         11/12</span>




             school, State highway, hospital, road etc. from the battery limit

             using the Google map only and had taken into account the

             materials placed before it by the State Board and on that basis had

             found the unit conforming to all the norms. He submits that, now

             that the issue, which has cropped up on the basis of said surprise

             inspection, is only with respect to the distance criteria and nothing

             else. Hence the inspection of the said Committee of the Central

             Board should be confined to taking measurements only and

             should not be directed to hold the inspection "in the back ground

             of the established norms for setting up an asbestos manufacturing

             unit".
</p>
<p id="p_22">                             This Court has indicated earlier that the conduct of

             the State Board and its officials have been such that it is difficult

             for this Court to place reliance on facts and figures containing in

             their affidavits and documents. Hence, this Court considers that

             instead of confining the inspection by the said Committee of the

             Central Board only to measurement of the distances, it is

             appropriate that it should hold inspection in the light of the

             established norms for setting up of Asbestos manufacturing

             industry as applicable in the Country. Hence, the objection of Mr.

             Kanth with regard to direction of this Court to the said Committee

             for "inspection in the back ground of established norms" is

                         rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                                         Lastly, this Court makes it clear that the observations

                         made in this order are only on the basis of the submissions and

                         materials placed by the learned counsels for the parties in the case

                         so far, and they should not be taken as final opinion or findings of

                         this Court on any issue and should not be referred as such.
