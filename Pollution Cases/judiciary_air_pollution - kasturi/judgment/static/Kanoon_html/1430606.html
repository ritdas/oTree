B.P. JEEVAN REDDY.
</p><p id="p_2">     A letter  written by  Sri Vineet  Kumar Mathur pointing
out the	 pollution caused  in the river Gomti and its causes
was treated  as a  writ petition  by this  Court and  orders
passed from time to time. Mohan Meakins Breweries is said to
be one	of the	industries polluting  the river.  It is	 not
necessary to  refer to	the various  orders passed  in	this
matter from time to time. It would be sufficient to refer to
the order made on January 15, 1993 which reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "The following  order will apply to: (1)
     M/s. Mohan Meakins, Daliganj, Lucknow;
     (2) M/s. Oudh Sugar Mill, Hargaon,
     Sitapur; (3)  M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Ltd.,
     Gola Gorakhnath, Kheri (Sugar Unit-
     Distillery); (4) M/s. Sharda Sugar Mill,
     Palia Lakhimpur  Kheri (New Name - Bajaj
     Hindustan Ltd., Unit Palia Lakhimpur
     Kheri); (5) M/s. Balaji Vegetable
     Product, Sitapur; (6) M/s. Kissan
     Cooperative Sugar Mill, Majhola,
     Pilibhit; (7) M/s. U.P. State Sugar
     Corpn, Maholi, Sitapur; (8) M/s. HAL
     Lucknow; (9) M/s. Lucknow Producers Milk
     Union, Lucknow Industries.
	  "The officers of the State
     Pollution Board will visit the above
     industrial establishments and make a
     fresh inspection of the effluent
     treatment plants installed in the said
     establishments and	 of their working. If
     there are any applications made by these
     industries for consent of the Board,
     they will be disposed of after
     inspection and within three weeks from
     today. If	after inspection, it is found
     that the  treatment plants are deficient
     in any respect or the deficiency pointed
     out earlier still continues, the Board
     will give reasonable time for the
     industries to cure the deficiencies.
     However, the time so given should not
     extend beyond 21st March, 1993.
	  The officers of the Pollution Board
     will visit the industrial establishments
     concerned after the expiry of the time
     given to  them to cure the deficiencies,
     and, make their report to this Court
     before 7th April, 1993.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  If the industries in question do
     not obtain the consent of the State
     Pollution Board for running their units,
     before 31st  March, 1993, the industries
     will stop	functioning after 31st March,
     1993.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  As regards  the Municipal Boards of
     Pilibhit, Barabanki, Sitapur, Sultanpur,
     Jaunpur, Lakhimpur Kheri, they are
     directed to instal the effluent
     treatment plant on or before 30th April,
     1993 and obtain a certificate from the
     State Pollution Board that the plant
     installed is upto the standard and its
     working is satisfactory. The Chief
     Officers and the Presiding Officers of
     the concerned Municipalities are
     required to  file their affidavits on or
     before 30th April, 1993 that they have
     complied with the above directions.
	  Mr.R.B. Misra appears for the State
     Government. The State Government is
     directed to let the Court know what
     steps they have taken to release the
     funds to  the Jal Nigam for installation
     of the sewerage treatment plant at
     Lucknow. The affidavit to be filed on or
     before 30th April, 1993.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  As regards the industries, the
     matter shall  come up for hearing on 7th
     April, 1993. As regards the
     municipalities, it would come up for
     hearing on 3rd May, 1993."</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">     Inasmuch  as   Mohan  Meakins   did  not	remove	 the
deficiencies in	 its effluent treatment plant by 21st March,
1993, no  consent was granted to it by the Pollution Control
Board. It  stopped functioning from Ist April, 1993 onwards.
The letter  dated March	 31, 1993 addressed to Mohan Meakins
by the	Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (at Pages 422-
425 of	the record)  states that in the circumstances stated
therein, consent  cannot be  granted to	 Mohan Meakins under
the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_1">Water  (Control of	Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short, the
"<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_2">Water Act</a>").
</p><p id="p_4">     On April  2, 1993,	 Mohan Meakins addressed a letter to
the Pollution  Control Board (P.C.B.) stating that they have
since complied	with the order of this Court and, therefore,
the consent  may now be granted to them under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_3">Water Act</a>.
Before we refer to the orders passed on this application, we
may refer  to some other developments which have taken place
in the meanwhile.
</p><p id="p_5">     On April 6, 1993, the P.C.B. filed an affidavit in this
Court stating, inter alia, that the consent has been refused
to Mohan  Meakins for  failing to remove the deficiencies in
effluent treatment plant.
</p><p id="p_6">     On 6th  and 7th  April, 1993,  Mohan Meakins  filed two
affidavits in  this Court.  In the  first  affidavit,  Mohan
Meakins stated	that the  sudden shut  down of	the plant is
likely to result in not only emission of poisonous gases but
is also	 likely to damage the machinery and the plant beyond
repair on account of the solidification of the spentwash and
that with a view to avoid the said untoward consequences, it
is felt	 necessary to  run the	plant intermittently  for  a
period not exceeding two days in all between 7th and 11th of
April, 1993.  By such running, it was submitted, the company
does not  mean to  nor	should	it  be	understood  to	have
violated the  order of this Court dated January 15, 1993. In
the other  affidavit filed  by Mohan Meakins, it stated that
inasmuch as  they have	since rectified	 the deficiencies in
the effluent  treatment plant  and have	 brought it upto the
desired level,	the order  dated January  15,  1993  may  be
extended till December 31, 1993, which is the date specified
in the	Government of  India Notification dated February 12,
1992.
</p><p id="p_7">     On April  15, 1993, this Court passed an order (at Page
520 of the record) holding that running of the plant between
7th and	 11th of  April, 1993  by Mohan	 Meakins prima facie
amounts to violation of this Court's order dated January 15,
1993. Accordingly,  notices  were  issued  to  the  Managing
Director of  Mohan Meakins,  Brig. Kapil  Mohan, and  to the
Chief Executive Officer, Sri Yogesh Kumar, to show cause why
they should  not be  proceeded against	for contempt of this
Court.
</p><p id="p_8">     Now, coming  back to the application made by the P.C.B.
on April  2, 1993  to grant  consent, the P.C.B. granted the
consent on  April 21,  1993. This  fact	 was,  however,	 not
brought to  the notice	of this	 Court immediately either by
P.C.B. or by Mohan Meakins. Though an affidavit was filed by
Sri Yogesh  Kumar on  April 27,	 1993  in  response  to	 the
contempt notice	 issued to  him on April 15, 1993, this fact
was not	 disclosed. Similarly,	the Managing Director, Brig.
Kapil Mohan also did not disclose this fact in his affidavit
filed in  reply to  the contempt notice. On May 3, 1993, the
P.C.B. also  filed an  affidavit stating that working of the
factory for  two days  by Mohan Meakins is not justified but
even here  the P.C.B.  did not	disclose the  fact that	 the
consent has since been granted to Mohan Meakins on April 21,
1993.  It,  however,  appears  that  during  the  course  of
arguments, this	 fact was  brought to  the  notice  of	this
Court.	Thereupon,   Sri  P.H.	Parekh,	 Advocate,  who	 was
appointed by  this Court  as Amicus  Curiae in	this  matter
addressed a  letter, on May 8, 1993, to the learned Advocate
for Mohan  Meakins to  confirm whether	the plant/factory of
Mohan Meakins  has started  working since April 23, 1993 and
if so,	on what basis. Sri Parekh sent a reminder on May 14,
1993. There  was no  reply from	 Mohan Meakins	to either of
these letters.
</p><p id="p_9">     On October	 8, 1993,  this Court  passed the  following
order in  view of the failure of Mohan Meakins to respond to
the letters from Sri Parekh:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "Inspite of the letter written by the
     learned counsel for petitioner on May 8,
     1993 requesting the learned advocate for
     the 2nd respondent to send him copies of
     all the applications for consent,
     appeals together  with the annexures and
     copies of the orders, passed either by
     the U.P. Pollution Control Board or by
     the Appellate Authorities under which
     the respondent Industry has been working
     since 23rd April, 1993, no documents
     have been supplied to him till date. Mr.
     Bhandare, learned counsel for the 2nd
     respondent states that they were under
     the impression  that the petitioner must
     be in  possession of the said documents.
     The reply is most unsatisfactory and
     distressing as well. We adjourn the
     matter to 5th November, 1993. The 2nd
     respondent to supply the documents in
     question on affidavit. The respondent
     No.2 to pay the cost of adjournment
     which is fixed at Rs. 10,000/- as a
     condition precedent.  The matter will be
     before this Bench as part-heard."</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">     In compliance  with the  above order,  an affidavit was
filed on  October 24,  1993 on	behalf of  Mohan Meakins (at
Page 595  of the  record) disclosing  that on  the basis  of
their letter  dated April  2, 1993,  the P.C.B.	 has granted
consent on  April 21,  1993 and that while granting the said
consent the  P.C.B. was	 fully aware  of the  order of	this
Court dated  April 15, 1993 (issuing contempt notices to the
Managing Director  and	Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Mohan
Meakins). It  was disclosed further that on the basis of the
said consent their plant had started functioning with effect
from April 23, 1993.
</p><p id="p_11">     In the  light of  the facts  disclosed in the affidavit
filed on behalf of Mohan Meakins, this Court issued a notice
to  Sri	  Darshan  Singh,  Member-Secretary,  Uttar  Pradesh
Pollution Control  Board to  show cause why he should not be
punished for  contempt of this Court for granting consent in
violation of  the orders  of this  Court dated	January	 15,
1993. Counsel  for the	State  of  Uttar  Pradesh  was	also
directed to produce the entire Government record relating to
the  said   matter  alongwith  an  affidavit  detailing	 the
circumstances in  which the  Government had issued the order
dated April 20, 1993 (referred to in the `consent' order) to
Sri Darshan  Singh. On May 13, 1994, Sri Darshan Singh filed
an affidavit  in response  to the  contempt notice issued to
him. In	 his affidavit,	 he referred  to (1)  Government  of
India Notification  dated February 12, 1992 adding sub-rules
(6) and	 (7) in	 Rule 3	 of Environment	 (Protection) Rules,
1986 and to sub-rule (6) in particular; (2) to <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_4">Section 18</a> of
the Water Act which empowered the Central Government to give
directions to  the P.C.B.;  (3) to  the order  of this Court
dated January  15, 1993	 and (4)  to the  closure  of  Mohan
Meakins on  and with effect from April 1, 1993 in compliance
with this  Court's order  dated January	 15, 1993  and	then
stated that  he had  put up  a	note  to  the  Chairman	 for
granting consent  to Mohan  Meakins in	view  of  the  Uttar
Pradesh Government order dated April 20, 1993, mentioning at
the same  time that  the consent so granted shall be subject
to the	orders of  this Court. He stated that "the Chairman,
U.P.  Pollution	  Control   Board/Secretary   (Environment),
Government of  U.P. directed  the deponent  not to raise any
objection in  granting consent to M/s. Mohan Meakins in view
of G.O. dated 20.4.1993 since this unit has been established
before 16.5.1991  and  requested  time	till  31.12.1993  to
achieve the standard". He submitted that in view of the said
direction, he  had to  and did	issue the 'consent'. He also
referred to  <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_5">Section 27(2)</a>  of the Water Act which empowered
the Board to review its order refusing consent.
</p><p id="p_12">     On July  20, 1994,	 an affidavit was filed on behalf of
the State  Government (sworn-to	 by Sri	 S.N.Shukla, Special
Secretary, Environment) affirming the direction given by the
Uttar Pradesh  Government to the Pollution Control Board but
stating at the same time that they were general instructions
and were not meant for a particular industry. It was further
stated in  this affidavit that any such general instructions
were not  supposed to be relied upon by the P.C.B. to act in
contravention of this court's order.
</p><p id="p_13">     In view  of the  affidavit of Sri Darshan Singh and the
affidavit of the Government of Uttar Pradesh aforesaid, this
Court directed, on May 4, 1995, notice to Sri Pradeep Kumar,
the then  Chairman of  the Uttar  Pradesh Pollution  Control
Board-cum-Secretary (Environment) to show cause as to why he
should not  be punished	 for contempt  of  this	 Court.	 Sri
Pradeep Kumar  filed an	 affidavit in  response to  the said
notice stating	that inasmuch  as Mohan	 Meakins was  a unit
established before  May 16,  1991 and had installed effluent
treatment plant	 and also  because the B.O.D. level was only
marginally  higher   than  the	prescribed  norms,  "it	 was
considered appropriate	to review the matter in the light of
the provisions of <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_6">Section 27(2)</a> of the Water (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of  Pollution) Act</a>,  1974", particularly  in view of
the orders  issued by  the Government  of Uttar	 Pradesh  on
April 20,  1993. Paragraphs  11, 12  and 13 of his affidavit
are relevant and may be extracted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     "11. That in aforesaid circumstances the
     Member-Secretary of  the Board had moved
     a proposal for reviewing the orders of
     the Board regarding refusal of the
     consent on 21.4.1993. It has been
     suggested by Member-Secretary that
     consent may be given to the industry
     subject to the condition that the unit
     will treat the effluents to the extent
     possible in  ETP and also subject to the
     orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
     W.P. No. 327/90 Vineet Kumar Mathur
     Versus Union of India &amp; Ors.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     12.  That the proposal of the Member-
     Secretary was approved by the deponent
     and it was directed not to raise any
     objections as  per the provisions of the
     G.O. dated 20.4.93. But such approval of
     the deponent  for reviewing consent does
     not mean that M/s. Mohan Meakins was
     allowed to	 operate its industrial plant
     after 31.3.93 in defiance of the order
     dated 15.1.1993 passed by this Hon'ble
     Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     13.  That in  the consent letter, it has
     been made	clear that the same is issued
     subject to the orders passed by this
     Hon'ble Court.  True English translation
     of letter dated 21.4.1993 issued to M/s.
     Mohan Meakins is being filed herewith
     and marked as Annexure IV to this
     affidavit."</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">     Since this Court was not satisfied with the explanation
so offered,  a notice  was issued on August 25, 1995 calling
upon Sri  Pradeep Kumar	 to answer the charge of contempt in
response to  which Sri	Pradeep Kumar  filed an affidavit on
October	 12,  1995.  In	 this  affidavit,  he  tendered	 his
unconditional apology for violating the orders of this Court
and prayed  that in  the circumstances	stated	therein	 his
unconditional apology may be accepted. In this affidavit, he
stated that  after the	closure of  several industries on or
with effect  from April	 1, 1993, they made a representation
to the Government of Uttar Pradesh referring, inter alia, to
the Government of India Notification dated February 12, 1992
(referred  to	supra)	whereupon   he	consulted   the	 Law
Department of  Uttar Pradesh  and on  the basis of its legal
opinion and  after considering	the matter  at	the  highest
level in  the Government  (including the Advisor to H.E. the
Governor) he  put up  a proposal to issue appropriate orders
to P.C.B.  that the industry established before May 16, 1981
may not	 be refused  consent and that such industries may be
given  time   till  December  31,  1993	 for  achieving	 the
prescribed level  of efficiency	 in their effluent treatment
plants. Accordingly,  the Government  issued orders on April
20,  1993   following  which   Sri  Darshan   Singh,  Member
Secretary, Uttar  Pradesh Pollution  Control Board  put up a
proposal for  granting consent,	 which he  approved  stating
that no	 objection be  raised for  granting consent to Mohan
Meakins. In his note, he made it clear that any such consent
shall be  subject to  the orders  of this Court. Sri Pradeep
Kumar admitted	that it	 was a	lepse  on  his	part,  as  a
Chairman of  the Pollution  Control Board,  in not  ensuring
that this  Court is informed of the said consent immediately
and in	not obtaining  appropriate orders in that behalf. He
further stated	that he	 is a  senior member  of the  I.A.S.
cadre, that  in his  entire career he has never violated the
orders of  the Court and that in the circumstances stated in
the affidavit,	he may be pardoned. He assured that he would
never give any occasion for similar complaint.
</p><p id="p_15">     When the  matter came  up on October 14, 1995, we heard
the matter  fully insofar  as  Sri  Pradeep  Kumar  and	 Sri
Darshan Singh  are concerned. Insofar as the contempt notice
related to  Mohan Meakins is concerned, it transpired during
the course of hearing that the notice issued to the Managing
Director and  the Chief	 Executive Officer pertained only to
their runnig  the factory/plant	 on two days between 7th and
11th of	 April, 1993  and not  to their obtaining consent on
April 21,  1993 and  running their  plant  contrary  to	 the
orders of  this Court. Accordingly, we issued a fresh notice
to the	officers of the Mohan Meakins to show cause why they
should not  be punished	 for violating	the orders  of	this
Court dated  January 15,  1993 by obtaining consent from the
P.C.B. on  April 21, 1993 in violation of the orders of this
Court. Notice  was made returnable within four weeks, during
which time  the said  contemnors were  entitled	 to  file  a
counter	 to  the  said	notice.	 For  this  reason,  we	 are
delinking the  contempt notice	insofar as  it	pertains  to
Mohan Meakins  which will  be dealt  with  and	disposed  of
later, though  we have	concluded the arguments with respect
to  the	  notice  already   issued  to	them.  We  think  it
appropriate that  orders are  passed with  respect to  Mohan
Meakins after  hearing them  in response to the fresh notice
issued on  October 13,	1995. These  orders are,  therefore,
confined to Sri Pradeep Kumar and Sri Darshan Singh only.
</p><p id="p_16">     Sri Pradeep  Kumar was  the Chairman  and	Sri  Darshan
Singh  was   the  Member-Secretary   of	 the  Uttar  Pradesh
Pollution Control Board at the relevant time.
</p><p id="p_17">     We are  of the  opinion that  the	consent	 granted  by
Pollution Control  Board to  Mohan Meakins on April 21, 1993
is clearly  in contravention  of this  Court's	order  dated
January 15,1993.  The order  of	 this  Court  had  expressly
directed that the reasonable time to be given to the various
industries for	removal of  deficiencies in  their  effluent
treatment plants  shall not  be beyond	March 21,  1993. The
inspection by  the P.C.B., the removal of deficiencies et al
were all  to be	 completed by  March  21,  1993.  All  those
industries which  did not remove the deficiencies within the
said date  and did not obtain the consent of P.C.B. by March
31,1993 were  to  close	 down.	Mohan  Meakins	were  indeed
refused consent	 by P.C.B.  on March  31, 1993	and  it	 was
closed on  and with effect from April 1, 1993. Yet a consent
was granted on April 21, 1993 by the Pollution Control Board
whereunder it  has been	 allowed to  operate its  plant	 and
factory	 with  the  condition  that  it	 should	 remove	 the
deficiencies on	 or  before  December  31,1993.	 It  may  be
noticed that  the amendment of Environment Rules effected by
the Central  Government by  Notification dated	February 12,
1992 was  long prior to this Court's order dated January 15,
1993. Though  the said	amendment provided for granting time
for removal  on deficiencies  till December 31, 1993 in case
of industries  established before  May 16,  1981, this Court
had yet	 ordered that  it should  be done on or before March
21, 1993.  In such  a situation,  it was  not  open  to	 the
Pollution Control  Board to  grant consent on April 21, 1993
asking Mohan  Meakins to remove the deficiencies by December
31, 1993.  It must be remembered that both the Uttar Pradesh
Pollution Control  Board and  Mohan Meakins  were Parties to
the order  dated January 15, 1993. We are, therefore, of the
clear opinion  that the	 said  grant  of  consent  to  Mohan
Meakins was  in	 clear	contravention  of  the	order  dated
January 15, 1993.
</p><p id="p_18">     So far  as the  addition of  the words,  "this  consent
order is subject to the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of  India in  W.P.327 of	1990  (<a href="/doc/434370/" id="a_8">Vineet  Kumar  Mathur
V.Union of  India</a>)" are	 concerned, we	think that  it was a
clever ploy  by the  person(s) issuing the consent. Firstly,
the order  of this  Court dated	 January 15,  1993 precluded
grant of any consent subsequent to March 31, 1993. Secondly,
there was  no point  in saying	that the  said	consent	 was
"subject to  the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court"
when  the   consent  being   granted  was  itself  in  plain
contravention of  the order  of this   Court.  If really the
Pollution Control  Board meant what it now says, the least -
and probably the only course open to it - it could have done
was to	apply to  this	Court  for  permission	to  issue  a
`consent' for  the reasons  stated by  it. It did nothing of
the sort.  It went  ahead and issued a consent with the said
misleading words  allowing the	industry to operate contrary
to the	orders of this Court. Yet another fact to be noticed
in this	 behalf is the variance between the ground stated in
Mohan Meakins' application (for consent) dated April 2, 1993
and the	 terms subject	to which  it was  granted consent by
P.C.B. In  their application  dated April 2, 1993, It may be
recalled, Mohan	 Meakins stated	 that inasmuch	as they have
complied with  the prescribed  norms they  should be granted
consent whereas	 the consent  actually granted	contemplates
Mohan Meakins  achieving the  prescribed norms	by  December
31,1993. The  consent letter  does not	also say  that Mohan
Meakins will  be entitled  to act upon the said consent only
after obtaining	 the orders  of this  Court therefor. In the
absence of  any such  stipulation, the	addition of the said
words in the consent order had no meaning and were evidently
meant to  be used  as a	 cover in future if and when someone
complained of  violation of the order of this Court. In this
view of	 this matter, both the Member-Secretary, Sri Darshan
Singh and  the Chairman	 of the Pollution Control Board, Sri
Pradeep Kumar  must be held to be guilty of violation of the
order of  this Court  dated January  15, 1993. Question then
arises, whether	 the unconditional  apology tendered by them
should be accepted, or not?
</p><p id="p_19">     Sri Pradeep  Kumar has  filed two	affidavits to  which
reference has  already been  made. In the earlier affidavit,
an attempt  was made  to show that there was no violation in
view of the facts stated therein by the second affidavit, he
has accepted  that there was a lapse on his part. Of course,
even in	 this second affidavit, he has tried to explain that
his orders  were passed	 upon the note put up by Sri Darshan
Singh, Member-Secretary,  the legal  opinion tendered by the
Law Secretary  and  the	 decision  taken  by  his  superiors
including the  Advisor to  H.E. the Governor. At the time of
arguments, however, Sri Kapil Sibal, learned counsel for Sri
Pradeep Kumar,	made no	 attempt to justify his conduct. Sri
Sibal plainly  admitted that what has been done was in clear
violation of  the orders  of this  Court dated	January	 15,
1993. Sri  Sibal submitted  that in  view of the unblemished
record of  the officer	and in	view  of  the  circumstances
stated in  his second  affidavit and  his assurance  that he
will never  allow any such situation to arise in future, the
unconditional apology  tendered	 by  him  may  be  accepted.
Counsel submitted  that Sri Pradeep Kumar is truly repenting
his lapse  and the  unconditional apology  by him is born of
genuine contriteness.
</p><p id="p_20">     Sri Darshan  Singh has  filed only one affidavit. While
tendering an  unconditional  and  unqualified  apology,	 Sri
Darshan Singh  has stated  that in  view of the amendment of
Environment Rules  on February	12, 1992,  and the  power of
review inhering	 in the Pollution Control Board by virtue of
<a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_9">Section 27(2)</a>  of the  Water Act, he put up a note for grant
of consent  on the  basis of  the application  made by Mohan
Meakins on April 2,1993. The relevant paras in his affidavit
are Paras 13 to 17 which read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     "13. That the deponent on 21.4.93
     keeping in view the orders passed by
     this Hon'ble  Court, G.O. dt.20.4.93 and
     provisions of the Act and Rules
     submitted a proposal for grant of
     consent to M/s. Mohan Meakins before the
     Chairman of the Board wherein it was
     specifically mentioned that this consent
     will be subject to orders passed by this
     Hon'ble Court in this case.

     not to raise any objection in grating
     consent to	 M/s.Mohan Meakins in view of
     G.O. dt.20.4.93 since this unit has been
     established before 16.5.1981 and
     requested time till 31.12.1993 to
     achieve the standard.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     15.  That in view of these directions
     the deponent granted consent to
     M/s.Mohan Meakins vide order dated
     21.4.93. But it has been specifically
     mentioned in this order that this
     consent is	 being granted subject to the
     orders of this Hon'ble Court passed in
     the abovementioned	 case. Since the unit
     has already  been closed in pursuance of
     order dt.15.1.93  passed by this Hob'ble
     Court w.e.f.  1.4.93, the same ought not
     to have been operated without seeking
     permission of this Hon'ble court because
     consent was granted subject to order
     dated 15.1.93. Merely because
     application seeking consent has been
     disposed of the Board does not mean that
     permission to operate the industry was
     granted by the deponent.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     16.  That in case the U.P. Pollution
     Control Board did not dispose of the
     application of any industries seeking
     consent within 4 months as per sub-
     section 7 of Section 25 of the Water
     (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of Pollution)
     Act</a>, 1974 it will be deemed to be
     granted unconditionally.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     17.  That in the light of the
     abovementioned facts  and circumstances,
     it is most respectfully submitted before
     this Hon'ble Court that the deponent had
     never intended to permit the industry to
     operate their plant and while issuing
     consent order the deponent has
     specifically mentioned therein that this
     order is subject to order passed by this
     Hon'ble Court in the above noted writ
     petition. As there is a specific
     condition in  the above noted order, the
     industry without  ensuring compliance of
     such condition cannot operate its
     industrial plant as the same was already
     lying closed down pursuant to order
     dated 15.1.93 of this Hon'ble Court."</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">     An extract	 of the	 note put up by Sri Darshan Singh as
also the  orders passed	 thereon by  Sri Pradeep  Kumar	 are
placed before  us. The relevant portion of the note reads as
under:

     18</a> read with <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_12">section 27(2)</a> clause B of

<p id="p_22">     It is significant to note that Para 3 of this Note does
refer to  the order of this Court dated January 15, 1993 and
to the	refusal of  consent by	P.C.B. to  Mohan Meakins  on
March 31,1993,	yet it says that in view of the instructions
issued by  the Uttar  Pradesh Government  on April 20, 1993,
the order dated March 31, 1993 refusing consent is liable to
be reviewd  under <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_15">Section 27</a> of the Water Act. It singularly
fails to  point out that the refusal of consent on March 31,
1993 was pursuant to and in terms of the Court's order dated
January 15,  1993 and cannot, therefore, be reviewed without
reference to this Court. It is equally significant to notice
that Sri  Pradeep Kumar too does not refer to this aspect in
his endorsement.  As a	matter of fact, his endorsement does
not even say specifically that consent be granted subject to
the orders  of this  Court. It looks as if for both of them,
the orders  of the  Uttar Pradesh Government issued on April
20, 1993  were sacrosant  and superseded  the orders of this
Court  as   well.  It  is  a  matter  of  regret  that	even
responsible and senior officers of the Government have acted
in this	 manner. It  is clear enough that the officials were
anxious to  somehow make  out a	 case for enabling the Mohan
Meakins to operate its plant and machinery regardless of the
orders of  this Court.	We may	also incidentally notice the
unusual speed with which the matter was processed. The Uttar
Pradesh Government's  orders, general  in nature,  are dated
April 20,  1993. On the very next day, Sri Darshan Singh put
up the	note, which was approved by Sri Pradeep Kumar on the
same day and the `consent' also issued on the same day.
</p><p id="p_23">     Sri V.R.  Reddy, learned  Additional Solicitor General,
appearing for  Sri Darshan  Singh reiterated the reasons and
circumstances in  which the  Member-Secretary had put up the
said note.  He submitted that the Member-Secretary was bound
by the	direction given	 by the	 Chairman and that he had no
option but  to issue  the consent  pursuant to the orders of
the Chairman.  Learned counsel	affirmed  the  unconditional
apology tendered  by Sri  Darshan Singh	 and pleaded for its
acceptance as a true expression of contriteness on his part.
</p><p id="p_24">     Taking   into   consideration   all   the	 facts	 and
circumstances aforesaid,  we hold that Sri Pradeep Kumar and
Sri Darshan  Singh are	both guilty  of	 violation  of	this
Court's	 Order	 dated	January	 15,1993.  In  view  of	 the
explanation  put   forward   by	  them	 and   the   several
circumstances stated  by them,	however, we  are inclined to
accept their  unconditional apology.  At the  same time,  we
administer a  severe  warning  to  both	 the  officers	that
repetition of  any such violation shall be viewed seriously.
A copy	of this	 Order shall form part of the service record
of both the officers.

of Mohan  Meakins are concerned, orders will be passed later
after hearing them on the fresh notice issued on October 12,
