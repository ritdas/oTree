                             JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

(A.K. Gosw ami, J)

</pre><p id="p_1">         Heard Mr. M A Sheikh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner. Also heard

Mr. C Baruah, learned CGC, appearing for Respondent No.1, Mr. J Abedin, learned

Counsel appearing for Respondent Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6 and Mr. S Borthakur, learned

counsel for Respondent No.4.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      This writ petition is directed against the letter of intent issued by the Reliance

Industries Ltd., for short, RIL on 27.03.2006 appointing the Respondent No. 4 as a

dealer for its retail outlet at Dhakuakhana, Assam.      A further prayer is made for a

direction to Respondent Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, to issue advertisement for settlement of

a retail outlet at Dhakuakhana, if they decided to open one.

</p><p id="p_3">3.      It is pleaded in the writ petition that Dhakuakhana, which is a most backward

region of the State of Assam, has a large unemployed population and in order to give

employment opportunity to the local population, it was incumbent upon the

respondents to have issued a notice inviting tender for appointment of a dealer for the

retail outlet at Dhakukhana.      Without such advertisement being issued, Respondent

No.4 was appointed as retailer on the basis of her application dated 07.12.2005, and

therefore, intervention of this Court is called for.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.       The Respondent No.1, in his affidavit, has stated that Ministry of Petroleum and

Natural Gas, Government of India, has no control over the procedure of issuing

dealership by RIL and it has full authority and power for consideration of allotment of

dealership to any person at their discretion and policy and that the policy of Ministry of

Petroleum and Natural Gas is not applicable in allotment of dealership by RIL. It is also

pleaded that approval was granted by the Government to M/s Reliance Petro Market (P)

Ltd, (RPM), which company was, subsequently amalgamated with RIL to market MS

(Petrol) and HSD (Diesel).
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.      The Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 had filed 2 (two) affidavits-one prior to

amendment of the writ petition and the other subsequent to the amendment of the writ

application.     The second affidavit by Respondent Nos.2 and 3 was filed alongwith

Respondent Nos.5 and 6. The sum and substance of both these affidavits filed, is,

WP (C) 2685/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                              3</span>


nonetheless, same. In the first affidavit, objection has been taken with regard to the

maintainability of the writ petition on the grounds that:- (i) no right of the writ

petitioner had been infringed and therefore, remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India is not available, (ii) The letter of intent (27.03.2006) was not put

to challenge and; (iii) Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 do not fall within the purview of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_2">Article

12</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.      It is stated that RIL is a Company under the Indian Private Sector and it has the

right to exercise its marketing policy in its own name and logo and according to its own

policies and procedures. It is further stated that as per the government policy, RIL had

sought to set up the Reliance outlet in a remote area.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.      In view of the stand taken in the first affidavit that LOI was already issued, the

writ petition came to be amended. In the subsequent affidavit, additionally, it had been

pleaded that the Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 are not falling within the purview of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_3">Article

12</a> of the Constitution of India. Further plea taken is that amendments effected in

Paragraphs 5 (a) and 5 (B) being not sworn statements as per the affidavit, cannot be

treated as part of the pleadings.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.      Mr. Sheikh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that only issues

that need to be decided in this case is as to whether RIL and RPL are State within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_4">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and as to whether they are amenable

to writ jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     According to him, if it is decided that the writ petition is maintainable, the only

logical view that would necessarily follow is quashing of the letter of intent issued to

Respondent No.4 as the same was issued without following any transparent procedure,

which is required to be followed by the State and its instrumentalities in the matter of

distribution of its largesse.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.      In support of his submission that the Respondent Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6 are

instrumentalities of the state and are amendable to the writ jurisdiction, learned counsel

submits that RIL is an Oil Company in terms of <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_5">Section 2</a> (h) of the Motor Spirit and

High Speed Diesel (Regulation of Supply, Distribution and Prevention of Malpractices)

Order, 2005, for short, Order of 2005 and it could do business in oil only because the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                4</span>


Central Government had duly authorised RIL. Accordingly, he submits that petroleum

products cannot be dealt with in any manner as one likes but the same is subject to the

aforesaid Order of 2005, which implies there is effective and pervasive Governmental

control.     He has also submitted that there is no limit to the power available under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and in a given case, writ can be issued against a

private individual also.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.        In support of his submission, Mr. Sheikh has placed reliance on the decisions in

the cases of: (i) AI R 1976 SC 425 (Rohtas I ndustries Ltd. and Anr.-Vs-Rohtas

I ndustries Staff Union and Ors.), (ii) AI R 1980 SC 1896 (Gujarat Steel Tubes

Ltd.-Vs- Gujarat Steel Tubes M azdoor Sabha and Ors.), (iii) (1989) 2 SCC 691

(Andi M ukta Sadguru Shree M uktajee Vandas Sw am i Suvarna Jayanti

M ahotsav Sm arak Trust and Ors. -Vs- V R Rudani and Ors.) and (iv)2007 (2)

GLT 312 (Raja K akati -Vs- Union of I ndia and Ors.).
</p>
<p id="p_12">12.        Mr. C Baruah, learned CGC in reassertion of the stand taken in the affidavits,

submits that RIL was given authorisation in terms of Paragraph 5 of the Order of 2005

and in the matter of appointment of dealership, RIL is free to follow its own policy and

the policy of the Government in relation to its undertakings does not apply to them.

</p><p id="p_13">13.         Mr. J Abedin, learned counsel appearing for Respondent Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6,

submits that appointment of a dealer is purely a private contract between the

Respondent Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6 and the Respondent No. 4 and there is no element of

public function involved in it.     It is founded on law of contract and the public law

remedy is not available in the matter of such appointment of a dealer. He has also

urged that the writ petitioner has not canvassed his own cause and with reference to

Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the writ petition, it is contended by him that the statements

made will go to show that the writ petitioner was trying to take up cudgels on behalf of

the local population of the Dhakuakhana. He also urges that there is no whisper in the

writ petition, suggesting that the writ petitioner was in any way interested, in the

dealership.      Therefore, according to him, the petitioner has no locus standi to maintain

this writ application. He has further argued that the proposal of the Respondent No. 4

was found acceptable by RIL and following the parameters laid down by the

WP (C) 2685/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               5</span>


government requiring settling of a retail outlet, allotted the dealership to the

Respondent No. 4 at Dhakuakhana, which according to own admission of the writ

petitioner, is a very backward region in the State of Assam.

</p><p id="p_14">14.       Mr. S Borthakur, learned counsel appearing for Respondent No. 4, at the very

outset, submits that while there is no interim order operating, in view of the pendency

of the writ application, though the Respondent No.4 had set up the retail outlet by

making substantial investment, the same is not being allowed to be run by the RIL

authorities.     With regard to maintainability of the writ petition, the learned counsel

echoes the submission advanced by Mr. Abedin. In the factual exposition also, the

stand taken by him is akin to the articulation made by Mr. Abedin. He has, however,

placed reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in Zee Telefilm s Ltd. and Anr. -Vs-

Union of I ndia and Ors., reported in (2005) 4 SCC 649, with special emphasis on

Paragraph 85 to contend that merely because there is general control of business in

terms of a statute or Regulation and not in respect of the body of question, such

control, per se, cannot bring the entity in the purview of "other authorities" within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_7">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India. He also places reliance on the

decision of the Apex Court in Federal Bank Ltd. -Vs- Sagar Thom as and Ors,

reported in (2003) 10 SCC 733.
</p>
<p id="p_15">15.       Under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_8">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, unless the context requires, "the

state" includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and

legislatures of each of the states and all local or other authorities within the territory of

India or under the control of the Government of India. <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_9">Article 12</a> finds place in Part-III

of the Constitution of India dealing with Fundamental Rights and significance of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_10">Article

12</a> lies in the fact that various Articles in Part-III of the Constitution of India have

placed responsibilities, obligations and duties on the state vis-à-vis the individual to

ensure constitutional protection and the individual's rights against the state and also to

enforce the Fundamental Rights. Over the period of time, the range and scope of

Fundamental Rights including Articles 14 and 16 have been expanded through the

process of judicial determination, with the result, there has been a corresponding

expansion in the judicial definition of the "State" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_11">Article 12.</a>

WP (C) 2685/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                              6</span>


</p><p id="p_16">16.       In <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_12">Article 12</a>, the term "other authorities" was introduced at the time of framing

of the Constitution with a limited objective of granting judicial review of actions of such

authorities which are created under statute and which discharge State functions. Till

about the year 1967, the Courts in India had taken a view that even statutory bodies

like universities, Selection Committees for admission into Government colleges were not

"other authorities" for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_13">Article 12.</a>       These was a paradigm shift in

Rajasthan State Electricity Board-Vs-M ohan Lal and Ors, reported in 1967 SC

1857 wherein a Constitution Bench of Apex Court held that the expression "other

authorities" is wide enough to include within it every authority created by a statute on

which powers are conferred to carry out Governmental or quasi-Governmental functions

under the control of Government of India. Necessitated by the change in the socio-

economic policies of the Government, to meet the challenges of the changing times,

another Constitution Bench of the Apex Court expanded the concept of "other

authorities" in the case of Sukhdev Singh and Ors -Vs- Bhagatram Sardar Singh

Raghuvanshi and Anr, reported in (1975) 1 SCC 421 , to bring within the umbrella

of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_14">Article 12</a> statutory bodies like ONGC, LIC etc., though, they are incorporated for

commercial purposes. The legal conundrum as to the meaning to be ascribed to "State"

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_15">Article 12</a> had been subject of many decisions, including

perceived conflicting decisions as in Sabhajit Tew ary -Vs- Union of I ndia and Ors,

reported in (1975) 1 SCC 485 and Ajay Hasia and Ors -Vs- K halid M ujjib

Sehravardi and Ors, reported in (1981) 1 SCC 722. While in Sabhajit Tew ary

(Supra), the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court held that a body which was

registered under a statute and not performing important State functions and not

functioning under the pervasive control of the Government would not be State for the

purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_16">Article 12</a>, in Ajay Hasia (Supra), the Constitution Bench held that a society

registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_17">Societies Registration Act</a> could also be an instrumentality of State

for the purpose of other authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">17.      The issue came up for consideration before a larger Bench of 7 (seven) Judges

in P radeep K um ar Bisw as -Vs- I ndian I nstitute of Chem ical Biology and Ors,

reported in (2002) 5 SCC 111. In paragraph 40, the Apex Court laid down as follows:
WP (C) 2685/06
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                7</span>


                      "40.   The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests

                      formulated in Ajay Hasia are not a rigid set of principles so that if a

                      body falls within any one of them it must, ex-hypothesi, be

                      considered to be a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_18">Article 12.</a> The

                      question in each case would be-whether in the light of the

                      cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally

                      and administratively dominated by or under the control of the

                      Government.        Such control must be particular to the body in

                      question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the body is a

                      State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_19">Article 12.</a> On the other hand, when the control is

                      merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would not

                      serve to make the body a State."
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">18.       In Zee Telefilm s (Supra), applying the tests laid down in P radeep K um ar

(Supra), the Apex Court held that Board of Control for Cricket in India, does not come

under the purview of "other authorities" for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_20">Article 12.</a> It is laid down

that even if there is some element of public duty involved in the discharge of the

Board's functions, even then, that by itself would not suffice for bringing the Board

within the net of "other authorities".
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">19.      On the own pleading of the petitioner, RIL is a private company. RPM is also a

private limited company. Though private company may not be a very apt description of

RIL, it is clear that both the aforesaid companies are not created by any statue. There

is no material placed to show that any share is held by the Government in the said

companies. The control, which is emphased by Mr. Sheikh, is not pervasive control but

is only regulatory in nature as applicable to other similar bodies. Thus, RIL and RPM

cannot be said to be "other authorities" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_21">Article 12</a> of the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">20.       It must be noted that <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_22">Article 12</a> is relevant only for the purpose of enforcement

of Fundamental Right under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_23">Article 32.</a> The term "authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> has

received a more liberal meaning than <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_25">Article 12.</a> Under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

India, High Courts can issue writs for enforcement of Fundamental Rights as well as

Non-Fundamental Rights. The words "any person or authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> are

not confined only to statutory authorities and instrumentalities of the state. While form

of the body is not very relevant, the nature of duties cast on the body is of utmost

importance. Thus, the words "any person or authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_28">Article 226</a> can cover

any other person or body performing public duty and wide power of the High Court can

reach injustice wherever it is found.

                     a striking departure from the English law. Under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a>, writs

                     can be issued to "any person or authority". It can be issued for the

the Constitution of India. It is laid down as follows:

                     the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. But in

                     certain circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or

                     persons as there may be statutes which need to be complied with

                     by all concerned including the private companies. For example,

                     there are certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_33">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the

                     <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_34">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_35">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper

                     environment, say the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_36">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

                     1981 or the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_37">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974

                     etc. or statutes of the like nature which fasten certain duties and

                     responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies which they are

                     bound to comply with. If they violate such a statutory provision a

                     writ would certainly be issued for compliance with those provisions.

                     For instance, if a private employer dispenses with the service of its

                     employee in violation of the provisions contained under the

                     <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_38">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable cases the High Court

                     interfered and has issued the writ to the private bodies and the

                     companies in that regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ may

                     arise where there may not be any non-compliance with or violation

                     of any statutory provision by the private body. In that event a writ

                     may not be issued at all. Other remedies, as may be available, may

                     have to be resorted to."

activities whether it may be banking, manufacturing or for that matter relating to any

other kind of business generating resources, employment, production and resulting in

circulation of money, no doubt have an impact on the economy of the country in

general but it does not necessarily follow that such activities would fall in the category

of activities of discharging duties and functions of public nature. A private body or a

person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction only where it may become necessary to

compel such body or association to enforce any statutory obligation or such obligations

of public nature casting positive obligation upon it.

                     under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_43">Article 226</a> is pre-eminently a public law remedy and is not

                     generally available as a remedy against private wrongs. It is used

                     for enforcement of various rights of the public or to compel

                     public/statutory authorities to discharge their duties and to act

                     within their bounds. It may be used to do justice when there is

                     wrongful exercise of power or a refusal to perform duties. This writ

                     is admirably equipped to serve as a judicial control over

                     administrative actions. This writ could also be issued against any

                     private body or person, specially in view of the words used in

                     <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. However, the scope of mandamus is

                     limited to enforcement of public duty. The scope of mandamus is

                     determined by the nature of the duty to be enforced, rather than

                     the identity of the authority against whom it is sought. If the

                     private body is discharging a public function and the denial of any

                     right is in connection with the public duty imposed on such body,

                     the public law remedy can be enforced. The duty cast on the public

                     body may be either statutory or otherwise and the source of such

                     power is immaterial, but, nevertheless, there must be the public

                     law element in such action. Sometimes, it is difficult to distinguish

                     between public law and private law remedies. According to

of doubt that jurisdiction conferred on the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution is very wide, it is equally true that this is a public law remedy and it is

available against a body, a person or a private authority performing a public law

function or public function. A body can be said to be performing a public function when

it seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the public or a section of the public.


</p><p id="p_35">27.       Gujarat Steel (Supra), on which reliance was placed by Mr. Sheikh, is a case

where, the Apex Court was considering whether an Arbitrator appointed under S 10 <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_46">A

of Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 was amenable to writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_47">Article 226</a> of

the Constitution of India. As such an Arbitrator has the power to bind even those who

are not parties to the reference or agreement and the whole exercise under Section 10

A as well as the source of the force of the award on publication derived from the

statute, it was held that the Arbitrator so appointed as part of the infra-structure of the

sovereign's dispensation of justice, thus falling within the ambit and sweep of statutory

tribunals amenable to judicial review. Consequently, it was held that under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_48">Article 226</a>,

the High Court could interfere with an award of the Arbitrator if that is based on a

complete misconception of law or based on no evidence or that no reasonable man

would come to the conclusion to which the Arbitrator has arrived. This case has no

application to the issues raised by Mr. Sheikh. In laying down the aforesaid principle,

the Apex Court reiterated the ratio laid down in Rohtas I ndustries (Supra), another

case relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner.          While recognising that

expansive and extraordinary power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_49">Article 226</a> can affect any

person or even a private individual and be available for any purpose, even though

another remedy may exist, the Apex Court reminded the restraints on the use of the

extraordinary power. In Raja K akati (Supra), this Court was basically considering
