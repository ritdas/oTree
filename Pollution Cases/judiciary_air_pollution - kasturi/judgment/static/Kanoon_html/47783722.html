     recorded in the said report is clear that as per ROC no

     Mr.Mihir Thakore with learned advocate, Mr.Mayur
     Sharad Shah who has taken this Court through the

     given by the RBI. It is urged by the learned senior
     counsel that factually it is also quite clear from the
     details which have been furnished that the accounts of
     Vimal Dairy Ltd and that of Swastic Ceracon Ltd are not
     director or related accounts and he has further
     questioned the very authority of C.E.O. In precluding the
     petitioner to act as a director by taking this Court

<p id="p_4">4.   Thus, it appears that pursuant to the policy framed by
the RBI and the guidelines issued by it from time to time in
exercise of its powers under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_2">Banking
Regulation Act</a>, 1949 and the RBI Act, 1934, the writ applicant

</p>
<p id="p_12">3.    That this Petition is wholly misconceived and devoid
of merits, both in law and on facts. There is no violation
of any legal and/or fundamental rights of the Petitioner.
Further, the allegation about violation of the principles of

petition, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is
not maintainable and deserves to be dismissed in limine.

<p id="p_13">4.    That, RBI is a statutory Corporation constituted as a
Monetary and Banking Authority under the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_8">Reserve Bank
of India Act</a>, 1934 and is vested with the responsibility of
Superintendence and control of the banking business in
the country under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_9">Banking
Regulations Act</a>. The banking business of banks including
the cooperative banks and propriety of their existence
and          non-existence         etc.        are

subject matters of close regulation by the RBI. In the year
1965, Parliament felt it necessary to bring within the
purview of the BR Act, 1949 a large number of
cooperative societies carrying on banking business to
prevent the emergence of weak urban banks and also to
ensure the growth of co-operative banking on sound
lines. <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_10">By the Act</a> 23 of 1965, called the Banking Laws
(Application to <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_11">Co-Operative Societies) Act</a>, 1965, the
then <a href="/doc/444965/" id="a_12">Banking Companies Act</a> has been, with certain
modification, made applicable to certain Co-Operative
Societies, carrying on the business of banking. <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_13">The Act</a>
23 of 1965 came into effect from 1 March 1966 by
inserting to the Principal Act a new Part- Part V, which
consists of <a href="/doc/1615963/" id="a_14">Section 56</a>, providing for the application of the
<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_15">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949 to Co-Operative Banks
[B.R. Act, 1949 (AACS)]. <a href="/doc/1402607/" id="a_16">Section 56</a> of the Act provides to
the effect that the provisions of the Act as in force for the

societies as they apply to banking companies, but
subject to the modifications laid down in the section.

<p id="p_14">5.   That in terms of Section 35 of the BR Act, 1949

any co-operative bank and its books and accounts as well
as cause a scrutiny of the affairs of the co-operative bank

and its books and accounts. Further, Section 35A of the
BR Act (AACS) empowers the RBI to give directions to
banks in the public interest; or in the interest of banking
policy; or to prevent the affairs of any bank being
conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the
depositors or in a manner prejudicial to the interests of
the bank; and to secure the proper management of the
bank. The banks are bound by the directions so issued by
the RBI under Section 35-A.
</p>
<p id="p_15">6.    That the RBI has in exercise of its powers conferred
under Sections 21 and 35-A of the BR Act (AACS), issued
directions BPD.Dir.No.5/ 13.05.00/2002-03 dated April 29,
2003 on 'Loans and advances to directors, relatives and
firms/concerns in which they are interested'. The
directions       stipulates        as        under:
</p>
<p id="p_16">"No primary co-operative bank shall make, provide, or
renew either secured or unsecured loans and advances
or any other financial accommodation to its directors and
their relatives, and the firm/companies/concerns in which
they               are            interested."
</p>
<p id="p_17">I submit that RBI has issued the said direction in view of
a number of instances that had come to its notice where
because of the concentrated exposure built up by UCBs
to the directors, their relatives or firms in which they are
interested, the banks have run into financial problems on
account of such accounts becoming NPAs. I submit that
the said direction was issued in the light of the
recommendation                of          the           Joint
Parliamentary Committee (JPC) which at that point of
time enquired into the stock market scam. The
recommendation stated that in order to prevent
irregularities of the type surfaced in the case of some co-
operative banks which were examined by the Committee,
they are of the view that full ban on granting of loans and
advances to the directors and their relatives, or the
concerns in which they are interested needs to be
imposed and that appropriate legal procedures may be
initiated to ensure that there is no conflict of interest in
the grant of loans and advances to the directors and their
relatives and the concerns in which they are interested.
In line with the said recommendation, the RBI had issued
the said directions prohibiting the urban cooperative
banks from extending any loans and advances (both

position of law and facts which lead to the issue of the
letter dated September 27, 2017 to MUCBL. This affidavit

to the extent specifically admitted herein. Such of the
allegations that are not specifically admitted hereunder
should be deemed to have been denied.

<p id="p_21">10. I deny the facts averred in the petition as

management of the related companies in order to
overcome the provisions of statutory directions issued by
RBI banning loans and advances to directors and their
relatives and firms/concerns in which they are interested.

<p id="p_22">11. I submit that the RBI conducted the statutory
inspection of the Mehsana Urban Cooperative Bank
Limited (MUCBL) with reference to its financial position as
on March 31, 2016, during November and December
2016. During the inspection, several irregularities and
violation of the provisions of the BR Act as well as the
directions issued by the RBI from time to time, were
observed. For the sake of brevity RBI is categorically
dealing with only the specific finding during the
inspection
which is the bone of contention in the present petition.

<p id="p_23">  C/SCA/12852/2018                           JUDGMENT



</p><p id="p_24">12. That during the inspection of MUCBL with reference
to its financial position as on March 31, 2016, RBI
observed that MUCBL had sanctioned loans and
advances to eight firms/concerns/companies in which the
Directors on the Board of the bank were interested. As
co-operative banks are prohibited from granting loans to
firms/companies in which directors were interested, RBI
had by letters dated August 10 and September 27, 2017
advised MUCBL to recall/close the eight director
related/interested loan accounts and to advise the
directors who are involved in connected lending to step
down from the Board of the bank. The said direction was
issued by the RBI to prevent the affairs of the bank being
conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the
depositors and the bank as well as to secure proper
management of the bank.
</p>
<p id="p_25">13. That the eight accounts include three accounts in
which the petitioner was interested viz. Vimal Dairy,
Swastik Ceracon and Cengres Tiles at the time of
inspection the details of which are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_26">(a)    Account of Vimal Dairy Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_27">(1) Vimal Dairy Ltd was formed in 1992 by Shri
Ganpatbhai Kashiram Patel, Chairman of MUCBL who was
the founder member. At the time of inspection of the
bank by RBI i.e. during November and December 2016, it
was observed that Shri Jayeshbhai Chandulal Patel, son
of the petitioner had been the Managing Director of
Vimal Dairy Ltd till June 2015. Vimal Dairy was the
subsidiary of the parent company Vimal Oil and Food
(VOF), where Shri Jayeshbhai Chandulal Patel was the
Chairman of the company. It was observed that Vimal
Dairy had opened five different current accounts with
different branches of MUCBL, whereas the company was
availing credit facilities from Bank of India, Mehsana.
</p>
<p id="p_28">(ii) Vimal Dairy had availed CC limit of Rs. 4616.00 lakh
from Bank of India, Mehsana Branch. The account of its
parent company i.e. VOF Ltd. had turned out to be NPA
as on 31/03/2016 in Bank of India, Corporate branch,
Ahmedabad. This was evident from the Bank of India,
Mehsana branch's letter dated May 27, 2016 advising
renewal of its loan facilities subject to some of the
conditions such as : (i) execution of personal guarantee

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                       Page 16 of 96</span>
  C/SCA/12852/2018                             JUDGMENT



letter from Shri J ayesh C Patel and Shri Chandubhai I
Patel (Petitioner) and Shri Ganpatbhai K Patel and two
others and (ii) to submit a roadmap for exiting in the light
of other account of the Group (VOFL) is NPA.
</p>
<p id="p_29">(iii) In view of Bank of India's above mentioned letter
and to enable Vimal Dairy to avail loan from MUCBL,
shareholding (19.35% as on March 31, 2016) was
transferred by the family of the petitioner to his
grandchildren and by Shri Ganpatbhai K Patel to MPYS
Infratech Pvt Ltd on June 15, 2016. Thereafter, three
directors were inducted into Vimal Dairy on July 20, 2016
viz. (1) Shri Jignesh Kumar Ramanbhai Patel, (ii) Shri
Chintankumar      Bhailabhbhai   Patel  and     (iii) Shri
Rameshbhai Dwarkadas Patel and ROC was informed; the
loan of Rs.3000 lakh was sanctioned on July 22, 2016 Le.
within two days of change of directors.
</p>
<p id="p_30">(iv) I submit that Vimal Dairy ceasing to be the subsidiary
of Vimal Oil Foods with effect from 26/06/2015 does not
mean that there was no linkage between Vimal Dairy and
the directors of MUCBL, which is evident from the
shareholding pattern as on 31.03.2016 available with
ROC wherein it was indicated that the family members of
Shri C l Patel had 19.35% shares in the company. Of
which, 18.07% of shares were transferred on June 15,
2016 to the grandchildren of the petitioner (viz. Kartik J.
Patel, Vimal J. Patel and Kirtan P. Patel). This is
apparently to escape from the definition as given in RBI
Circular of April 29, 2003 wherein grandchildren are not
included.
</p>
<p id="p_31">(v) Further, it is also relevant that Shri Pradipbhai
Chandubhai Patel, another son of Shri Chandubhai I Patel
was a signatory to operate the account of Vimal Dairy in
Mehsana Urban CBL and continued to be the signatory to
operate the account of Vimal Dairy in MUCBL even after
change of directorship in July 2016. Incidentally, Shri
Pradipkumar C Patel son of the petitioner and his wife
Mrs Jigshaben P Patel were having 437200 shares
forming 7.29% of total shares of Vimal Dairy. Therefore,
the averment made by the petitioner that no "relative" is
a shareholder or director of Vimal Dairy to whom MUCBL
provided credit facility is not acceptable the same being
misconceived and false.

<p id="p_32">  C/SCA/12852/2018                             JUDGMENT



</p><p id="p_33">(vi)   Further, it is also relevant to state that out of the
three new directors of Vimal Dairy registered with ROC
on July 20, 2016, only one director, viz. Shri Rameshbhai
Dwarkadas Patel was having 216000 shares of Vimal
Dairy whereas other two directors were not having any
shares of the company as per shareholding as on March
31, 2016, which shows that the so called reshuffling of
the Board of the company was just a camouflaging
exercise to overcome the directions issued by the RBI
and avail loan from MUCBL.
</p>
<p id="p_34">(vii) It was further observed during the inspection that
the petitioner and his son, Shri Jayesh Chandubhai Patel
had extended personal guarantee to Bank of India for the
loan availed by Vimal Dairy, which has been taken over
by MUCBL. From the above facts, it is explicit that the
petitioner and his relatives were interested parties in the
account and they have been acting in a manner
detrimental         to        the        interest        of
the depositors of MUCBL, the bank as well as the public
interest.
</p>
<p id="p_35">(b)    Account of Swastik Ceracon

From the statutory inspection conducted by RBI, it was
observed that Shri Jayeshbhai Chandubhai Patel, son of
the petitioner was not only past director of Swastik
Ceracon Ltd but was also having shares and directorship
in sister concerns; viz. Akik Tiles Ltd. and Gladder
Ceramics which were merged with Swastik Ceracon Ltd.
As per merger documents dated May 05, 2012, Shri J C
Patel was having shares in Swastik Ceracon (250000) and
Akik Tiles (120000) and Gladder Ceramics (1300200).
</p>
<p id="p_36">From the shareholding pattern as on March 31, 2016, as
revealed by the ROC, the family members of the
petitioner had 15.12% shares in the company and Shri
Keshavlal K Patel, brother of Shri G K Patel, Chairman of
MUCBL had 0.9% shares in the company. Besides, other
group companies viz. Vimal Energy and Vimal Dairy had

</pre><p id="p_37">Neither MUCBL in its letter dated August 18, 2018 nor the
Petitioners in the Petition mention that, there was
another loan account wherein the petitioner is interested
as observed by RBI during inspection of the bank as on
March 31, 2016 i.e., Cengres Tiles, details of which are as
under;
</p>
<p id="p_38">(i) In case of Cengres Tiles (a Private Limited company),
the bank stand of MUCBL that Shri Chandubhai Ishwarlal
Patel was having no interest in the firm was not true. In
support of this, the bank has furnished a copy of the ROC
search report containing names of three Directors as: (i)
Shri Parth Rajesh Shah, (ii) Shri Rakeshbhai Kacharabhai
Patel and (iii) Shri Ashish Chandravardan Patel and
concluded that they were not related to the Chairman.
The matter was examined during the inspection and it
was observed that the names of the Directors that were
shown as loan applicants were having much less
percentage of shareholding in the company than the
shareholding of Shri Chandubhai Ishwarlal Patel and his
relatives. Out of the total paid up capital of Rs. 775.00
lakh (77.50 lakh shares of RS. 10), the shares of these
three Directors aggregated to 520493 shares, forming
just 6.71% of paid up share capital whereas Shri
Chandubhai Ishwarbhai Patel and his family members
together had total 16,15,684 shares forming 20.84% of
paid UP capital of the company as on 31/03/2015 and
19.91% as on 31/03/2016.
</p>
<p id="p_39">(ii) Further, from the scrutiny of the loan account of
Cengres Tiles limit Rs. 800.00 lakh), it was observed that
the loan account had remained overdrawn for most of
the period and was brought down within the limit on
31/03/2016 by transferring funds of Rs.245.00 lakh from
another loan account (no. 0001/13/05/000281) of its
sister concern M/s Swastik Ceracon. As on 31/03/2016,
the            account            was           overdrawn
with outstanding balance of Rs. 805.52 lakh exceeding
the limit of Rs.800.00 lakh sanctioned.
</p>
<p id="p_40">(iii) Though the loan account of Cengres Tiles was closed
subsequent to RBI advice, the fact remains that at the
time of RBI inspection, the account was operational and
the petitioner was interested in the loan account and as a
director of the bank, the loan should not have been
availed by the company from the bank.

</p><p id="p_42">        (iv) The Petitioner thus is also guilty of suppression of
        material facts regarding his interest in Cengres Tiles.
</p>
<p id="p_43">        14. I submit that in view of the above, allowing the
        petitioner to be on the Board of the co-operative bank
        would be detrimental to the interest of the depositors of
        the bank, the bank itself as well as the public interest.
        Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to any relief as
        sought for, including any interim relief. Grant of any
        interim relief would jeopardise the interest of the bank
        and its depositors.
</p>
<p id="p_44">        15. In the facts and circumstances submitted herein
        above, the petitioner is not entitled to any relief as
        prayed for against the RBI. The petitioner has failed to
        show any reasonable ground for seeking relief against
        the RBI. Therefore, it is prayed that this Hon'ble Court
        may be pleased to dismiss the petition as against the
        respondent     no.2,      with    costs     thereof.

submit the following additional facts to apprise the
Hon'ble Court the actual state of affairs in sanctioning
the loan to the company, which has been deliberately
suppressed by the Petitioner. I submit that the loan
application submitted by the company for sanction of the
loan amount of Rs.30.00 crore was signed by the three
new directors who were appointed as directors of the
company on July 20, 2016. It is relevant to note that the
said loan application submitted to MUCBL, was undated.
</p>
<p id="p_49">b)    However, MUCBL's recommendation, signed by the
AGM of the bank on the loan application is dated July 11,
2016. It is explicit from this that the loan application was
signed by the three new directors well before their date
of appointment in Vimal Dairy Ltd i e. July 20, 2016, as
per the filing with ROC by the Company.
</p>
<p id="p_50">c)    I submit that the Board approval was recorded on
the loan application stating that the loan of Rs.30.00
crore was sanctioned vide board resolution no. 84 dated
July 22, 2016 which has been signed by the CEO on the
same                        date.
</p>
<p id="p_51">d)   As stated in the affidavit filed by the RBI on August
29, 2018, Shri Pradipbhai Chandubhai Patel, another son
of the Petitioner was a signatory to operate the loan
account of Vimal Dairy Ltd in MUCBL and continued to be
the signatory to operate the account of Vimal Dairy in
MUCBL even after change of directorship in July 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_52">e)    The chronology of events submitted above reveals
that the change in the directors of Vimal Dairy Ltd was
with the sole intention to overcome the prohibition
stipulated in the directions issued by RBI. It was a
camouflaging        exercise     to     overcome        the
restrictions/prohibition issued by the RBI. It further
reveals the malafide intention of the petitioner and his
relatives in the position of the Petitioner as Chairman
Emeritus in MUCBL to benefit the companies in which the
Petitioner and his relatives are interested in, at the cost
of the interest of the bank, its depositors and the public
interest.

relevant facts to the notice of this Hon'ble Court which

<p id="p_55">16.    Mr. M.S. Shah, the learned counsel appearing for the writ
applicant submitted that the writ application against a Multi-
State Scheduled Bank          is maintainable. He submitted that a
writ would lie against a cooperative society when the duty
owed by it is of a public nature or when there is infringement
of any statutory rules by a cooperative society. According to
Mr. Shah, the entire action initiated by the Bank against his
client is at the instance of the RBI and the same is illegal and
contrary to the principles of natural justice and, therefore, the
writ application is maintainable.

duty. He would submit that the duty owed by the Bank is not
of a public nature. There is no infringement of any statutory
rules by the Bank. Mr. Mehta would submit that his client has
taken the necessary steps for the removal of the writ applicant
as a Director from the Board of Directors keeping in mind the
guidelines and directions issued by the RBI.

<p id="p_60">20.   Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the

only question that falls for my consideration is whether this

against    a     Multi-State   Scheduled       Cooperative   Bank   is
maintainable in law?.
</p>
<p id="p_61">21.   I may in this regard at the outset notice that the Apex
Court in Supriyo Basu Vs. West Bengal Housing Board,
(2005) 6 SCC 289 held that a Co-operative Society is
constituted on agreement between the members thereof who
had agreed to abide by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_19">Co-operative
Societies Act</a> and the Rules framed thereunder or the bye-laws


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                               Page 24 of 96</span>

framed by the Society; that where the society is not a
department of the State and is also not a creature of a statute
but merely governed by a statute, only if it is established that
the mandatory provision of a statute has been violated, would
a writ petition be maintainable thereagainst. Referring to U.P.
State Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. Vs. Chandra
Bhan Dubey (1999) 1 SCC 741, it was held that the question to
be considered in determining whether a writ petition would lie
against a Co-operative Society is, what is the nature of the
statutory duty placed on it and the Court is to enforce such
statutory public duty.
</p>

<p id="p_62">22.   Reference may also be made to S.S. Rana Vs. Registrar,
Co- operative Societies (2006) 11 SCC 634 which was a case of
termination       by      Kangra   Central         Co-operative   Bank     Ltd.
constituted under the Himachal Pradesh Co-operative Societies
Act, 1968 of the services of its Branch Manager. The
contention of the Branch Manager in that case was that the
activities of the Co-operative Society being to lend money to
the agriculturists, the same would come within the purview of
Pradeep Kumar Biswas Vs. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology
MANU/SC/0330/2002            and     the     writ    petition   alleging   the
termination to be contrary to rules, bye-laws and principles of
natural justice would be maintainable. The Supreme Court held
that where a Society has not been constituted under an Act
and functions like any other Co-operative Society and is merely
regulated by the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_20">Co-operative Societies Act</a> and where the
State has no say in the functions of the Society, and where the
membership, acquisition of shares and all other matters are
governed by the bye-laws framed under the Act and the State
is not the majority shareholder of the Society and does not

exercise any direct or indirect control over the affairs of the
Society for deep and pervasive control and the State has only
to nominate one Director, it could not be said that the State
exercises any functional control over the affairs of the Society.
It was further held that several other relevant questions
required to be considered in deciding whether writ would lie
against the Society are, (i) How the Society was created; (ii)
Whether it enjoys any monopoly character; (iii) Do the
functions of the Society partake to statutory functions or public
functions; and (iv) Can it be characterized as public Authority.
The Kangra Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. was held to be not
answering any of the aforesaid tests. It was held that the
general regulations like the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_21">Companies Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_22">Co-operative
Societies Act</a> would not render the activities of a Company or a
Society as subject to control of the State and the purpose of
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_23">Companies Act</a> or the Co- operative
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_24">Societies Act</a> is only to ensure proper functioning of the Society
and the State or the statutory authorities as the Registrar Co-
operative Societies would have nothing to do with the day-to-
day functioning of the Society.
</p>

<p id="p_63">23.   I may notice that the writ petition, as filed, does not
contain any pleadings whatsoever as to the nature, character
or constitution of the respondent No.1-Bank or as to the
maintainability of the writ application against the respondent
No.1-Bank       and       presumes    the        writ   application   to   be
maintainable. Upon objection being taken by the respondents,
the maintainability of the writ application is justified only for
the reason of the control exercised by the Central Registrar,
Multi-State        Cooperative Societies under the <a href="/doc/1123621/" id="a_25">Multi-State
Cooperative Societies Act</a> and further that the entire action

taken by the bank is at the instance of the RBI. To put it in
other words, the submission canvassed on behalf of the writ
applicant is that as the action is at the behest of the RBI and
other statutory authorities and the impugned order has also
been passed by the bank in accordance with the directions of
the RBI and the Government of India, in substance, it could be
said that the impugned order has been passed by an
'authority' falling within the <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_26">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
</p>


<p id="p_64">24.   The respondent No.1-Bank has a distinct personality and
legal entity.        It is not a body constituted by the State
Government or the Central Government.           It is a Multi-State
Cooperative Society         incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1123621/" id="a_27">Multi-State
Cooperative Societies Act</a>. Mere regulatory control of the RBI
under a statute is not sufficient. The objective purpose of
applying the various tests is to decipher whether the body is
really an agency of the Government.           If a body is not an
agency of the Government, it is not an "Authority" within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_28">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_65">25.   <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_29">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is plenary in
nature and confers powers on the High Court of the country to
issue writs. The said Article reads as under;

      person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any
      Government, within those territories directions, orders or
      writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus,
      mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or
      any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights
      conferred by Part III and for any other purpose."

26.   The said Article states that every High Court                   has
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_76">jurisdiction to issue appropriate writs against any authority for
enforcement of rights conferred by Part III or for 'any other
purpose' . The said Article also states that writs can be issued
to 'any person'. The expression 'any person' and 'for any other
purpose' have been explained and elucidated upon by the
Supreme Court in its various decisions.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_66">27.   The very reading of the <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a> shows that the High
Court has power to issue writs or orders even against any
person for the enforcement of fundamental rights or for any
other purpose. The question which arises for decision is:
whether a writ or an order could be issued by the High Court
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_32">Article 226</a> of the Constitution against a cooperative
society which, no doubt, is covered by the definition of
"person" to enforce any statutory provisions by which the said
society may be governed?
</p>

<p id="p_67">28.   The rule of law is all pervasive in so far as our
constitution is concerned. The three important wings of the
Government, namely, legislative, executive and judicial, all the
public authorities created by constitution or by the statute are
amenable to the rule of law. It is axiomatic that a private
person is not to be governed by law. The question is of remedy
which should be available against a private person for
enforcing     the provisions    of the         statute   which   may be
applicable to a private person. The writ jurisdiction conferred
on the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_33">Article 226</a> is not a substitute for the
legal remedies or forums available to the citizens for enforcing
legal liabilities against particular citizens or authorities. The

writ jurisdiction is in the field of public law. The writ jurisdiction
has its origin in the English law. In English law also there has
taken place vast changes which have been discussed by H.M.
Seervai in the Constitutional Law of India, Volume II, 3rd

<blockquote id="blockquote_77">      "Since 1950 the concept of public law has been greatly
      enlarged. Secondly, they show that the restrictions
      imposed on the grant of mandamus by the Lewisham
      Case could not be sustained because they deprived
      mandamus of its essential character as a public law
      remedy. Since private law remedies and public law
      remedies were granted by the same Courts, the Courts
      were slow to realize the full implications of the public law
      aspect of prerogative writs and the consequences which
      flowed from that aspect. This implication has been.
      admirably brought oui by Prof. Schwartz and Prof.
      H.W.R.Wade. Referring to the prerogative remedies of
      certiorari, prohibition and mandamus, they wrote:- "The
      important aspect of the prerogative remedies is that they
      belong exclusively to public law (with the exception of
      habeas corpus), their primary object being to make the
      machinery object being to make the machinery of
      government work properly rather than to enforce private
      rights. This introduces a valuable 'public interest'
      element. An application for certiorari is, as the title of the
      case indicates, a proceeding by the Queen to call some
      public authority to account for exceeding or abusing its
      power. Similarly in a suit for mandamus the Queen is
      calling for the proper discharge of some public duty.
      Although private persons are of course the real plaintiffs,
      the public character of the proceedings is more than a
      mere form."

directed towards any person, corporation of inferior tribunal

or their office and is in the nature of public duty. An order of

certiorari is an order directing an inferior tribunal requiring the
record of the proceedings in some case or matter to be
transmitted into the High Court to be dealt with there. The
learned author while discussing the Indian law at page 1324 of
the Same edition has observed as follows:-
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_78">     "HOWEVER,soon after the Constitution come into force,
     the wide terms of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Article 226</a> were emphasized to
     support the contention that the High Courts were not
     limited to issuing directions or writs expressly mentioned
     in the Article but could issue "any order or direction"
     against "any person" for "any other purpose", that is, for
     "any purpose other than the enforcement of fundamental
     rights". This contention was negatived in a number of
     cases, where the petitioners asked for reliefs to which
     they were not entitled according to well-settled principles
     governing the issue of prerogative writs. Thus, in In re
     Nagabhushana, (1950) Madras 1119, the petitioner asked
     for a writ of prohibition against the various organs of a
     political party. In re Kallumattam Thippaswami, (1951) 2
     M.L.J. 171, the guardian of a minor prayed for writ of
     mandamus restraining the respondents, who were
     private parties, from cutting trees standing on certain
     survey numbers. In Indian Tobacco Corpn. Vs. Madras,
     (1954) Madras 754, the petitioner asked for a mandamus
     restraining the respondents from committing an alleged
     anticipatory breach of contract. The broad contention in
     these cases was that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> gave the court
     jurisdiction even to decide private disputes. The following
     propositions emerge from the cases rejecting that
     contention: (1) The literal construction of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a>
     could not have been intended because "it would enable
     any person to obtain any relief by an application under
     this Article. This construction of the Article would
     practically abrogate the entire judicial system and the
     machinery set up for the administration of justice in the
     State." (2) There is internal evidence in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_37">Article 226</a> that
     the words "to any person" and "for any purpose" cannot
     be construed literally. For, whatever other power <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_38">Article
     226</a> confers on the High Courts, it undoubtedly confers
     the power to issue writs in the nature of habeas corpus,
     mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto. But


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                             Page 30 of 96</span>
        C/SCA/12852/2018                             JUDGMENT



      these writs cannot be issued "to any person" and "for any
      purpose". The purposes for which, and the persons to
      whom, these writs can be issued have long been well
      settled. Therefore, the power to issue writs of the nature
      expressly mentioned "to any person" can only mean "the
      power to issue such a writ to any person to whom,
      according to well established principles the writ lay". And
      the words "for any other purpose" must mean "for any
      other purpose for which any of the writs would according
      to well-established principles issue" the word "other"
      being read in antithesis to "for the enforcement of
      fundamental rights". It is submitted that from the
      propositions set out in (2) above the following proposition
      must follow:- (3) Orders, directions or writs are to be
      issued "to any person" and for "any purpose", once the
      meaning of these words is ascertained with reference to
      writs, a different meaning cannot be given to them with
      reference to "orders" or "directions". Nor should this
      surprise us. In England, the writs of mandamus, certiorari
      and prohibition were replaced by "orders" of the same
      name in 1938; the writ of quo warranto was replaced first
      by information in the nature of quo warranto, and later
      by an injunction-that is, an order of the court. In India the
      writs of habeas corpus and mandamus were replaced by
      "directions" in the nature of, habeas corpus and by
      "directions" in the nature of mandamus by Section 491,
      Cr. P.C. and Section 45, <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_39">Specific Relief Act</a>, 1877,
      respectively. The words "orders" and "directions" were
      used to describe what at one time were called writs, and
      since the terminology had been in use in England and in
      India, all the three words have been used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">Article 226</a>
      to describe well-recognized English writs. (4) <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_41">Article 226</a>
      should not be construed so as to replace the ordinary
      remedies by way of a suit and application available to the
      litigant under the general law of the land."

the learned author that mandamus lies against a person

being in force, are clearly incumbent upon such person or
court in his or its public character or of such corporation in its

that as mandamus lies to secure the discharge of public duties
which are clearly incumbent under the law for time being in
force, it will not lie against private parties or for the
enforcement of contractual rights.

such circumstances, the Bank went before the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court took the view that the circulars issued

<p id="p_75">155. In the case of <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_45">Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib</a>, AIR 1981
SC 487, the Supreme Court laid down certain relevant
tests       for      determining        whether        a
company/society/corporation can be held to be an
agency or instrumentality of the State Government.
These tests are as under :--
</p>

<p id="p_76">(1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the
corporation is held by Govt. it would go a long way
towards indicating that the corporation is an
instrumentality or agency of Government.
</p>

<p id="p_77">(2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much
as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation,
it would afford Some indication of the corporation being
impregnated with governmental character.
</p>

<p id="p_78">(3) It may also be a relevant factor .... whether the
corporation enjoys monopoly status which is the State
conferred or State protected.
</p>

<p id="p_79">(4) Existence of 'deep and pervasive State control may
afford an indication that the Corporation is a State
Agency or instrumentality.
</p>

<p id="p_80">(5) If the functions of the corporation of Public
importance and closely related to governmental functions
it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation
as an instrumentality or agency of Govt.
</p>

<p id="p_81">(6) Specifically, if a department of Govt. is transferred to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                       Page 34 of 96</span>
  C/SCA/12852/2018                              JUDGMENT



a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of
this inference of the Corporation being an instrumentality
or agency of Government.
</p>

<p id="p_82">156 Proceeding further, the Supreme Court held that it
was immaterial whether the corporation was created by a
statute or under a state. The test is whether it is an
instrumentality or agency of the Government and not as
to how it was created. In the said case their Lordships
proceeded to observe that the Government may act
through the instrumentality or agency of a natural person
or it may employ the instrumentality or agency of
juridical person to carry out its functions. The test is that
it will be considered to be an agency and instrumentality
of the State. It is true that the corporation is a distinct
juristic entity with a corporate structure of its own and it
carries on its functions on business principles with a
certain amount of autonomy which is necessary as well
as useful from the point of view of effective business
management but behind the formal ownership which is
cast in the corporate mould, the reality is very much the
deeply pervasive presence of the Government, and it is
in fact the Government which acts through the
instrumentality or. agency of the corporation or the
juristic person. If the instrumentality and agency of the
Govt. discharges the Governmental functions it must be
subject to same limitations in the field of constitutional
law as the Government itself, though in the eye of the
law it would be a distinct and independent legal entity. In
Ajay Hasia's case (supra), the Supreme Court was
considering the obligations of instrumentalities and
agencies of the Government to respect the fundamental
rights of the citizens and they were held to be bound to
enforce the fundamental rights guaranteed to the
citizens of India under Part III of the Constitution of India.
If this binding was not there, the fundamental rights in
the opinion of the Supreme Court would then be reduced
to an idle dream or a promise of unreality. Because in the
constitution philosophy of a democratic socialist public
Govt. has to undertake a multitude of socio-economic
operations and the Govt. having regard to the practical
advantages of functioning through the legal device of a
corporation by resorting to create instrumentalities or
agencies which will not exonerate the Govt. itself from


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                       Page 35 of 96</span>
  C/SCA/12852/2018                           JUDGMENT



obeying the fundamental rights of the citizens. In the
context of enforcing fundamental rights, the Supreme
Court laid emphasis that by process of judicial
construction fundamental rights cannot be rendered
futile and meaningless. Because in the opinion of the
Apex Court, it is the fundamental rights which alone with
the directive principles constitute the life force of the
Constitution of India and they must be put into effective
action by meaningful and purposeful interpretation.
Therefore, it was observed that if a corporation or a
company is the instrumentality or agency of
Government, it must be held to be an authority within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_46">Article 12</a> of the Constitution and subject
to the same basic obligation to obey the fundamental
rights as the Government.
</p>

<p id="p_83">157. Applying the test nos.1 and 2 to the facts of the
case on hand, no materials have been placed on record
to even remotely indicate that the share capital of the
bank is held by the Central Government or the State
Government, or the bank is dependent upon the
Government for financial assistance. There is nothing to
even remotely suggest that the Standard Chartered Bank
enjoys any monopoly status conferred by the State. With
regard to the fourth test, there is nothing to indicate
existence of deep and pervasive State control. All that
can be said is that the directives of the Reserve Bank of
India are binding on the bank. With regard to the fifth
test, although it has been very vociferously submitted by
Mr.Shelat, the learned appearing on behalf of the
petitioners, that the functions of the bank are of public
importance and further the bank could be said to be
discharging a public function which is akin to a
Governmental function, yet this argument pales into
insignificance in view of the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_47">Federal Bank Limited v. Sagar
Thomas and others</a>, (2003)10 SCC 733. We shall discuss
the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Federal
Bank Limited (supra) a little later.

<p id="p_84">158 While dealing with the test based on functions of
the Coirporation of public importance, the Supreme Court
in Ramana Dayaram Shetty's case, AIR 1979 SC 1628,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                     Page 36 of 96</span>

referred to E.S.Evans v. Charles E.Newton, (1966)382 US
296 and Smith v. Allwright, (1943)32 US 649, and
observed that the decisions show that the test of public
or governmental character of the function is not easy of
application and does not invariably lead to the correct
inference because the range of governmental activity is
broad and varied and merely because an activity may be
such as may legitimately be carried on by Government, it
does not mean that a Corporation which is otherwise a
private entity, would be an instrumentality or agency of
the Government by reason of carrying of such activity. In
applying the test, therefore, a further precaution is to be
taken and it is to be seen whether the public nature of
the function is impregnated with governmental character
or tied or entwined with Government or fortified by some
other additional factor (vide observations in para 18
column 2 at page 641). In our view, therefore, the fifth
test is also not satisfied.
</p>

<p id="p_85">159. Thus, so far as the tests laid down by the Supreme
Court in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra) is concerned,
none of the tests could be said to be fulfilled so as to
make the Standard Chartered Bank, a private bank,
amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court.

<p id="p_89">Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_54">Article 13</a> defines 'law' as including any

Ambedkar in Constituent Assembly explaining the
purpose sought to be achieved by <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_55">Article 12.</a> In RSEB's
case, the majority adopted the test that a statutory
authority "would be within the meaning of 'other
authorities' if it has been invested with statutory power
to issue binding directions to the parties, disobedience of
which would entail penal consequences or it has the
sovereign power to make rules and regulations having
the force of law".
</p>

<p id="p_90">In Sukhdev Singh's case, the principal reason which
prevailed with A.N. Ray, CJ for holding ONGC, LIC and IFC
as authorities and hence 'the State' was that rules and
regulations framed by them have the force of law. In
Sukhdev Singh's case, Mathew J. held that the test laid
down in RSEB's case was satisfied so far as ONGC is
concerned but the same was not satisfied in the case of
LIC and IFC and, therefore, he added to the list of tests
laid down in RSEB's case, by observing that though there
are no statutory provisions, so far as LIC and IFC are
concerned, for issuing binding directions to third parties,
the disobedience of which would entail penal
consequences, yet these corporations (i) set up under
statutes, (ii) to carry on business of public importance or
which is fundamental to the life of the people ___ can be
considered as the State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_56">Article 12.</a>
Thus, it is the functional test which was devised and
utilized by Mathew J. and there he said,

       corporation set up under a special statute to carry
       on a business or service which Parliament thinks
       necessary to be carried on in the interest of the
       nation is an agency or instrumentality of the State
       and would be subject to the limitations expressed in
       <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_57">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution. The State is an
       abstract entity. It can only act through the
       instrumentality or agency of natural or juridicial
       persons. Therefore, there is nothing strange in the
       notion of the State acting through a corporation and
       making it an agency or instrumentality of the
       State".
</p>

<p id="p_91">It is pertinent to note that functional tests became
necessary because of the State having chosen to entrust
its own functions to an instrumentality or agency in
absence whereof that function would have been a State
activity on account of its public importance and being
fundamental to the life of the people.

       and it must invade the constitutional rights of

       developed by Mathew J. prevents a large-scale
       evasion of fundamental rights by transferring work
       done     in   Govt.   Departments     to   statutory
       Corporations, whilst retaining Govt. control.
       Company legislation in India permits tearing of the
       corporate veil in certain cases and to look behind
       the real legal personality. But Mathew J. achieved
       the same result by a different route, namely, by
       drawing out the implications of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_64">Article 13(2)" (Para
       7.57 ibid).</a>
</p>

<p id="p_94">The terms instrumentality or agency of the State are not
to be found mentioned in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_65">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
Nevertheless they fall within the ken of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_66">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution for the simple reason that if the State
chooses to set up an instrumentality or agency and
entrusts it with the same power, function or action which
would otherwise have been exercised or undertaken by
itself, there is no reason why such instrumentality or
agency should not be subject to same constitutional and
public law limitations as the State would have been. In
different judicial pronouncements, some of which we
have reviewed, any company, corporation, society or any
other entity having a juridical existence if it has been
held to be an instrumentality or agency of the State, it
has been so held only on having found to be an alter ego,
a double or a proxy or a limb or an off-spring or a mini-
incarnation or a vicarious creature or a surrogate and so
on __ by whatever name called __ of the State. In short,
the material available must justify holding of the entity
wearing a mask or a veil worn only legally and outwardly
which on piercing fails to obliterate the true character of
the State in disguise. Then it is an instrumentality or
agency of the State.
</p>

<p id="p_95">It is this basic and essential distinction between an
'instrumentality or agency' of the State and 'other
authorities' which has to be borne in mind. An authority
must be an authority sui juris to fall within the meaning
of the expression 'other authorities' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_67">Article 12.</a> A
juridical entity, though an authority, may also satisfy the
test of being an instrumentality or agency of the State in

which event such authority may be held to be an
instrumentality or agency of the State but not the vice
versa.
</p>

<p id="p_96">We sum up our conclusions as under:-
</p>

<p id="p_97">(1) Simply by holding a legal entity to be an
instrumentality or agency of the State it does not
necessarily become an authority within the meaning of
'other authorities' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_68">Article 12.</a> To be an authority, the
entity should have been created by a statute or under a
statute and functioning with liability and obligations to
public. Further, the statute creating the entity should
have vested that entity with power to make law or issue
binding directions amounting to law within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_69">Article 13(2)</a> governing its relationship with other
people or the affairs of other people __ their rights,
duties, liabilities or other legal relations. If created under
a statute, then there must exist some other statute
conferring on the entity such powers. In either case, it
should have been entrusted with such functions as are
governmental or closely associated therewith by being of
public importance or being fundamental to the life of the
people and hence governmental. Such authority would be
the State, for, one who enjoys the powers or privileges of
the State must also be subjected to limitations and
obligations of the State. It is this strong statutory flavour
and clear indicia of power __ constitutional or statutory,
and its potential or capability to act to the detriment of
fundamental rights of the people, which makes it an
authority; though in a given case, depending on the facts
and circumstances, an authority may also be found to be
an instrumentality or agency of the State and to that
extent they may overlap. Tests 1, 2 and 4 in Ajay Hasia
enable determination of Governmental ownership or
control. Tests 3, 5 and 6 are 'functional' tests. The
propounder of the tests himself has used the words
suggesting relevancy of those tests for finding out if an
entity was instrumentality or agency of the State.
Unfortunately thereafter the tests were considered
relevant for testing if an authority is the State and this
fallacy has occurred because of difference between
'instrumentality and agency' of the State and an
'authority' having been lost sight of sub-silentio,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                       Page 41 of 96</span>

unconsciously and un-deliberated. In our opinion, and
keeping in view the meaning which 'authority' carries,
the question whether an entity is an 'authority' cannot be
answered by applying Ajay Hasia tests.
</p>

<p id="p_98">(2) The tests laid down in Ajay Hasia's case are relevant
for the purpose of determining whether an entity is an
instrumentality or agency of the State. Neither all the
tests are required to be answered in positive nor a
positive answer to one or two tests would suffice. It will
depend upon a combination of one or more of the
relevant factors depending upon the essentiality and
overwhelming nature of such factors in identifying the
real source of governing power, if need be by removing
the mask or piercing the veil disguising the entity
concerned. When an entity has an independent legal
existence, before it is held to be the State, the person
alleging it to be so must satisfy the Court of brooding
presence of government or deep and pervasive control of
the government so as to hold it to be an instrumentality
or agency of the State.

(2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much
as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation,
it would afford some indication of the corporation being
impregnated with governmental character.

<p id="p_103">(3) It may also be a relevant factor ⬦ whether the
corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State-
conferred or State-protected.
</p>

<p id="p_104">(4) Existence of deep and pervasive State control may
afford an indication that the corporation is a State agency

<p id="p_105">(5) If the functions of the corporation are of public

<p id="p_107">163. The aforesaid ratio in Ramana Dayaram Shetty

  within which to determine, whether a particular entity
  falls within the definition of other authority, as given in
  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_74">Article 12.</a> The ultimate conclusion of the Constitution
  Bench are recorded in paragraph 39 and 40 as under :-
</p>

<p id="p_110">  39. Fresh off the judicial anvil is the decision in <a href="/doc/1944115/" id="a_75">Mysore
  Paper Mills Ltd. v. Mysore Paper Mills Officers' Assn</a>.,
  (2002)2 SCC 167, which fairly represents what we have
  seen as a continuity of thought commencing from the
  decision in Rajasthan Electricity Board in 1967 up to the
  present time. It held that a company substantially
  financed and financially controlled by the Government,
  managed by a Board of Directors nominated and
  removable at the instance of the Government and
  carrying on important functions of public interest under
  the control of the Government is 'an authority' within the
  meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_76">Article 12.</a>
</p>

<p id="p_111">40.The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests
  formulated in Ajay Hasia are not a rigid set of principles
  so that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex
  hypothesi, be considered to be a State within the
  meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_77">Article 12.</a> The question in each case would
  be, whether in the light of the cumulative facts as
  established, the body is financially, functionally and
  administratively dominated by or under the control of the
  Government. Such control must be particular to the body
  in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then
  the body is a State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_78">Article 12.</a> On the other hand,
  when the control is merely regulatory whether under
  statute or otherwise, it would not serve to make the body
  a State.

  Chartered Bank as one of the Scheduled Banks under the
  <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_79">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, 1934, cannot be regarded as
  Governmental or of essential public importance or as
  closely related to Governmental functions or being
  fundamental to the life of the people and duties and
  obligations to the public at large. The bank has its own
  resources to raise its funds without any contribution or
  shareholding by the State. It is not in dispute that it has
  its own Board of Directors. It works like any other private
  company in the banking business.

</p><p id="p_114">166. In the aforesaid context, it will be profitable for us
to look into a decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_80">Federal Bank Limited v. Sagar Thomas and others</a>,
(2003)10 SCC 733. In the said case, the respondent no.1
was working as a Branch Manager in the Federal Bank.
He was suspended on 29th May 1982 since a disciplinary
inquiry was ordered into some charges of misconduct.
The Inquiry Officer found him guilty of the charges and
ultimately awarded punishment of dismissal. The
respondent no.1 challenged his dismissal by filing a writ
petition in the High Court. A preliminary objection to the
maintainability of the writ petition was taken by the
appellant Bank, saying that it was a private bank and not
a State or its agency or instrumentality within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_81">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India. The
learned Single Judge of the High Court, however, found
that the Federal Bank performed a public duty, and as
such, it would get covered under the definition of 'other
authority' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_82">Article 12</a>, and as such,
the writ petition was maintainable. The order passed by
the learned Single Judge was carried in appeal and the
appeal was also dismissed. The Federal Bank challenged
the order passed by the High Court, dismissing the
appeal, before the Supreme Court. The question which
fell for the consideration before the Supreme Court on
appeal was, whether the appellant Bank was a private
body or fell within the definition of a State or legal or
other authorities under the control of the Government
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_83">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of
India.
</p>

<p id="p_115">167. The observations of the Supreme Court               as
contained in paragraphs 26 to 33 are worth noting :
</p>

<p id="p_116">26. A company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_84">Companies Act</a> for
the purposes of carrying on any trade or business is a
private enterprise to earn livelihood and to make profits
out of such activities. Banking is also a kind of profession
and a commercial activity, the primary motive behind it
can well be said to earn returns and profits. Since time
immemorial, such activities have been carried on by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                       Page 45 of 96</span>

individuals generally. It is a private affair of the company
though case of nationalized banks stands on a different
footing. There may, well be companies, in which majority
of the share capital may be contributed out of the State
funds and in that view of the matter there may be more
participation or dominant participation of the State in
managing the affairs of the company. But in the present
case we are concerned with a banking company which
has its own resources to raise its funds without any
contribution or shareholding by the State. It has its own
Board of Directors elected by its shareholders. It works
like any other private company in the banking business
having no monopoly status at all. Any company carrying
on banking business with a capital of five lacs will
become a scheduled bank. All the same, banking activity
as a whole carried on by various banks undoubtedly has
an impact and effect on the economy of the country in
general. Money of the shareholders and the depositors is
with such companies, carrying on banking activity. The
banks finance the borrowers on any given rate of interest
at a particular time. They advance loans as against
securities. Therefore, it is obviously necessary to have
regulatory check over such activities in the interest of the
company itself, the shareholders, the depositors as well
as to maintain the proper financial equilibrium of the
national economy. The Banking companies have not been
set up for the purposes of building economy of the State
on the other hand such private companies have been
voluntarily established for their own purposes and
interest but their activities are kept under check so that
their activities may not go wayward and harm the
economy in general. A private banking company with all
freedom that it has, has to act in a manner that it may
not be in conflict with or against the fiscal policies of the
State and for such purposes, guidelines are provided by
the Reserve Bank so that a proper fiscal discipline, to
conduct its affairs in carrying on its business, is
maintained. So as to ensure adherence to such fiscal
discipline, if need be, at times even the management of
the company can be taken over. Nonetheless, as
observed earlier, these are all regulatory measures to
keep a check and provide guideline and not a
participatory dominance or control over the affairs of the
company. For other companies in general carrying on
other business activities may be manufacturing, other
industries or any business, such checks are provided

under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_85">Companies Act</a>, as indicated
earlier. There also, the main consideration is that the
company itself may not sink because of its own
mismanagement or the interest of the shareholders or
people generally may not be jeopardized for that reason.
Besides taking care of such interest as indicated above,
there is no other interest of the State, to control the
affairs and management of the private companies. The
care is taken in regard to the industries covered under
the Industries (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_86">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951
that their production which is important for the economy
may not go down yet the business activity is carried on
by such companies or corporations which only remains a
private activity of the entrepreneurs/companies.
</p>

<p id="p_117">27. Such private companies would normally not be
amenable to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_87">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. But in certain circumstances a writ may
issue to such private bodies or persons as there may be
statutes which need to be complied with by all concerned
including the private companies. For example, there are
certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_88">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the
<a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_89">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_90">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining
proper environment say Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_91">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 or Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_92">Control of
Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 etc. or statutes of the like nature
which fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily
upon such private bodies which they are bound to comply
with. If they violate such a statutory provision a writ
would certainly be issued for compliance of those
provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispense
with the service of its employee in violation of the
provisions contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_93">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in
innumerable cases the High Court interfered and have
issued the writ to the private bodies and the companies
in that regard. But the difficulty in issuing a writ may
arise where there may not be any non-compliance or
violation of any statutory provision by the private body.
In that event a writ may not be issued at all. Other
remedies, as may be available, may have to be resorted
to.
</p>

<p id="p_118">28. The six factors which have been enumerated in the
case of Ajay Hasia (supra) and approved in the later


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                      Page 47 of 96</span>

decisions in the case of Ramana (supra) and the seven
Judges Bench in the case of Pradeep Kumar Biswas
(supra) may be applied to the facts of the present case
and see as to those tests apply to the appellant bank or
not. As indicated earlier, share capital of the appellant
bank is not held at all by the government nor any
financial assistance is provided by the State, nothing to
say which may meet almost the entire expenditure of the
company. The third factor is also not answered since the
appellant bank does not enjoy any monopoly status nor it
can be said to be an institution having State protection.
So far control over the affairs of the appellant bank is
concerned, they are managed by the Board of Directors
elected by its shareholders. No governmental agency or
officer is connected with the affairs of the appellant bank
nor anyone of them is a member of the Board of
Directors. In the normal functioning of the private
banking company there is no participation or interference
of the State or its authorities. The statutes have been
framed regulating the financial and commercial activities
so that fiscal equilibrium may be kept maintained and not
get disturbed by the malfunctioning of such companies or
institutions involved in the business of banking. These
are regulatory measures for the purposes of maintaining
the healthy economic atmosphere in the country. Such
regulatory measures are provided for other companies
also as well as industries manufacturing goods of
importance. Otherwise these are purely private
commercial activities. It deserves to be noted that it
hardly makes any difference that such supervisory
vigilance is kept by the Reserve Bank of India under a
Statute or the Central Government. Even if it was with
the Central Government in place of the Reserve Bank of
India it would not have made any difference, therefore,
the argument based on the decision of All India Bank
Employees' Association (supra) does not advance the
case of the respondent. It is only in case of
malfunctioning of the company that occasion to exercise
such powers arises to protect the interest of the
depositors, shareholders or the company itself or to help
the company to be out of the woods. In the times of
normal functioning such occasions do not arise except for
routine inspections etc. with a view to see that things are
moved smoothly in keeping with fiscal policies in general.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                      Page 48 of 96</span>

</p><p id="p_120">29. There are a number of such companies carrying on
the profession of banking. There is nothing which can be
said to be close to the governmental functions. It is an
old profession in one form or the other carried on by
individuals or by a group of them. Losses incurred in the
business are theirs as well as the profits. Any business or
commercial activity, may be banking, manufacturing
units or related to any other kind of business generating
resources, employment, production and resulting in
circulation of money are no doubt, are such which do
have impact on the economy of the country in general.
But such activities cannot be classified one falling in the
category of discharging duties, functions of public nature.
Thus the case does not fall in the fifth category of cases
enumerated in the case of Ajay Hasia (supra). Again we
find that the activity which is carried on by the appellant
is not one which may have been earlier carried on by the
government and transferred to the appellant company.
For the sake of argument even if it may be assumed that
one or the other test as provided in the case of Ajay
Hasia (supra) may be attracted that by itself would not
be sufficient to hold that it is an agency of the State or a
company carrying on the functions of public nature. In
this connection, observations made in the case of
Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra) quoted earlier would also
be relevant.
</p>

<p id="p_121">30. We may now consider the two decisions i.e. Andi
Mukta (supra) and the U.P. State Co-operative Land
Development Bank Ltd.(supra)upon which much reliance
has been placed on behalf of the respondents to show
that a writ would lie against the appellant company. So
far the decision in the case of U.P. State Co-operative
Land Development Bank Ltd.(supra) is concerned, it
stands entirely on a different footing and we have
elaborately discussed it earlier.
</p>

<p id="p_122">31. The other case which has been heavily relied upon is
Andi Mukta (supra). It is no doubt held that a Mandamus
can be issued to any person or authority performing
public duty, owing positive obligation to the affected
party. The writ petition was held to be maintainable since
the teacher whose services were terminated by the
institution was affiliated to the university and was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                       Page 49 of 96</span>

governed by the Ordinances, casting certain obligations
which it owed to that petitioner. But it is not the case
here. Our attention has been drawn by the learned
counsel for the appellant to paragraphs 12, 13 and 21 of
the decision (Andi Mukta) to indicate that even according
to this case no writ would lie against the private body
except where it has some obligation to discharge which is
statutory or of public character.
</p>

<p id="p_123">32. Merely because the Reserve Bank of India lays the
banking policy in the interest of the banking system or in
the interest of monetary stability or sound economic
growth having due regard to the interests of the
depositors etc. as provided under <a href="/doc/216565/" id="a_94">Section 5(c)(a)</a> of the
Banking Regulation Act does not mean that the private
companies carrying on the business of or commercial
activity of banking, discharge any public function or
public duty. These are all regulatory measures applicable
to those carrying on commercial activity in banking and
these companies are to act according to these provisions
failing which certain consequences follow as indicated in
the Act itself. Provision regarding acquisition of a banking
company by the Government, it may be pointed out that
any private property can be acquired by the Government
in public interest. It is now judicially accepted norm that
private interest has to give way to the public interest. If a
private property is acquired in public interest it does not
mean that the party whose property is acquired is
performing or discharging any function or duty of public
character though it would be so for acquiring authority.
</p>

<p id="p_124">33. For the discussion held above, in our view, a private
company carrying on banking business as a scheduled
bank, cannot be termed as an institution or company
carrying on any statutory or public duty. A private body
or a person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction only
where it may become necessary to compel such body or

Respondent's service with the bank stands terminated.
The action of the Bank was challenged by the respondent
by filing a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_96">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India. The respondent is not trying to
enforce any statutory duty on the part of the Bank. That
being the position, the appeal deserves to be allowed.

</p>

<p id="p_128">10. The Writ of Mandamus lies to secure the performance
of a public or a statutory duty. The prerogative remedy of
mandamus has long provided the normal means of
enforcing the performance of public duties by public
authorities. Originally, the writ of mandamus was merely
an administrative order from the sovereign to
subordinates. In England, in early times, it was made
generally available through the Court of King's Bench,
when the Central Government had little administrative
machinery of its own. Early decisions show that there was
free use of the writ for the enforcement of public duties
of all kinds, for instance against inferior tribunals which
refused to exercise their jurisdiction or against municipal
corporation which did not duly hold elections, meetings,
and so forth. In modern times, the mandamus is used to
enforce statutory duties of public authorities. The courts
always retained the discretion to withhold the remedy
where it would not be in the interest of justice to grant it.

<p id="p_129">  C/SCA/12852/2018                             JUDGMENT



It is also to be noticed that the statutory duty imposed on
the public authorities may not be of discretionary
character. A distinction had always been drawn between
the public duties enforceable by mandamus that are
statutory and duties arising merely from contract.
Contractual duties are enforceable as matters of private
law by ordinary contractual remedies such as damages,
injunction, specific performance and declaration. In the
Administrative Law (Ninth Edition) by Sir William Wade
and Christopher Forsyth, (Oxford University Press) at
page 621, the following opinion is expressed:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_82">       "A distinction which needs to be clarified is that
       between public duties enforceable by mandamus,
       which are usually statutory, and duties arising
       merely from contract. Contractual duties are
       enforceable as matters of private law by the
       ordinary contractual remedies, such as damages,
       injunction, specific performance and declaration.
       They are not enforceable by mandamus, which in
       the first place is confined to public duties and
       secondly is not granted where there are other
       adequate remedies. This difference is brought out
       by the relief granted in cases of ultra vires. If for
       example a minister or a licensing authority acts
       contrary to the principles of natural justice,
       certiorari and mandamus are standard remedies.
       But if a trade union disciplinary committee acts in
       the same way, these remedies are inapplicable: the
       rights of its members depend upon their contract of
       membership, and are to be protected by declaration
       and injunction, which accordingly are the remedies
       employed in such cases."

<p id="p_130">11. Judicial review is designed to prevent the cases of
abuse of power and neglect of duty by public authorities.
However, under our Constitution, <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_98">Article 226</a> is couched
in such a way that a writ of mandamus could be issued
even against a private authority. However, such private
authority must be discharging a public function and that
the decision sought to be corrected or enforced must be
in discharge of a public function. The role of the State
expanded enormously and attempts have been made to
create various agencies to perform the governmental


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                       Page 52 of 96</span>

functions. Several corporations and companies have also
been formed by the government to run industries and to
carry on trading activities. These have come to be known
as Public Sector Undertakings. However, in the
interpretation given to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_99">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, this
Court took the view that many of these companies and
corporations could come within the sweep of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_100">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution. At the same time, there are private
bodies also which may be discharging public functions. It
is difficult to draw a line between the public functions and
private functions when it is being discharged by a purely
private authority. A body is performing a "public function"
when it seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the
public or a section of the public and is accepted by the
public or that section of the public as having authority to
do so. Bodies therefore exercise public functions when
they intervene or participate in social or economic affairs
in the public interest. In a book on Judicial Review of
Administrative Action (Fifth Edn.) by de Smith, Woolf &amp;
Jowell in Chapter 3 para 0.24, it is stated thus:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_83">       "A body is performing a "public function" when it
       seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the
       public or a section of the public and is accepted by
       the public or that section of the public as having
       authority to do so. Bodies therefore exercise public
       functions when they intervene or participate in
       social or economic affairs in the public interest. This
       may happen in a wide variety of ways. For instance,
       a body is performing a public function when it
       provides "public goods" or other collective services,
       such as health care, education and personal social
       services, from funds raised by taxation. A body may
       perform public functions in the form of adjudicatory
       services (such as those of the criminal and civil
       courts and tribunal system). They also do so if they
       regulate commercial and professional activities to
       ensure compliance with proper standards. For all
       these purposes, a range of legal and administrative
       techniques may be deployed, including: rule-
       making, adjudication (and other forms of dispute
       resolution); inspection; and licensing.</blockquote>


<p id="p_131">       Public functions need not be the exclusive domain

       of the state. Charities, self-regulatory organizations
       and other nominally private institutions (such as
       universities, the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's of London,
       churches) may in reality also perform some types of
       public function. As Sir John Donaldson M.R. urged, it
       is important for the courts to "recognise the realities
       of executive power" and not allow "their vision to be
       clouded by the subtlety and sometimes complexity
       of the way in which it can be exerted". Non-
       governmental bodies such as these are just as
       capable of abusing their powers as is government."

<p id="p_132">12. In Regina v. Panel on Take-overs and Merges, Ex
parte Datafin Plc. And another (1987) 1 Queen's Bench
Division 815, a question arose whether the Panel of Take-
overs and Mergers had acted in concert with other
parties in breach of the City Code on Take-overs and
Mergers. The panel dismissed the complaint of the
applicants. Though the Panel on Take-over and Mergers
was purely a private body, the Court of Appeal held that
the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court was
adaptable and could be extended to any body which
performed or operated as an integral part of a system
which performed public law duties, which was supported
by public law sanctions and which was under an
obligation to act judicially, but whose source of power
was not simply the consent of those over whom it
exercised that power; that although the panel purported
to be part of a system of self- regulation and to derive its
powers solely from the consent of those whom its
decisions affected, it was in fact operating as an integral
part of a governmental framework for the regulation of
financial activity in the City of London, was supported by
a periphery of statutory powers and penalties, and was
under a duty in exercising what amounted to public
powers to act judicially; that, therefore, the court had
jurisdiction to review the panel's decision to dismiss the
applicants' complaint; but that since, on the facts, there
were no grounds for interfering with the panel's decision,
the court would decline to intervene.

<p id="p_133">13. Lloyd L.J., agreeing with the opinion expressed by Sir
John Donaldson M.R. held :
</p>

       "I do not agree that the source of the power is the
       sole test whether a body is subject to judicial
       review, nor do I so read Lord Diplock's speech. Of
       course the source of the power will often, perhaps
       usually, be decisive. If the source of power is a
       statute, or subordinate legislation under a statute,
       then clearly the body in question will be subject to
       judicial review. If at the end of the scale, the source
       of power is contractual, as in the case of private
       arbitration, then clearly the arbitrator is not subject
       to judicial review.
</p>

<p id="p_135">14. In that decision, they approved the observations
made by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions
vs. Minister for the Civil Service (1985) A.C. 374, 409
wherein it was held:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_84">       "For a decision to be susceptible to judicial review
       the decision- maker must be empowered by public
       law (and not merely, as in arbitration, by agreement
       between private parties) to make decisions that, if
       validly made, will lead to administrative action or
       abstention from action by an authority endowed by
       law with executive powers which have one or other
       of the consequences mentioned in the preceding
       paragraph. The ultimate source of the decision-
       making power is nearly always nowadays a statute
       or subordinate legislation made under the statute;
       but in the absence of any statute regulating the
       subject matter of the decision the source of the
       decision-making power may still be the common law
       itself, i.e., that part of the common law that is given
       by lawyers the label of 'the prerogative.' Where this
       is the source of decision-making power, the power
       is confined to executive officers of central as
       distinct from local government and in constitutional
       practice is generally exercised by those holding
       ministerial rank"

<p id="p_136">15. It is also pertinent to refer to Sir John Donaldson M.R.
in that Take-Over Panel case :

       "In all the reports it is possible to find enumerations
       of factors giving rise to the jurisdiction, essential or
       as being exclusive of other factors. Possibly the only
       essential elements are what can be described as a
       public element, which can take many different
       forms, and the exclusion from the jurisdiction of
       bodies whose sole source of power is a consensual
       submission to is jurisdiction."

<p id="p_138">16. The above guidelines and principles applied by
English courts cannot be fully applied to Indian conditions
when exercising jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_101">Article 226</a> or 32 of
the Constitution. As already stated, the power of the High
Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_102">Article 226</a> is very wide and these powers
have to be exercised by applying the constitutional
provisions and judicial guidelines and violation, if any, of
the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the
Constitution. In the matter of employment of workers by
private bodies on the basis of contracts entered into
between them, the courts had been reluctant to exercise
the powers of judicial review and whenever the powers
were exercised as against private employers, it was
solely done based on public law element involved
therein.

before this Court. This Court held at pages 589-590 as
under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_85">       "....that the applicant for a mandamus should have
       a legal and specific right to enforce the
       performance of those dues. Therefore, the condition
       precedent for the issue of mandamus is that there is
       in one claiming it a legal right to the performance of
       a legal duty by one against whom it is sought. An
       order of mandamus is, in form, a command directed
       to a person, corporation or any inferior tribunal
       requiring him or them to do s particular thing
       therein specified which appertains to his or their
       office and is in the nature of a public duty. It is,
       however, not necessary that the person or the
       authority on whom the statutory duty is imposed
       need be a public official or an official body. A
       mandamus can issue, for instance, to an official of a
       society to compel him to carry out the terms of the
       statute under or by which the society is constituted
       or governed and also to companies or corporations
       to carry out duties placed on them by the statutes
       authorizing their undertakings. A mandamus would
       also lie against a company constituted by a statute
       for the purpose of fulfilling public responsibilities
       [Cf. Halsbury's Laws of England (3rd Ed.), Vol.II p 52
       and onwards].

       by a statute in respect of which enforcement could
       be sought by means of a mandamus, nor was there
       in its workmen any corresponding legal right for
       enforcement of any such statutory or public duty.
       The High Court, therefore, was right in holding that

<blockquote id="blockquote_87">       "7. In de Smith, Woolf and Jowell's Judicial Review of
       Administrative Action, 5th Edn., it is noticed that not
       all the activities of the private bodies are subject to
       private law, e.g., the activities by private bodies
       may be governed by the standards of public when
       its decisions are subject to duties conferred by
       statute or when by virtue of the function it is
       performing or possible its dominant position in the
       market, it is under an implied duty to act in the
       public interest. By way of illustration, it is noticed
       that a private company selected to run a prison
       although motivated by commercial profit should be
       regarded, at least in relation to some of its
       activities, as subject to public law because of the
       nature of the function it is performing. This is
       because the prisoners, for whose custody and care
       it is responsible, are in the prison in consequence of
       an order of the court, and the purpose and nature of
       their detention is a matter of public concern and
       interest. After detailed discussion, the learned
       authors have summarized the position with the
       following propositions :</blockquote>


<p id="p_142">       (1) The test of a whether a body is performing a
       public function, and is hence amenable to judicial
       review, may not depend upon the source of its

       power or whether the body is ostensibly a "public"
       or a "private" body.
</p>

<p id="p_143">       (2) The principles of judicial review prima facie
       govern the activities of bodies performing public
       functions.
</p>

<p id="p_144">       (3) However, not all decisions taken by bodies in the
       course of their public functions are the subject
       matter of judicial review. In the following two
       situations judicial review will not normally be
       appropriate even though the body may be
       performing a public function


</p><p id="p_145">       (a) Where some other branch of the law more
       appropriately governs the dispute between the
       parties. In such a case, that branch of the law and
       its remedies should and normally will be applied;
       and


</p><p id="p_146">       (b) Where there is a contract between the litigants.
       In such a case the express or implied terms of the
       agreement should normally govern the matter. This
       reflects the normal approach of English law,
       namely, that the terms of a contract will normally
       govern the transaction, or other relationship
       between the parties, rather than the general law.
       Thus, where a special method of resolving disputes
       (such as arbitration or resolution by private or
       domestic tribunals) has been agreed upon by the
       parties (expressly or by necessary implication), that
       regime, and not judicial review, will normally govern
       the dispute.

workers of the appellant and they filed various writ
petitions contending that they had to be treated as

appeal, but the same was dismissed and the decision of

held that any business or commercial activity, whether it

Court in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_115">Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas
Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust &amp; Ors. Vs.
V.R. Rudani &amp; Ors</a> (1989) 2 SCC 691. In this case, the
appellant was a Trust running a science college affiliated
to the Gujarat University under Gujarat University Act,
1949. The teachers working in that college were paid in
the pay scales recommended by the University Grants
Commission and the college was an aided institution.
There was some dispute between the University Teachers
Association and the University regarding the fixation of
their pay scales. Ultimately, the Chancellor passed an
award and this award was accepted by the State Govt. as
well as the University and the University directed to pay
the teachers as per the award. The appellants refused to
implement the award and the respondents filed a writ
petition seeking a writ of mandamus and in the writ
petition the appellants contended that the college
managed by the Trust was not an "authority" coming
within the purview of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_116">Article 12</a> of the Constitution and
therefore the writ petition was not maintainable. This
plea was rejected and this Court held that the writ of
mandamus would lie against a private individual and the
words "any person or authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_117">Article 226</a> are
not to be confined only to statutory authorities and
instrumentalities of the State and they may cover any
other person or body performing public duty. The form of
the body concerned is not very much relevant. What is
relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on the body.
The duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation
owed by the person or authority to the affected party. No
matter by what means the duty is imposed, if a positive
obligation exists, mandamus cannot be denied.
</p>

<p id="p_151">29. Thus, it can be seen that a writ of mandamus or the
remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_118">Article 226</a> is pre-eminently a public law
remedy and is not generally available as a remedy
against private wrongs. It is used for enforcement of
various rights of the public or to compel the
public/statutory authorities to discharge their duties and
to act within their bounds. It may be used to do justice
when there is wrongful exercise of power or a refusal to
perform duties. This writ is admirably equipped to serve
as a judicial control over administrative actions. This writ


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                       Page 61 of 96</span>
  C/SCA/12852/2018                              JUDGMENT



could also be issued against any private body or person,
specially in view of the words used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_119">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution. However, the scope of mandamus is limited
to enforcement of public duty. The scope of mandamus is
determined by the nature of the duty to be enforced,
rather than the identity of the authority against whom it
is sought. If the private body is discharging a public
function and the denial of any right is in connection with
the public duty imposed on such body, the public law
remedy can be enforced. The duty cast on the public
body may be either statutory or otherwise and the source
of such power is immaterial, but, nevertheless, there
must be the public law element in such action.
Sometimes, it is difficult to distinguish between public
law and private law remedies. According to Halsbury's
Laws of England 3rd ed. Vol. 30, page-682,


       "a public authority is a body not necessarily a
       county council, municipal corporation or other local
       authority which has public statutory duties to
       perform and which perform the duties and carries
       out its transactions for the benefit of the public and
       not for private profit."
</p>

<p id="p_152">There cannot be any general definition of public authority
or public action. The facts of each case decide the point.
</p>

<p id="p_153">30. A contract would not become statutory simply
because it is for construction of a public utility and it has
been awarded by a statutory body. But nevertheless it
may be noticed that the Government or Government
authorities at all levels is increasingly employing
contractual techniques to achieve its regulatory aims. It
cannot be said that the exercise of those powers are free
from the zone of judicial review and that there would be
no limits to the exercise of such powers, but in normal
circumstances, judicial review principles cannot be used
to enforce the contractual obligations. When that
contractual power is being used for public purpose, it is
certainly amenable to judicial review. The power must be
used for lawful purposes and not unreasonably.

</p><p id="p_155">31. The decision of the employer in these two cases to
terminate the services of their employees cannot be said
to have any element of public policy. Their cases were
purely governed by the contract of employment entered
into between the employees and the employer. It is not
appropriate to construe those contracts as opposed to
the principles of public policy and thus void and illegal
under <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_120">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act. In contractual
matters even in respect of public bodies, the principles of
judicial review have got limited application. This was
expressly stated by this Court in <a href="/doc/1156062/" id="a_121">State of U.P. vs. Bridge
&amp; Roof Co</a>. (1996) 6 SCC 22 and also in <a href="/doc/121921120/" id="a_122">Kerala State
Electricity Board vs. Kurien E.Kalathil</a> (2000) 6 SCC 295.
In the latter case, this Court reiterated that the
interpretation and implementation of a clause in a
contract cannot be the subject matter of a writ petition.
Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is
a question of construction of contract. If a term of a
contract is violated, ordinarily, the remedy is not a writ
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_123">Article 226.</a>
</p>

<p id="p_156">32. Applying these principles, it can very well be said that
a writ of mandamus can be issued against a private body
which is not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_124">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution and such body is amenable to the
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_125">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and the
High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_126">Article 226</a> of the Constitution can
exercise judicial review of the action challenged by a
party. But there must be a public law element and it
cannot be exercised to enforce purely private contracts
entered into between the parties.

       A body is performing a 'public function' when it
       seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the
       public or a section of the public and is accepted by
       the public or that section of the public as having
       authority to do so. Bodies therefore exercise public
       functions when they intervene or participate in
       social or economic affairs in the public interest.
</p>

<p id="p_170">       Public functions need not be the exclusive domain
       of the state. Charities, self-regulatory organizations
       and other nominally private institutions (such as
       universities, the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's of London,
       churches) may in reality also perform some types of
       public function. As Sir John Donaldson M.R. urged, it
       is important for the courts to 'recognize the realities
       of executive power' and not allow 'their vision to be
       clouded by the subtlety and sometimes complexity
       of the way in which it can be exerted'. Non-
       governmental bodies such as these are just as
       capable of abusing their powers as is Government.
</p>

<p id="p_171">52. These observations make it abundantly clear that in
order for it to be held that the body is performing a
public function, the appellant would have to prove that
the body seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the
public or a section of public and accepted by the public
as having authority to do so.

dealt with the case of a science college at Ahmedabad,
which was being which was being run by a Trust and has
temporary affiliation to the Gujarat University under the
Gujarat University Act, 1949, which, of course, later
received permanent affiliation as amended by Gujarat
Act VI of 1973. The University teachers and those
employed in the affiliated colleges were paid in the pay
scale   recommended        by   the   University   Grants
Commission. At one stage there was some dispute

between the University area teachers Association and the
University and the implementation of certain pay scales.
That dispute by agreement of parties was referred to the
Chancellor of the University for decision. The Chancellor
gave his award holding that the revised pay scales
should be applicable to all irrespective of the
employment under the University and affiliated college.
The State Government accepted the award of the
Chancellor and issued directions to all affiliated colleges
to pay their teachers in terms thereof. The trustees
challenged the Government's directive and approached
the University to terminate the services of the teachers
who were entitled to the revised scale of pay on the
ground that they were surplus. The Vice-Chancellor,
however, refused the request of the trustees. The
trustees then decided to close down the college and
surrendered the affiliation of the college to the
University. Teachers moved the High Court. The trustees
resisted the prayer on the grounds, inter alia: (1) the
Trust is not a statutory body and is not subject to the writ
jurisdiction of the High Court; (2) the resolution of the
University directing payment to teachers in the revised
pay scales was not binding on the trust; (3) the
University had no power to burden the trust with
additional financial liability by retrospectively revising the
pay scales; (4) the claim for gratuity by retrenched
teachers was untenable; and (5) Ordinance 120E
prescribing closure compensation was ultra vires of the
powers of the Syndicate.
</p>

<p id="p_173">172. The High Court rejected the above submissions and
accepted the writ petitions. The trustees moved the
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has in the said
judgment considered the question of maintainability of
the writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_131">Article 226</a> of the Constitution in
these words (AIR 1989 SC 1607 at pp.1610-1613) :

<p id="p_174">"The essence of the attack on the maintainability of the
writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_132">Art. 226</a> may now be examined. It is
argued that the management of the college being a trust
registered- under the Public Trusts Act is not amenable to
the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. The contention in
other words is that the trust is a private institution


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                       Page 66 of 96</span>

against which no writ of mandamus can be issued. In
support of the contention, the counsel relied upon two
decisions of this Court: (a) <a href="/doc/1004292/" id="a_133">Executive Committee of Vaish
Degree College, Shamli v. Lakshmi Narain</a>, (1976) 2 SCR
1006 : AIR 1976 SC 888 and (b) <a href="/doc/782644/" id="a_134">Deepak Kumar Biswas v.
Director of Public Instruction</a>. In the first of the two cases,
the respondent institution was a Degree College
managed by a registered co-operative society. A suit was
filed against the college by the dismissed principal for
reinstatement. It was contended that the Executive
Committee of the college which was registered under the
<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_135">Co-operative Societies Act</a> and Affiliated to the Agra
University (and subsequently to Meerut University) was a
statutory body. The importance of this contention lies in
the fact that in such a case, reinstatement could be
ordered if the dismissal is in violation of statutory
obligation. But this Court refused to accept the
contention. It was observed that the management of the
college was not a statutory body since not created by or
under a statute. It was emphasised that an institution
which adopts certain statutory provisions will not become
a statutory body and the dismissed employee cannot
enforce a contract of personal service against a non-
statutory body.
</p>

<p id="p_175">The decision in Vaish Degree College was followed in
Deepak Kumar Biswas case. There again a dismissed
Lecturer of a private college was seeking reinstatement
in service. The Court refuse to grant the relief although it
was found that the dismissal was wrongful. This Court
instead granted substantial monetary benefits to the
lecturer. This appears to be the preponderant judicial
opinion because of the common law principle that a
service Contract cannot be specifically enforced.
</p>

<p id="p_176">But here the facts are quite different and, therefore, we
need not go thus far. There is no plea for specific
performance of contractual service. The respondents are
not seeking a declaration that they be continued in
service. They are not asking for mandamus to put them
back into the college. They are claiming only the terminal
benefits and arrears of salary payable to them. The
question is whether the trust can be compelled to pay by
a writ of Mandamus?
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                       Page 67 of 96</span>
<p id="p_177">  C/SCA/12852/2018                            JUDGMENT




If the rights are purely of a private character no
mandamus can issue. If the management of the college is
purely a private body with no public duty mandamus will
not lie. These are two exceptions to Mandamus. But once
these are absent and when the party has no other
equally convenient remedy, mandamus cannot be
denied. It has to be appreciated that the appellant-trust
was managing the affiliated college to which public
money is paid as Government aid. Public money paid as
Government aid plays a major role in the control,
maintenance and working of educational institutions. The
aided institutions like Government institutions discharge
public function by way of imparting education to
students. They are subject to the rules and regulations of
the affiliating University. Their activities are closely
supervised by the University authorities. Employment in
such institutions, therefore, is not devoid of any public
character (See The "Evolving Indian Administrative Law
by M.P. Jain (1983) p 266). So are the service conditions
of the academic staff. When the University takes a
decision regarding their pay scales, it will be binding on
the management. The service conditions of the academic
staff are, therefore, not purely of a private character. It
has super-added protection by University decisions
creating a legal right-duty relationship between the staff
and the management. When there is existence of this
relationship, mandamus cannot be refused to the
aggrieved party.
</p>

<p id="p_178">The law relating to mandamus has made the most
spectacular advance. It may be recalled that the remedy
by prerogative writs in England started with very limited
scope and suffered from many procedural disadvantages.
To overcome the difficulties, Lord Gardiner (the Lord
Chancellor) in pursuance of Section 3(l)(e) of the Law
Commission Act, 1965, requested the law Commission to
review the existing remedies for the judicial control of
administrative acts and commissions with a view to
evolving a simpler and more effective procedure. The
Law Commission made their report in March, 1976 (Law
Com No. 73) it was implemented by Rules of Court (Order
</p><p id="p_179">53) in 1977 and given statutory force in 198! by <a href="/doc/106678696/" id="a_136">Section

former remedies into one proceeding called judicial
review. Lord Denning explains the scope of this "Judicial
review":
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_90">       "At one stroke the courts could grant whatever
       relief was appropriate. Not only certiorari and
       mandamus, but also declaration and injunction.
       Even damages. The procedure was much more
       simple and expeditious. Just a summons instead of
       a writ. No formal pleadings. The evidence was given
       by affidavit. As a rule no cross-examination, no
       discovery, and so forth. But there were important
       safeguards. In particular, in order to qualify, the
       applicant had to get the leave of a judge.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_91">       The statute is phrased in flexible terms. It gives
       scope for development. It uses the words "having
       regard to". Those words are very indefinite. The
       result is that the courts are not bound hand and foot
       by the previous law. They are to 'have regard to' it.
       So the previous law as to who are - and who are not
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_92">       - public authorities, is not absolutely binding. Nor is
       the previous law as to this matters in respect of
       which relief may be granted. This means that the
       judges can develop the public law as they think
       best. That they have done and are doing." (see -
       The Closing Chapter by Rt. Hon. Lord Denning p.</blockquote>
<p id="p_180">       122)


       There, however, the prerogative writ of mandamus
       confined only to public authorities to compel
       performance of public duty. The 'public authority'
       for them means everybody which is created by
       statute - and whose powers and duties are defined
       by statute. So Government departments, local
       authorities, police authorities, and statutory
       undertakings and corporations, are all 'public
       authorities'. But there is no such limitation for our
       High Courts to issue the writ 'in the nature of
       mandamus'. <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_137">Article 226</a> confers wide powers on the
       High Courts to issue writs in the nature of
       prerogative writs. This is a striking departure from
       the English law. Under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_138">Article 226</a>, writs can be

This article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and
it ex facie confers a wide power on the High Courts to
reach injustice wherever it is found. The Constitution
designedly used a wide language in describing the nature
of the power, the purpose for which and the person or
authority against whom it can be exercised. It can issue
writs in the nature of prerogative writs as understood in
England; but the use of the expression "nature", for the
said expression does not equate the writs that can be
issued in India with those in England, but only draws an
analogy from them. That apart, High Courts can also
issue directions, orders or writs other than the
prerogative writs. It enables the High Courts to mould the
reliefs to meet the peculiar and complicated
requirements of this country. Any attempt to equate the
scope of the power of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_142">Art. 226</a> of
the Constitution with that of the English Courts to issue
prerogative writs is to introduce the unnecessary

cover any other person or body performing public duty.
The form of the body concerned is not very much
relevant. What is relevant is the nature of the duty
imposed on the body. The duty must be judged in the
light of positive obligation owed by the person or
authority to the affected_ party. No matter by what
means the duty is imposed. If a positive obligation exists
mandamus cannot be denied.

<p id="p_185"><a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_149">In Praga Tools Corporation v. C.V. Imanual</a>, , this Court
said that a mandamus can issue against a person or body
to carry but the duties placed on them by the Statutes
even though they are not public officials or statutory
body. It was observed (at p. 778 of 1969-3 SCR): (at pp
1309-10 of AIR):
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_93">       "It is, however, not necessary that the person or the
       authority on whom the statutory duty is imposed
       need be a public officials or an official body. A
       mandamus can issue, for instance, to an official of a
       society to compel him to carry out the terms of the
       statute under or by which the society is constituted
       or governed and also, to companies or corporations
       to carry out duties placed on them by the statutes
       authorising their undertakings. A mandamus would
       also lie against a company constituted by a statute
       for the purpose of fulfilling public responsibilities.

Here again we may point out that mandamus cannot be
denied on the ground that the duty to be enforced is not
imposed by the statute. Commenting on the
development of this law, Professor De Smith states: "To
be enforceable by mandamus a public duty does not
necessarily have to be one imposed by statute. It may be
sufficient for the duty to have been imposed by charter,
common law, custom or even contract." (Judicial Review
of Administrative Act 4th Ed. p 540). We share this view.
</blockquote><p id="p_186">The judicial control over the fast expanding maze of
bodies affecting the rights of the people should not be
put into watertight compartment. It should remain
flexible to meet the requirements of variable
circumstances. Mandamus is a very wide remedy which
must be easily available lo reach injustice whenever it is
found". Technicalities should not come in the way of
granting that relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_150">Art. 226.</a> We, therefore, reject
the contention urged for the appellants on the
maintainability of the writ petition.
</p>

<p id="p_187">173. The ratio discernible from Shri Anadi Mukta Sadguru
(supra) is that, the form of the body concerned is not
very much relevant. What is relevant is the nature of
duty imposed on the body. A writ of mandamus can be
issued against a person or a body to carry out the duties
placed on them by the statute, even though they are not
public officials or statutory bodies.
</p>

<p id="p_188">174. <a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_151">In Praga Tools Corporation v. C.V. Immaneul</a>, AIR
1969 SC 1306, the Supreme Court observed:
</p>

<p id="p_189">"<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_152">Article 226</a> provides that every High Court shall have
power to issue to any person or authority orders and writ,
including writs in the nature of habeas corpus,
mandamus, etc., or any of them for the enforcement of
any of the rights conferred by Part-Ill of the Constitution
and for any other purpose. But, it is well understood that
a mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public or
statutory duty in the performance of which the one who
applies for it has a sufficient legal interest.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                      Page 72 of 96</span>
<p id="p_190">    C/SCA/12852/2018                              JUDGMENT



  Therefore, the condition precedent for the issue of
  mandamus is that there is. one claiming it a legal right to
  the performance of a legal duty by one against whom it is
  sought. An order of mandamus, is, in form, a command
  directed to a person, corporation or inferior Tribunal
  requiring him or them to do a particular thing therein
  specified which appertains to his or their office and is in
  the nature of a public duty. It is, however, not necessary
  that the person on the authority on whom the statutory
  duty is imposed need be a public official or an official
  body.
</p>

<p id="p_191">  It is therefore, clear that a writ of mandamus is an
  extraordinary remedy. It is in form a command directed
  to a person, corporation or an inferior Tribunal requiring
  him or them to do a particular thing therein specified
  which appertains to his or their office and is in the nature
  of a public duty. So long as the duty that is sought to be
  performed is in the nature of a public duty, it is not
  necessary that the person or the authority on which the
  duty is imposed should be a public official or an official
  body. It is further necessary that the person claiming a
  'writ of mandamus must have a legal right to the
  performance of a legal duty by the one against whom the
  writ is sought.
</p>

<p id="p_192">  175. What is discernible from an exhaustive review of
  the case-law, considered and discussed above, may be
  summed up thus:
</p>

<p id="p_193">1. For issuing writ against a legal entity, it would have to be
   an instrumentality or agency of a State or should have
   been entrusted with such functions as are Governmental
   or closely associated therewith by being of public
   importance or being fundamental to the life of the people
   and hence Governmental.
</p><p id="p_194">2. A writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_153">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
   India may be maintainable against (i) the State
   Government; (ii) Authority; (iii) a statutory body; (iv) an
   instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a company
   which is financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private
   body run substantially on State funding; (vii) a private

  body discharging public duty or positive obligation of
  public nature; and (viii) a person or a body under liability
  to discharge any function under any Statute, to compel it
  to perform such a statutory function.
</p><p id="p_195">3. Although a private banking company like the Standard
   Chartered Bank with which we are concerned is duty
   bound to follow and abide by the guidelines provided by
   the Reserve Bank of India for smooth conduct of its
   affairs in carrying on its business, yet those are of
   regulatory measures to keep a check and provide
   guideline and not a participatory dominance or control
   over the affairs of the company.
</p><p id="p_196">4. A private company carrying on banking business as a
   Scheduled bank cannot be termed as a company carrying
   on any public function or public duty.
</p><p id="p_197">5. Normally, mandamus is issued to a public body or
   authority to compel it to perform some public duty cast
   upon it by some statute or statutory rule. In exceptional
   cases a writ of mandamus or a writ in the nature of
   mandamus may issue to a private body, but only where a
   public duty is cast upon such private body by a statute or
   statutory rule and only to compel such body to perform
   its public duty.
</p><p id="p_198">6. Merely because a statue or a rule having the force of a
   statute requires a company or some other body to do a
   particular thing, it does not possess the attribute of a
   statutory body.
</p><p id="p_199">7. If a private body is discharging a public function and the
   denial of any rights is in connection with the public duty
   imposed on such body, the public law remedy can be
   enforced. The duty cast on the public body may be either
   statutory or otherwise and the source of such power is
   immaterial but, nevertheless, there must be the public
   law element in such action.
</p><p id="p_200">8. According to Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Ed. Vol.30,
   p.682, a public authority is a body not necessarily a
   county council, municipal corporation or other local
   authority which has public statutory duties to perform
   and which perform the duties and carries out its
   transactions for the benefit of the public and not for
   private profit. There cannot be any general definition of
   public authority or public action. The facts of each case
   decide the point.

</p><p id="p_202">176. We are again posing a question for our
consideration. The answer to the same should put an end
to the matter.
</p>

<p id="p_203">177. The Master Circular relating to the willful defaulters
has been issued by the Reserve Bank of India in exercise
of its powers under the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_154">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949,
and the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_155">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, 1934, very much
binding to the Standard Chartered Bank, therefore, while
acting under the Master Circular for the purpose of
declaring a particular borrower as a willful defaulter, does
the bank discharge a public duty.
</p>

<p id="p_204">178. To put it in other words, if a private bank has failed
to perform its duty in the sense that it has gone beyond
the scope of the regulations of the Master Circular, or in
performance of the same, has violated any of the
fundamental rights or any other legal rights of the
borrower against whom the action is proposed, then
whether such a borrower can legitimately maintain a
writ-application before this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_156">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_205">179. A body, public or private, should not be categorized
as amenable or not amenable to writ jurisdiction. The
most important and vital consideration should be the
function test as regards the maintainability of a writ
application. If a public duty or public function is involved,
any body, public or private, concerned or connection with
that duty or function, and limited to that, would be
subject to judicial scrutiny under the extraordinary writ
jurisdiction of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_157">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_206">180. In the case of <a href="/doc/730804/" id="a_158">LIC of India v. Escorts Ltd</a>., AIR 1986
SC 1370, it was contended before the Supreme Court
that   the    Life   Insurance    Corporation     was   an
instrumentality of the State, and was debarred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_159">Article
14</a> from acting arbitrarily. It was also contended that it
was obligatory upon the Corporation to disclose the

reasons for its action complained of, namely, its
requisition to call an extra-ordinary general meeting of
the company for the purpose of moving a Resolution to
remove some Directors and appoint others in their place.
Such argument was opposed by the State, contending
that the actions of the State or an instrumentality of the
State, which do not properly belong to the field of public
law but belong to the field of private law, were not
subject to judicial review. Dealing with the said
contentions, the Supreme Court observed :-
</p>
<p id="p_207">"While we do find considerable force in the contention of
the learned Attorney-General it may not be necessary for
us to enter into any lengthy discussion of the topic, as we
shall presently see. We also desire to warn ourselves
against readily referring to English cases on questions of
Constitutional law' Administrative Law and Public Law as
the law in India in these branches has forced ahead of
the law in England, guided as we are by our Constitution
and uninhibited as we are by the technical rules which
have hampered the development of the English law.
While we do not for a moment doubt that every action of
the State or an instrumentality of the State must be
informed by reason and that, in appropriate cases actions
uninformed by reason may be questioned as arbitrary in
proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_160">Art.226</a> or <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_161">Art.32</a> of the Constitution,
we do not construe <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_162">Art.14</a> as a charter for judicial review
of State actions and to call upon the State to account for
its actions in its manifold activities by stating reason; for
such actions.
</p>
<p id="p_208">For example, if the action of the State is political or
sovereign in character, the Court will keep away from it
'the Court will not debate academic matters or concern
itself with the intricacies of trade and commerce. If the
action of the State is related to contractual obligation or
obligations arising out of the contract, the Court may not
ordinarily examine it unless the action has some public
law character attached to it. Broadly speaking, the Court
will examine actions of State if they pertain to the public
law domain and refrain from examining them if they
pertain to the private law field. The difficulty will lie in
demarcating the frontier between the public law domain
and the private law field. It is impossible to draw the line
with precision and we do not want to attempt it. The

question must be decided in each case with reference to
the particular action, the activity in which the State or
the instrumentality of the State is engaged when
performing the action, the public law or private law
character of then action and a host of other relevant
circumstances. When the State or an instrumentality of
the State ventures into the corporate world and
purchases the shares of a company, it assumes to itself
the ordinary role of a share holder, and dons the robes of
a share-holder, with all the rights available to such a
share-holder there is no reason why the State as a share-
holder should be expected to state its reasons when it
seeks to change the management, by a resolution of the
Company, like any other share-holder.."
</p>
<p id="p_209">Distinction between `public law' and `private law' :
</p>
<p id="p_210">Difficult as this distinction is and incapable of precise
demarcation, it is yet necessary to keep the broad
distinction in mind. Lord Denning in his book "The Closing
Chapter" has this to say on the subject:
</p>
<p id="p_211">"The first thing to notice is that public law is confined to
`public authorities'. What are 'public authorities'? There is
only one avenue of Approach. It is by asking, in the words
of <a href="/doc/106678696/" id="a_163">Section 31(2)(b)</a> of the Supreme Court Act 1981 :
</p>
<p id="p_212">What is the 'nature of the persons and bodies against
whom relief may be granted by such orders', that is, by
mandamus, prohibition or certiorari?
</p>
<p id="p_213">These are divided into two main categories :
</p>
<p id="p_214">First, the persons or bodies who have legal authority to
determine questions affecting the common law or
statutory rights or obligations of other persons as
individuals. That is the formula stated by Lord Justice
Atkin in <a href="/doc/94441558/" id="a_164">R. v. Electricity Commissioners</a>, ex parte London
Electricity Joint Committee Co., (1920) Ltd, (1924)1 KB
171 / 205 as broadened by Lord Diplock in O'Reilly v.
Mackman (1982) 3, WLR 1096/ 1104).
</p>
<p id="p_215">Second, the persons or bodies who are entrusted by
Parliament with functions, powers and duties which
involve the making of decisions of a public nature....To
which I would add the words of Lord Goddard, C.J. in R. v.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                       Page 77 of 96</span>

National Joint Council for Dental Technicians, ex parte
Neate (1953) 1 QB 704/707):
</p>

<p id="p_217">"The bodies to which in modern times the remedies of
these prerogative writs have been applied have all been
statutory bodies on whom Parliament has conferred
statutory powers and duties which, when exercised, may
lead to the detriment of subjects who may have to
submit to their jurisdiction".
</p>
<p id="p_218">But those categories are not exhaustive. The courts can
extend them to any other person or body of a public
nature exercising public duties which it is desirable to
control by the remedy of judicial review.
</p>
<p id="p_219">There are many cases which give guidance, but I will just
give some illustrations.
</p>
<p id="p_220">Every body which is created by statute and whose
powers and duties are defined by statute is a 'public
authority'. So Government departments, local authorities,
police authorities, and statutory undertakings and
corporations, are all `public authorities'. So are members
of a statutory tribunal or inquiry, and the board of visitors
of a prison. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board is a
public authority. So also, I suggest, is a university
incorporated by Royal charter; and the managers of a
State School. So is the Boundary Commission: and the
Committee of Lloyd's.
</p>
<p id="p_221">But a limited liability company incorporated under the
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_165">Companies Act</a>s is not a 'public authority'; (see Tozer v.
National Greyhound Racing Club Ltd. (1983) Times, 16
May). Nor is an unincorporated association like the Jockey
Club... ". (see pp. 122, 123, 124)

</p><p id="p_222">38. Sir Harry Woolf, a Lord Justice of Court of Appeal,
points out the distinction in the following words :-
</p>
<p id="p_223">"I regard public law as being the system which enforces
the proper performance by public bodies of the duties
which they owe to the public. I regard private law as
being the system which protects the private rights of
private individuals or the private rights of public bodies.
The critical distinction arises out of the fact that it is the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                       Page 78 of 96</span>

public as a whole, or in the case of local government the
public in the locality, who are the beneficiaries of what is
protected by public law and it is the individuals or bodies
entitled to the rights who are the beneficiaries of the
protection provided by private law ". (see page 221 of his
Article "Public Law Private Law : Why the Divide? A
personal View (published in "Public Law" Summer
(1986)").
</p>
<p id="p_224">The learned Law Lord stated further in the same Article,
at page 223 :
</p>
<p id="p_225">"While public law deals only with public bodies, this does
not mean that the activities of public bodies are never
governed by private law. Like public figures, at least in
theory, public bodies are entitled to have a private life.
There have been suggestions that in the commercial field
public bodies should adopt different and higher ethical
standards than private individuals, but this is not yet
required as a matter of law and in relation to purely
commercial transactions the same law is applicable,
whether or not a public duty is involved. Prima facie, the
same is true in relation to employment. The servant
employed by a public body ordinarily has the same
private rights as any other servant ".
</p>
<p id="p_226">The position may, however, be different pointed out the
learned Law Lord if such relationship is circumscribed by
a statutory provision.
</p>
<p id="p_227">39. In this context, it would be appropriate to refer to two
important English decisions, where a public duty was
implied even in the absence of a statutory provisions.
They are <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_166">R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board</a>, ex
parte Lain (1967) 2 All ER 770, and <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_167">R. v. Panel</a> on take-
overs (1987) 1 All ER 564. In Criminal Injuries
Compensation Board, the relevant facts are the following:
In the year 1964 the Government of Great Britian
announced a Scheme in both Houses of Parliament
providing for compensation to victims of violence and
persons injured while assisting the police. It was a non-
statutory scheme under which compensation was to be
paid ex gratia. The scheme was to be administered by a
Board, who were to be provided with money through a
grant-in-aid, out of which payment would be made when
the Board was satisfied that the compensation was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                       Page 79 of 96</span>
  C/SCA/12852/2018                             JUDGMENT



justified. The widow of a Police Constable who was shot in
the face by a suspect whom he was about to question,
and who subsequently shot himself, applied to the Board
for compensation. The Board awarded compensation, but
made certain deductions, which was questioned by way
of certiorari. The first question before the Court was
"whether the Board are a body of persons amenable to
the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court?". For the Board
reliance was placed upon the well-known words of Atkin,
L.J., in' <a href="/doc/94441558/" id="a_168">R.v. Electricity Commissioners</a> (1924) 1 KB 171, at
p. 205 to the effect that the body of persons to be
amenable to writ jurisdiction must have the legal
authority to determine questions affecting the rights of
subjects and who are under a duty to act judicially. The
Court held that the said words of Atkin. L. J., were not
supposed to be exhaustive of the situation where a
certiorari may issue, and pointed out that the Board,
though not set up under a statute, is set up by the
executive Government, i.e., under the prerogative, and
that its acts are no less lawful on that account. The Court
observed :
</p><p id="p_228">"Indeed, the writ of certiorari has been issued not only to
courts set up by statutes but also to courts whose
authority was derived, inter alia, from the prerogative.
Once the jurisdiction is extended, as it clearly has been,
to tribunals as opposed to courts, there is no reason why
the remedy by way of certiorari cannot be invoked to a
body of persons set up under the prerogative. Moreover,
the Board, though set up under the prerogative and not
by statute, had in fact the recognition of Parliament in
debate and Parliament provided the money to satisfy the
Board's awards....".
</p>
<p id="p_229">It was further observed:
</p>
<p id="p_230">"We have, as it seems to me, reached the position when
the ambit of certiorari can be said to cover every case in
which a body of persons, of a public as opposed to a
purely private or domestic character, has to determine
matters affecting subjects provided always that it has a
duty to act judicially. Looked at in this way, the Board in
my judgment comes fairly and squarely within the
jurisdiction of this Court. The Board are, as counsel for
the Board said, "a servant of the Crown, charged by the
Crown, by executive instructions, with the duty of
distributing the bounty of the Crown". The Board are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                       Page 80 of 96</span>
  C/SCA/12852/2018                              JUDGMENT



clearly, therefore, performing public duties. Moreover,
the Board are quite clearly under a duty to act judicially".
</p>
<p id="p_231">The same idea was put forward by Diplock, L.J., in his
separate opinion, where he said :
</p>
<p id="p_232">"If new tribunals are established by acts of Government,
the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court extends to
them if they possess the essential characteristics on
which the subjection of inferior tribunals to the
supervisory control of the High Court is based...".
Ashworth, J., justified the issue of certiorari in that case
on the following basis:
</p>
<p id="p_233">"They (Board) were set up by the executive after the
proposal to set them up had been debated in both
Houses of Parliament, and the money needed to satisfy
their awards is drawn from sums provided by Parliament.
It can therefore be said that their existence and their
functions have at least been recognized by Parliament,
which to my mind has a twofold consequence : in the first
place it negatives any notion that the Board are a private
tribunal, and secondly it confers on the Board what I may
call a public or official character. The number of
applications for compensation and the amounts awarded
by the Board alike show how greatly the general public
are affected by the functioning of the Board ....".
</p>
<p id="p_234">40. This decision has since been followed and applied in
several English decisions. It would suffice to refer to <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_169">R. v.
Panel</a> on Takeovers and Mergers, Ex Parte Datafin (1987)
1 All ER 564. The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers was a
self-regulating unincorporated association which devised
and operated the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers
prescribing a Code of Conduct to be observed in the take-
overs of listed public companies. The panel had no direct
statutory, prerogative or common law powers, nor were
its powers based solely on consensus; its acts were
supported and sustained by certain statutory powers and
penalties introduced after the inception of the Panel. A
decision of the panel was sought to be questioned by
way of certiorari. One of the objections of the
respondents was that the supervisory jurisdiction of the
Court was confined to bodies whose power was derived
solely from legislation or the exercise of the prerogative,
and that the power of judicial review did not extend to a

body such as the Panel on Takeovers. Overruling this
objection, it was held that in determining whether the
decisions of a particular body were subject to judicial
review, the Court was not confined to considering the
source of that body's powers and duties, but could also
look to their nature. Accordingly, if the duty imposed on a
body, whether expressly or by implication, was a public
duty and the body was exercising public law functions,
the Court had jurisdiction to entertain an application for
judicial review of that body's decisions. It was held that,
having regard to the wide-ranging nature and importance
of the matters covered by the City Code on Take-overs
and Mergers and to the public consequences of
noncompliance with the Code, the Panel on Takeovers
and Mergers was performing a public duty when
prescribing and administering the Code and its rules and
was subject to public law remedies. Accordingly, it was
held that an application for judicial review would lie in an
appropriate case. The approach to be adopted in such
cases, it was stated by Sir John Donaldson, M.R., is"to
recognize the realities of executive power".This is what
the learned Master of Rolls stated :-
</p>
<p id="p_235">"In fact, given its novelty, the panel fits surprisingly well
into the format which this court had in mind in <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_170">R. v.
Criminal Injuries Compensation Board</a> (1967-2 QB 867). It
is without doubt performing a public duty and an
important one. This is clear from the expressed
willingness of the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry to limit legislation in the field of take-overs and
mergers and to use the panel as the centerpiece of his
regulation of that market. The rights of citizens are
indirectly affected by its decisions, some, but by no
means all of whom, may in a technical sense be said to
have assented to this situation, e.g., the members of the
Stock Exchange. At least in its determination of whether
there has been a breach of the Code, it has a duty to act
judicially and it asserts that its raison d'etre is to do
equity between one shareholder and another. Its source
of power is only partly based on moral persuarion and the
assent of institutions and their members, the bottom line
being the statutory powers exercised by the Department
of Trade and Industries and the Bank of England. In this
context I should be very disappointed if the courts could
not recognize the realities of executive power and
allowed their vision to be clouded by the subtlety and

sometimes complexity of the way in which it can be
exerted...".
</p>
<p id="p_236">This rule was reiterated in yet another decision of the
Court of Appeal in <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_171">R. v. Panel</a> on Take-overs and Mergers,
ex parte Guinness, (1989) 1 All ER 509. This was indeed
the approach indicated by Mathew, J. in Sukhdev v.
Bhagatram, AIR 1975 SC 1331, when the learned Judge
spoke of "the governing power, wherever located" being
subjected to "fundamental constitutional limitations". The
learned Judge felt that "the need to subject the power
centres to the control of the Constitution requires an
expansion of the concept of State action". (see para 93 at
p. 1352).

<p id="p_237">181. Applying the above test, the Bank herein cannot be
called a public body. It has no duty towards the public.
It's duty is towards its account holders, which may
include the borrowers having availed of the loan facility.
It has no power to take any action, or pass any order
affecting the rights of the members of the public. The
binding nature of its orders and actions is confined to its
account holders and borrowers and to its employees. Its
functions are also not akin to Governmental functions.

of the Bombay High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/633055/" id="a_172">Shamrao Vithal
Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. Padubidri Pattabhiram Bhat</a>,
AIR 1993 Bombay 91. The issue before the Full Bench of
the Bombay High Court was whether the appellant-Bank
was "State" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_173">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution of India, and whether the writ-petition was
maintainable against the appellants. In view of conflict of
two decisions of the High Court, the matter was referred
to a Larger Bench for determination. It was submitted
that a Co-operative Bank, performed an important public
function and that itself was sufficient for coming to the
conclusion that it was a "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_174">Article 12.</a> It was
also submitted that in a welfare State, the definition of
"Governmental functions" had to be widened to include
within its scope of functions, which were of public
importance. Hence, any organization which performs a
public function must be considered as a "State" under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_175">Article 12.</a> The Full Bench took the view that it was too
broad a proposition and sounded a note of caution
considering the decision of the Supreme Court in the

case of Ajay Hasai (supra). The Court took the view that
every organization which carried out a function, which
was of public importance, did not necessarily become
"State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_176">Article 12.</a> Conferment of "Statehood"
depended upon various other factors also, such as the
nexus of such organizations with the State, the extent of
State control etc. The following observations of the Full
Bench are worth taking note of :-
</p>
<p id="p_239">There may be many functions of public importance which
can be performed by private organisation also. We have
a large number of organisations doing important social
work vital to the community. There are, for example,
organisations which look after, educate and train
handicapped persons or the blind, provide them with jobs
and rehabilitate them. There are private charitable
organisations which may provide free or subsidies
housing to the poor or free medical aid. They may supply
text-books to poor students, freeships and scholarships.
There may be private organisation engaged in transport
of goods and men. They perform functions which are,
undoubtedly of public importance; and they subserve a
public need. But this does not necessarily make such
organisations     "State"  under   <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_177">Art.   12.</a>Banking    is
undoubtedly a function of public importance. In fact, the
nationalised banks do carry out these functions under the
control of the State. But that does not mean that banks
which are not so controlled, or banks which are set up by
private organisations or co-operative societies become"
State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_178">Article 12.</a> In a welfare State, many
activities which are often carried on by private
organisations are undertaken by the State. In such cases
the Supreme Court has said that we must look at the
overall position of the organisation in the light of the
other tests also, especially when the function of the
organisation is not such as can be carried on only by the
State or is not connected with governmental functions."

<p id="p_240">183. What is complained before us is the procedural
arbitrariness on the part of the bank. We have examined
the constitutional validity of the Master Circular issued by
the Reserve Bank of India at the instance of the
petitioners of Special Civil Application No.10120 of 2014,
but it is difficult for us to also look into the proposed

       action on the part of the Standard Chartered Bank on the
       premise that the show-cause notice which has been
       issued is lacking in material particulars.
</p><p id="p_241">       184. Such being the position, we hold that the Standard
       Chartered Bank being a private bank is not amenable to
       the writ jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_179">Article 226</a> of the

       before the appropriate authority."
</p>
<p id="p_243">36.    With all odds against the writ applicant, I am still
persuaded to take the view that I should not throw away this
writ   application         on   the    ground          that   the   same    is    not
maintainable in law. It is evident from the materials on record
that it all started with the statutory inspection of the Bank by
the    officials of the RBI under <a href="/doc/222598/" id="a_180">section 35</a> of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949. According to the RBI, the writ applicant
managed to avail loan facility from the Mehsana Urban
Cooperative Bank Ltd. (for short "the MUCBL) in the companies
in which he himself and his relatives are interested. The
allegations of the RBI are that this was done clandestinely with
a view to overcome the provisions of the statutory directions
issued by the RBI prohibiting loans and advances in favour of
the directors and their relatives. It is also the case of the RBI
that the statutory inspection of the MUCBL revealed several
irregularities and         violation of the provisions of the              <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_181">Banking
Regulation Act</a> as well as the directions issued by the RBI time
to time. It is also alleged by the RBI that the                      MUCBL had
sanctioned            loans           and             advances       to          eight
firms/concerns/companies, in which, the directors on the board
of the Bank were interested and that includes the writ

applicant herein. In such circumstances, referred to above, the
first thing      that the RBI did was to address a letter to the
MUCBL to ensure that the writ applicant and similarly situated
directors step down from the Board of Directors.          It was a
positive mandate of the RBI to the MUCBL in this regard. I
also take notice of the letter dated          dated 2nd May, 2018
addressed by the Government of India to the MUCBL calling
upon the MUCBL to explain as to why such Directors had not
yet stepped down despite the instructions from the RBI.
</p>

<p id="p_244">37.   Taking all this into consideration, the MUCBL, ultimately,
passed a resolution No.159 which is at page-133 of the paper-
book, Annexure-I, unanimously resolving to issue letter to the
concerned Directors that they would cease to be the Director
of the Bank with effect from 24th August, 2018. At the cost of
repetition, I may quote a portion of the said resolution, which
reads thus;
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_95">      "Since it was instruction of RBI the bank was compelled
      to issue the letter as such till the closure of above
      accounts, the both director Shri Chandubhai I. Patel and
      Shri Ambalal J. Patel will not be allowed to work as a
      director of Bank and compelled to step down from the
      board of the Bank."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_245">38.   Thus, the facts of this case are quite peculiar. The
mandate or the instructions issued by the RBI and the
Government of India may be a part of the regulatory
measures, but the fact remains that the MUCBL acted upon
such instructions and the action taken by the MUCBL has been
further endorsed by the RBI as well as the Government of
India.

</p><p id="p_247">39.   I am of the view that this is not a matter in which the writ
application has been brought against an independent action of
the Multi-State Cooperative Bank. It is obvious that the action
at the instance of the MUCBL is on the basis of the directives
issued by the RBI. It could be argued that the RBI merely gave
a reminder to the MUCBL to act in accordance with its policy
and the guidelines and that by itself cannot be termed as an
action taken by the RBI. However, the peculiar facts of this
case has persuaded me to take the view that this writ
application can be said to be maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_248">40.   In Ionic Metalliks (supra), the Division Bench of this Court,
to which I was a party, has discussed in details as regards the
maintainability of a writ application under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_182">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution of India against a private Bank. In Ionic Metalliks
(supra), the Bank involved was the Standard Chartered Bank.
The Standard Chartered Bank issued a show-cause notice to
the borrower calling upon him to show-cause as to why he
should not be declared as a willful defaulter. Having regard to
the   subject matter, this Court, after exhaustive discussion,
took the view that a writ petition is not maintainable against a
private Bank.        This Court also took the view that the show-
cause notice issued to a defaulter was a part of the regulatory
measures which the Bank was otherwise obliged to undertake
in accordance with the guidelines issued by the RBI. The facts
of the present case are slightly different and stands on
altogether a different footing compared to the facts of Ionic
Metalliks (supra).
</p>

<p id="p_249">41.   As regards the powers of the High Court, to issue
prerogative writs under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_183">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                               Page 87 of 96</span>
       C/SCA/12852/2018                                  JUDGMENT



the issue has been dealt with by the Supreme Court and the
High Courts on several occasions. Before even referring to
such rulings, it would be relevant to note the very expressions
in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_184">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to "any person or
authority" and "for the enforcement of the rights conferred by
Part III and "for any other purpose". The said expressions
would be sufficient to hold that there is no fetter or limitation
on the power of the Court to issue a writ as against any class
of persons as well as statutory authorities. The power is wide
enough to reach any one dealing with any situation for the
purpose of enforcing not only the fundamental rights, but also
for any other purpose and to enforce legal rights of the citizens
and statutory obligations and duties on the part of the
Governmental, Statutory authorities, private companies and
individuals. The series of restrictions which are enumerated by
the various Courts are only self imposed restraints aimed at
using the extraordinary power only to deserving situations.
There is no difficulty while exercising the power as against the
Government,       Statutory   authorities,     Corporations   and   the
Establishments coming within the definition of "State" under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_185">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India. But when it comes to
issuing a writ against private companies, establishments and
individuals, the ground for exercising the power are restricted
and narrowed down having regard to the extraordinary nature
of the power and the availability of alternative remedies. Some
of the grounds which would weigh against the exercise of the
power are (i) availability of effective alternative remedy (2)
absence of any public duty; (3) laches and unreasonable delay
in approaching the Court; (4) Need to deal with and adjudicate
upon complicated facts which would require detailed evidence
oral or documentary etc. These are the factors which would

        C/SCA/12852/2018                              JUDGMENT



dissuade the Courts from exercising the jurisdiction. But even
if these dissuading factors exist, yet the Court can issue a writ,
if the situation and interest of justice warrant interference and
the monstrosity of the situation is such that refusal to exercise
such power would result in grave injustice.
</p>

<p id="p_250">42.   The observations made above are only culled out from
the various judgments of the Supreme Court. Therefore, it
would be a misnomer to say that a writ petition is not
maintainable except where it is barred under the Constitution
itself specifically. In other cases, it is a matter of exercise of
discretion by the Court to issue or not to issue a writ.
</p>


<p id="p_251">43.   Though the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court prior
to and immediately after the Constitution prescribed stringent
grounds for issuing writs, the Supreme Court subsequently
held that having regard to the far-reaching expressions used in
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_186">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, there was no
justification to look back nor to feel oppressed by the earlier

      targets of the writ power as inclusive of any person by
      the expressive reference to 'the residence of such
      person.' But it is one thing to affirm the jurisdiction,
      another to authorise its free exercise like a bull in a china
      shop. This Court has spelt out wise and clear restraints
      on the use of this extraordinary remedy and High Courts
      will not go beyond those wholesome inhibitions except
      where the monstrosity of the situation or other
      exceptional circumstances cry for timely judicial interdict
      or mandate. The mentor of law is justice and a potent
      drug should be judiciously administered. Speaking in
      critical retrospect and portentous prospect, the writ
      power has, by and large, been the people's sentinel on
      the qui vive and to cut back on or liquidate that power
      may cast a peril to human rights. We hold that the award
      here is not beyond the legal reach of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_191">Article 226</a>,
      although this power must be kept in severely judicious
      leash."

1969 1 SCC 585 the Apex Court held that it was not
necessary that the person or the Authority on whom the
statutory duty is imposed need be a public official or an
official body. That a mandamus can be issued even to an
official or a Society to compel him to carry out the terms
of the statute under or by which the Society is
constituted or governed and also to companies or
corporations to carry out duties placed on them by the
statutes authorizing their undertakings. Further, a
mandamus would lie against a Company constituted by a
statute      for   the    purposes    of   fulfilling public
responsibilities. In the same decision, the Apex Court
examined the amplitude of the term "Authority" used in
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_205">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. The Court opined that it
must receive liberal meaning unlike the term in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_206">Article 12</a>
of the Constitution. It went to observe that the words
"any person or authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_207">Article 226</a> cannot be
confined       only    to    statutory    authorities   and
instrumentalities of the State. It may cover any other

relevant for exercising power is the nature of the duty
imposed on the body which must be a positive obligation
owned by the person or Authority. Depending on that
finding, the Court may invoke its authority to issue writ of
mandamus. In the case of <a href="/doc/730804/" id="a_208">Life Insurance Corporation of

the authorities on the point except to observe that a writ
would lie against even a Cooperative Society or
Company. But that does not mean that the Court is
bound to issue such a writ. It is the prerogative of the
High Court to issue writ to any person or authority, which
is not a State or an instrumentality of the State. The
Court would do so with circumspection and keeping in
mind the well defined parameters. Whether in the fact
situation of a given case, the Court ought to exercise its
authority to issue writ or order in the nature of writ under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_211">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, will have to be answered
on the basis of the settled principles, on case to case
basis. Thus, it will be inapposite to put it in a straight
jacket manner that every writ petition filed against the
Cooperative Banks must be dismissed as not
maintainable or otherwise.

      Kangra Bank had relied on two Judges Bench decision in
      the case of <a href="/doc/713373/" id="a_212">Zorastrian Cooperative Housing Society Ltd.
      and another vs. District Registrar, Cooperative Societies
      (Urban and others</a>), 2005 5 SCC 632 (para 32) which
      took the view that a Cooperative Society cannot be
      treated as State unless it fulfills the tests spelt out in Ajay
      Hasia's case by the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court,
      followed in the case of Praga Tools (supra). Reference
      was also made to the seven Judges Bench of the Apex
      Court in the case of <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_213">Pradeep Kumar Biswas vs. Indian
      Institutes of Chemical Biology and others</a>, 2002 5 SCC
      111 (paras 1 to 4 and 40) and another decision in the
      case of <a href="/doc/77593953/" id="a_214">Bhadra Shahakari S.K. Niyamita vs. Chitradurga
      Mazdoor Sangh and others</a>,2006 8 SCC 552 (para 3)
      which deals with the        question as to whether the
      appellant, Cooperative Society can be treated as State
      within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_215">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. The
      learned Senior counsel for the H.P. Cooperative Society
      invited our attention to the decision of two Judges Bench
      of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/157180567/" id="a_216">General Manager, Kishan Sahkari
      Chini Mills Ltd. Sultanpur, UP vs. Satrughan Nishad and
      others</a>, 2003 8 SCC 639 (paras 6 to 8) to contend that
      even if it is a case of nominated Directors of Society that
      does not presuppose that the State has perennial control
      over the Society. Reliance is also placed on the another
      decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_217">Shri Anadi

the reference apart from the answers to the other questions
answered the question with regard to the maintainability of a

<blockquote id="blockquote_99">      "As regards the second part of the question as to
      whether a writ would lie against the stated Cooperative

      definite answer to this question. For, it would depend on
      several attending factors. Further, even if the said Banks

      were held to be not a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_219">Article
      12</a>, the High Court in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_220">Article
      226</a> of the Constitution of India, can certainly issue a writ
      or order in the nature of writ even against any person or
      Authority, if the fact situation of the case so warrants. In
      other words, writ can lie even against a Corporative
      Society. Whether the same should be issued by the High
      Court would depend on the facts of each case."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_258">47.   Having taken the view that in the peculiar facts of the
case the writ application is maintainable, the next question
that falls for my consideration is whether the action of the
MUCBL is justified in law. In this regard, I am of the view that
an appropriate authority of the RBI or any other authority that
may be appointed by the RBI should give an opportunity of
hearing to the writ applicant as regards his role in the two
companies is concerned, namely, (I) Vimal Dairy Ltd. and (ii)
Swastik Ceracon Ltd. There is nothing on record to indicate
that any opportunity of hearing had been given to the writ
applicant In this regard except few correspondence in writing.
The writ applicant is an elected Director of the MUCBL. He has
been asked to step down from the office. Asking him to step
down from the office of the post of the Director would
definitely     have       some   civil     consequences.       In     such
circumstances, one opportunity of hearing should be given to
the writ applicant. Thereafter, it shall be open for the authority
concerned to take an appropriate decision and pass an
appropriate order in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_259">48.   There is one more reason why I am persuaded to hold
that this writ application          is maintainable. At the cost of
repetition,    I refer to the amended bye-laws framed               by the
Bank under the Act, 2002, more particularly, bye-law No.39,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                 Page 94 of 96</span>
       C/SCA/12852/2018                                    JUDGMENT



which is in respect to the removal of the elected directors by
the General Body.          Bye-law No.39 has been referred to in the
earlier part of the judgment.             This particular bye-law No.39
makes it very clear that an elected director of the Board can
be removed on the basis of the report of the Central Registrar
or upon resolution of the General Body passed by its meeting
by majority not less than 2/3rd of the members present if it is
found that the Director concerned shall not be removed unless
he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making a
representation       in the matter. This word         representation is
sought to be read and understood as a written representation
and nothing beyond that. To put it in other words, it is sought
to be argued on behalf of the respondents that for the purpose
of invoking bye-law No.39, there is no obligation to give a
personal hearing            to the concerned Director before his
removal.
</p>

<p id="p_260">49.   I am not impressed by such a submission. Reasonable
opportunity of making a representation should be read as an
opportunity of hearing to the concerned Director in person. It
may not be feasible or possible to explain everything in a
representation.          In such circumstances,    if an opportunity is
given to a concerned Director of personal hearing in person,
the same may make a difference.
</p>

<p id="p_261">50.   I am of the view that the bye-law No.39 has not been
complied with in its proper perspective. In such a situation, an
order passed by the CEO of the Bank on the basis of the
resolution passed by the Board of Directors against one of its
Directors in violation of the bye-laws, can be corrected by way
of a writ petition. This is not because the bye-laws have the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                  Page 95 of 96</span>

force of law, but on the ground that having framed the bye-
laws prescribing the mode and method of removal of a
Director, the Society must follow them, in the interest of
fairness. If it is left to the sweet will and pleasure of the Society
either to follow or not to follow the bye-laws, it would be
inherently       arbitrary,        and     may       very     likely   give    rise    to
discriminatory treatment. (see Srikonaseema Co-operative
Central Bank Ltd. &amp; Another Vs. N. Seetharama Raja, Air 1990
Andhra Pradesh 171)


</p><p id="p_262">51.     In view of the above, this writ application is allowed in
part. The communication dated 16th August, 2018 of the
MUCBL       to    the       writ   applicant,            Annexure-A    to     this    writ
application, Page-16 is hereby quashed. The RBI shall give one
opportunity of hearing to the writ applicant and, thereafter,
take an appropriate decision in accordance with law. While
giving an opportunity of hearing to the writ applicant, the
MUCBL shall also be heard through one of its authorized
officers, and a representative from the Government of India
(Ministry of Agriculture) shall also be heard. Let this exercise
be undertaken at the earliest and an appropriate decision shall
be taken within a period of three months from the date of the
receipt of the writ of this order.
