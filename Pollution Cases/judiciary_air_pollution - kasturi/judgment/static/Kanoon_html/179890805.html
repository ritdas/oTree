                 J U D G M E N T
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.       This application is filed    by a group     of   idol

manufacturers and artisans, under <a href="/doc/58846485/" id="a_1">Section 14</a> and <a href="/doc/57511046/" id="a_2">16</a> of the

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Originally, they had filed

a Writ Petition bearing SCA No. 8406/2012 in the High Court

of Gujarat at Ahmedabad. By that petition they had

challenged directions dated 23.1.2012, issued by    Principal

Secretary, Forest and Environment Department, Sachivalaya,

Gandhi Nagar (Respondent No. 4) as well as guidelines dated

18.06.2010, issued by Central Pollution Control Board (for

short, CPCB) (Respondent No. 6). The CPCB issued guidelines

dated 18.06.2010, regulating procedure for immersion of

idols in order to upkeep the environment and ecosystems.

The said guidelines have been issued in response to certain

observations of the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay in PIL

bearing WP (C) No. 1325 of 2003 (Janhit Manch Vs. State of

Maharashtra and others).Taking clue from the said guidelines

of the CPCB, the communication dated 23.01.2012 was

issued by the Respondent No. 4.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.       The applicants are aggrieved mainly due to the

implied ban put on making of       idols of Hindu Gods and

Goddesses by using Plaster of Paris (for short, PoP). Though

the applicants also challenged some other parts of the

communication dated 23.01.2012, including the manner in

which the idols shall be painted, yet during the course of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           4</span>
 arguments, learned Counsel for the Applicants gave up the

other challenges and restricted the argument only to the

extent of challenge to the prohibition imposed on use of PoP

as material for making Lord Ganesh idols. In short, the basic

challenge is to the prohibitory directions in respect of use of

PoP for manufacturing/making of Ganesh idols.


</p><p id="p_4">3.          In the wake of Judgment delivered by the Hon'ble

High Court of Bombay in the writ petition No. 1325/2003

(Janhit Manch Vs the State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors.) the CPCB

drew the guidelines dated 18.06.2010.            The Hon'ble High

Court of Bombay, in fact, did not give any finding about the

use of PoP nor gave any specific direction. While disposing of

said writ petition, however, certain observations, which are

obiter, were made, that may be quoted as below:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "we expect that the Central Government will consider

     laying down of guidelines for immersion of idols and

     would also consider related matters with regard to

     pollution of water bodies. Both the Union Government as

     well    as   the   State       Government   shall   consider   it

     expeditiously because the time lost involving the pollution

     might prove dangerous for environment of the country in

     long run"
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">
</blockquote><p id="p_5">4.          It will be useful to see the first two guidelines shown

in the communication dated 18.06.2010 issued by the CPCB

and the first two guidelines shown in the communication


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                5</span>
 dated 23.01.2012 issued by the Forest and Environment

Department of the State of Gujarat.                This comparison will

indicate as to how the Forest and Environment Department of

Gujarat, instead of following similar CPCB guidelines, issued

the prohibitory directions.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     The first two guidelines mentioned in communication

dated 18.06.2010 issued by the CPCB are as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (i)      " Idols should be made from natural materials as

              described in the holy scripts. Use of traditional clay

              for idol making rather than baked clay, plaster of

              paris,    etc.   may       be   encouraged,   allowed   and

              promoted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (ii)        Painting of idols should be discouraged. In case

              idols are to be painted, water soluble and nontoxic

              natural dyes should be used. Use of toxic and non-

              biodegradable chemical dyes for painting idols

              should be strictly prohibited."</blockquote><p id="p_7">


</p><p id="p_8">     The first two guidelines mentioned in communication

dated 23.01.2012 issued by the Forest and Environment

Department of Gujarat vide communication dated 23.01.2012

are as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     1.        " Idols should be made from natural materials as

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       2.     Painting of idols may only be done from water

           soluble and nontoxic naturals dyes. Use of toxic and

           non-biodegradable chemical dyes for painting idols is

           strictly prohibited."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                   (emphasis supplied by us)


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">5.         Briefly stated, the case of the applicants is that they

are making/sculpting idols of gods and goddesses, including

Lord Ganesh, among others, since many years in the State of

Gujarat. The idols are manufactured by using PoP. The use of

PoP for manufacturing of Ganesh idols has not been

prohibited in the State of Maharashtra or in any other nearby

States. The PoP is extracted from Gypsum rock and comprises

of Calcium and Sulphate.           One noted research institute, by

name, Srishti Eco-Research Institute at Pune (SERI) has

conducted scientific study on use of PoP with reference to

immersion of the idols made from PoP. The scientific report

has revealed that although PoP is not easily soluble in water,

yet it has no poisonous effect. It has been further found that

due to flow of water, the PoP made idols are carried away. The

study made by the institute (SERI) indicated that use of PoP

does not cause any serious adverse effect on the Environment.

</blockquote><p id="p_9">The Pollution level of the river/lake almost remains unchanged

in spite of immersion of PoP made idols. The PoP made idols

are   comparatively        convenient    for   transportation.   The

guidelines of the Respondent No. 6 (CPCB) indicate that

instead of POP, use of natural clay should be encouraged.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   7</span>
 However,      the   impugned   communication    issued   by    the

Respondent No. 4 goes a step ahead and practically imposes a

ban on use of PoP for manufacturing/making of idols.


</p><p id="p_10">6.         According to the applicants, use of clay for making

the idols is impracticable. For, not only are the clay idols

unaffordable to the common man , but extraction of clay from

river bed or places of earth would cause relatively more harm

to the Environment than the present practice of PoP made

idols. Moreover, making of clay idols require excessive manual

work. There is also difficulty in transportation thereof. The

Applicants further allege that they were not given opportunity

of hearing before imposing the ban. They have a fundamental

right to deal in trading/manufacturing of PoP idols.          Their

fundamental right cannot be trampled with by issuing such

prohibitory     orders.   They     are   concerned   only     with

manufacturing and selling of PoP made idols. The local

authorities may take appropriate steps to monitor the

immersion process by preparing artificial tanks during the

festival periods. The Applicants and those who are dependent

on the business of manufacturing of PoP made idols will be

deprived of their right to livelihood if the impugned directions

are not quashed. The impugned directions issued by the

Respondent No. 4 are arbitrary and discriminatory in nature.

Consequently, as a group, they knocked at the doors of

Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat by filing SCA No. 8406 of 2012.

</p><p id="p_11"> 7.       In view of the judgment of the Apex Court in W.P. (C)

50/1998 titled "<a href="/doc/1436850/" id="a_3">Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan

and others vs. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>", the said Writ Petition

was transferred to this Tribunal. The Writ Petition has been

converted into form of an application, as per the National

Green Tribunal (Practice and Procedure) Rules, 2011.

</p><p id="p_12">8.       The CPCB stated that the Respondent No. 4 has

issued directions under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_4">Section 5</a> of Environment (Protection)

Act, 1986.      The guidelines issued by the CPCB have been

treated as basis for issuance of directions in question. The

CPCB alleged that study of impact of immersion during

Dussehra festival in river Hoogli was carried out. The said

study report indicated that there was depletion in dissolved

oxygen content in river Hoogli after immersions of idols during

festivals days. Guidelines issued by the CPCB are based on

various scientific studies conducted by the authorities. The

guidelines have been issued in order to ensure protection of

environment. The CPCB further came out with a case that the

Respondent No. 4 has the power to issue directions under

<a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_5">Section 24</a> of the Water Act, 1974. It further stated that the

State Pollution Control Board has the power under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Section 25</a>

of the Water Act, 1974, to ensure that discharge from

industries shall comply with the prescribed directions and

norms.    The    CPCB,   therefore,   sought   dismissal   of   the

application.

</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">(ii)   Whether the direction issued by Respondent No. 4,

       imposing the ban on making of idols by using PoP as

       base material is otherwise legal and proper ?

</p><p id="p_22">12.    Mr. Kutti, Learned Counsel for the Applicants would

submit that the directions cannot be issued by the Respondent

No. 4, under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_7">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986, because such power is available only to the Central

Government. He argued that the guidelines issued by the

Respondent No 6 (CPCB), with a view to sensitise the public

and monitor the water quality, cannot be the basis to ban use

of PoP for making the idols. He further argued that the

Respondent No. 4 exceeded the limits of its legal authority

while issuing the relevant communication dated 23rd January,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                             10</span>
 2012. He pointed out that the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay

in PIL WP (c) 1325 of 2003 (Janhit Manch Vs State of

Maharashtra) only expressed that guidelines should be laid

down by the Central Government. He contended that such

guidelines have no force of law. He further argued that the

applicants were not heard before imposing the ban and as

such the impugned communication is bad in law due to

violation of principles of natural justice. He submitted that use

of PoP is made elsewhere in the medical field, fixing of false

ceiling etc. as it was not found to be a hazardous substance.

He contended that the applicants are aggrieved by the FIRs

filed against them. He further argued that the right of the

applicants to carry on trade is protected under <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_8">Article 304</a> of

the Constitution of India and the same is being trampled with

vide the impugned communication. Hence, he urged to quash

the impugned communication to the extent of implied ban on

use of PoP for making Idols.

Learned Counsel appearing for the contesting respondents

argued that the impugned communication is legal and proper.

reasonable restrictions. They argued, therefore, that the

applicants    have   no   right   to   carry   on   any   kind   of

trade/business which is not in the interest of the public at

large. They submitted that the impugned communication is

issued in view of the suggestions of the High Court of Bombay.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             11</span>
 They contended that internal studies on the impact of PoP had

been done by the MoEF/CPCB. Therefore, the guidelines are

issued. They further contended that <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_9">Section 18</a> of the Water

Act, 1974, read with Article162 of the Constitution of India,

empowers the GPCB as well as CPCB to formulate action plan

that mere wrong quoting of <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_18">section 5</a> of the Environment

(Protection) Act, 1986 does not invalidate the impugned

notification.        He      would    submit     that      the   Forest   and

further argued that the impugned communication is based

upon the guidelines issued by the Central Government, and,

therefore, it is part of the same environmental action plan. He

contended that the impugned communication, in any way,

1986 by the CPCB (R-6) in order to regulate the process for

immersion       of   idols    during      the   festival    periods.      That

communication, however, clearly goes to show that the CPCB

has issued the guidelines which may be followed by the State

authorities and all concerned to prepare action plan and

strategies to avoid environmental degradation in general and

water pollution, in particular.           The guidelines issued by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                     14</span>
 CPCB cannot be equated with statutory directions, rules or

regulations. The guidelines only indicate what precautionary

measures need be taken by the State authorities and all

concerned to avoid water pollution during festival days. The

first guideline is to the effect that making of idols by using

natural clay should be encouraged. This guideline is not, in

fact, of prohibitory nature.       In our opinion, it is rather of

recommendatory or advisory nature. What appears from the

impugned direction no. 1 stated in the communication dated

23.01.2012 issued by the State Government of Gujarat is that

impliedly restrictions are put on manufacturing of the idols by

using PoP. The other directions are indicative of safety

measures to be followed in order to alleviate water pollution

caused due to synthetic colours applied to the PoP idols. The

immersion of flowers, puja materials, etc., are additional

factors which cause water pollution, and hence need to be

regulated.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">
</blockquote><p id="p_60">22.        Upon plain reading of <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_37">section 5</a>, it is amply clear

that the power to give directions is available only to the

Central Government in order to perform its functions under

the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_38">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986. In other words, the

power to issue directions under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_39">section 5</a> cannot be exercised




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                              18</span>
 by the State Government under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_40">Environment (Protection)

Act</a>, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">23.          At this juncture, definition of the expression

"Environment Pollutant" may be considered.      <a href="/doc/53690461/" id="a_41">Section 2(b)</a> of

the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 defines "Environment

Pollutant" as any solid, liquid or gaseous substance present in

such concentration as may be, or tend to be injurious to the

environment. Therefore, even for the purpose of putting total

embargo on use of PoP for making of idols, it is necessary for

the Central Government to first determine whether the PoP is

an "Environment Pollutant". Guidelines issued by the CPCB

(R-6) do not indicate any finding of the CPCB that PoP is an

environment pollutant. We need not undertake such exercise

by ourselves for the simple reason that it is within the domain

of the CPCB or the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), as

the case may be, to conduct scientific study and determine

whether the PoP is an environmental pollutant. Still, however,

we may mention here that the PoP is calcium sulphate hemi-

hydrate : (CaSO4,     H2O) derived from gypsum.     A calcium

sulphate dihydrate (CaSO4, 2 H2O), by firing the mineral at

relatively low temperature and then reducing it to powder is

PoP.   PoP when mixed with water sets within few minutes.

The setting of PoP takes place with expansion and its surface

becomes smooth. Due to this property, PoP is used in moulds.

PoP is used in paper, soap and ceramic industries. It is used

for wrapping part of body for treatment of fractured bone in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                            19</span>
 order to immobilize the same.     PoP is not easily soluble in

water. It gradually goes to bed of the river or ponds after

immersing the idols or any other article made there from. It

has potential to make the water alkaline, if it is excessively

deposited at the pond or river bed or in the well. The excessive

deposition of such PoP may, therefore, harm aquatic life as

well as natural flow of pure water. However, these are not our

findings at present. These are the observations which, prima

facie, are culled out from certain study papers which have

been placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><p id="p_64">24.       Now, the pertinent question is whether the Forest

and Environment Department of the State of Gujarat could

have legally placed blanket embargo on use of PoP for making

of idols notwithstanding the fact that no such restriction was

clamped under the guidelines issued by the CPCB.         In our

opinion, such prohibition or restrictions may be imposed only

by the Central Government in the exercise of its power under

<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_42">section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.        The

power to give such directions is available to the Central

Government, irrespective of anything contained in any other

law with a rider that it shall be in consonance with the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_43">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986.       The

opening words of <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_44">section 5</a> i.e. "notwithstanding anything

contained in any other law but subject to the provisions of this

Act" are indicative of the legislative intent.   The provision

commences     with   "non-obstante   clause".     The   Central

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                            20</span>
 Government, therefore, has adequate powers to issue the

directions in order to protect the environment and alleviate

degradation thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">25.         Coming to the Environment (Protection) Rules,

1986, it may be stated that Rule 3 deals with authority of the

CPCB to prescribe standards of emission or discharge of

environmental pollutants as specified in schedule (I) to (IV).

Rule 4 deals with manner in which any direction may be

issued under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_45">section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986.      Rule 5 (1) empowers the Central Government to

prohibit location of industries and carrying of all the processes

and operations in different areas. The Central Government is

required    to    consider the        maximum allowable limits   of

concentration of environment pollutants including noise, for

an area.         Thus, the Central Government is required to

consider various factors before issuing notification under

<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_46">section 5</a> Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.


</p><p id="p_67">26.         All said and done, the Forest and Environment

it may be required to follow such directions issued by the

Central Government.        It need not be reiterated that the

notification dated 18.06.2010 issued by the CPCB is only in

the form of guidelines.               The Forest and Environment

Department of Gujarat had no power to place embargo on use

the same is without legal authority and as such would become

illegal.

further invited our attention to observations in case of "V.

Petitions.     A copy of the Judgment given by Hon'ble High

Court of Judicature at Madras is placed on record. That was a

PIL in which directions in the nature of writ were sought

against      the   State   Authorities   to   issue   permission   to

organizations to carry large sized PoP Ganesh idols and other

idols made of any other chemicals and immersing thereof in

sea, river and other water sources in the State of Tamil Nadu.

Perusal of the above referred Judgment reveals that the

Pollution Control Board had formed an Expert Committee

be permitted to make Ganesh/Vinayagar idols. The Division

Bench, however, did not decide about correctness of such

finding /conclusion of the Expert Committee.            The Division

Bench of Hon'ble Madras High Court, specifically observed as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_74">
"We do not propose to go into this question at this hour

replacing the opinion of the Committee with our opinion based

on the untested contention of the interveners to allow Vinayagar

idols that are made of Plaster of Paris to be immersed in the

</p>
<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">30.          We are of the opinion that the above referred

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                23</span>
 laid down any ratio in the context of the issue whether the PoP

idols can be branded as "Environment Pollutant" within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/53690461/" id="a_56">section 2(b)</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act,

1986.    The reliance on the above Authority is, therefore,

misplaced.
</p>
<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">31.        Cumulative effect of the foregoing discussion is that

the impugned communication issued by the Respondent No. 4

to the extent of ban on PoP made idols is without legal

authority in as much as such direction could not be issued

under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_57">section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

Thus, the said direction is arbitrary and liable to be quashed.

"negative".

</blockquote><p id="p_81">32.        For the sake of arguments, we may assume that the

Forest and Environment Department of the State of Gujarat

issued the impugned direction in the exercise of the powers

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_58">Water Act</a>. Whether the State Department of Forest

and Environment can exercise such power under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_59">Water

Act</a> is an ancillary question that will have to be now

addressed.    The preamble of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_60">Water Act</a>, 1974 which is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                            24</span>
 quoted earlier, provides key to decipher the Legislative intent

in pursuance of which the enactment has been brought into

force. The intention of the Legislature is to empower the PCBs

for the prevention and control of water pollution by conferring

and assigning such Boards, powers and functions regarding

thereof and for matters connected therewith.    The preamble

itself shows that the Parliament has no powers to make laws

for the State with respect any of the matters pertaining to

prevention and control of water pollution, except as provided

in Articles No. 249 and 250 of the Constitution. Therefore, as

a result of resolutions passed by all the Houses of the

Legislatures of the States including that of Gujarat, the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_61">Water

Act</a> has been enacted in pursuance of clause no. (1) of <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_62">Article

252</a> of the Constitution. Obliviously, the main intention of the

<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_63">Water Act</a> is to establish State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB)

for prevention and control of water pollution and to confer the

powers and functions on the PCBs to carry out functions in

the context of prevention and control of water pollution. Thus,

the preamble itself shows that <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_64">Water Act</a> has been enacted to

establish the SPCBs for the specific purpose enumerated in

the Act. <a href="/doc/20739/" id="a_65">Section 4</a> of the Water Act envisages constitution of

the SPCBs. The State Government is required to appoint the

Chairman and other Members of the Pollution Control Board

by means of notification published in an official gazette. The

powers and functions of the SPCBs are stated in <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_66">section 17</a> of

the Water Act.

submit that <a href="/doc/1352031/" id="a_67">section 24</a> of the Water Act may be invoked in

order to prohibit using of streams or wells for disposal of

polluting matter. It is worthy to be noted that <a href="/doc/29573430/" id="a_68">section 24</a> will

be attracted when any person would cause poisonous, noxious

or polluting matter to enter into any stream or well or sewer or

on land. The provision may be invoked only if such polluting

matter is specified in accordance with the relevant standards

as laid down by the SPCB.           It is nobody's case that Gujarat

PCB has laid down any particular standards of PoP so as to

stamp      the   same   as   "polluting    matter"   or    "poisonous

substance".

the GPCB under <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_70">section 33</a> - <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_71">A of the Water Act</a>.              For, the

PoP made idols cause pollution of water after the immersion

thereof.   Still, however, prima facie, it appears that even in

order to alleviate likelihood of nuisance on account of large

number of immersion of PoP idols in river/sea or ponds, etc.,

it may be an act covered by definition of word "pollution"

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/379900/" id="a_79">section 2(e)</a> of the Water Act. It follows,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                             27</span>
 therefore, that the GPCB may exercise the power to give

that the power is available to the GPCB and as well as to the

</p><p id="p_97">37.       Mr. P.N. Kutti, Learned Counsel for the Applicants

heavily relied upon certain observations in case of "Mohan

Bhai Yashwant Bhai Khandekar and 90 Petitioners &amp; Ors. vs.

State of Gujarat and 4 Respondents" (C.A. No. 6750 of 2011).

We have carefully gone through the said judgment rendered by

the Learned Single Judge of the Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat

at Ahmadabad.     The Petitioner therein had challenged the

notification dated 16.07.2011 issued by the Commissioner of

Police, Surat city under provision of <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_83">section 144</a> of the

Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.     The Learned Single Judge

quashed the notification dated 16.07.2011 mainly on the

ground that in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_84">section 144</a> of the

Criminal Procedure Code there must be circumstances which

may indicate that an urgent situation has arisen, of a nature

demanding invocation of speedy remedy.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">38.       Be that as it may, the observations of the Learned

Single Judge in the same Judgment, as reflected from

paragraphs 22, 23 and 25, would make it amply clear that the

Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat expected that the malady

requires to be tackled at the source, must be addressed as

environment and water pollution cause, for permanent

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                           28</span>
 solution and not by way of temporary measures such as the

issuance of notification under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_85">section 144</a> of the Criminal

Procedure Code. The Learned Single Judge observed:


</p><p id="p_100">      "In the instant case, the cause is right but the remedy is

not correct one"
</p>
<p id="p_101">
</p><p id="p_102">39.          It is but natural to infer that even according to the

Learned Single Judge the cause i.e. the prevention of water

pollution due to immersion of PoP made idols was right but

the temporary measures adopted by issuance of notification

under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_86">section 144</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code was

improper. In this view of the matter, the case law cited by the

Learned Counsel, Mr. Kutti is of no assistance to the

Applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_103">
</p><p id="p_104">40.          It may be mentioned that Learned Counsel for the

Respondents urged to invoke "precautionary principle" and

therefore, to dismiss the Application. The Counsel relied upon

certain observations in "Research Foundation for <a href="/doc/18451466/" id="a_87">Science

Technology and Natural Resources Policy vs. UoI &amp; Anr</a>. (2005)

10 SCC 510. The Apex Court expounded the precautionary

principle in the context of different facts and circumstances.

The     Apex   Court   held   that   precautionary       principle   of

sustainable     development    provides   for   taking     precaution

against specific environmental hazard by avoiding or reducing

environmental risks before specific harms are experienced.

The case of "<a href="/doc/758189/" id="a_88">P.K. Palanisamy vs. N. Arumgrham &amp; Anr</a>." (2009)


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                              29</span>
 9 SCC 173 was relied upon by the Counsel for the

Respondents in support of the argument that only because a

wrong provision was mentioned by the party, it would not be a

ground to nullify the order. We have already observed earlier

that this is not a case of mere wrong mentioning of the

provision in the impugned order. In our opinion, the State of

Gujarat over stepped by restricting the use of PoP for

making/manufacturing of idols. Thus, condition no. (1) in the

impugned communication is no short of over-stepping of

powers by the State Forest and Environment Department of

Gujarat without backup of any legal authority as such. The

Learned Counsel for the Respondents also referred to "<a href="/doc/1489220/" id="a_89">T

Ramakrishana Rao vs. Principal Secretary to Govt. of Andhra

Pradesh</a>" (2001 to 2005) ALD 299.          We do not find any

parallels in the facts of that case and present case. Had there

been scientific study and tangible material to infer that PoP is

harmful to    health or   causes   water pollution and      the

Notification was under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_90">Water Act</a>, the legal effect of such

ban might have been viewed differently.
</p>
<p id="p_105">
</p><p id="p_106">41.        Considering the entire gamut of arguments and the

legal position, we have no hesitation in holding that impugned

communication dated 23.01.2012 issued by the Respondent

No 4 is liable to be quashed to the extent of condition no. (1)

thereof. Accordingly, for non-compliance with due procedure

under the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_91">Water Act</a>, we record our finding on the issue no. (ii)

in the "negative".
</p>
<p id="p_107"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                            30</span>
</p><p id="p_108"> 42.         The communication dated 18.06.2010 issued by the

CPCB is in the form of guidelines and the challenge to said

communication is given up during course of the arguments.

Hence, to that extent the Application must fail.


</p><p id="p_109">43.         Incidentally, we may mention here that immersion

of idols must not diminish obeisance for the Gods/Goddesses.

One who has seen mutilated PoP idols resurging on surface of

the sea water, after the high-tide is over, will not forget the

pathetic sight and plight of the PoP idols, which were at the

centre of worshiping/Pandals before a few hours prior to the

immersion thereof. The sight of such mutilated idols, some of

them having broken hands, some of             them having partly

beheaded bodies, some of them having loss of legs, etc. give

serious jolt to the religious sentiments of the prudent

spectators.
</p>
<p id="p_110">       We     do   not   see   any   reason   why   the   idols   of

Gods/Goddesses should not have sanctity and due respect

even after the immersion. We mean to say, the aftermath of

the immersion should not result into colossal disrespect to the

idols of Gods and Goddesses on account of adoption of

improper immersion process. One cannot be oblivious of the

fact that when head of a soldier is found chopped at the hands

of the enemy, the public sentiments are seriously hurt. And, it

is a justified reaction as well as most natural reaction of the

citizens. It does not stand to reason, therefore, that religious

sentiments also will not be hurt to see the beheaded or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                               31</span>
 otherwise mutilated idols of Gods /Goddesses which come on

surface of the water at the shore of the sea, ponds or other

water bodies as a result of backlash or reverse water waives.

Needless to say, therefore, that it would be in the interest of

the public to avoid the hurting of religious sentiments by

regulating immersion process and use of the PoP for

making/manufacturing of idols of Gods/Goddesses.


</p><p id="p_111">44.          Before parting with the present matter, we may

observe that the use of PoP for making/manufacturing of not

only Ganesh idols, but also any other idols or articles made of

PoP which are traditionally immersed in rivers, ponds, sea, or

other water bodies deserve reasonable restrictions. It is also

necessary to strike a proper balance while imposing such

restrictions. We do not think it proper to pre-determine the

nature of restrictions and impose our views on the competent

authority.     However, we deem it proper to give certain

directions to the SPCBs in general and to the GPCB in

particular, for preventing water pollution.


</p><p id="p_112">45.          In the result, the Application is partly allowed. The

impugned communication dated 23.01.2012 is quashed to the

extent of condition no. 1 stated therein i.e. which restricts use

of PoP for manufacturing/making of idols. The other prayer

pertaining to challenge to the guidelines dated 18.06.2010

stands dismissed. Other conditions no. 2 to 12 shown in the

impugned direction of the Govt. Of Gujarat are kept intact till



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                              32</span>
 further directions issued by GPCB or State Government or

CPCB.
</p>
<p id="p_113">
</p><p id="p_114">46.       We direct the GPCB and all the other Pollution

Control Boards which are covered by the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_92">Water Act</a> to

undertake scientific study of the impact of PoP made idols on

immersion thereof, in relation to water quality of rivers, ponds,

sea, or other sources and examine whether it is               an

environment pollutant.
</p>
<p id="p_115">
</p><p id="p_116">47.       We also direct the said PCBs to examine whether

the immersion of PoP made idols, in fact, cause nuisance,

though the PoP by itself may not be a water pollutant. After

conducting such scientific study by appointing an Expert

Committee, the Pollution Control Board or the Central

Government or the State Government may issue appropriate

directions in accordance with the powers available under

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_93">section 33</a> - <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_94">A of the Water Act</a> or any other provisions under

the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_95">Water Act</a> or any other Act, in order to control water

pollution or to avoid the nuisance caused on account of

immersion of the PoP made idols.
</p>
<p id="p_117">
</p><p id="p_118">48.       Since the Ganesh festival and other festivals are in

the offing, it is desirable that the Gujarat PCB as well as the

other PCBs should complete the exercise mentioned above

within a period of three (3) months and thereafter the SPCB or

Government may issue the necessary directions, if so deemed




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                            33</span>
 proper, under provisions of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_96">Water Act</a> or any other Act, as

may be permissible and deemed proper.
</p>
<p id="p_119">
</p><p id="p_120">49.       We expect that the Pollution Control Boards or the

Government would also decide and set out norms/benchmark

for the heights of PoP idols which are to be ultimately

immersed, in accordance with the nature of the immersion

places, even though PoP is not found to be an "environment

pollutant".   For example, the idols to be immersed into sea

water may not be of more than 8 - 10 ft. height and the idols

to be immersed in ponds may not be of more than 5 ft. height,

so on and so forth. So also, the local bodies may be required

to create artificial ponds, in the absence of appropriate water

resources like ponds, lakes, etc. for temporary purpose of

immersion of PoP idols.
