          HONOURABLE SRI JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO

               WRIT PETITION NO.26464 OF 2018
ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioners are working as workmen in SIEMENS Limited.

Their grievance in the present writ petition is that they are not

continued beyond the age of 58 years and till they attain the age of

60 years. According to petitioners, the respondent company has

establishments in various parts of the country including the one at

Hyderabad, where petitioners are working. In the matter of fixation

of age of superannuation, company is not adopting the uniform

yardstick or policy. In some of the Units, employees are continued

till they attain the age of 60 years and in some other units, like one

in Hyderabad, employees are made to retire on attaining the age of

58 years and, therefore, such action is arbitrary, discriminatory

and thus unconstitutional.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Heard learned counsel Mr. Balamukund for Mr. Ch.Ganesh,

learned counsel for petitioners and learned counsel appearing for

respondent company.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    As the Court entertained doubt on maintainability of writ

petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India praying to

issue mandamus on the 2nd respondent company to continue the

petitioners in service beyond the age of 58 years, learned counsel

for petitioners was requested to assist the Court on the issue of

maintainability.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    According to learned counsel for petitioners, SIEMENS

though a multinational company, it is required to follow the

statues, rules, regulations formulated by the Government of India
                                                                     PNR,J
                                                      W.P.No.26464 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    4</span>

on all aspects including the service conditions of employees, such

as, contribution to the provident fund under the <a href="/doc/397345/" id="a_2">Employees

Provident Fund Act</a>, 1952, <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_3">Gratuity Act</a>, 1972, <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_4">Industrial Disputes

Act</a>, 1947 and similar enactments and, therefore, respondent

company is amenable to writ jurisdiction of this court. In support

of his contention, he placed reliance on the decision of learned

single Judge of this Court in <a href="/doc/12539344/" id="a_5">Police Officers Association,

Adilabad Unit, Adilabad v. United India Insurance Co.Ltd.,

Chennai</a> and another1.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.       Per contra, learned counsel appearing for 2nd respondent

company would submit that SIEMENS is a multinational company

and is a private company and relationship between the petitioners

and the 2nd respondent company is purely contractual.           Second

respondent company does not answer the description of 'other

authority' as enshrined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_6">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India. It

is not discharging any public duty. Thus, it is not amenable to

writ jurisdiction, more so for enforcement of terms of contract of

employment.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.       Writ remedy is available to an aggrieved person alleging that

his rights are affected by an order/decision or not deciding in a

given time frame by an authority vested with responsibility to

discharge public functions and thereby, offending his right.           In

case of public employment, person can complain of offending right

to equality and equal treatment and violation of constitutional

safeguards or statutory rules/regulations. A citizen can invoke

jurisdiction of writ Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

                                                                      PNR,J
                                                       W.P.No.26464 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5</span>

India alleging violation of equality clause enshrined in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14</a> of

the Constitution of India; rights conferred in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_9">Article 19;</a> Right to life

as enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> or violation of other fundamental rights

or statutory right vested in him. Even against a private person writ

is maintainable if such person is involved in discharging public

duty or the cause espoused in the writ petition has public law

element or to enforce statutory obligations against him. But, such

remedy is not available to a person seeking enforcement of terms of

contract vis-à-vis private employer.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7.    In the case on hand, grievance of petitioners is that they are

not continued in service by their employer beyond 58 years. This

claim is based on the premise that in other Units of respondent

company employees are continued till they attain the age of 60

years. There is no public law element involved in this case. There

is no statutory prescription to continue petitioners till they attain

the age of 60 years. It is purely enforcement of terms of contract

between the petitioners and their employer.


</p><p id="p_14">8.    In the decision relied by the learned counsel for petitioners,

respondent was insurance company.          The respondent insurance

company entered into contract with the petitioners' association

and offered to issue 10 years long term Group Janata Personal

Accident Insurance Policy to its members working in Police

Department, covering the risk of death and disability arising out of

any accident or otherwise on payment of one time premium in

lump sum and issued Group Insurance Policy. While so, petitioner

association received communication informing the association that

the policy is terminated w.e.f. 27.04.2002. Aggrieved thereby, writ
                                                                     PNR,J
                                                      W.P.No.26464 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    6</span>

petition was instituted. The Court held that respondent company

being a public authority could not have cancelled/withdrawn the

policy by invoking clause in the policy without assigning reasons.

The Court opined that as the cancellation was affecting the rights

of members of petitioner association, such cancellation ought not

to have been made without affording due opportunity. With

respect, said decision do not come to the aid of petitioners herein.


</p><p id="p_15">9.        The issue for consideration is whether writ petition seeking

enforcement of terms of contract of employment against private

company is maintainable ?
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">10.       In the following decisions, Supreme Court considered this

issue.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
10.1.       <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_11">In Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas</a> and others2,

Supreme Court was considering maintainability of writ petition vis-

à-vis private Bank. Reliance was placed on provisions of <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_12">Reserve

Bank of India Act</a>, 1934 and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_13">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949 to

contend that State has deep and pervasive control over the

functioning of the private Bank and, therefore, such bank is

amenable to writ jurisdiction, identical contention as urged in this

writ petition. Said contention was rejected. Supreme Court held

that exercise of power by the Reserve Bank of India under the

<a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_14">Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, 1934 and <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_15">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949

is only to ensure compliance of statutory provisions.

10.2. Supreme Court held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    "18. From the decisions referred to above, the position that
    emerges is that a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of the
    Constitution of India may be maintainable against (i) the State
    (Government); (ii) an authority; (iii) a statutory body; (iv) an
    instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a company which is
    financed and owned by the State; (vi) a private body run
    substantially on State funding; (vii) a private body discharging
    public duty or positive obligation of public nature; and (viii) a
    person or a body under liability to discharge any function under
    any statute, to compel it to perform such a statutory function.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">    27. Such private companies would normally not be amenable to
    the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_17">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. But in
    certain circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or
    persons as there may be statutes which need to be complied with
    by all concerned including the private companies. For example,
    there are certain legislations like the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_18">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the
    <a href="/doc/142278/" id="a_19">Minimum Wages Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_20">Factories Act</a> or for maintaining proper
    environment, say the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_21">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,
    1981 or the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974
    etc. or statutes of the like nature which fasten certain duties and
    responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies which they
    are bound to comply with. If they violate such a statutory
    provision a writ would certainly be issued for compliance with
    those provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispenses
    with the service of its employee in violation of the provisions
    contained under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_23">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, in innumerable
    cases the High Court interfered and has issued the writ to the
    private bodies and the companies in that regard. But the
    difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where there may not be
    any non-compliance with or violation of any statutory
    provision by the private body. In that event a writ may not
    be issued at all. Other remedies, as may be available, may
    have to be resorted to.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">    32. Merely because Reserve Bank of India lays the banking
    policy in the interest of the banking system or in the
    interest of monetary stability or sound economic growth
    having due regard to the interests of the depositors etc. as
    provided under <a href="/doc/216565/" id="a_24">Section 5(c)(a)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act
    does not mean that the private companies carrying on the
    business or commercial activity of banking, discharge any
    public function or public duty. These are all regulatory
                                                                                   PNR,J
                                                                    W.P.No.26464 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                            8</span>

        measures applicable to those carrying on commercial activity in
        banking and these companies are to act according to these
        provisions failing which certain consequences follow as indicated
        in the Act itself. As to the provision regarding acquisition of a
        banking company by the Government, it may be pointed out that
        any private property can be acquired by the Government in public
        interest. It is now a judicially accepted norm that private interest
        has to give way to the public interest. If a private property is
        acquired in public interest it does not mean that the party whose
        property is acquired is performing or discharging any function or
        duty of public character though it would be so for the acquiring
        authority.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        33. For the discussion held above, in our view, a private company
        carrying on banking business as a scheduled bank, cannot be
        termed as an institution or a company carrying on any statutory
        or public duty. A private body or a person may be amenable to
        writ jurisdiction only where it may become necessary to compel
        such body or association to enforce any statutory obligations or
        such obligations of public nature casting positive obligation upon
        it. We don't find such conditions are fulfilled in respect of a
        private company carrying on a commercial activity of banking.
        Merely regulatory provisions to ensure such activity carried on by
        private bodies work within a discipline, do not confer any such
        status upon the company nor put any such obligation upon it
        which may be enforced through issue of a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a>
        of the Constitution. Present is a case of disciplinary action being
        taken    against   its   employee   by   the   appellant   Bank.   The
        respondent's service with the Bank stands terminated. The action
        of the Bank was challenged by the respondent by filing a writ
        petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The
        respondent is not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the part
        of the Bank. That being the position, the appeal deserves to be
        allowed."                                (emphasis supplied).

[Election Commission of India v. Saka Venkata Rao</a>, AIR 1953 SC
210] this Court had observed that administrative law in India
has been shaped on the lines of English law. There are a catena
of judgments in English courts taking same view, namely,
contractual and commercial obligations are enforceable only by
ordinary action and not by judicial review. <a href="/doc/117218345/" id="a_33">In R. (Hopley) v.
Liverpool Health Authority</a> [2002 EWHC 1723 (Admin) : 2002
Lloyd's Med Rep 494] (unreported)(30-7-2002), Justice Pitchford
helpfully set out three things that had to be identified when
considering whether a public body with statutory powers was
exercising a public function amenable to judicial review or a
private function. They are: (i) whether the defendant was a
public body exercising statutory powers; (ii) whether the function
being performed in the exercise of those powers was a public or
a private one; and (iii) whether the defendant was performing a
public   duty   owed   to    the    claimant   in   the   particular
circumstances under consideration.

Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak
Trust v. V.R. Rudani</a>, (1989) 2 SCC 691] , which took a
revolutionary turn and departure from the earlier views, this
Court held that "any other authority" mentioned in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> is
not confined to statutory authorities or instrumentalities of the
State defined under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_36">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, it also

      In the first two cases, the employment ceases to have private law
      character and "status" to such an employment is attached. In
      the third category of cases, it is the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_38">Industrial Disputes Act</a>

      impugned action does not involve public law element and no
      "public law rights" have accrued in favour of the appellant which
      are infringed. The service conditions of the appellant are not
      governed in the same manner as was the position in <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_39">Andi Mukta

company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_40">Companies Act</a> and is a private

company involved in manufacturing goods and services.                       No

material is placed on record to show exercise of control by the

Government of India over the management and administrative

functions of respondent company in any manner including

employment aspects of the company.              As contended by learned

counsel for respondent company, the company formulates its own

employment policy and regulates conditions of services of its

employees.

</p><p id="p_39">12.   In the case on hand, respondent company works in a

particular field of its activity and it does not have any monopoly

status in its sphere of activity.          Company is not created by a

statute. No investment is made by the State to establish the

company nor it extended financial support. The State has no

control over its internal affairs, much less deep and pervasive

control. It only exercises statutory powers to enforce compliance of

statutory requirements.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">13.   The relationship between the petitioners and the respondent

company is one of contract of service regulated by the terms of

appointment granted to them. As it is a registered company, it is

also governed by the provisions of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_41">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947

and industrial standing orders in addition to various other

statutes.   Thus, if an employee is aggrieved by decisions of the

company affecting his conditions of service, he can take recourse

to the provisions of the industrial standing orders and/or the

<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_42">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.

superannuation of its employees. It is not discharging any public

utility service. Only when essential Governmental functions are

placed or allowed to be performed by a private body, it must be

held to have undertaken a public duty or public function. There is

no public law element in the issue agitated in the writ petition. It

is purely on enforcement of terms of contract of service.

conditions of employees working in 2nd respondent company is not

maintainable. It is accordingly dismissed. Pending       miscellaneous
