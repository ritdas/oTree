             AND
             HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD
             SINGH

    CAV JUDGMENT
    (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE I. A. ANSARI)
    Date: 30.01.2015.

                                    Compelled to do what is imperative so as

                  to adhere to, and maintain, judicial discipline and

                  impelled by the call of duty, I, with some degree of

                  sadness and a deep sense of anguish, pen down my

                  views and conclusions in the context of the facts and

                  attending       circumstances,       which    have   led   to   the

                  constitution of this Full Bench. Strictly speaking,

                  administration of justice inheres judicial discipline. No

                  wonder, therefore, that while administering justice,

                  judicial discipline is needed to be adhered to.

               BACKGROUND FACTS

                                    3. The material facts, which led to the

                  constitution of this Full Bench, may, in brief, be set

                  out as under:-

                                    (i) On 01.11.2012, a PIL was filed by

                  Suresh Prasad Yadav and others, being C.W.J.C. No.

                  20570 of 2012 (referred to, for convenience, as `first

                  PIL'), bringing to the notice of this Court the

                  village Sampatchak, Bairiya, P.S. Gopalpur, District

                  Patna, in particular, with regard to dumping of solid

                  municipal waste causing environmental pollution and

                  health hazard. As the same was being allegedly done

                  at the behest of the Patna Municipal Corporation, the

                  Patna Municipal Corporation was made one of the

                  party-respondents through the Chief Executive Officer-

                  cum-Municipal Commissioner. Some of the orders

                  passed in these proceedings, insofar as they are

                  relevant, are quoted hereunder:-

                                                               ―17.05.2013-       A
                                            counter affidavit is filed today on
                                            behalf    of     the   Patna   Municipal
                                            Corporation affirmed by Sri Kuldip
                                            Narayan, Municipal Commissioner.
                                            We have gone through the same.
                                                                    The Corporation
                                            does not appear to be realizing the
                                            gravity of the situation giving the
                                            seriousness the matter deserves.
                                            Time is running out. Further delay
                                            would in our opinion create an
                                            irretrievable and grossly hazardous
                                            situation.        The       Corporation
                                            acknowledges       possession    of the
                                            lands having been given to it.
                                            Surprisingly it then questions its
                                            own       acts     with     regard    to

                  the first PIL, was clear. The matter, in relation to

                  was specifically noted in the order, dated 15.12.2014,

                  passed in the first PIL, is that Shri Kapil Ashok was

                  given time by the Court to acquaint himself with the

                  affairs of the Patna Municipal Corporation and the

                  that on 16.04.2013, another writ petition was filed by

                  one Narendra Mishra, which gave rise to a PIL, bearing

                  C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013, wherein the petitioner‟s

                  grievance was in relation to a particular multi-storied

                  building being constructed in violation of the Building

                  Bye-laws within the territorial area of the Patna

                  Municipal Corporation and, in spite of complaint

                  alleged to have been made in this regard, nothing was

                  being done by the Patna Municipal Corporation. The

                  would refer to as „second PIL‟, expanded the scope of

                                            this      Court,          would        impair

                  cases be, immediately, listed before a larger Bench

                  i.e. Full Bench, and the three senior most Judges of

                  the Court i.e. the Acting Chief Justice, Justice V. N.

                  Sinha     and     Justice     Navaniti       Prasad   Singh    would

                  constitute the Full Bench to hear the two public

                  interest litigations. It is in this perspective that this

                  batch of PILs, with all interlocutory applications filed

                  therein,      have      been        listed   and   taken      up   for

</p><p id="p_50">                                    4. As vehement lengthy arguments have

                  been advanced before this Full Bench with regard to

                  the legality of the constitution of this Full Bench, while

                  referring the two PILs to a Full Bench and other

                  matters impinging upon the constitution of the Full

                  Bench, I deem it proper to deal with them as well.

</p><p id="p_51">                                    5. The first thing, I would like to note, is

                  that no counsel, appearing for any of the parties in

                  any of these proceedings before the Full Bench, has

                  chosen to doubt or challenge the correctness of order,

                  dated 15.12.2014, passed in the first PIL, i.e.,

                  C.W.J.C. No. 20570 of 2012, wherein the first Division

                  Bench had held that Shri Kuldip Narayan could

                  challenge his suspension in a separate writ petition,

                  but not in a PIL nor has anyone doubted the

                  impartiality of the first Division Bench, in the first

                  PIL, allowing Shri Kuldip Narayan a leeway. Without

                  challenging the correctness, legality or otherwise of

                  the order passed, in the first PIL, in the pre-lunch

                  session,     on     15.12.2014,     Shri   Kuldip   Narayan,

                  however, filed, on 18.12.2014, I.A. No. 9498 of 2014

                  questioning the cases being referred to the Full Bench.

                  constitution of this Full Bench, Mr. Y. V. Giri, learned

                  Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the Municipal

                  Commissioner -cum- Chief Executive Officer of the

                  Patna Municipal Corporation, Shri Kuldip Narayan, and

                  also the Patna Municipal Corporation, submits that

                  listing of all the cases together before the Full Bench

                  of three Judges by the orders of the Acting Chief

                  Justice was not permissible under the Patna High

                  Court Rules, especially, when, according to him, there

                  were no conflicting order or orders in ignorance of

                  binding precedent. Mr. Giri, learned Senior Counsel,

                  also submits that though Shri Kuldip Narayan was an

                  officer of the State Government in the cadre of All

                  India Service (I.A.S.), he having been appointed as

                  Corporation, the State Government was incompetent

                  to take any disciplinary action against him under the

                  All India Services (Discipline &amp; Appeal) Rules, 1969,

                  and it had no jurisdiction to either start disciplinary

                  proceedings or to suspend him, especially, in respect

                  of nothing done or alleged to have been done by him

                  as a Municipal Commissioner under the provisions of

                  the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007. His further submission

                  is that notwithstanding clear order, dated 15.12.2014,

                  passed in the first PIL, specifically pointing out that

                  the order of suspension could not be made subject

                  matter of PIL and notwithstanding that the second

                  Division Bench, being cognizant of the said order,

                  having entertained the interlocutory application being

                  I. A. No. 9327 of 2014 as filed by Shri Kuldip Narayan

                  in the second PIL, and notwithstanding the stay

                  granted by the second Division Bench as against the

                  order of suspension and thereby allowing Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan to continue as Commissioner, Patna Municipal

                  Corporation, there was no conflict and the second

                  Division Bench ought to have been permitted to

                  proceed and adjudicate upon the merits of the

                  suspension order in the second PIL and any party,

                  aggrieved by the final order, could seek his remedy

                  accordingly, but referring all the cases to the Full

                  traditions maintained at the Bar, Mr. Giri, learned

                  Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan, has not, however, raised any plea, attributed

                  or even faintly suggested, of likelihood of bias against

                  any member constituting this Full Bench. Why I made

                  this observation would become clear and evident as

                  we proceed further.
</p>
<p id="p_54">                                    8. Amazing though it may sound, Mr.

                  Shree Prakash Srivastava, learned counsel appearing

                  for the petitioners, in the first PIL, has also assailed

                  the legality of the constitution of this Bench. His

                  arguments        are,      however,         a   little   different.   His

                  contention is that the first PIL had been directed to

                  be listed on 19.12.2014, whereas the matter, on being

                  mentioned         by     the         learned    Principal    Additional

                  Advocate       General,         in    the   pre    lunch    session    of

                  17.12.2014, was taken up without publication of any

                  notice. I may, immediately, point out that the matter

                  was taken up, on 17.12.2014, on publication of notice.

                  This apart, adverse order ought to have been passed,

                  and had not been passed, against the interest of the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8152 of 2013 dt.30-01-2015

                  petitioners in the first PIL, while referring the two

                  PILs, on the administrative side, to the Acting Chief

                  Justice, for consideration, if a larger Bench needed to

                  be    constituted       to    arrest    conflicting    orders    and

                  directions emanating from the two Division Benches of

                  this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_55">                                    9. The other grievance of Mr. Shree

                  Prakash Srivastava, learned counsel, is that the

                  subject matter of the second PIL has been imported

                  into the first PIL. I find no substance in this

                  submission inasmuch as the two PILs are on two

                  different subjects and it was only because of the fact

                  that the Commissioner, Patna Municipal Corporation,

                  stood      suspended,          that    different    and      colliding

                  directions, may be unintentionally, emanated from two

                  Division Benches of this Court, which was wholly

                  unhealthy,        may        be,    unconsciously      and     unless

                  conflicting observations and directions were restricted,

                  such conflicts would negate the concept of judicial

                  discipline and deny to the people proper and effective

                  administration of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_56">                                    10. I may further point our that Mr.

                  Shree     Prakash       Srivastava,      learned      counsel,   was

                  repeatedly asked by us to point out how he or, for that

                  matter, his writ petition or his writ petitioners were at

                  all adversely affected by placing the matter before the

                  Full Bench, he had no clear reply. Why he was

                  opposing the hearing before the Full Bench, he could

                  not clearly specify. I am surprised and dismayed.

</p><p id="p_57">                                    11. We, then, have Mr. Jyoti Ranjan Jha,

                  Advocate, appearing for Shri Amitesh Kumar, in I.A.

                  No. 9094 of 2014, filed in the first PIL, adopting the

                  same line of arguments as Mr. Giri; but in course of

                  his argument, he, however, urged the Court that his

                  submissions        should       be   taken   note     of   as    an

                  independent Advocate in the matter. To me, the

                  reasons were obvious. I have earlier indicated                   the

                  contents of this I.A. No. 9094 of 2014 as filed in the

                  second PIL, wherein Shri Amitesh Kumar had sought

                  to protect the interest of his father, Shri Lalan Prasad

                  Singh, Executive Engineer in the Kankarbagh Division

                  of the Patna Municipal Corporation, in respect of the

                  vigilance     case     filed   and   registered     against     him,

                  wherein the second Division Bench, in the second

                  PIL, ordered, on 09.12.2014, that no coercive steps

                  be taken, in the vigilance case against Sri Lalan

                  Prasad Singh, even though he was not a party to any

                  of the proceedings in the public interest litigation nor

                  could he even remotely claim the protection of the

                  order, dated 08.07.2013, passed, in the second PIL,

                  wherein an order of restraint was passed only in

                  respect of transfer of Sri Kuldip Narayan, Municipal

                  Commissioner, without leave of the Court. The effect

                  of the directions, given in favour of Sri Lalan Prasad

                  Singh, was that neither could he be arrested nor was

                  any search or seizure possible.
</p>
<p id="p_58">                                    12. It may also be noted here that on

                  15.12.2014 itself, in the second PIL, State had filed

                  two interlocutory applications, being I.A. No. 9357 of

                  2014 and I.A. No. 9359 of 2014, seeking leave of the

                  Division Bench to post another officer in place of Shri

                  Kuldip Narayan, who had been suspended, so that

                  functions of the Patna Municipal Corporation might

                  continue.
</p>
<p id="p_59">                                    13. Before proceeding further, I may

                  refer to I.A.No. 108 of 2015 filed, in C.W.J.C.No. 8152

                  of 2013, by Mr. Prasoon Sinha, an Advocate, strictly

                  in his individual capacity. It has not been filed on

                  behalf of any of the parties to the writ petition, much

                  less on behalf of Shri Kuldip Narayan or on his

                  instructions. By this application, Mr. Prasoon Sinha has

                  sought Justice Navaniti Prasad Singh to recluse from

                  being a Member of the Full Bench and hearing this

                  matter on the ground of likelihood of bias against Shri

                  Kuldip Narayan. With this interlocutory application, I

                  will deal with elaborately at a later stage. I may,

                  however, hasten to add that Shri Kuldip Narayan has

                  raised no such apprehensions nor has any such

                  apprehensions been expressed by any of the parties to

                  the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_60">                                    14. I may also note here that Mr. Kumar

                  Amitesh Chandra, Advocate, who apparently appears

                  for some of the connected matters, raised serious

                  objections      to    the     stand   of    Mr.    Prasoon     Sinha,

                  Advocate,       who      appeared     not     as    a    party,   but

                  independently by means of I. A. No. 108 of 2015,

                  seeking one of the members of the Full Bench to

                  rescue on the ground of likelihood of bias. Mr. Kumar

                  Amitesh Chandra, learned counsel, placed on record

                  some       orders      of     different    Courts       in   different

                  proceedings, wherein different Benches, including that

                  of Justice V. N. Sinha, have passed severe strictures

                  against Shri Kuldip Narayan. This questions the bona

                  fide of Mr. Prasoon Sinha, Advocate, in choosing to

                  ignore these orders and strictures passed, while

                  raising the plea of likelihood of bias against one of the

                  must hasten to point out that no bias or prejudice has

                  been alleged by any of the parties to the two Public

                  Interest     Litigations      against       any    of    the     Judges,

                  constituting either the first Division Bench or the

                  second Division Bench, nor has any of the parties to

                  the two public interest litigations or interlocutory

                  applications filed therein have expressed any doubt on

                  the impartiality of the members of this Full Bench,

                  which was encouraging and gave us the impetus to do

                  Government in issuing orders of suspension of Shri

                  applications in the second PIL, urges the Court to

                  take note of the fact that unnecessarily, the Builders

                  Association and its members are being dragged into

                  the    present      controversy,        though      they    have   no

                  personal animus against Shri Kuldip Narayan and

                  note, in this regard, that this interlocutory application

                  of the State, in all the cases, submits, firstly, that in a

                  PIL, exclusively relating to failure of Patna Municipal

                  Corporation to discharge its statutory obligations, any

                  individual grievance of an officer, in relation to service

                  matter, at his own behest, could not have been

                  entertained and the interlocutory application (I.A. No.

                  9327 of 2014), filed by Shri Kuldip Narayan, in the

                  second PIL, was, thus, not maintainable as being

                  that the second Division Bench, in view of the order of

                  the first Division Bench, was required to decline to

                  entertain the said interlocutory application and if the

                  the views of the first Division Bench or with the

                  directions passed in the first PIL, the only option for

                  the second Division Bench was to refer the matter to

                  the Chief Justice to constitute a larger Bench to

                  consider or adjudicate the issue. He, then, submits

                  full authority in assigning of cases and constitution of

                  his personal capacity, not on behalf of or not on

                  proceedings on the ground of likelihood of bias against

                  Shri Kuldip Narayan is nothing, but a mischievous

                  effort to scandalize the Court and depicts irresponsible

                  conduct of an officer of the Court, not compatible to

                  the status of an Advocate of the Court and, as such,

                  the interlocutory application, filed by Mr. Prasoon

                  Division Bench, in the first PIL, presided over by me

                  inasmuch as it was indicated, in no uncertain words, in

                  the order, dated 15.12.2014, passed in the pre lunch

                  session that an order placing a Government servant

                  under suspension, cannot be made a subject of a

                  public interest litigation and observing that „until the

                  time a permanent arrangement is made by the State

                  Government by withdrawing suspension of Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan,       functions      of    the   Corporation,      as   the

                  submissions made on behalf of the State Govt. and

                  including the learned counsel for Shri Kuldip Narayan,

                  who appeared in the second PIL, a prayer was made

                  before the second Division Bench, in the second PIL,

                  by Sri Kuldip Narayan to quash and stay his order of

                  suspension and notwithstanding the fact that all these

                  Division Bench, however, not only entertained the

                  with the second PIL, acted, consistent with the best

                  traditions of judicial discipline, in making apparently

                  Chief Justice, and the facts having been brought to my

               SERVICE DISPUTE VIS-À-VIS PUBLIC INTEREST

               LITIGATION

</p><p id="p_78">                                    27.       I    should,    now,    consider    the

                  argument of Mr. Santosh Kumar, Advocate, appearing

                  for   some      of    the       Municipal   Councilors,   who   are

                  opposing the actions of the State Government in

                  suspending           the        Municipal    Commissioner       and

                  challenging the order of suspension in the PIL. Firstly,

                  no intervention to support a petitioner is permissible

                  under the Patna High Court Rules inasmuch as proviso

                  to Rule 5 of Chapter XXIC of the Patna High Court

                  Rules makes it clear that intervention or intervenors

                  can only oppose or be heard in opposition. Thus, the

                  application of the Councillors of the Patna Municipal

                  Corporation, impugning the order of suspension of

                  Shri Kuldip Narayan, is wholly misconceived in law and

                  cannot be sustained and, therefore, rejected. Since,

                  Mr. Santosh Kumar has relied upon a decision of the

                  Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/103003427/" id="a_4">State of Punjab v.

                  Salil Sabhlok and others</a>, reported in (2013) 5 SCC

                  entertained, I may point out that I have examined the

                  decision in Salil Sabhlok (supra), and in my view,

                  reliance is wholly misconceived.

                  referred to earlier on this aspect, I may refer to the

                  recent judgment of the Supreme Court, in the case of

                  the reports, as follows :-

                                              principles make it clear that

<p id="p_80">                  That is different from a PIL as generally understood.

                  Keeping this in mind, if we see the decision in the case

                  of Salil Sabhlok (supra), the Apex Court therein had

                  clearly held that what was in challenge was not an

                  appointment of a person holding a civil post. In other

                  words, what was challenged by way of PIL was not a

                  service matter, but what was challenged was selection

                  of a person holding a constitutional post of the

                  Chairman of the Public Service Commission. It was

                  clearly a case of quo warranto and not a case of PIL

                  simplicitor in a service matter. I am constrained to

                  observe that the decision in Salil Sabhlok (supra),

                  relied upon by Mr. Santosh Kumar, is not an authority

                  for the proposition he has sought to canvas.

</p><p id="p_81">                                    30. To me, the law, in relation to PIL, is

                  clear. A PIL is not to be an adversarial litigation; but

                  inquisitorial in character. PIL is meant to deal with

                  larger public interest litigation at the behest of public

                  spirited person(s) espousing cause(s) of people, who

                  are voiceless and who may not be in a position to

                  move Courts to vindicate their rights. It is a litigation

                  claiming no personal right and claiming no personal

                  relief. The moment an individual claims to enforce a

                  personal right and claims a personal relief, it ceases to

                  be a subject matter of PIL and is not maintainable as

                  such; more particularly, if the subject matter relates

                  to service dispute. Enforcement of personal right and

                  asking for a personal relief are clearly beyond the

                  object with which PIL was conceived. Individuals have

                  well defined forums for vindicating their individual

                  rights and PIL is not for the said purpose nor can

                  individual disputes be brought for adjudication in a

                  PIL and, in fact, in terms of the Patna High Court

                  Rules relating to PIL, a certificate is required to be

                  submitted by an applicant stating that none of his

                  personal interest is involved in the public interest

                  litigation, whereas the prayers, for stay of suspension

                  and quashment, made by Sri Kuldip Narayan had no

                  element of public interest, but purely private and

                  individual interest.

                  contemplation thereof, it decided to suspend him in

                  impugning the action of the State in his personal

                  capacity and seeking a personal and private relief of

                  not only stay of his suspension, but also for getting

                  the order of suspension quashed, though he had right

                  either in moving the Central Administrative Tribunal or

                  in a separate writ petition if he could make out a case

                  for invoking the extra ordinary jurisdiction of the High

                  but in a PIL, and that too, by a mere interlocutory

                  application, no such relief could have been sought for,

                  or granted, either for limited or unlimited purpose. It

                  is trite that a Court will not pass any interim order

                  which it cannot pass finally; whereas the present one

                  challenged the legality of his suspension by way of an

                  position as consistently held by the Supreme Court,

                  Division Bench, in second PIL, could have, with

                  greatest respect, referred the matter to a Full Bench

                  instead of entertaining I. A. No. 9327 of 2014, filed by

                  Shri Kuldip Narayan, challenging, in a pending PIL,

                  his suspension with prayers of stay thereof and its

                  quashment. Such an application was totally foreign to

                  a PIL; more so, in the second PIL, wherein subject

                  matter was entirely different. It is not that Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan was remediless. He had a statutory remedy

                  before the Central Administrative Tribunal or, if so

                  advised, by an independent writ petition. He and his

                  learned counsel were aware of the order of the first

                  Division Bench passed, in the pre lunch session, in the

                  first PIL, on 15.12.2014 and so was the second

                  Division       Bench       made     aware     of     the    order

                  aforementioned of the first Division Bench in the first

                  PIL; yet a dispute, relating to service matter, was

                  entertained in the second PIL by the second Division

                  Bench ignoring the law laid down by the Apex Court as

                  stands incicated above I would, accordingly, dismiss

                  I.A. No. 9327 of 2014, filed on 15.12.2014, by Shri

                  unavoidably worth pointing out that in a case, where

                  final order cannot be passed, interim order ought not

                  have been passed. If the court could not have

                  quashed the order placing Shri Kuldip Narayan under

                  suspension, the question of granting stay of such an

                  order did not arise at all. It would have been a

                  different matter, had Shri Kuldip Narayan merely laid

                  information, in the second PIL, that he was unable to

                  perform the duties assigned to him by the Court,

                  because of his suspension and, then, the Court could

                  have taken initiative to do the needful.

</p><p id="p_98">                                    37. Unbelievably, Shri Kuldip Narayan,

                  with the help of his I. A. NO. 9327 of 2014, did not

                  merely inform the Court, in second PIL, that he was

                  unable to carry out the directions of the court; rather,

                  he applied for quashing and stay of the order putting

                  him      under        suspension      pending      drawing    of

                  departmental proceeding and operation of this order

                  was stayed in the post lunch session, on 15.12.2014,

                  in the second PIL.

                  to challenge the Government‟s Resolution, dated

                  indicated hereinbefore, has alleged that in the garb of

                  his    failure      as     Commissioner,      Patna      Municipal

                  Corporation, he, for extraneous reasons and not for

                  any dereliction of his duties, has been placed under

                  suspension by the Government‟s Resolution, dated

                  12.12.2014. The accusation, so made by Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan, meant that he was inviting the Court to

                  decide nor merely the correctness and legality of the

                  suspension order, but also the motive behind the

                  issuance of the impugned Resolution placing him

                  under suspension and, in this regard, he has also

                  alleged that the impugned Resolution has been passed

                  in    collusion     with      some   influential   and   powerful

                  was, in this regard, placed on record by Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan and no name of any builder has been

                  mentioned on this aspect of the case by Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan. It remains, therefore, a mystery as to who

                  those influential and powerful builders are, though the

                  law is fairly settled that if collusion is alleged, the

                  name or names of the person or persons, who have

                  colluded, must be disclosed in the pleadings.

                  impugned Resolution; whereas the real purport and

                  motive of his suspension order can be examined, if

                  challenged, by the Central Administrative Tribunal, as

                  Shri Kuldip Narayan is an IAS Officer and, it is in a

                  rare, rather, very rare case, that the matter may,

                  would be for the Court to decide whether to allow or

                  making a grievance that his father, Shri Lalan Prasad

                  Singh, an Executive Engineer of Kankarbagh Division

                  of the Patna Municipal Corporation, was wrongly being

                  proceeded against by the Vigilance Department of the

                  lodged in this regard, a case had been registered

                  against his father. On this interlocutory application

                  filed in the second PIL, the second Division Bench

                  passed, on 09.12.2014, an interim order prohibiting

                  taking of any coercive steps against Shri Lalan Prasad

                  Singh meaning thereby that he could not have been

                  even arrested and his custodial interrogation was

                  some concern that Shri Lalan Prasad Singh chose not

                  to move the Court himself seeking any relief, much

                  less    in    the    PIL,      but   his   son   moved    the     said

                  interlocutory application and sought a personal relief

                  for his father. This, again, I find curious and not

                  permissible. No hesitation, therefore, in holding, with,

                  however, all humility and respect, that the said

                  interlocutory application, in the second PIL, was

                  wholly misconceived in law and not maintainable and I

                  aspect of the submission, I may also notice the

                  argument of Mr. Jyoti Ranjan Jha, learned counsel,

                  that the expression `Chief Justice‟, as used in Patna

                  include `Acting Chief Justice‟. I am unable to agree

                  with this argument for the simple reason that it is only

                  in absence of the Chief Justice, a puisne Judge is

                  notified to take charge and perform the functions of

                  Chief Justice and there is no restriction on the powers

</p><p id="p_117">                                    47. It is also contended by Mr. Jyoti

                  Ranjan Jha, learned counsel, that since the Full Bench

                  was constituted by the then Acting Chief Justice, the

                  Full Bench should, now, be presided over by Hon‟ble

                  the Chief Justice. This submission does not take notice

                  of the fact that a cause list is published by the order of

                  Hon‟ble the Chief Justice and it is the decision of

                  Hon‟ble the Chief Justice that these cases are listed

                  before this Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_118">                                    48. In fairness to Mr. Giri, I must notice

                  that his submission has been that the Acting Chief

                  Justice did not exercise powers under Rule 11 of

                  Chapter II of the Patna High Court Rules and there

                  being no difference of opinion between the order

                  passed in the first PIL and any order passed in the

                  second PIL, powers under Rule 1 of Chapter V of

                  Patna High Court Rules could not have been exercised.

                  He places reliance on two Division Bench decisions of

</p>
<p id="p_119">                                    49. First, I would like to notice the true
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8152 of 2013 dt.30-01-2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                       61/135</span>




                  import of the Rules aforesaid. Rule 11 of Chapter II

                  clearly gives overriding power to the Chief Justice to

                  direct any matter to be heard by a Full Bench. There is

                  no condition or limitation attached thereto. When we

                  come to Chapter V, Rule 1, it is in two parts. Firstly,

                  where a Division Bench desires and the Chief Justice

                  consents, the case shall be referred to Full Bench.

                  Secondly,       where      any      subsequent   Division   Bench

                  differs from an earlier Division Bench, then, the case

                  shall be referred for a decision to the Full Bench.

</p><p id="p_120">                                    50. Thus, Rule 11 of Chapter II is an

                  independent power of the Chief Justice , whereas, the

                  first part of Rule 1 of Chapter V is dependent upon the

                  desire of a Division Bench and consent of the Chief

                  Justice     thereto     irrespective     of   whether   there   is

                  difference of opinion or not. Such cases are well

                  known, where question of great importance is desired

                  to be decided by a larger body of Judges and the Chief

                  Justice agrees to it. The second part of Rule 1 clearly

                  predicates the situation of difference of opinion and in

                  such a situation, no consent of the Chief Justice is

                  necessary.

<p id="p_121">                                    51. In my considered view, the Rules

                  aforementioned clearly postulate the position of the

                  ultimate decision taken by the Chief Justice is an

                  administrative decision upon reference by a Division

                  Bench or even suo motu.

<p id="p_132">                                    58. Now, I may refer to the argument in

                  this regard independently made by Shri Jyoti Ranjan

                  Jha, Advocate. He argues that under the Patna High

                  Court Rules, there is Chapter XXI-CC dealing with

                  Public Interest Litigation. There being special rules for

                  PIL, the general rules would not apply. This Chapter

                  does not provide for reference to Full Bench and, as

                  such, no PIL could be referred to Full Bench. The

                  rules, relating to PIL, are not exhaustive. They touch

                  upon only certain aspects. We may refer to Rules 8

                  and 9 of this Chapter, which are quoted               hereunder

                  and they themselves                 in clear terms demolish the

                  argument of the learned counsel :

                  Bench can overrule a question of law, but cannot undo

                  inter party orders. As a proposition of law, this

                  submission is wholly correct. However, this proposition

                  of law does not apply to the facts of the present

                  proceedings as the Full Bench has been constituted to

                  consider the correctness of an approach and the cases

                  as a whole, with the proceedings therein, have been

                  placed before the Bench, so that divergence in the

                  proceedings be arrested, otherwise, a Division Bench

                  would proceed in the same matter in an opposite

                  direction of a binding precedent in relation to the

                  same person, which is a most undesirable state of

                  affairs    for   a    judicial      system.   There   has   to   be

                  Commissioner, State Government was incompetent to

                  take any disciplinary action against him, when he was

                  under the control of the Municipal Corporation, which

                  alone was competent to take any action.                Since the

                  submission so made by Mr. Giri, learned Senior

                  Counsel, relates to legality or merit of the suspension

                  order, I would consciously refrain myself from making

                  any observation on this aspect of the submissions of

                  Mr. Giri; more so, when I am clearly of the view that

                  neither     an      interlocutory     application          nor   even      a

                  substantive application, relating to service dispute,

                  could     have      been       entertained     in    a     pending        PIL

                  inasmuch as the suspension order was passed pending

                  drawing        of      disciplinary      proceedings               or      in

                  contemplation thereof and was, thus, a purely service

                  matter, unless the dispute required issuance of a writ

                  in the nature of quo warranto, which is not the case at

                  hand.

<p id="p_139">                                    62. Though, I am clearly of the view that

                  the interlocutory application, made by Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan, seeking stay and quashing of the order of his

                  suspension, was not entertainable in the second PIL,

                  yet in order not to be seen evasive, I record the

                  reasons for not accepting the contention of Mr. Y. V.

                  Giri,    learned       Senior       Counsel,        that     the        State

                  Government was not competent to take disciplinary

                  action against Shri Kuldip Narayan. These reasons are,

                  however, for the purpose of rejecting the submissions

                  so made on behalf of Shri Kuldip Narayan. No doubt,

                  the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007, if the Empowered

                  decides, the State Government is obliged to terminate

                  the appointment of such officer; yet this Section itself

                  authorizes the State Government to terminate such an

                  appointee made by it. For convenience, Section 36(7)

                  of    the    Bihar      Municipal      Act,   2007,   is   quoted

                  Counsel.      Shri    Kuldip        Narayan   was   appointed   as

                  controlling authority whereof is the State Government.

                  The disciplinary control of any officer of this cadre

                  flows from All India Service (Disciplinary and Appeal)

                  Rules, 1961, and, in particular, <a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_27">Section 3</a> thereof. That

                  power of the State Government cannot be stultified in

                  any manner and that power is an absolute power of

                  cease to be an IAS Officer. He is merely deputed, as

                  Advocate General and reject the contention as raised

                  of an appointment of IAS with the State Government

                  as a Cadre Controlling Authority and this control does

                  not cease to exist merely because an IAS Officer has

                  been appointed as a Municipal Commissioner. The

                  order, placing Sri Kuldip Narayan under suspension,

                  been issued, in this regard, to the person or persons

                  concerned; whereas no such step was taken. Far from

                  this, the order of suspension was itself stayed. If Shri

                  misappropriation of the funds of Patna Municipal

                  Corporation, could his suspension have been stayed,

                  in the second PIL, on the ground that his transfer

                  without Court‟s leave had been prohibited and his

                  suspension for alleged misconduct of fund of Patna

                  Municipal Corporation was mala fide and tantamount

                  to setting at naught the said restraint order passed in

               QUESTIONED

</p><p id="p_149">                                    67. Appearing on behalf of Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan, Mr. Y. G. Giri, learned Senior Counsel, has

                  submitted that Shri Kuldip Narayan, though a party to

                  the first PIL, relating to solid waste management, he

                  was, actually not responsible for the project and it was

                  Additional Commissioner, Patna Municipal Corporation,

                  who was the one responsible in terms of the orders

                  passed in the second PIL, relating to High rise

                  building.
</p>
<p id="p_150">                                    68.    Since      the   above   aspect   of   the

                  submission made on behalf of Shri Kuldip Narayan,

                  relates to the merit of his suspension, I would merely

                  comment that it was never brought to the notice of

                  the Court, in the first PIL, that Shri Kuldip Narayan

                  was not responsible for the project, which forms the

                  subject matter of the first PIL. Contrary thereto, Shri

                  Kuldip Narayan had all along been represented by his

                  learned Counsel and he has, in fact, entered personal

                  appearance, in the first PIL, to explain as to why the

                  project was being delayed, though the project was

                  wholly indispensable in order to do away with the

                  environmental and health hazard, which had been

                  affecting the residents of the locality in the area,

                  where the solid waste is being dumped.

</p><p id="p_151">                                    69.     Either,    therefore,    Shri   Kuldip

                  Narayan had been misleading the Court, in the first

                  PIL, all along or he is, now, trying to escape, because

                  the orders, passed in the first PIL, relating to the

                  solid waste management, indicate failure of Patna

                  Municipal Corporation and forms, according to his

                  suspension       order,        one   of   the   grounds   of   his

                  suspension inasmuch as the order of suspension

                  mentions, inter alia, that there has been failure of Shri

                  Kuldip Narayan as Commissioner, Patna Municipal

                  Corporation, in dealing with the issue of dumping of

                  solid waste.
</p>
<p id="p_152">                                    70. At the cost of repetition, it is only

                  because Mr. Y. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel,

                  vehemently argued, I have noticed these arguments

                  for its rejection; otherwise, the question of merit or

                  demerit of suspension order cannot, in my considered

                  opinion, be made a subject-matter of determination in

                  a PIL. As already held, Shri Kuldip Narayan had the

                  remedy before Central Administrative Tribunal or in a

                  separate writ, but not in PIL, by way of interlocutory

                  application.

                  as I have already noted, that he could not point out as

                  to how he was at all prejudiced by the reference to

                  Full Bench. How his writ petition was to be adversely

                  affected in any manner, he could not point out.

</p><p id="p_155">                                    72. In short, therefore, the first PIL,

                  relating to solid waste management, is not affected by

                  the present controversy and the petitioners of the first

                  PIL, relating to solid waste management, cannot raise

                  any objection to the reference being made to the Full

                  learned Counsel for the petitioner in the second PIL,

                  has not made any specific submission in this regard.

                  2015 filed in C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013. This

                  interlocutory application has been filed by Mr. Prasoon

                  Sinha, Advocate, strictly in his individual capacity. It

                  has not been filed on behalf of any of the parties to

                  the writ petition, much less on behalf of Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan or on his instructions. By this application, he

                  has sought Justice Navaniti Prasad Singh to recuse

                  from being a Member of the Full Bench and hearing

                  this matter on the ground of likelihood of bias against

                  Shri Kuldip Narayan. Once again, I would note that

                  Shri Kuldip Narayan has raised no such apprehension.

                  What      was     the    interest    of   Shri   Prasoon    Sinha,

                  Advocate, is not understood except to embarrass and

                  scandalize the Court. The Advocate General, as also

                  the    Principal     Additional      Advocate    General,    have

                  strongly opposed the said application contending that

                  it is scandalous, unbecoming for an Advocate being an

                  officer of the Court and verges on contempt. On the

                  other hand, Mr. Kumar Amitesh Chandra, learned

                  Counsel, as noted earlier, placed on record some

                  orders of different Courts in different proceedings,

                  wherein different Benches, including that of Justice V.

                  N. Sinha, had passed severe strictures against Shri

                  Kuldip      Narayan.          Mr.   Kumar    Amitesh       Chandra
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8152 of 2013 dt.30-01-2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                       78/135</span>




                  questioned the bona fide of Shri Prasson Sinha,

                  Advocate, in choosing to ignore these orders and

                  strictures, while raising the plea of likelihood of bias

                  against one Member of the Full Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_159">                                    75. Firstly, I would like to note that the

                  plea of bias or likelihood of bias is a personal plea to

                  be raised by a litigant at the earliest opportunity.

                  Here, I may specifically note that though Shri Kuldip

                  Narayan filed an interlocutory application seeking

                  personal relief for stay of his suspension order and its

                  quashment and, as noted earlier, he also filed an

                  interlocutory application questioning the legality of the

                  reference to Full Bench and was represented by the

                  learned Senior Counsel Mr. Y. V. Giri, there is,

                  nowhere, a whisper with regard to likelihood of bias as

                  against any Member constituting the Full Bench. In

                  this perspective, it is curious as to why and how Shri

                  Prasoon Sinha, as an independent Advocate, could

                  raise such a plea of likelihood of bias at all. It must be

                  remembered that an Advocate is first an officer of the

                  Court. He is never permitted to identify himself with

                  the cause or the case of any litigant. No Advocate, at

                  large, can intervene in any proceeding inter party.

                  Obviously, the interlocutory application, moved by Mr.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8152 of 2013 dt.30-01-2015

                  Prasoon Sinha, in his individual capacity, lacks bona

                  fide. As rightly submitted by learned Advocate General

                  and learned Principal Additional Advocate General, it is

                  only to scandalize and embarrass the Court so that

                  this Full Bench does not hear the matter. One must

                  remember that the PIL means a Public Interest

                  Litigation and not a personal interest litigation or a

                  publicity interest litigation. Courts cannot permit Public

                  Interest Litigation to be degenerated into either a

                  personal       interest litigation or a publicity interest

                  litigation. It is totally an unprofessional and unethical

                  conduct for a lawyer of the standing of Mr. Prasoon

                  Sinha.
</p>
<p id="p_160">                                    76. In his affidavit, Mr. Prasoon Sinha,

                  Advocate, has referred to a case, being M.J.C. No.

                  3939 of 2014, arising out of C.W.J.C. No. 23620 of

                  2013, which was filed for initiating a proceeding of

                  contempt against, inter alia, Shri Kuldip Narayan, the

                  Municipal Commissioner. Mr. Prasoon Sinha has made

                  insinuations against Justice Navaniti Prasad Singh,

                  who was dealing with the said case, noting various

                  oral observations, which, allegedly, took place during

                  the court proceedings.              Fortunately, he has annexed

                  the order passed in those proceedings (Annexure

                  RR/B). Nothing of what he has said in his affidavit is

                  borne out by the records, much less by the final order,

                  which was passed in the case. I would like to note the

                  concluding part of the order, dated 07.11.2014,

                  passed by Justice Navaniti Prasad Singh, in the

                  aforesaid C.W.J.C. No. 23620 of 2013, which reads

                  thus,

                  have been made when Shri Kuldip Narayan was the

                  Collector of the said district. How did Mr. Prasoon

                  Sinha     get    these       correspondences       has      not     been

                  disclosed by him. Who gave those papers to him is not

                  disclosed by him. They are official communications

                  from the Collector to an individual. Mr. Prasoon Sinha

                  discloses       them    to     be    based    upon    his      personal

                  knowledge        in    the     affidavit     in   support      of     the

                  application. Apart from the fact that it does not involve

                  Justice Navaniti Prasad Singh in any way, much less to

                  raise a plea of likelihood of bias, it is not even raised

                  by Shri Kuldip Narayan. All I can reply is what the

                  Supreme Court observed in the case of Ashok Kumar

                  Pandey (supra) and, in particular, paragraph 16

                  thereof in regard to such document, as quoted

                                            interesting aspect is that in the PIL,

                                            was given as to its possession. It
                                            was stated that a packet was lying
                                            on the road and when out of
                                            curiosity the petitioner opened it,

                                            he found copies of the official

</p>
<p id="p_167">                                    79. There is yet another pleading in the

                  application filed by Mr. Prasoon Sinha, Advocate. I

                  wonder from where Mr. Prasoon Sinha, Advocate, got

                  the same. It is an order passed by Justice Navaniti

                  Prasad Singh in C.W.J.C. No. 21170 of 2013, being

                  order, dated 28.11.2013, wherein upon allegations of

                  bias being made, even though not founded on facts

                  and not found to be correct, the Court recuse itself

                  from the proceedings. That order is annexed as

                  Annexure RR/G to the affidavit of Mr. Prasoon Sinha.

                  Probably, Mr. Sinha wants to use it as a binding

                  precedent on Justice Navaniti Prasad Singh. I fail to
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8152 of 2013 dt.30-01-2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                       83/135</span>




                  see what is the relevance thereof in the present

                  matter. There the petitioner, for whatever it may be

                  worth, had the courage to stand up and allege the

                  apprehension of bias. He was not stranger to the

                  proceedings, who had raised the plea. Commensurate

                  to the majesty of the Court, though Justice Navaniti

                  Prasad Singh was not bound to recuse himself, yet in

                  larger interest of justice as "Justice is not only to be

                  done but seems to be done", he recused himself. That

                  cannot      be    used     as   a   precedent.   A   warning   is

                  necessary. If such practice is allowed, then, any party

                  can choose to say anything and embarrass a Court

                  and manage to get its case transferred. That would

                  not be conducive to the judicial system. It is because

                  of this that I am constrained to observe that Shri

                  Prasoon Sinha, Advocate, failed to appreciate the

                  responsibility, which an Advocate owes to a Court. As

                  rightly submitted by the learned Advocate General, it

                  is a petition only to scandalize and embarrass the

                  Court with oblique motive verging on contempt. No

                  more words are necessary to express the anguish of

                  the Court on such a conduct of an officer of the Court.

              esteemed brother Ansari, J, I express my inability to agree

              with the same, hence, with utmost humility, proceed to

              record my own opinion in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_175">                              2. Before I consider the prayer made in I.A.

              No. 9327 of 2014, it is necessary to notice few facts.

              Present Public/Social Interest               Litigation   was filed     by

              Narendra         Mishra      asserting       that    a    multi-storeyed

              apartment/complex is being raised in an 8 ft. wide lane off

              the East Boring Canal Road, Patna. The law, however,

              requires minimum 20 ft. wide road for raising such

              apartment/complex. During hearing of the writ petition this

              Court noticed under order dated 02.07.2013 that several

              other apartment/complex, 449 in number, have also been

              raised in violation of the building bye-laws and the

              different orders passed by this Court in the case of Arun

              Kumar Mukherjee Vs. State of Bihar (C.W.J.C. No.

              2290 of 1990). Close perusal of order dated 02.07.2013

              further indicates that thereunder this Court noticed the

              order dated 15.11.1996 passed in the case of Arun

              Kumar        Mukherjee             (supra)   whereunder      this   Court

              prohibited construction of high rise apartment on roads

              less than 15 ft. wide. Notwithstanding the building bye-

              laws and the order passed in the case of Arun Kumar

              Mukherjee           (supra)         mushroom        growth   of     illegal

              apartments continued in the city of Patna over the years.

              Even after matter was brought to the notice of the Court

              complaining inertia on the part of the Patna Municipal

              Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation")

              to regulate the building activities in the city because of the

              involvement of the mighty builders‟ lobby, the apathy of

              the     Corporation       to      regulate   the   building   activities,

              construction of the high rise building, contrary to the

              in the number of apartments infracting the bye-laws

              affecting the life of the common man. The continued

              inertia of the Corporation to take action against those who,

              violating the building bye-laws, raised apartments made it

              necessary for this Court to direct the Corporation under

              order dated 02.07.2013 to proceed and take action against

              449 apartments which have already been identified as also

              to finalize the case of 771 persons to whom notice has

              been issued seeking details of the constructions raised by

              them. This Court having realized that mere issue of

              mandamus directing the Corporation to perform its legal

              duty would be futile, it decided to keep the matter pending

              and issued direction from time to time requiring the

              Corporation to report progress of the action taken against

              Court again listed the matter on 08.07.2013 at its own

              instance and observed that while finalizing the order dated

              transferred without its permission both for the purpose of

              continuity and answerability. It would, therefore, appear

              that this Court entrusted the job of enforcing the building

              bye-laws by the Corporation to Sri Narayan whose transfer

              from     the    Corporation         was       restrained    by    this    Court

              12.12.2014         that    Government             has   passed    order   for

              suspension of Sri Kuldip Narayan, Municipal Commissioner

              whereafter the Bench directed that the matter be listed on

              15.12.2014 with further direction to the State counsel to

              seek instruction in the meanwhile. In the light of the

              aforesaid direction writ case was placed before the Bench

              dealing with the same on Monday i.e. 15.12.2014 in the

              afternoon session when I.A. No. 9327 of 2014 was filed by

              Sri Kuldip Narayan, Municipal Commissioner assailing the

              resolution dated 12.12.2014 suspending him from the post

              of Municipal Commissioner. In response to the prayer

              made in the said Interlocutory Application Bench was

              informed by Principal Additional Advocate General that the

              resolution suspending Sri Kuldip Narayan was placed

              in a Public Interest Litigation suspension order of an officer

              cannot      be    assailed/       questioned.   The     Bench    hearing

              afternoon of 15.12.2014 observed that it is cognizant of

              the legal position that even if transfer of a Government

              servant is stayed by the Court, the Government servant

              can still be placed under suspension by the Disciplinary

              Authority but went on to further observe that aforesaid

              legal position is not applicable to the facts of the present

              case in the background of the order dated 02, 08.07.2013

              a precedent if it decides question of law. The only

              exceptions are principles of per incurium and sub silensio.

              It is submitted that in the absence of any point of law the

              case may not be referred before the Full Bench. It is well

              Narendra Mishra (C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013) while

              hearing Interlocutory Application No. 9327 of 2014 filed by

              Sri Kuldip Narayan is not permissible as no Coordinate

              Bench can even comment upon, let alone sit in judgment

              over the discretion exercised or interim order rendered in a

              cause or a matter before another Coordinate Bench. With

              reference to the judgment in the case of The High Court

              of Judicature at Patna Vs. Ramawatar Singh (supra) it

              is submitted that the Division Bench of this Court in the

              said case held that a bare perusal of Rules 10, 10A of

              Chapter II of the Patna High Court Rules would indicate

              that the Rules put an express bar on the powers of Hon‟ble

              the Chief Justice to do anything with regard to a pending

              matter before a Bench and submitted that while referring

              C.W.J.C. No. 20570 of 2012 for being heard by a Full

              Bench under order dated 17.12.2014 the Coordinate Bench

              ought not to have referred C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013 for

              being heard by the Full Bench along with C.W.J.C. No.

              20570 of 2012. In this connection they further pointed out

              that there is no conflict at all in the two orders passed on

              15.12.2014 in C.W.J.C. Nos. 20570 of 2012, 8152 of 2013

              and to arrest the same reference of the two matters to the

              Full Bench is necessary, as according to learned counsel

              while     granting       interim        stay   of   resolution   of   the

              Government dated 12.12.2014 placing Sri Kuldip Narayan

              under suspension the Bench under orders dated 15,

              16.12.2014 granted interim stay, reserving final orders on

              the Interlocutory Application filed by Sri Kuldip Narayan

              has itself observed that the Bench is cognizant of the legal

              position as even if transfer of a Government servant is

              stayed by the Court in Public Interest Litigation the officer

              can be placed under suspension by the Disciplinary

              Authority but the said legal position is not applicable to the

              case of Sri Kuldip Narayan as Sri Narayan was entrusted

              with the task of effective implementation of the building

              bye-laws by the Patna High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of

              2013 and to ensure such task the Bench directed the

              Government          not    to      transfer   the   present   Municipal

              Commissioner Sri Kuldip Narayan without obtaining its

              permission. It is submitted that by placing Sri Narayan

              under suspension without obtaining permission from the

              Bench the Government has nullified the entrustment made

              by the Bench to Sri Narayan in C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013

              to effectively implement the building bye-laws without

              seeking its permission and in appreciation of such fact the

              Bench proceeded to grant interim stay of suspension,

              which fact was not brought to the notice of the Coordinate

              Bench when it proceeded to observe under order dated

              15.12.2014 passed in the forenoon that suspension order

              of an officer cannot be the subject matter of Public Interest

              Litigation. Learned counsel for the petitioners in the case

              of Suresh Prasad Yadav (C.W.J.C. No. 20570 of 2012)

              additionally submitted that his consent has not been

              obtained by the Principal Additional Advocate General on

              17.12.2014 before mentioning the matter for making

              reference and that reference order dated 17.12.2014 was

              passed behind his back.

              08.07.2013 having become final inter party cannot be

              has been decided or interim order passed and not the

              08.07.2013 having been challenged before the Supreme

              Court and the challenge failed as the Special Leave to

              relates to his private rights as an individual pertaining to

              his service career. The other aspect is concerned with the

              prejudice caused to the public interest irrespective of

              private interest. In this connection, it is submitted that

              there was strong unimpeachable evidence to substantiate

              definite public interest at the time when order dated

              08.07.2013 was passed by the High Court in the matter.

              The materials on record provide vitiating element to

              protect the transfer of Sri Kuldip Narayan from the

              Corporation. It is submitted that the Division Bench passed

              an injunction order protecting transfer of Sri Kuldip

              Narayan for the purpose of continuity and answerability

              which is apparent from the subsequent orders dated

              passed in the case of Narendra Mishra (C.W.J.C. No. 8152

              of 2013). It is further submitted that since the functioning

              subject to public scrutiny              so as   to promote public

              accountability the restraint order on the transfer was

              passed by the High Court. It is submitted that the order

              dated 08.07.2013 has been affirmed by the Supreme Court

              on 25.11.2013 but the Supreme Court was pleased to

              permit the State Government to move an application for

              variation of the order dated 08.07.2013 and if the same is

              not allowed, the State may file Special Leave Petition.

              High Court to complete the disposal of the Vigilance Cases

              till 15.01.2015 and in the aforesaid background, though

              State has express power to place an I.A.S. Officer under

              suspension, the question, which is being raised for

              consideration, is whether the Municipal Commissioner an

              I.A.S. could be suspended on 12.12.2014 in wake of the

              judicial order protecting his transfer/ removal from the

              Corporation for the purpose of continuity and answerability

              in the matter of enforcing the building bye-laws. The

              power to suspend an employee is within the domain of the

              employer but in the facts and circumstances of the case

              the general principle of law of suspension will not be

              Court and without obtaining leave of the High Court he

              could not have been suspended as suspension also

              tantamounts to his removal from the Corporation.

              settled law that service dispute cannot be decided in Public

              Interest Litigation, except for the purpose of writ of quo

              warranto. Reliance in this connection is placed on the

              judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Hari Bansh

              Lal Vs. Sahodar Prasad Mahto and others (2010) 9

              Supreme Court Cases 655 but it is submitted that the

              principle of law laid down in the case of Hari Bansh Lal

              (supra) is not attracted to the case in hand as the present

              writ petition is not connected with service dispute for which

              only the aggrieved party has the locus to initiate legal

              action.      The     resolution         of    the    Government     dated

              12.12.2014 placing Sri Kuldip Narayan under suspension is

              an incidental matter and the same is amenable to judicial

              review in the present case itself. By placing Sri Kuldip

              Narayan under suspension, the State authorities have

              proceeded to nullify the operation of a judicial order, merit

              whereof can always be examined in the present Public

              Interest Litigation as thereby the State authorities have

              nullified     the     direction     of       the    High   Court   not   to

              remove/transfer Sri Narayan from the post of Municipal

              the case in hand suspension order could not have been

              insulated from judicial review even if there was no service

              dispute as the same has been passed to defeat the order

              of the High Court and the Supreme Court.

              Litigation ought not to have passed interim order staying

              resolution suspending Sri Narayan, which is in teeth of the

              observation made by the Division Bench in the forenoon.

              In case, the Coordinate Division Bench in the afternoon did

              not agree with the view taken by the earlier Division Bench

              in the forenoon on the same day it ought to have referred

              the matter to Hon‟ble the Chief Justice for constituting a

              Larger Bench but in no case should have passed interim

              order staying the resolution suspending Sri Narayan and

              continued the same on 16.12.2014 until disposal of I.A.

              No. 9327 of 2014 filed by Sri Narayan on which orders

              were reserved on the same day. According to Principal

              Additional Advocate General, the only course open to the

              subsequent Division Bench was to fall in line with the

              observations made by the earlier Division Bench or to refer

              the matter to a Larger Bench. In no case, the Coordinate

              Bench should have granted ad interim stay of the

              resolution suspending Sri Narayan. It is further submitted

              that as the two different Division Benches made/ passed

              contrary observations/ directions the State had no option

              but to request the earlier Division Bench on 17.12.2014 to

              committed criminal misappropriation of public funds in

              connection with disposed of writ petition while dealing with

              unconnected criminal revision the Supreme Court framed

              questions in Paragraph 6 of its judgment and answered in

              Paragraphs 22, 23 in view of the facts noted in Paragraph

              25 of the judgment that Judges were not free to choose

              their jurisdiction or assume jurisdiction in a case pending

              in the High Court unless the case is allotted to him or them

              by the Chief Justice. Strict compliance of this procedure is

              essential for maintaining judicial discipline and proper

              functioning of the Court. If every Judge of a High Court

              starts picking and choosing cases for disposal by him, the

              discipline in the High Court would be casualty and

              administration of justice would suffer. No legal system can

              permit machinery of the Court to collapse. Paragraph 25 of

                              1996 had not been put up along with the other
                              part-heard cases, Shethna, J., as it appears
                              from the impugned order, sent for Mr Madani
                              (the dealing officer from the Registry) to
                              explain as to why that writ petition had not
                              been placed before him. Mr Madani informed
                              him, as is noticed in the impugned order, that
                              since    the       writ   petition   had   already   been
                              disposed of it was not listed before him. The
                              learned Judge directed Mr Madani to produce
                              the original record of that writ petition which
                              was produced before him on 12-9-1997, on
                              which date the learned Judge directed that the
                              papers of (SB Civil WP No. 2949 of 1996) "be
                              kept with this case" (criminal revision petition)
                              even though there was no connection or
                              relevance between the two cases. In our
                              considered opinion Shethna, J. did not have
                              any authority, statutory or otherwise -- nor
                              was it necessary -- to call for the record of the
                              above writ petition: firstly because it stood
                              already disposed of by a Division Bench and
                              secondly because it was totally unrelated to
                              and unconnected with the criminal revision
                              petition he was to hear. Therefore, it appears
                              that the record was sent for not for mere
                              perusal but for some other purpose, not strictly
                              judicial. This becomes quite obvious from the
                              fact that while stating "brief reasons for not
                              placing Writ Petition No. 2949 of 1996" before
                              him, Shethna, J. observed:

                              become infructuous then the same statement
                              could have been made before this Court when
                              this Court treated the matter as part heard and
                              this Court would have also passed the same
                              order      provided         it      had     really    become
                              infructuous. The most interesting part of it is
                              that the matter was disposed of by Division

                                The fact situation, however, in the present

              case, is wholly different. In the special facts and different

              orders passed in the case of Narendra Mishra (C.W.J.C. No.

              8152 of 2013), it may not be appropriate to place reliance

              on the judgment in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs.

              Prakash Chand (supra) to support the present reference.

              (supra) where the Supreme Court was at a loss to

              understand how once one Division Bench of a High Court

              held a particular provision of law to be constitutional and

              not violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_34">Article 14</a>, another Division Bench could

              hold the same provision of law unconstitutional and

              violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_35">Article 14.</a> Judicial discipline demanded that

              one Division Bench of the High Court should ordinarily

              follow the judgment of another Division Bench of that High

              Court. In extraordinary cases where the latter Division

              Bench finds it difficult for stated reasons to follow the

              earlier Division Bench judgment the proper course is to

              order that the papers be laid before Hon‟ble the Chief

              Justice of the High Court for constituting a Larger Bench.

              Certainly where one Division Bench has held a statutory

              provision to be constitutional it is not open for another

              Division Bench to hold otherwise. For the aforesaid

              proposition, he also relied on the judgment of the Supreme

              the order dated 25.09.2014 passed in the said case itself,

              afternoon on the same day another Coordinate Bench in

              the case of Narendra Mishra (C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013)

              proceeded to grant interim stay of resolution placing Sri

              Narayan under suspension and to resolve the conflict

              between the two orders of the two different Coordinate

              Benches State had no option but to request the former

              Division Bench to make a reference of both the writ

              petitions and the connected Interlocutory Applications to a

              Full Bench. Aforesaid submission is wholly misconceived in

              view of the fact that the Bench dealing with the case of

              Suresh Prasad Yadav (C.W.J.C. No. 20570 of 2012) in the

              forenoon of 15.12.2014 was not informed that Sri Narayan

              was entrusted with the task of effective implementation of

              the building bye-laws within the municipal limits of Patna

              by the High Court under orders dated 02, 08.07.2013 and

              that his transfer/ removal from the Corporation is to be

              made after obtaining permission from the High Court and

              that suspension tantamounts to removing/ preventing the

              officer from discharging the task entrusted to him by the

              High Court. Had the aforesaid facts been informed to the

              Bench on 15.12.2014 in the forenoon in the case of Suresh

              Prasad Yadav (C.W.J.C. No. 20570 of 2012) there would

              not have been any occasion for the Bench to have

              observed in the said case that the suspension of an officer

              cannot be assailed in Public Interest Litigation. Reference

              of Narendra Mishra case (C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013) and

              case including I.A No. 9327 of 2014 filed by Sri Narayan to

              the Full Bench is contrary to the provisions of Rules 10,

              Suresh Prasad Yadav (C.W.J.C. No. 20570 of 2012) to

              refer the matter to a Larger Bench on the ground that

              another Coordinate Bench in the case of Narendra Mishra

              (C.W.J.C.       No.    8152          of   2013)    has    entertained    the

              which is in teeth of the observation made in the case of

              Suresh Prasad Yadav in the forenoon of 15.12.2014 and to

              arrest the conflict, it is necessary to refer the case of

              Suresh Prasad Yadav (C.W.J.C. No. 20570 of 2012),

              Narendra        Mishra       (C.W.J.C.   No.   8152   of   2013),

              Interlocutory Applications filed in both the writ cases

              including I.A. No. 9327 of 2014 filed by Sri Narayan to the

              Full Bench. In this connection, it may be pointed out that

              the Full Bench is constituted to settle a point of law and

              not to set aside the interim order as the same would

              amount to sitting in appeal over the interim order passed

              by the Division Bench, which is not permissible in the eye

              of law. The overriding power of Hon‟ble the Chief Justice

              contained in Rule 11 of the Patna High Court Rules to

              direct any application, petition, suit, appeal or reference to

              be heard by a Full Bench is with respect to those matters

              which have not yet been assigned to any Judge or Bench.

              Hon‟ble the Chief Justice being the first amongst the

              equals has administrative power to fix the roster and to

              change the same from time to time. Having assigned any

              case or application to a Judge or a Bench the same has to

              be considered in the same roster and can be referred to

              the Full Bench or any other Bench or Judge dealing with

              the said roster, the case or the application cannot be taken

              Judge without the consent of the Judge or Bench dealing

              with the roster. In this connection, I may also usefully

              refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of

              Binoy Bhushan Sahay Vs. State of Bihar (Criminal

              Appeal No. 180 of 1966) decided on 29.09.1966

              reported in Supreme Court Judgments Volume 4

              September 1966 page 234D to 234E whereunder a

              three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court has observed

              that it is for the Court hearing a proceeding to arrange its

              roster of cases for hearing the cases before it and no one

              has a right to claim that it should be disturbed. It is,

              therefore, held that while referring the case of Suresh

              Prasad Yadav to the Full Bench the case of Narendra

              Mishra (C.W.J.C. No. 8152 of 2013) and other connected

              matters ought not to have been referred to the Full Bench

              as there is neither any conflict between the two orders

              dated      15.12.2014        passed     by   two   different   Division

              Benches, one in the forenoon and another in the afternoon

              in the case of Suresh Prasad Yadav and Narendra Mishra

              respectively nor there is any special circumstance like the

              one in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Prakash

              Chand (supra) which could persuade Hon‟ble the Chief

              Justice to refer the matters to the Full Bench.

                so, I would like to add a post script.
</p>
<p id="p_216">                                 2.    No    one       has    challenged      the   legal

                proposition that in a PIL (public interest litigation and

                not personal or private interest litigation), pure service

                matter cannot be raised, except to a certain extent in

                quo warranto proceedings of PIL in nature. Service

                matters are outside the scope of PIL proceedings. Then,

                if suspension be a service matter, it cannot be impugned

                in a PIL. In quo warranto, no one challenges suspension

                but challenges appointment/holding of public office. If

                these be the positions, when no final order warranting

                quashment of suspension can be passed in a PIL, then,

                can any stay application be at all entertained? Answers

                must be in the negative. It would have been entirely a

                different fact situation, if Sri Kuldip Narayan had merely

                brought the order of suspension to the notice of the

                Court in the second PIL and pointed out that because of

                the suspension order, he is unable to comply with the

                earlier orders of the Court and, then, leaving it to the

                Court to decide as to what steps are to be taken, which

                could,      in   appropriate          case,   be   in   the   contempt

                jurisdiction but after due notice in this regard. But that

                was not to be; rather, he invited, in a PIL, the Court to

                adjudicate upon the merits of suspension order including
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8152 of 2013 dt.30-01-2015

                mala fide on the part of the Government. This surely is

                beyond the ambit of PIL. He was not remediless.

</p><p id="p_217">                                3. I. A. NO. 9094 of 2014, in CWJC No.

                8152 of 2013, is a classic example of abuse of PIL

                jurisdiction, where challenge to a criminal vigilance case

                is made, not by an officer proceeded against, but by his

                son. It is entertained with orders of no coercive action.

                Taking que from it, Sri Kuldip Narayan challenges his

                suspension, which is stayed.
</p>
<p id="p_218">                                4. Let us not permit the PIL jurisdiction to

                be degenerated and abused in this manner.

</p><p id="p_219">                                5. I would say no more on this aspect as

                Justice I.A. Ansari has dealt with this in great details.

</p><p id="p_220">                                6. Justice V. N. Sinha has elaborately dealt

                with the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice to refer cases to

                Full Bench, taking a view that the present case was not

                a case, in which he could exercise such jurisdiction. All I

                can say is first as the Apex Court has repeatedly held

                and the judgments have been noticed by Justice I.A.

                Ansari, the Chief Justice is the Master of Rosters. As

                pointed out by the Apex Court in the case of Prakash

                Chand (supra), wherein it was held that it is a complete

                fallacy to assume that a part-heard case can, under no

                circumstances, be withdrawn from the Bench and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">                                       132/135</span>




                referred to a larger Bench. This position, in my view,

                negates the aforesaid views of Justice V. N. Sinha.

</p><p id="p_221">                                7. Again in the case of Assistant Collector

                of Estate Duty (supra), the Apex Court clearly held

                that     subsequent        Division      Bench    must    follow    the

                judgment of earlier Division Bench of that High Court. In

                extra ordinary cases, where the latter Division Bench

                finds difficulty for stated reasons to follow the earlier

                Division Bench judgment, the proper course is to order

                that papers be placed before the learned Chief Justice of

                the High Court for constituting a larger Bench. Without

                going into the facts, which have already been narrated

                in the two opinions, clearly there was a divergence of

                proceedings. In the first PIL it was clearly observed that

                the suspension order of Shri Kuldip Narayan could not

                be made subject matter of challenge in PIL, whereas, for

                some reason, in the second PIL, it was thought that

                interference with the said suspension matter in PIL was

                possible. If this is not a conflict, I fail to see what is a

                conflict. The Apex Court clearly said that in such a

                situation,      the    second         Division   Bench,   instead    of

                proceeding with the matter, granting stay and then

                intending to deal with it on merits, should place the

                matter before the Chief Justice for being referred to the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8152 of 2013 dt.30-01-2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                                       133/135</span>




                larger Bench. This is not only a principle of judicial

                propriety, but of good judicial administration. If these

                two conflicting orders are seen by the public, what will

                they say about the Court. They have to follow the Court

                orders.      They     have       to   understand   the    same.   The

                predicament of the State is clear. Divergent views and

                divergent approaches in respect of the same matter are

                not conducive and this is why there is necessity to refer

                the matter to a larger Bench to arrest the divergence

                and get the unanimity.
</p>
<p id="p_222">                                8. The effect of divergent views writ large.

                The first Division Bench holds that during suspension,

                Shri Kapil Ashok would function; whereas the second

                Division Bench stays the suspension of Shri Kuldip

                Narayan effectively nullifying thereby the order of the

                first Division Bench, giving also chance to Shri Kuldip

                Narayan to enjoy stay, may be wrongly, to plead further

                that      the     departmental          proceeding,      having   not

                commenced within 45 days, the suspension stands

                revoked.
</p>
<p id="p_223">                                9. Moreover, the Patna High Court Rules, as

                in detail discussed and quoted by Justice I.A. Ansari, is

                not alone, dealing with the conflicting orders. As pointed

                out, they are in three parts. First Chapter II of the Patna

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                                       134/135</span>




                High Court Rules and, in particular, Rule 11 thereof,

                gives an over-riding independent discretionary power to

                the Chief Justice to direct any petition to be heard by a

                Full Bench. There may be no conflict of orders or

                otherwise. This is one independent source. Then Chapter

                V, Rule 1 thereof, is in two parts. First- where the

                Division Bench itself seeks a reference, it would be upon

                the Chief Justice to consent. Second- where there is

                difference between the two Division Benches, in which

                case consent of the Chief Justice is not required. These

                are three independent powers under which a matter

                may be referred by the Chief Justice to a Full Bench.

                agree with Justice V. N. Sinha that in the present case

                no reference could be made to the larger Bench and I

                agree with the views taken by Justice I. A. Ansari in

                these regards.

<p id="p_225">                                11. To conclude all I can say is that the

                dignity of the institution is above the predilection of

                individuals constituting the Court and it is for this reason

                that the principle of etiquettes has been evolved, one of

                them the Chief Justice, being the Master of Rosters, has

                over-riding rights in constituting or referring matters to

                larger     Bench      because         ultimately   it   would   be   the

                           discretion of the Court as to how one would proceed

                           with the matter, which is relevant. I as well agree with

                           the conclusions of Justice I.A. Ansari in all respect.</p><pre id="pre_16">
