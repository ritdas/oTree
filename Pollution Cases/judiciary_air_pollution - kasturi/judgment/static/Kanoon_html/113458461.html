                      submitted an application under the Export Oriented Scheme 2004-09, dated

                      15.04.2010 to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of

                      Commerce, Government of India, for setting up a recycling plastic unit for the

                      purpose of producing pet Flakes from pet bottles and pet grindings with an

                      annual capacity of 7200 Metric tonnes in the said Survey Numbers. The

                      Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, has given

                      permission on 28.04.2010 under E.O.U. scheme, with certain conditions as

                      enclosed in the annexure therein, to start the unit in the Madras Export

                      Processing Zone at Chennai. Such permission was given for a period of five

                      years from the date of commencement of production, with an option to

                      increase the same. The production was permitted to be undertaken in the

                      Customs bonded area coming within the jurisdiction of the concerned

                      Commissioner of Customs. Only after satisfying about the feasibility of the

                      Export Oriented Unit (E.O.U), the said permission was granted. There was a

                      specific provision to the effect that provisions will have to be made and the

                      Government will have to be satisfied in regard to the process hazards for

                      ensuring Plant safety. The Government of India issued a Green Card with an

                      approval to start 100% E.O.U and the Unit was entitled to top priority

                      treatment from all concerned of the Central and State Government

                      Departments and other organisations concerned in the matter. The petitioner

                      had also taken all steps to approach the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board

                      for the purpose of obtaining their requisite consent.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                             4</span>

</p><p id="p_4">                            3. It is the further case of the petitioner that the plastic recycling unit

                      by itself is a project to safeguard environment and pollution. The said pet

                      Flakes are utilised for the purposes of manufacturing textiles, garments and

                      other related products and wasted pet bottles are the raw materials for the

                      manufacture of pet Flakes. The categories of process waste and post

                      consumer waste are converted into pet Flakes through an operational section

                      and the said manufacturing process is 100% effluent free. The recycling of

                      the plastic waste material is an absolutely necessary to prevent environment

                      degradation, since the plastic materials are not bio-degradable.

</p><p id="p_5">                            4. It is also stated by the petitioner that the Unit aforesaid suffered a

                      serious setback in the year 2011 and therefore, it was unable to meet 100%

                      Export Oriented Unit obligations and the Green Card issued by the Ministry of

                      Commerce and Industries was surrendered to the Government. The petitioner

                      continued the manufacture and supply of pet Flakes to the local markets. The

                      petitioner submitted an application on 09.11.2011 to the Tamil Nadu Pollution

                      Control Board under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

                      seeking consent from the Board to continue the manufacturing process. But

                      without considering the said application, the District Environmental Engineer

                      of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Ambattur issued a show cause

                      notice stating as if there was waste water discharge from washing operators

                      without any treatment and causing water pollution. Even before the petitioner

                      could submit his explanation, the District Environmental Engineer through its

                      Assistant Engineer, conducted an inspection and without hearing the

                      petitioner, issued an order on 02.01.2012 stating that the Unit is situated in

                      catchment area, which is restricted for development under the Development

                      Control Rules and Regulations as notified by the CMDA and rejected the

                      application. The petitioner sent a reply to the aforesaid proceedings bringing

                      to the notice of the District Environmental Engineer of the Tamil Nadu

                      Pollution Control Board stating that the order is barred by the Government

                      Order in G.O.No.127, Environment and Forest (EC-III), dated 08.05.1988 and

                      the petitioner also brought to his notice that appropriate STB Plant will be set

                      up shortly. It was also brought to the notice of the concerned authority that

                      approval for the site was obtained from the Government of India, Ministry of

                      Commerce and Industries and only thereafter, production was started after

                      approval.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                             5. It is further stated by the petitioner that he filed appeal in Appeal

                      Nos.30 and 31 of 2012 before the concerned Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu

                      Pollution Control Board, under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_3">Section 28</a> of the Water (Prevention and

                      <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, which are still pending. In the aforesaid appeals, the

                      Pollution Control Board sought for a direction from the Appellate Authority

                      directing the petitioner to put an effluent treatment plant and the same had

                      also been recorded in the order of the Appellate Tribunal, dated 25.07.2013

                      and at the relevant point of time, the effluent treatment plant was already set

                      up by the petitioner after incurring cost of Rs.30 lakhs. Thereafter, the

                      officials of the District Environmental Office inspected the plant and at the

                      relevant point of time, the petitioner's unit was not given any notice. The

                      petitioner states that there was no generation of process effluent nor waste

                      water and the plant was also set up as per global standards. The aforesaid

                      facts have been intimated to the Appellate Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                             6. The petitioner further adds that the said appeals were argued at

                      length before the Appellate Authority during the month of April 2018, at which

                      time, it was brought to the notice of the Tribunal that various industrial units

                      in the Alamathi and Sholavaram area have approached this Court in

                      W.P.Nos.18388, 18396, 18400, 18997 of 2018 seeking for a direction from

                      the State Government and the CMDA for the purpose of de-reserving the

                      areas, apart from the catchment area from the Second Master Plan of the

                      Chennai Metropolitan Area 2026 (Development Regulations) and also as per

                      Section 38(b) of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act. The

                      Appellate Authority during the course of arguments, had observed that the

                      power/scope of the appeal is limited and it may not be in a position to issue

                      any direction to the Government for classifying the petitioner's land as an

                      "industrial area", though the said area is no way connected with the

                      catchment area as contended by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.

                      Government on 30.06.2018 stating that the unit of the petitioner was

                      originally a 100% E.O.U. and presently, it is catering to the local markets after

                      surrendering the Green Card and the unit has set up an effluent plant and

                      there is no discharge of waste in and around the unit. The petitioner also

                      brought to the notice of the Government about the order passed by this Court

                      in a batch of Writ Petitions referred to above, dated 27.09.2016 in the matter

                      of B.T.Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., Vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others, in which this

                      Court has directed the Government to consider the representation of the

                      aforesaid unit(s) after affording an opportunity to them and also taking into

                      consideration the parameters of the ecological damage. The aforesaid

                      representation had been acknowledged by the Government, but till date, the

                      same had not been disposed of, nor the petitioner had been given an

                      opportunity to put forth his case.

<p id="p_9">                             8. It is the further stand of the petitioner that he is still operating the

                      recycling plant and there are adjoining units in and around the area where

                      there are commercial establishments including colleges and other residential

                      units. The Chennai-Thiruvallur High Road clearly demarcates the petitioner's

                      land and the catchment area which is more than 500 meters from the unit

                      where they are recycling the plastic bottles. The petitioner has also set up

                      STP plant and there is no discharge of effluents as alleged by the Pollution

                      Control Board. The petitioner reiterates that the Unit is not all situated in the

                      catchment area and if so, it had been wrongly classified. The concerned

                      authority of the Government has not considered the said representation of the

                      petitioner till date and there is also no response from the CMDA. The claim of

                      the petitioner for the purpose of re-classification of his lands for which the

                      Government had granted patta, may be considered by the Government and

                      other authorities. It is the further claim of the petitioner that the patta lands

                      can never be considered as areas comprising the catchment area which is in a

                      different Survey Number. The petitioner had invested huge amount of Rs.1

                      crore to set up the unit, and therefore, appropriate direction may be given by

                      the State Government, though the Central Government through the Ministry

                      of Industries and Commerce, had already granted permission to start 100%

                      E.O.U. Hence, for all these reasons, the petitioner has filed the present Writ

                      Petition for the relief stated supra.
