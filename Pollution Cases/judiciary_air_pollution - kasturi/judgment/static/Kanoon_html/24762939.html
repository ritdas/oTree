</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Complainants have filed this complaint against the opposite

parties under <a href="/doc/1749394/" id="a_2">Section 17</a> of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for

short 'the Act'), on the averments that opposite parties had

launched a Shopping Complex Project under the name and style of

City Heart inside NH-21, Chandigarh-Kharar Road, Kharar. The

complainants had visited opposite party No.1 on the basis of

advertisements, pictures shown in various advertisements.                    The

complainants wanted to establish their shop for earning their

livelihood and considering the demonstration made by the opposite

parties in their brochure or otherwise complainants agreed to

purchase the commercial showroom No.84/B measuring 16x66 sq.

ft. 1056 sq.ft. on 1st floor and buyer's agreement was executed

between the complainants and opposite parties on 28.04.2015 and

the total sale price was settled as Rs.52,05,100/-. At the time of

execution of the agreement opposite parties had not provided the

necessary         documents          i.e.    necessary   permission   from   the

Government or other authorities. The complainants and opposite

party No.1 entered into another agreement i.e. Unit Buyer Option

Agreement Assured Return Plan on 04.05.2015 for providing

assured return at the rate of 12.5% per annum on the sum of

Rs.36,00,000/- received by them i.e. Rs.37,500/- per month till offer

of possession or 24 months whichever is earlier. The complainants

had made the payment of Rs.40,12,500/- upto 31.03.2016. After

adding the sum of Rs.37,500/- which was due from the opposite

parties, the complainants have paid a sum of Rs.44,62,500/-. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Consumer Complaint No. 289 of 2017                                       3</span>



project was to be completed within 21 months period. However,

opposite party No.1 wrote a letter dated 16.09.2016, which

contains a maintenance agreement to show that the possession of

the shop has been given to the complainants but the said

agreement is neither signed by the complainant nor they have

taken the possession of the shop in question. There is another

letter dated 21.11.2016, vide which opposite party No.1 had

demanded the amount within 15 days without making reference to

any particular amount stating that since your unit is ready for

possession and in case the payment is not made within 15 days,

booking will be cancelled, therefore, opposite parties appear to be

in confusion. The complainant visited many times to the office of

the opposite parties for getting the possession of the shop after

developing the market with infrastructure but opposite parties could

not give any satisfactory reply. Even, opposite party No.1 could not

get completion certificate from PUDA/GMADA i.e. opposite party

No.2. Alleging deficiency in service on the part of the opposite

parties, this complaint has been filed by the complainant seeking

directions against the opposite parties to direct the opposite party

to refund the amount of Rs.44,62,500/- alongwith interest at the

rate of 18% p.a. from the date of respective payments; to pay a

sum       of    Rs.5,00,000/-        as   compensation   for   unnecessary

harassment and mental tension and agony and other sufferings

and Rs.55,000/- as litigation expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.               Upon notice, opposite party No.1 appeared and filed its

reply by taking preliminary objections that the complaint is not

maintainable for want of territorial jurisdiction; the complainants

have concealed the material facts and have tried to play fraud with

the Hon'ble Court by projecting wrong facts. It was denied that the

project was not approved by GMADA/PUDA.                     Vide letter dated

12.05.2015 a technical approval of building control sheets, by

Executive Officer, M.C. Kharar was issued. Consent under <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_3">Section

25</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and

under <a href="/doc/1485003/" id="a_5">Section 21</a> of Air(Prevention &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_6">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981

was accorded by Punjab Pollution Control Board was accorded on

04.09.2014. M.C., Kharar vide letter dated 17.07.2014 approved

Solid Waste Management of OPs. NOC dated 20.08.2014 was

issued by Highway Administrator-cum-Executive Engineer Central

Works       Division,       Mohali.   Permission   Letter   of   CLU   dated

29.01.2014 under PAPRA.                 Letter dated 27.08.2014 of Co-

ordinates, Height and Distance from Nearest Airport issued by

Survey of India, Vide letter dated 15.07.2014, NOC was issued by

Executive Officer, Central Works Division, Mohali. The complaint is

bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties. The M.C.

Kharar is the authority, whereas the project does not fall within the

purview of opposite party No.2 and that opposite party No.2 has

been wrongly impleaded by the complainants. The entire market

has already been completed.               The complaint is barred by the

principle of estoppel. The agreement was executed between the

complainant and opposite party No.1 and that SBP group was the

main party did not survive; as per clause 22 of the agreement, the

allottee is entitled for cancellation of the allotment within a period of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Consumer Complaint No. 289 of 2017                                           5</span>



six months of the allotment and that there is an arbitration clause

and in case of any dispute, the matter is to be referred to the

Arbitrator as provided under the agreement. On merits, launching

of the project of opposite party No.1 is matter of record. It was

denied that the complainants wanted to establish their shop for

earning their livelihood. Basically, they do agree to get this shop

for resale and asked the value of resale of the shop being resident

of Delhi. The shop in question was ready in the month of August,

2016 and it was intimated by opposite party No.1 to the

complainants          vide      registered   letter   dated   16.09.2016   and

17.09.2016. The complainants did not come forward to take the

possession. Other averments of the complaint were denied. It was

denied that there is any deficiency in service or unfair trade

practice on the part of opposite party No.1. Complaint is without

merit, it be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.               On the other side, opposite party No.2 filed its written

reply and took preliminary objections that there is no relationship of

consumer and service provider between the complainants and this

opposite party, therefore, there is no locus standi to file the

complaint against this opposite party. The complaint is bad for mis-

joinder and non-joinder of the necessary parties and that Municipal

Council, Kharar is the necessary party. It has been stated that the

allegations of deficiency in service is against opposite party No.1

as the area falls within the municipal limits of Municipal Committee,

Kharar and as per the notification dated 24.06.2010 issued by the

Government of Punjab, Department of Housing and Urban
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Consumer Complaint No. 289 of 2017                                             6</span>



Development, Regional Deputy Director, Local Government,

Patiala is the competent authority under Section 2(1) of the Punjab

Apartment and Property Regulation Act, 1995 for the area falling

within the municipal limits of Municipal Committee, Kharar. Other

averments were denied. Therefore, there is no merit in the

complaint filed by the complainant against this opposite party. It is

without merit, it be dismissed.

</p>
<p id="p_5">5.               We have heard the counsel for the parties and have

carefully gone through the averments as alleged in the complaint,

evidence, written reply and documents filed by the parties.

</p><p id="p_6">6.               Counsel for opposite party No.1 has taken the plea that

this Commission does not have the territorial jurisdiction to

entertain the complaint. It is clear from the complainant that the

shop was to be built in the shopping complex under the name and

style of 'City Heart', Chandigarh-Kharar Road, Kharar, which is a

part of District S.A.S. Nagar, Mohali, which falls within the territorial

jurisdiction of this Commission. Therefore, we do not agree with

the plea raised by the counsel for opposite party No.1 that this

Commission does not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain

this complaint.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Consumer Complaint No. 289 of 2017                                     8</span><p id="p_7">



</p><p id="p_8">7.               Another objection taken by the counsel for opposite

party No.1 that there is an arbitration clause under the agreement,

therefore, the matter is required to be referred to the arbitrator. No

doubt that there is an arbitration clause in the agreement. In case,

opposite party No.1 was interested to refer it to the arbitrator then it

should have moved an application under <a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_7">Section 8</a> of the

Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_8">Conciliation Act</a> but no such application was moved

by opposite party No.1. Further, under <a href="/doc/1202608/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> of the Consumer

Protection Act, an additional remedy has been provided for

entertaining of the complaint before the Consumer Fora, therefore,

under <a href="/doc/1202608/" id="a_10">Section 3</a> of the Consumer Protection Act complaint is

maintainable before this Commission. Therefore, we do not with

the plea raised by the counsel for the opposite parties that

Arbitration clause is there, therefore, consumer complaint before

this Commission is not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.               Although, no specific objection has been taken by the

counsel for opposite party No.1 in the written statement but in the

oral arguments, it has been submitted by him that the complainant

is not a consumer. He further argued that it is a legal preposition,

even if, no specific objection has been taken by the counsel for

opposite party No.1 in its written reply, the Commission is also

under obligation to check it whether the complainant comes within

the definition of consumer. No doubt that no specific plea has been

taken by opposite party No.1 to say that the complainant is not a

consumer but it is also the duty of the Commission to check it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Consumer Complaint No. 289 of 2017                                     9</span>



whether the complainant is consumer or not.           The definition of

consumer under <a href="/doc/1820593/" id="a_11">Section 2(1)(d)(ii)</a> is as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "[hires or avails of] any services for a consideration which has
        been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or
        under any system of deferred payment and includes any
        beneficiary of such services other than the person who [hires
        or avails of] the services for consideration paid or promised,
        or partly paid and partly promised, or under any stream of
        deferred payment, when such services are availed of with the
        approval of first mentioned person [but does not include a
        person who avails of such services for any commercial
        purpose];
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 [Explanation - For the purposes of this clause,
        "commercial purpose" does not include use by a person of
        goods bought and used by him and services availed by him
        exclusively for the purposes of earning his livelihood by
        means of self-employment;]


</blockquote><p id="p_10">9.               In case, we go through the contents of the complaint,

the complainant booked a shop in the shopping complex to be

constructed by opposite party No.1, therefore, certainly it is a

commercial property and commercial shop has been excluded from

the jurisdiction of the Consumer Fora except in the circumstances

as referred in the explanation.       In that circumstance, in case a

commercial property is to be used by the complainants to earn their

livelihood by way of self-employment then consumer complaint with

regard to the commercial property is also maintainable. It has been

so observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment

reported in 2016(3) R.C.R. (Civil) 924 titled as "<a href="/doc/102310204/" id="a_12">Bunga Daniel

Babu v. M/s Sri Vasudeva Constructions</a>",               wherein it was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> Consumer Complaint No. 289 of 2017                                10</span>



observed that consumer means any person who hires or avails of

any services for a consideration, but does not include a person who

avails of such services for any commercial purpose" does not

include a person who avails of such services for any commercial

purpose and the "commercial purpose" does not include services

availed by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood

by means of self-employment." Therefore, even according to this

judgment in case of commercial purpose then the services might

have been taken for the purposes of earning livelihood by means of

self-employment. In case, we go through the complaint filed by the

complainants in para No.3 of the complaint, it has been referred

that the complainants wanted to establish their shop for earning

their livelihood and further in para No.8, it has been referred that

the complainants invested the amount for opening a showroom for

earning their livelihood and objection has been taken by opposite

party No.1 that the word self-employment is not there. No doubt

that in the explanation under <a href="/doc/1820593/" id="a_13">Section 2(1)(d)(ii)</a> the word self-

employment is not there but in case the word self-employment has

not been specifically used then we are to check it what is the

intention of the complainants in the complaint, whether the wording

used in the complaint establishes that he wanted to purchase this

shop for self-employment. This legislature has been introduced for

the welfare of the consumer and sometimes the consumer may not

be alive of the specific wording used in the Act and the complaint

cannot be dismissed only on the ground that specific word self-

employment has not been mentioned, then it will be too technical.

In case we go through the language used by the complainant in

para No.3 and 8 of the complaint, it has been stated in para No.3

that complainants wanted to establish their shop and in para no.8

to open a showroom to earn their livelihood. Therefore, the broad

meaning of these wordings indicate that they wanted to establish

their shop for self-employment. The opposite parties have not led

any evidence to say that they are already in business and that this

shop is not required to the complainants to establish their own shop

to the complainants to establish their own business by way of self-

employment. Therefore, in the absence of any contrary evidence

on behalf of the opposite parties, the plea taken by the

complainants in the complaint can be accepted. Therefore, we are

of the opinion that this shop was booked by the complainants to

earn their livelihood by way of establishing their own shop for self-

employment and in completes the ingredients as referred in

explanation to <a href="/doc/1820593/" id="a_14">Section 2(1)(d)(ii)</a> of the Act. Therefore, we do not

agree with the plea raised by the counsel for opposite party No.1

that complainants are not covered under the definition of the

consumer as defined under the Act.

had booked one shop with opposite party No.1 for a total costs of

Rs.52,05,100/- and Buyer's agreement was executed between the

could not deliver the possession to the complainants within the

agreed time.            On 04.05.2015, Unit Buyer Option Agreement

Assured Return Plan was executed between the complainants and

opposite parties in which it has been referred that the sum of

Rs.52,05,100/- is the basic sale consideration of Unit No.84-B on

First Floor and according to term No.2 of the terms and conditions

it has been referred that the allottee has paid the above said

amount on the assurance by the developer to provide him an

assured return of 12.5% on received amount of Rs.36,00,000/- till

the offer of possession or 24 months whichever is earlier i.e.

Rs37,500/- per month and complainants have placed on record the

receipts from May, 2015 to March, 2016, vide which the sum of

Rs.37,500/- per month has been shown paid to the complainant

which is shown as interest for the project 'City Heart', therefore,

apart from the other payment made by the complainants a sum of

Rs.4,12,000/-was adjusted in the account of the complainants on

account of this payment.

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">        NOTES

        Bar of section 4. - A few provisions of the Act may be noticed. The Act
        was published in the Gazette on August 9, 1995. In Section 1(3), it was
        provided that the Act "shall come into force on such date as the State
        Government may by notification in the official Gazette, appoint and
        different dates may be appointed for different areas of the State." Vide
        notification dated October 13, 1995, the Act was enforced with effect
        from October 15,1995 in the whole of the State of Punjab. Under
        Section 4, it has been inter alia provided that' 'no promoter shall issue
        an advertisement or prospectus, offering for sale any apartment or plot,
        or inviting persons who intend to take such apartments or plots to make
        advances or deposits, unless (a) the promoter holds a certificate of
        registration under sub-section (2) of Section 21 and its number is
        mentioned in the advertisement or prospectus " By Section 21(1), it was
        provided that" from such date as may be fixed by the State
        Government, by notification in the official Gazette in this behalf, no
        person shall carry on the business of promoter or estate agent, or
        represent or hold himself out as carrying on such business, except
        under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the certificate
        of registration granted under this Act." Clause (2) provides for the
        submission of an application for registration as a promoter or as an
        estate agent alongwith the prescribed fee on the prescribed form. It is,
        thus, clear that the provision for registration of promoters and estate
        agents was to become operative from a date to be fixed by the State
        Government by notification in the official Gazette. The application had
        to be submitted on a prescribed form. The prescribed fee had also to be
        deposited. It is only thereafter that the bar under Section 4 could
        become operative.

        Act. - Prior to the promulgation of this Act, the provisions of Punjab
        Regulation of colonies Act 1975 were in force. Even under those
        provisions, a person was debarred from setting up a colony except after
        compliance thereof. However, by section 46, the provisions of the 1975
        Act were replead. On the promulgation of the 1995 Act, the provisions
        of the 1975 Act were no longer in force. Thereafter, it had become
        incumbent on a person to get himself registered in view of the
        provisions of Sect ion 21. The date in this behalf was fixed as
        November 30, 1995 vide notification dated November 10, 1995. The
        application for registration had to be made on the prescribed form. The
        form had to be prescribed under the rules. The rules were also
        promulgated on November 23,1995. Thus there was a hiatus in the
        intervening period. It was during this interval when the 1975 Act did not
        exist and the provisions of 1995 Act regarding registration as a
        promoter were not in force that the advertisements had been issued by
        the petitioner. It was dec1ared by the High Court that the
        advertisements did not violative the provisions of the 1995 Act."

<p id="p_14">12.              According to these Sections before launching the

Scheme, the builder is required to make full disclosure of the name

and title and authorized sanctions from the Government or other

competent authorities and only then advertisement can be given

and applications can be invited. In the present case, the allotment

letter was issued on 28.04.2015, whereas, according to the

documents placed on record by opposite party No.1 as Ex.OP-1/1

the Technical Approval of Building Control Sheets of City Heart

Commercial Town Planning Scheme, Kharar issued by Municipal

Council, Kharar written to opposite party No.1 on 12.05.2015,

therefore, opposite party No.1 issued the allotment letter even

before obtaining clearance of the project by the competent

authority. He has further referred to another document as Ex.OP-

1/4 issued by Highway Administrator-cum-Executive Engineer,

Central Works Division, Mohali for grant of provisional NOC for

grant of permission for approval of passage on Mohali-Roopnagar

Road National Highway No.21 (205) for Commercial Complex of

M/s Sky City Builders &amp; Promoters Pvt. Ltd. and according to

Clause No.1, it has been referred that final approval shall only be

given after construction work is completed that you will construct

access as per approved drawing at your own cost within 6 months

from the issue of provisional NOC, otherwise action as per clause

11 of MORT&amp;H guidelines would be taken. However, counsel for

the opposite party No.1 has not placed on record that he

constructed access from this road to its township according to the

approved drawings and after constructing it within a period of six

months from the issuance of this letter i.e. 20.08.2014. He was to

apply for final approval but no drawing has been placed on the

record, whether the road has been constructed by opposite party

No.1 as per approved layout plan. However, according to Clause

VI of the letter issued by Regional Deputy Director-cum-Competent

Authority, Local Govt. Patiala that Promoter shall obtain NOC from

PPCB under the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,

permission from the Forest Department, Govt. of India under <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_16">Forest

Clause XII promoter shall make provision of rainwater harvesting

within the project area at its own cost and under the Notice, Note

No.13 says that before getting the CLU, no booking or

advertisement shall be done by the promoter. No CLU containing

the terms and conditions have been placed on the record. There is

no evidence with regard to getting the permission from the Forest

Department under the <a href="/doc/654536/" id="a_17">Forest Act</a>, 1980. There is no evidence of

by the opposite parties. Then the information was taken by the

complainants under the RTI (Ex.C-10) i.e. Letter from Municipal

Council, Kharar dated 09.11.2017, wherein it has been referred

that till date no completion certificate has been issued in favour of

opposite party No.1 with regard to the completion of the project. In

case opposite party No.1 has failed to complete the project within

the specific time and to handover the possession, it amounts to

deficiency in service and complainants are entitled to withdraw

from the scheme. A reference can be made to the judgment

reported in 2017(1) CPR 168 (NC) titled as "<a href="/doc/144934684/" id="a_18">Sanjay Kumar v.

Sahara Prime City Limited &amp; Ors</a>.", wherein it was held that

allottee is entitled to withdraw from the scheme in the event of

delay in completion of that project.
</p>
<p id="p_15">13.              Now, we are to check it that how much amount was

deposited by the complainants with opposite party No.1. In para

No.6 of the complaint, it has been referred that the complainants

have made a payment of Rs.40,12,500/- till 31.03.2016. There are

three receipts Ex.C-5, Ex.C-5A, Ex.C-5B, Ex.C-5C and Ex.C-5D.

According to it a sum of Rs.36,00,000/- has been paid and further

the affidavit of complainant shows that the sum of Rs.36,00,000/-

has been paid by the complainants. Similarly, reference is given in

the agreement. Ex.C-4 is the Unit Buyers Option Agreement. No

other evidence has been placed on record that the sum of

Rs.40,12,500/- has been paid by the complainants to opposite

party No.1.           A sum of Rs.4,12,000/- has been paid to the

be given then in that eventuality, it is to be decided whether interest

will be paid on the deposited amount or the complainants will be

entitled to the interest or the assured return received by them from

the OPs. Certainly, the complainants will be entitled to interest on

the deposited amount and not on the amount received as assured

income from the OPs. In case, the project was not completed within

the specific time then the complainants are entitled for refund and

in case refund then interest at the rate of 12% interest is to be paid,

it has been so provided under Rule 17 of PAPRA Rules, 1995,

which reads as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">        "17. Rate of Interest on refund of advance money upon

        cancellation of agreement. - The promoter shall refund full

        amount collected from the prospective buyers under sub-

        receipt of amount so collected till the date of re-payment."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">                 Therefore, in case on the deposited amount, we allow

12% interest then they will not be entitled to the interest in case

payment for the assured return of Rs.37,500/- per month has been

received by the complainant.

<p id="p_16">14.              No other point has been raised by the counsel for the

parties.

<p id="p_17">15.              Sequel to the above, we are of the opinion that there is

amount as demanded by the opposite party No.1 from time to time.
