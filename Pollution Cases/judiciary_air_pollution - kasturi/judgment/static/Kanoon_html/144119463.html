                                JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Common issue based on common factual matrix posed for

consideration in these writ petitions.                    Therefore, they were

heard jointly and are being disposed of by this common

judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. The 2nd respondent Municipal Corporation prepared a

detailed project report for the Integrated Solid Waste

Management System in Thrissur. The initial project under the

system is the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project

(KSUD project). While steps for its implementation was

underway one Dr. Pathiyoor Gopinth who is a faculty of Kerala

Agricultural University submitted another project report. After

much deliberations it was decided to accept and implement the

project proposed by Dr. Pathiyoor Gopinath and accordingly,

Government directed the Corporation to execute an agreement

with the Agricultural University after accepting the University

as its implementing agency and appointing said Dr. Pathiyoor

Gopinath as its implementing officer. In the meanwhile WP(C)

No.21217/09 was instituted as a Public Interest Litigation for

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                    2</span>

providing basic amenities and emergent medical relief to the

pollution ridden people of Laloor area within the Thrissur

Corporation. In the said writ petition, this court appointed a

mediator/conciliator to resolve apprehension of the local public.

The mediator/conciliator after due deliberation filed a report

before this court on 27.02.2010.       The said writ petition was

heard and disposed of by a Division Bench of this Court as per

judgment dated 17.01.2011. I will deal with the same a little

later.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. WP(C) No. 32451/2010 has been filed by one of the

members of the Merchant Association in Thrissur, who is

conducting a dry fish shop in stall No.109 of non-vegetarian

market situated in the Sakthan Thampuran Nagar. It is prayed

in the said writ petition for issuance of writ of mandamus

commanding the 2nd respondent Corporation not to proceed with

the construction of the waste treatment plant in the proposed

area, viz. in Sakthan Thampuran Nagar, and also for a

declaration to the effect that the 2nd respondent is not entitled to

change the nature of the land notified as parking place for the

vehicle coming to the Municipal market and further, that the 2nd

respondent, Corporation is not entitled to construct any building

or treatment plant in the heart of the city without obtaining

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                   3</span>

proper authority and consent from the Pollution Control Board

in a manner causing nuisance and posing health hazards to the

general public and for such other reliefs. The latter writ petition

has been filed by a resident of the Thrissur Corporation alleging

illegality in the manner in which respondents are planing

implementation of garbage disposal under the scheme proposed

by the aforesaid Dr.R. Pathiyoor Gopinath        who is the co-

ordinator of the Laloor Model Waste Disposal Scheme. In the

said writ petition it is mainly prayed for issuance of a writ of

mandamus commanding the respondents 1 to 3 namely the

Secretary of the Thrissur Corporation, the Thrissur Corporation

and the Kerala State Pollution Control Board not to implement

Exhibit P1 scheme without sanction or consent from the 4th

respondent under the Water(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a> and Air(Prevention and Control of Pollution)Act. It is further

prayed for issuance of writ of mandamus commanding the 3rd

respondent not to use the six places mentioned in Exhibit P1

scheme for disposal of waste without a notification under Section

331 of the Municipality Act and to direct the Corporation to

conduct a public hearing, i.e., affording an opportunity to the

residents including the petitioner to object to the issuance of

such notification before actually issuing such a notification. It is

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                     4</span>

also prayed thereunder for issuance of a writ of mandamus

commanding the 3rd respondent Corporation not to notify under

<a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_2">Section 331</a> of Municipalities Act       the places mentioned in

Exhibit P1 as places for disposal of solid waste without taking

into consideration the health and environmental impact of such

notification.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. In the former writ petition a counter affidavit has been

filed by the second respondent, Thrissur Municipal Corporation.

Along with the same a copy of the project namely Laloor Model

for Solid Waste Management (for short LAMPS) was also

produced. Exhibit R2(f) mentions the six places proposed for

setting up the project. It includes Sakthan Thampuran Nagar as

well. In fact the former writ petition is concerned only with the

proposal to setting up project in Sakthan Thampuran Nagar. In

the latter writ petition, in fact, the challenge is against setting

up of plants, in terms of the projects in question, at in all the

six places mentioned in Exhibit P1 scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. I may now deal with        the contentions in WP(C) No.

32451/02. It is contended that as per Exhibit P1 notification

dated 03.03.1983 the proposed place in Sakthan Thampuran

Nagar has been notified as a parking place for the motor vehicles

coming to the market. That apart, it is contended, in the light of

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                    5</span>

Ext.P1 and the provisions under Section 331 of the Kerala

Municipalities Act (for short 'the Act'), that every Municipality

shall have to identify and notify suitable lands within or outside

the municipal area for the purpose of final disposal of waste and,

in the absence of a re-notification the place earmarked for

parking in terms of Exhibit P1 cannot be made use for the

purpose of setting up the project. It is further submitted, relying

on the submission made in the affidavit filed by the 3rd

respondent, the Environmental Engineer of the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board, that the permission/consent from the

Pollution Control Board has not so far been obtained for the

purpose of setting up of the plant in question.      The sum and

substance of the contentions in the said writ petition is that

setting up a Plant in terms of schemes would, ultimately, work

out detrimental to the people as it is     without considering the

viability of setting up such a plant in Sakthan Thampuran Nagar

which situates in the heart of the city, that the respondents are

taking steps to set up a plant there.    In short the contention is

that Sakthan Thampuran Nagar shall not be permitted as a place

to set up any plant under any of the three projects available to

the Thrissur Corporation. According to the petitioner already

there is a bio-gas plant in the place in question and on account of

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                      6</span>

the improper attention on the part of the respondents, it is not

functioning, now.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. The main contention in the latter writ petition is that in

the absence of a notification, in terms of the provisions under

<a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_3">Section 331</a> of the Municipalities Act, the respondents are not

entitled to set up any plant in any of the six places. In fact, such

a contention has been made without any special reference to any

of the above places mentioned in Exhibit P1. However, it is

contended that the places proposed by Corporation for setting

up of plants are not suitable for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7. In the context of the rival contentions raised in these writ

petitions it is relevant to refer to the decision of a Division Bench

of this Court in WP(C) No. 21217/09. As already noticed herein

before the said writ petition filed as public interest litigation

mainly with the prayers for providing basic amenities and

emergent medical relief to the pollution ridden people of Laloor

area within the Thrissur Corporation.        That writ petition was

filed in the backdrop of an incident that took place in July, 2009.

During the said period torrential rain resulted in accidental

outflow of water from the existing Laloor water dumping yard

and it awashed the nearby residences. The nearby wells were

got contaminated.         Evidently, after considering the rival

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                   7</span>

contentions the Division Bench as per the judgment dated

17.1.2011 directed respondents 1 to 3 therein to ensure

implementation of all the projects namely LAMPS, KSUD project

and the proposals made by the conciliator. In fact, the project

namely LAMPS got the approval from the Government and

virtually as per order dated 14.05.2010 the Government ordered

to execute an agreement with the University, recognizing the

University as its implementing agency and appointing the

aforesaid Pathiyoor Gopinath as its implementing officer. As per

order dated 26.08.2010 Government accorded sanction to the

Corporation to transfer 10% of the allotted amount viz.9.40

crores to      Agricultural University as first installment to

implement the project.     Later in terms of the directions of the

Government, the Corporation had signed an agreement with the

Kerala Agricultural University, accepting the University as

implementing agency of Laloor Model Project for Solid Waste

Management (LAMPS) and appointing Dr.Pathiyoor Gopinath as

its implementing officer on 28.8.2010. It is the said project that

is produced by the respondents as Exhibit R2(f). Further, it is

evident from the said judgment that Thrissur Corporation has

already transferred 94 lakhs from the ADB Fund received by

them for implementing KSUD project to the Kerala Agricultural

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                  8</span>

University as the first installment on 28.08.2010. In paragraph

11 of the judgment dated 17.1.2011 it is stated thus: "Having

scanned the materials placed on record and considered the

submissions addressed at the Bar, we are convinced that the

Thrissur Corporation and the State Government are acting in

earnestness to contain the serious problem which have arisen

over decades in Laloor and other parts of the Thrissur

Corporation resulting from absence of scientific method for

disposal of waste and garbage.       The said writ petition was

disposed of by the Division Bench as per judgment dated

17.1.2011 with certain specific directions.   Respondents 1, 2,

and 3 therein viz., Secretary of Thrissur Corporation, District

Collector and the Secretary of Local Self Government

Department were directed to ensure that Annexure VI project

(Exhibit R2(f) herein) produced by the Corporation of Thrissur

along with their action taken report dated 09.11.2010 is

implemented without fail in the manner proposed therein subject

to orders already passed by the Government in the context of

that report. Further, they were directed to ensure that KSUD

project of additional 7th respondent Suchithwa Mission is also

implemented to the extent it did not conflict with the Laloor

project. They are also directed to implement the proposals made

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                    9</span>

by the conciliator appointed by this Court to the extent

necessary in the light of Laloor Project and KSUD project". It is

thus obvious that for the purpose of solid waste disposal, 3

projects have been prepared namely KSUD, LAMPS and the

proposals of the mediator/conciliator. As per the judgment dated

17.1.2011     the Division Bench directed respondents 1 to 3

therein to ensure their implementation in terms of the judgment.

Thus it is evident that after considering all aspects of the matter

the Division Bench issued directions to the three authorities

referred above to ensure implementation of R2(f) project which

is produced in the former writ petition as Exhibit R2(f) without

fail and in the manner proposed therein and subject to the

orders already passed by the Government. When that be the

case, I have no hesitation to hold that the petitioners cannot be

heard to contend against the implementation of the said projects.

In short, the prayer to restrain the Corporation from setting up

of or taking steps for implementation of the scheme under

Exhibit R2(f) is      unsustainable.  In fact, going by the said

judgment, the Corporation is bound to implement the same. In

the light of the said judgment, the respondents are bound to

ensure implementation of all the three projects in the manner it

is directed as per the said judgment. However, the question to

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                    10</span>

be decided in these writ petitions is whether as part of

implementation of the said projects Plants could be permitted to

be set up at the six places including at Sakthan Thampuran

Nagar, as identified by the 2nd respondent Corporation.

</p><p id="p_8">      8. The learned counsel for the petitioner in WP(C) No.

32451/10 submitted that in troth, the petitioner is not against

the implementation of the three projects whilst his grievance is

against the choice of the places especially, Sakthan Thampuran

Nagar, for setting up the plants as part of the implementation of

the projects, that too, in total disregard to the prescribed

procedures. According to the petitioner, in view of the fact that

as per Exhibit P1 notification dt.03.03.1983 Sakthan Thampuran

Nagar, was already been notified as a parking place in the

absence of a re-notification, in terms of the provisions under

Section 331 of the Kerala Municipalities Act, the said place

cannot be used for the purpose of setting up of a plant as part of

implementation of the projects. It is in that context, that a

contention has been taken up in WP(C) 3827/11, that without

issuing a notification in terms of Section 331 of the Kerala

Municipalities Act, no place could be identified or used for final

disposal of waste.       According to the petitioners in these writ

petitions, in respect of the six places referred to in Exhibit R2(f)

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                      11</span>

no notification has been hither to, issued in terms of Section 331

of the Kerala Municipalities Act.       The learned counsel for the

petitioner, further submitted that in the light of the statements

made in the counter affidavit filed by the 3rd respondent Sakthan

Thampuran Nagar cannot be said to be suitable for setting up of

such a plant. The 3rd respondent filed a counter affidavit on

11.11.2010 in the former writ petition. Respondents 7 and 8

have also filed a joint counter affidavit on 13.12.2010 in the said

writ petition. In the counter affidavit filed by the respondents 7

and 8 it is stated thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      " It is further submitted that the Pollution Control Board

      has already granted Authorization (as reported by the

      Corporation of Thrissur) to establish the Integrated Solid

      Waste Management System, including a processing plant

      at the project site at Laloor. Further, once the plant to be

      set up at the Sakthan Thampuran Nagar market is

      designed and finalized, the Thrissur Corporation will move

      the Pollution Control Board for Authorization for the

      amended plan".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">It would definitely suggest that as regards the plant to be set up

at Sakthan Thampuran Nagar market, the Thrissur Corporation

is yet to receive authorization from the Pollution Control Board.

In that context, it is relevant to refer to Rule 6 of the Municipal

Solid Wastes (Management and handling) Rules, 2000.                A

scanning of the provision thereunder would reveal that the

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                   12</span>

Central Pollution Control Board and the State Board or the

Committees are having certain responsibilities for the purpose of

setting up waste processing and disposal facility. The municipal

authority or an operator of a facility is bound to submit an

application to the State Board or the Committee and on its

receipt the Board or the Committee is bound to examine the

proposal before the issuing authorization.          Sub rule (4)

thereunder would reveal that an authorization issued would be

valid only for a given period and after expiry of its validity a

fresh authorization it to be obtain. Thus, a perusal of Rule 6 of

the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,

2000 would reveal that an authorization from the State Board or

the Committee of the Pollution Control Board is required for

setting up of waste project process/disposal facility by

Management Authority. That apart, as already noticed in terms

of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_4">Section 331</a> of the Act place for final disposal of waste has not

only to be identified but also to be notified. In the counter

affidavit by respondents 7 and 8 it is further stated:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "It is submitted that the waste water treatment plant is

     the proposal stage and the Municipal Corporation will

     have to seek consent from the Kerala State Pollution

     Control Board as per rule and without which it cannot be

     established"</blockquote><p id="p_10">

view that the contentions of the petitioners that an authorization

from the Pollution Control Board and a notification identifying

the places are required for the purpose of setting up of the plant

cannot be said to be bereft of basis. In that context it is also

relevant to refer to the stand taken by the respondents.              In

categorical terms, the respondents have stated that it would be

implemented only after getting all the requisite permits and

consent, as required under the relevant rules. In other words,

going by the stand taken by the respondents it is evident that

they would establish the Integral Solid Waste Management

System including process plant at the project site, only after

obtaining the requisite consent, permits and license, therefor. In

fact, it is so specifically stated in the counter affidavit filed by the

2nd respondent Thrissur Corporation and also in the counter

affidavit filed by the additional respondents 7 and 8. In the light

of the said specific statements made in the said counter

affidavits filed by the respondents, I am of the view that there is

no reason for nursing any apprehension that the plants would be

established without adhering to the provisions of law and

procedures. It is also to be noted, in the context of the

contentions, that in the light of the judgment of the Division

Bench referred above in WP(C) No.21217/2009 the respondents

 WP (C) Nos. 32451 of 2010
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> &amp; 3827 of 2011                  14</span>

are bound to implement the project referred therein, namely

KSUD project, LAMPS and the proposals made by the

mediator/conciliator in accordance with the directions therein.

The petitioners cannot be heard to contend that they shall not be

implemented. Therefore, the only question is whether plants in

implementation of such projects could be established without

obtaining the requisite consent, permits or license and without

issuing the requisite notifications in terms of the provisions

under the <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_5">Municipalities Act</a>. Nobody has a case that the said

judgment gave any such right or liberty to the respondents.

Therefore, there can be no doubt that all the mandatory

provisions and procedures have to be complied with while

implementing the projects and for that purpose while

establishing the plants. As already stated, the respondents in

their respective counter affidavits, have stated in unambiguous

terms that      the projects would be implemented only after

obtaining the requisite consent, license and only after complying

with all the formalities required under law. When that be the

position, I think that the respondents cannot be restrained from

pursuing further for the implementation of the three projects

named above, in terms of the direction in WP(C) No. 21217/09

dated 17.01.2011 and in accordance with the relevant provisions

of law and procedures.

<p id="p_12">     10. In view of the directions of the Division Bench in the

said Writ Petition and also considering the importance and

inevitable requirement the respondents are bound to take

appropriate steps, in furtherance of the said directions in tune

with the provisions and procedures, expeditiously.
