14666, 2090, 2520, 2730 and 2580 of 2002, as common

question of law and facts are involved in these cases. For brevity,

the facts are being taken from C.W.P No.15242 of 2001.

[2]        The petitioners are partnership or proprietorship firms,

most of whom had been running stone crushers in the area of

Pallinangla and Anangpur in District Faridabad. They had statedly

established their stone crushers during the years 1970-1980.

[3]        As the stone crushers run by the petitioners were

found to be causing air pollution or environment degradation, the

Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 15.05.1992 passed in a

PIL filed by Mr. M. C. Mehta, Advocate, issued the following

directions (relevant extracts only:

          our orders. This exercise should be completed

          and plots offered to the stone crushers within a

          period of six months from today. The Director,

          Town     and      Country     Planning    Department,

          Haryana, Chandigarh, is further directed to send

          a progress report to the Registry of this Court

          before July 31, 1992 in this respect".



</blockquote><p id="p_11">[4]        In view of the categoric direction that no stone crusher

shall operate in the subject area from August 15, 1952 onwards,

the Chief Administrator, Faridabad Complex Administration vide

his memo     dated 19.05.1992     (Annexure P-3) directed      the

petitioners "to stop functioning and operating the stone

crushers with immediate effect        and any failure will also

be treated as a contempt of the order of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India".
</p>
<p id="p_12">[5]         It may further be noticed from direction No.7

reproduced above, that the Hon'ble Supreme Court was apprised

of a new crushing zone carried out by the Town and Country

Planning Department, Haryana to rehabilitate the existing stone

crushers, who were ordered to be closed down. The Apex Court

further directed that in case the authorities were required to

acquire additional land in/or the area of crushing zone, that shall

also be done so that all these stone crushers could be set up in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> C.W.P NO. 15242 OF 2001                                 -6-</span>



the crushing zone. The petitioners' case is that a list of more than

100 stone crushers, who were to be uprooted in compliance to

the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, was prepared

and their names also figured in the said list.

[6]        Meanwhile, the Faridabad Complex Administration

appears to have issued an advertisement in the daily newspapers

inviting applications from the stone-crushers to enlist them for

the purpose of allotment of plots in the new crushing zone. The

applicants were required to deposit 20% of the tentative cost

amounting to Rs.11.40 lacs along with their applications. The

petitioners were allegedly not in a position to arrange the said

amount. They requested the authorities that instead of depositing

20% of the tentative cost at the time of registration only, they

were ready to deposit 70% of the tentative cost at the time of

allotment of the land. However, some of the stone-crushers, who

were in a position to pay 20% of the tentative cost at the time of

registration, were finally allotted the plots in the year 1994.

[7]        It may be clarified that there are two sets of

petitioners before this Court. The first group belongs to those

who were forced to close down their stone crushing units in

compliance to the order dated 15.05.1992 passed by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. The others are those who are now required to

shift their units in terms of the notification dated December 18,

1997, whereby the siting parameters have been changed.

under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_4">Section 5</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 read

with the powers conferred upon vide Government of India,

Ministry of Environment and Forest, Department of Environment's

notification dated 10.02.1988, notified new siting-parameters on

December 18, 1997 and also identified the new zones to make

available sites to the stone crushers who were to be uprooted for

their failure to fulfill the prescribed siting-parameters. Schedule-

IV of the notification laid down the procedure for establishment

and operation of the stone crushing units in the identified zones.

Paragraphs 1 to 2.2 thereof being relevant are reproduced below:

        previous location anywhere in Haryana. But no

           he criteria as specified in para 2.1 above".



</blockquote><p id="p_13">[9]        The petitioners who were the existing stone crushing

units and most of them had been ordered to be closed down in

compliance to the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, were to be given first priority in the matter of allotment of

sites in the newly carved out zones as provided in Clause 2.1 of

the Schedule IV of the Notification. The others are those who

have been affected by the newly prescribed siting-parameters

and were required to shift to the notified/prescribed crushing-

zone and are entitled to have second priority in terms of Clause

2.2 of Schedule-IV of the Notification, as reproduced above.

[10]       In order to implement the notification dated December

18, 1997, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board issued an

advertisement, commencing on 24.08.2001 whereby applications

were   invited    for   allotment   of   stone    crushing   sites   (each

measuring one acre) at the notified stone crushing-zones in

District Faridabad. Clause 5 of the advertisement stipulated that

"allotment of the plots shall be governed by the provisions

contained    in     the   Haryana        Government,     Environment

Department Gaz. Notification dated December18, 1997

and Rules/Regulations framed thereunder and amended

from time to time". Nevertheless, the Pollution Control Board

also inserted Clause 9 which reads as follows :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           "9.    The     applicants       will    submit     complete

           applications and shall be interviewed by the

           Committee constituted for the purpose. The

           decision of the committee for allotment of the

           plot shall be final".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">

</blockquote><p id="p_14">[11]       Apprehending that notwithstanding their entitlement

for allotment on priority basis, as provided in paras 2.1 and 2.2

of the notification dated December 18, 1997, they might be

deprived of the allotments on the pretext of poor performance in

'interview by the Committee', that the petitioners have

approached this Court by way of these writ petitions.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> C.W.P NO. 15242 OF 2001                                 -11-</span>



[12]       Notice of motion was issued and as an interim

measure, the respondents were directed to keep one plot

reserved for each petitioner. The respondents have filed their

respective counter-affidavits.
</p>
<p id="p_15">[13]       The solitary question that arises for consideration is as

to whether or not the respondents are entitled to 'interview' the

petitioners for the purpose of determining their eligibility for

allotment of the stone crushing sites ?
</p>
<p id="p_16">[14]       So far as the first set of petitioners is concerned, there

is indeed no dispute that they were asked to close down their

stone crushing units under the orders dated 15.05.1992 passed

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and were required to be

rehabilitated in the new crushing zone setup for such closed

units. There is a clear mandate in direction no.7 of the Supreme

Court order that even if there was insufficient land in the new

crushing-zone developed by the Town and Country Planning

Department, Haryana, the respondents were obligated to acquire

more land to accommodate all such stone crushers. It would

necessarily mean that the respondents had no discretion but to

allot a site to the first set of the petitioners who were admittedly

close down under the orders of Hon'ble Supreme Court. The

holding of an interview by the Committee for the purposes of

determining their eligibility or suitability is, therefore, an empty

formality and an exercise in futility. It is a contumacious attempt

by the Executive to frustrate the relief to which they were entitled
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> C.W.P NO. 15242 OF 2001                                 -12-</span>



to be given under the orders of the Apex Court. This shall,

however, would not preclude the respondents from imposing

lawful terms and conditions of the allotment like that the allotted

land shall be utilized for the purpose of running a stone crusher

unit only or that an allottee shall ensure that its unit causes no

pollution or abide by the payment schedule, if any, etc.

[15]       It is true that the petitioners in the first set of cases

did not avail the opportunity of allotment offered to them in the

year 1992, but to their own dis-advantages only. There is a

substantial difference in the 1992 allotment price as compared to

the revised price of the year 2001. The sites of two crushing

zones are also different. Their stone-crushers have also remained

defunct for a longer period. Besides this, the notification dated

18.12.1997 is statutory in character and it does not contemplate

any discretion in the matter of allotment provided that an

applicant fulfills the eligibility criteria. The said   notification

confers first priority in allotments to the stone-crushers like the

petitioners of the first set of cases.   Clause 9 of the impugned

advertisement, thus, not only violates the mandate of the Apex

Court, it also runs contrary to the spirit of the notification dated

18.12.1997 and is accordingly quashed qua those stone-crushers

who have been closed down under the orders dated 15.05.1992

passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_17">[16]       Adverting to the second set of petitioners,namely,

those running units who have been or to be closed down due to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> C.W.P NO. 15242 OF 2001                                    -13-</span>



the changes in siting parameters made vide notification dated

18.12.1997, I am of the considered view that the Clause 9 of the

advertisement dated 24.10.2001, as such, cannot be invoked in

their cases also provided that they are found eligible. The

interview can be for the limited purpose of verifying as to

whether or not their existing stone crushing units are liable to be

closed down due to changes in the siting-parameters and they fall

within the ambit of paragraph 2.2 of the Schedule IV of the

notification dated December 18, 1997. Once the respondents are

satisfied that the petitioners in the second set of cases are those

stone crushing units who have been closed down or are liable to

be shifted due to changed siting norms,, they also cannot be

deprived of the allotment on the pretext of any so called

unsuitability which the Interviewers might observe. In other

words, the Interviewing Committee would be entitled to satisfy

itself with regard to the eligibility only may be through the

documents attached with the application forms or by way of an

interview.
</p>
<p id="p_18">[17]           Consequently, it is directed that in the cases of second

set of the     petitioners, the interview, if any, shall be held for the

limited purpose of ascertaining their eligibility and not the

suitability.
</p>
<p id="p_19">[18]           For the reasons and the terms stated above,        these

writ petitions are allowed and the respondents are accordingly

directed to allot the plots to the petitioners within a period of

three months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this

order.
