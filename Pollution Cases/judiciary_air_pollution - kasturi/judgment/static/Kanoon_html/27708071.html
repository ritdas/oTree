<p id="p_18">2.   The constitutionality, legality and correctness of the above

notification has been challenged by the applicants [Applications No.

26/2013(THC) and 53/2013(THC)]. The challenge to the notification is

based on the factual premise and grounds as stated hereinafter.

Jarnail   Singh   and   Karnail   Singh    claim   to   be   engaged   in

manufacture and supply of virgin polythene bags which are not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                        4</span>
 recycled ones, virgin/natural food grade HM, LLDPE, LDPE poly

bags, plastic sheets, plastic rolls and all kinds of industrial

packaging material under the name and style of M/s Goodwill

Plastic Industries. According to the applicants, they do not deal

with recycled plastic/polythene. They are carrying on the activity of

manufacture and supply of the same in the UT of Chandigarh,

States of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and even in some

other parts of the country. The products manufactured by them

strictly comply with the specifications and thickness standards, as

laid down in the relevant rules and/or notifications. Further, it is

the case of the applicants that they established this industry after

taking loan and availing credit limits for working capital from

different financial institutions. The applicants as well as the

workers under them are dependent upon this industry for their

livelihood. Besides, they are also registered with the Chandigarh

Pollution Control Committee for manufacture of plastic bags and

containers. They are manufacturing virgin polythene bags of

thickness not less than 30 microns and of size not less than 8"x

12". They were granted the consent in terms of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Section 25(4)</a> of the

Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (for short the

"<a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_8">Water Act</a>") and <a href="/doc/64492593/" id="a_9">Section 21(4)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_10">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (for short the "<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_11">Air Act</a>"). According to the

applicants, they are carrying on their business strictly in terms of

the consent orders and have not violated the same ever. The plastic

manufacture,    sale   and   usage   is   governed   by   the   Plastic

Manufacture, Sale and Usage Rules, 1999, as amended in 2003,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                      5</span>
 which bars manufacture, stocking, distribution, sale, etc. of virgin

or recycled plastic bags of dimension less than 8" x 12" and

thickness of 20 microns. These rules do not ban the production,

sale and use of polythene bags. On 10th February, 1992, the

Chandigarh Administration issued a notification under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_12">Section 5</a> of

the Environment Act providing that the thickness of the polythene

bags shall not be less than 30 microns while maintaining the same

size i.e. not less than   8" x 12". This continued for a number of

years and on 6th December, 2005, the Chandigarh Administration

issued a draft notification proposing a total ban on the manufacture

and use of polythene/plastic carry bags. Various objections to the

draft notification were filed and it had been brought to the notice of

the authorities concerned that the solution to the pollution

resulting from littering of plastic bags lay in proper collection,

segregation and safe disposal of polythene bags and not in banning

manufacture, sale and use of polythene carry bags. Referring to the

Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh's activity to set up Sehaj Safai

Kendra, it was stated that civic agencies are unable to handle and

dispose of solid waste including casual carry bags effectively which

results in the sewerage system being choked besides the same

being detrimental to the health of animals due to consumption of

such polythene bags. Objections were also raised that the general

public would be deprived of reusable polythene like plastic bags and

a complete ban on which is bound to produce negative results and

implications like unemployment, hurting entrepreneurs, etc.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                     6</span>
</p><p id="p_19"> 3.   The Administration of UT of Chandigarh, after considering

these objections, found them without substance, primarily on the

ground that human health, animal life and environmental concerns

are of much greater value than the economic interests addressed by

the applicants. It is the case of the applicants that the Chandigarh

Administration, contrary to its earlier stand based on proper

analysis, that the solution to the pollution caused from littering of

plastic bags lies in proper collection, segregation and safe disposal

of the same and not by imposing a complete ban, issued the

notification dated 11th February, 2008 proposing to completely ban

the manufacture and use of polythene carry bags in the UT of

Chandigarh and invited objections in regard to the same. Various

objections thereto were filed. Jarnail Singh along with Karnail Singh

filed the Writ Petition No. 6098 of 2008 challenging the draft

notification before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at

Chandigarh. However, this writ petition was withdrawn with liberty

to challenge the final notification, as and when published. On 30 th

July, 2008, the Chandigarh Administration issued the final

notification imposing a complete ban on manufacture and use of

polythene carry bags in the UT of Chandigarh.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">4.   Both these applicants filed another writ petition before the

same High Court challenging the final notification vide Writ Petition

No. 15230 of 2008 praying for a direction to the respondents to

discharge their statutory duties under the Municipal Solid Wastes

(Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 (for short the "MSW

Rules").

</p><p id="p_23"> 5.    During the pendency of this Writ Petition, the MSW Rules

were amended in 2011. In fact the Plastic Waste (Management and

        use of plastic 'carry bags' is irrational and discriminatory. Also

        the ban has been imposed only in the UT of Chandigarh vide

        the notification dated 30th July, 2008 while no such ban has

 public interest, and is therefore, clearly permissible and protected

under <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_13">Article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution of India. The business and

commercial interests of a few manufactures cannot be allowed to

operate to the detriment of the public at large, especially where

interest of the future generations is involved. The main problem

with plastic bags is that after being sold, they normally end up as

trash whereupon they either come back to the landfill or are burnt.

Either of these is a very poor solution for the environment and

burning the plastic results in emission of toxic gases that harm the

environment      and    increase      the   level    of   Volatile      organic

compounds (VOCs) in the air. Plastic bags litter all around. They

are non-bio-degradable and thus stay in the environment for a very

long time. It results into a major problem of uncontrollable littering,

thereby leading to unhygienic conditions and environmental

pollution. The coloured plastic is even more harmful in all these

aspects. The plastic is reused in one form or the other which even

makes it environmentally more serious and vulnerable. According to

the respondents, studies have shown that there are very few plants

that actually recycle plastic bags and most of the public authorities

either   burn    them    or    send     them    to    the    landfill     sites.

Environmentally, cloth bags are a better alternative and are even

becoming    an    attractive    proposition         among    environmental

supporters. The plastic/polythene carry bags result in blockage of

drains, pipelines and are even life threatening for the animals who

eat them along with other wastes.

</p><p id="p_31"> 10. According to the respondents, in the draft notification No.

ED/2008/125 dated 11th February, 2008, complete reasons have

been given by the Chandigarh Administration for the proposed

imposition of the ban and the ban imposed ultimately is in

consonance with <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_14">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act. The partial ban

earlier permitting the restricted use of micro plastic bags had failed

to achieve the desired results. The protective and ameliorated

impact of the impugned ban on environment, especially in the long

term and the relative importance and efficacy of the ban from the

perspective of sustainable development cannot be disputed. In order

to prevent environmental hazards, there was a need to adopt

dynamic environmental protective measures and the same had been

taken by virtue of imposition of the ban in question. The earlier

restrictions and regulatory measures imposed on the usage of

plastic bags have not achieved the desired results and a complete

ban on such bags had become inescapable and inevitable. To

prevent environmental degradation, it is the duty of the authorities

to adopt highly dynamic, yet appropriate measures, evolved with

experience and continuously responding and adapting to the felt

necessities of time, at the same time. Such duty is imposed upon

the Government authorities concerned in terms of Articles 48-A, 51-

A(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India. The issuance of the Rules

dated 4th February, 2011, superseding the earlier Rules of 1999 in

relation to plastic bags is not disputed by the respondents.

However, it is stated that the Rules of 2011 were not intended to

tinker with or lift the ban imposed by the notification of 30th July,

 with regard to its legality and effect. The power under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_17">Section 5</a> of

the   Environment   Act   states   that   notwithstanding   anything

contained in any other law, however, subject to the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_18">Environment Act</a>, the Central Government is vested with the power

to issue directions to any person, officer or authority, including

directions of closure, prohibition or regulation of any industrial

operation or process, and stoppage or regulation of supply of

electricity or water or other services to such industry. Such

directions can be prohibitory or preventive in their content and

effect. The Explanation to <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_19">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act is

inclusive of the powers of wide amplitude that are vested in the

authority. The power to issue directions, as contemplated under

<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_20">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act, is to achieve a different object

and is not a supervisory or a regulatory power, as are contemplated

under <a href="/doc/1122072/" id="a_21">Sections 18</a> and <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_22">20A</a> of the Water Act and the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_23">Air Act</a>

respectively. The power to issue directions is not equitable to the

powers vested in the respective authorities for permitting the

carrying on of a business. By issuance of appropriate directions, it

is primarily to prevent environmental hazards. In other words,

<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_24">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act relates to the role of the Central

Government where any environmental hazard has occurred or is

apprehended to occur as a result of any polluting activity through

an industrial activity, operation or process. Such direction can be

issued to any person, authority or officer who shall be bound to

comply with the same.

Environment Act is polluter centric. These powers could be

exercised   by   invoking        precautionary     principle,    polluter-pays

principle or could even be prohibitory where the situation so

demands.    In   the    present     case,   the    contention     of   the   UT

Administration is that they had conducted studies and tried various

other   measures       despite    which     they   failed   to   control     the

environmental hazards resulting from the manufacture and sale of

plastic carry bags, which resulted in issuance of the above

notification, has merits. The closure, prohibition or regulation

referred to in Explanation to <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_26">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act is

relatable to an industrial activity, operation or process raising

environmental issues or hazards. It is in exercise of this power that

the notification dated 30th July, 2008 has been issued by the

competent authority. On the other hand, the scheme under

<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_27">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_28">6</a> and <a href="/doc/31045844/" id="a_29">25</a> of the Environment Act is distinct. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_30">The

Environment Act</a> has been enacted with the object of protection and

3(1)</a> of the Environment Act vests the Central Government with

powers to take all such measures as may be necessary or expedient

for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the

environment and preventing, controlling and abating environmental

inclusiveness provided in such generic powers contained under

<a href="/doc/105902756/" id="a_34">Section 3(1)</a> of the Environment Act besides laying down standards

for the quality of environment, procedures and safeguards for

prevention of accidents, laying down procedures and safeguards for

handling of hazardous substances, establishment or recognition of

environmental laboratories, laying down standards for emission or

discharge of environmental pollutants from various sources, and

importantly planning and execution of nation-wide programmes for

prevention, control and abatement of environmental pollution.

<a href="/doc/48644524/" id="a_35">Section 6</a> of the Environment Act concerns itself with the power of

the Central Government to make rules in regard to all matters as

stipulated in <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_36">Sections 3</a> of the Environment Act. <a href="/doc/31576994/" id="a_37">Section 6(2)</a> of the

 with the principal statute and cannot run contra thereto.        These

rules were framed in supersession of 1999 Rules and were intended

to provide parameters for regulating the production, manufacture,

etc. of various plastic/polythene products. In terms of Rule 2 of the

Rules of 2011, the provisions of Rules 5 and 8 of the Rules of 2011

shall not apply to the manufacture of carry bags exclusively for

export purposes. 'Carry bags' means all plastic bags used to carry

commodities including self-carrying features.       'Plastic' has been

defined to mean material which contains as an essential ingredient,

a high polymer and which at some stage in its processing into

finished products can be shaped by flow. 'Plastic waste' means any

plastic product such as carry bag pouches or multi-layered plastic

pouch or sachet etc. which have been discarded after use or after

their intended life is over. The 'virgin plastic' means plastic material

which has not been subjected to use earlier and has also not been

blended with scrap or waste.

<p id="p_44">
</p><p id="p_45">17. Rule 5 of the Rules of 2011 spells out the conditions which are

to be observed during the course of manufacture, stacking,

distribution, sale and use of carry bags and sachets. In terms of

Rule 5 (c), no person shall manufacture, stack or distribute any

carry bags made of virgin or recycled or compostable plastic which

is less than 40 microns in thickness.       This very rule emphasizes

certain other conditions in relation to the use of plastic sachets and

other packets for different articles specifying different standards.

Rule 9 of the Rules of 2011 deals with registration of manufacturers

and recyclers. Under Rule 9 (c) of the Rules of 2011, no person

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                      17</span>
 shall manufacture plastic carry bags or recycled plastic bags or

multi-layered plastic pouch or sachet without obtaining the

registration certificate from the SPCB or PCC, as the case may be,

prior to the commencement of production.       The scheme of these

rules is that a person who wishes to commence or enter into the

field of manufacture, storage, sale of multi-layered plastics, plastic

carry bags has to get registered and upon registration, the

production, sale and storage of such material shall be regulated by

the various provisions as afore-indicated.     If a person does not

obtain registration in terms of Rule 9(c) of the Rules of 2011, such

person then, cannot carry on any of these activities. This rule thus,

states conditions that are precedent to the carrying on of such

business. In consonance with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_47">Environment

Act</a> all these provisions of the Rules of 2011 specify regulatory

measures, compliance to which is essential for the grant of

registration in terms of these Rules. In contra-distinction to this,

the directions issued under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_48">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act are

primarily mandatory and are intended not only to act as a

regulatory measure but also as preventive and prohibitory measure.

found to apprehend environmental hazards, the directions to the

the directions contemplated under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_50">Section 5</a> of the Environment

Act, as contained in the notification dated 30th July, 2008 operate

in distinct and independent fields. There is no conflict between the

two.   The directions may come into play only when the first phase

of grant of registration and permission to carrying on of such

activity has been completed. These provisions are not in conflict

with each other but are complimentary and supplementary to each

other. Both of them aid/re-enforce the principal object of the Act,

i.e. protection and improvement of the environment.

the citizen to practise any profession or carry on any occupation,

free of restrictions or limitations. Normally the restrictions can be in

two different forms - one is by way of reasonable restrictions to

which the right is made subject to by the Constitution itself, while

the other would be by virtue of law that may be enacted by the

State. The State is competent to make laws relating to the

professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any

profession or carrying on of any occupation, trade or business. The

requirement is that such restriction has to be reasonable and must

be as a result of the law enacted by the State. The right to carry on

trade is thus not an absolute right but is a conditional right and is

subject to such restrictions as may be placed. The Rules of 2011

tax not mentioned in either of these Lists. List II (State List) also

does not contain any specific entry in relation to environment but

for Entry 6 of the said List which deals with public health and

sanitation; hospitals and dispensaries. It may be useful to notice

here that in terms of <a href="/doc/745615/" id="a_57">Article 243W</a> of the Constitution relating to

powers, authority and responsibilities of Municipalities, etc. under

Entry 6 of the 12th Schedule to the Constitution, subjects of public

health, sanitation, conservancy and solid waste management are

specified. <a href="/doc/745615/" id="a_58">Article 243W</a> of the Constitution deals with the powers,

authority and responsibilities of municipalities and subject to the

provisions of the Constitution, the legislature of a State, may by

law, endow the municipalities with such powers and authority as

may be necessary to enable them to perform the functions and

responsibilities in relation to the matters specified in the 12th

Schedule.

air, water, soil, forests, even plants, human beings, micro-

of the law void or invalid, then alone the court may exercise such

discretion. This brings us to analyse what are the essentials of a

law being declared void on account of repugnancy under the

Constitution.   The Supreme Court of India, in the case of <a href="/doc/1214980/" id="a_60">Rajiv

Sarin and Another v. State of Uttarakhand and Others</a> (supra), while

referring to the judgment of the Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1716282/" id="a_61">M. Karunanidhi

v. Union of India</a> [1979 (3) SCC 431] spelt out the conditions which

are required to be satisfied before an Act could fall on the ground of

repugnancy within the rigours of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_62">Article 254</a> of the Constitution.

The Court held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">     "45. For repugnancy under <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_63">Article 254</a> of the Constitution,
     there is a twin requirement, which is to be fulfilled: firstly,
     there has to be a "repugnancy" between a Central and <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_64">State
     Act</a>; and secondly, the Presidential assent has to be held as
     being non-existent. The test for determining such
     repugnancy is indeed to find out the dominant intention of
     the both legislations and whether such dominant intentions
     of both the legislations are alike or different. To put it simply,
     a provision in one legislation in order to give effect to its
     dominant purpose may incidentally be on the same subject
     as covered by the provision of the other legislation, but such
     partial or incidental coverage of the same area in a different
     context and to achieve a different purpose does not attract
     the doctrine of repugnancy. In nutshell, in order to attract
     the doctrine of repugnancy, both the legislations must be
     substantially on the same subject.

<p id="p_56">23. If we apply the doctrine of pith and substance to the present

case, it is evident that firstly the two notifications, viz. the

notification issued by UT Chandigarh dated 30th July, 2008 and the

Rules of 2011 do not cover exactly the same field and also their

substance and spirit is quite distinct and different. Not only this,

the very object to be achieved under these two notifications is

discernible from the very basis on which such notifications have

been issued. The notification of 30th July, 2008 just deals with the

banning of manufacture, storage, sale and use of plastic carry bags

in the interest of the environment while the Rules of 2011 are

general in their nature and permit the carrying on of a business of

manufacturing, storing and selling of various plastic and polythene

items and the conditions which are required to be satisfied before

commencement and continuation of such business. We are unable

to see any conflict or inconsistency between the two notifications,

much less a clear and direct inconsistency between the two. As

already indicated, these two notifications are operating in different

fields with different objects and implications.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                       24</span>
</p><p id="p_57"> 24. Even, for the sake of argument, we assume that there is some

inconsistency between the two notifications, then it further has to

be satisfied that the inconsistency is absolutely irreconcilable and it

is impossible to obey one without disobeying the other. None of

these ingredients are satisfied in the present case. They can safely

be harmonised and construed together and in fact permitted to

operate in their respective fields without causing any conflict or

contradiction. One regulates the conduct of the business which has

to be performed in a licensed manner within the limitations

imposed by the regulations while the other is a preventive or

prohibitory direction in the interest of the environment and the

public at large. One deals with the private business interest while

the other with larger public interest. The Rules of 2011 can

continue to operate for manufacture, sale and usage of other

plastic/polythene items except for polythene carry bags banned

under the notification of 30th July, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">25. Now we may examine another aspect of this case which is

most fundamental as to whether the provisions of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_71">Article 254</a> of the

Constitution are at all attracted in the present case. We have

already indicated that there is no entry in either of the Lists which

specifically deals with the subject of environment per se. All the

legislations on environment have been enacted by the Union

Parliament, obviously with the aid of fields specified under Entry

No.97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_72">The Environment Act</a> is one

of such legislations which has been enacted by the Union

Parliament. With the powers vested under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_73">Section 5</a> of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                     25</span>
 <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_74">Environment Act</a> and as delegated vide notification of 1992, the UT

Administration has exercised its power and issued the notification

dated 30th July, 2008 banning the manufacture, sale, storage and

use etc. of plastic polythene carry bags. Thus, both these

notifications have been issued by and under the Union law and in

furtherance to the powers delegated by the Central Government. It

neither falls in the Concurrent List nor is it in conflict with one of

the subjects stated in the fields of List II i.e. within the competence

of the State Government.     <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_75">Article 254</a> can operate only when the

subject relates to the fields specified in the Concurrent List and the

State law is in conflict with the law enacted by the Union

Parliament. The other situation is where the provision of a law

made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of

law made by the Parliament, which the Parliament is competent to

enact. Even these two situations of repugnancy are subject to the

limitations of <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_76">Article 254(2).</a> However, it is apparent that either of

these two situations do not exist in the present case.


</p><p id="p_60">26. For the above reasoning and in view of the law settled by the

Supreme Court supra, the argument of the notification dated 30th

July, 2008 being repugnant to the Rules of 2011 has no merits and

is liable to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">27. As stated by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1524072/" id="a_77">K.T. Plantation

Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Karnataka</a> [2011 (9) SCC 1], it was held

that repugnancy between two statutes would arise if there is a

direct conflict between the two provisions of law made by the

Parliament and the law made by the State legislature occupying the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                     26</span>
 same field and covering the same subject matter. The Supreme

Court further held:
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">          " When the repugnancy between the Central and
          State Legislations is pleaded, we have to first examine
          whether the two legislations cover or relate to the
          same subject matter. The test for determining the
          same is to find out the dominant intention of the two
          legislations and if the dominant intention of the two
          legislations is different, they cover different subject
          matter then merely because the two legislations refer
          to some allied or cognate subjects, they do not cover
          the same field. A provision in one legislation to give
          effect to its dominant purpose may incidentally be on
          the same subject as covered by the provision of the
          other legislation, but such partial coverage of the
          same area in a different context and to achieve a
          different purpose does not bring about the
          repugnancy which is intended to be covered by
          <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_78">Article 254(2).</a> In other words, both the legislations
          must be substantially on the same subject to attract
          <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_79">Article 254."</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_64">28. The other contention raised on behalf of the applicants is that

the notification dated 30th July, 2008 stands impliedly over-ruled by

the notification of the Rules of 2011. In this regard, the learned

counsel has placed reliance upon <a href="/doc/1921918/" id="a_80">Section 24</a> of the General Clauses

Act, 1897. In order to deal with this argument, we may refer to the

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/666476/" id="a_81">State of Madhya

Pradesh v. Kedia Leather &amp; Liquor &amp; Ors</a>. [2003 (7) SCC 389] where

the Court stated the principles leading to repeal of a statute or a

provision by implication and the factors which are required to be

considered or questions that are required to be decided by the

Court. The Court held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p>     "13. There is presumption against a repeal by implication;<p id="p_66">
</p><p id="p_67">     and the reason of this rule is based on the theory that the
     Legislature while enacting a law has a complete knowledge of
     the existing laws on the same subject matter, and therefore,
     when it does not provide a repealing provisions, the intention

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                      27</span>
 is clear not to repeal the existing legislation. (See: Municipal
Council Palai through the <a href="/doc/793142/" id="a_82">Commissioner of Municipal
Council, Palai v. T.J. Joseph</a>:[1964]2SCR87, <a href="/doc/352854/" id="a_83">Northern India

Anr. v. Union of India</a>: AIR1990SC104 . When the new Act
contains a repealing section mentioning the Acts which it
expressly repeals, the presumption against implied repeal of
other laws is further strengthened on the principle expressio
unius (Personal vel rei) est exclusion alterius. (The express
intention of one person or thing is the exclusion of another),
as illuminatingly stated in Garnett v. Bradley (1878) 3 AC
</p><p id="p_68">944. The continuance of existing legislation, in the absence
of an express provision of repeal by implication lies on the
party asserting the same. The presumption is, however,
rebutted and a repeal is inferred by necessary implication
when the provisions of the later Act are so inconsistent with
or repugnant to the provisions of the earlier Act and that the
two cannot stand together. But, if the two can be read
together and some application can be made of the words in
the earlier Act, a repeal will not be inferred.
</p><p id="p_69">(See: A.G. v. Moore (1878) 3 Ex. D 276, Ratanlal's case

AIR1992SC81.
</p><p id="p_70">14. The necessary questions to be asked are:
</p><p id="p_71">(1) Whether there is direct conflict between the two
provisions.
</p><p id="p_72">(2) Whether the Legislature intended to lay down an
exhaustive Code in respect of the subject-matter replacing
the earlier law;
</p><p id="p_73">(3) Whether the two laws occupy the same field.
</p><p id="p_74">(See: <a href="/doc/1401686/" id="a_87">Pt. Rishikesh and Anr. v. Salma Begum (Smt</a>.) :
[1995]3SCR1062 , and <a href="/doc/73619/" id="a_88">Shri A.B. Krishna and Ors. v. The
State of Karnataka and Ors</a>. : [1998]1SCR157
</p><p id="p_75">15. The doctrine of implied repeal is based on the theory that
the Legislature, which is presumed to know the existing law,
did not intend to create any confusion by retaining
conflicting provisions and, therefore, when the court applies
the doctrine, it does not more than give effect to the intention
of the Legislature by examining the scope and the object of
the two enactments and by a comparison of their provisions.
The matter in each case is one of the construction and
comparison of the two statutes. The Court leans against
implying a repeal, "unless two Act are so plainly repugnant
to each other that effect cannot be given to both at the same
time, a repeal will not be implied, or that there is a necessary
inconsistency in the two Acts standing together." (See Craies
on Statute Law, Seventh Edition, page 366, with reference to
Re: Barry (1936) Ch. 274. To determine whether a later

      statute repeals by implication an earlier, it is necessary to
     scrutinize the terms and consider the true meaning and
     effect of the earlier Act. Until this is done, it is impossible to
     ascertain whether any inconsistency exists between the two
     enactments. The area of operation in the Code and the
     pollution laws in question are different with wholly different
     aims and objects; and though they alleviate nuisance, that is
     not of identical nature. They operate in their respective fields
     and there is no impediment for their existence side by side."

</p><p id="p_76">29. The Rules of 2011 were framed in supersession of the

recycled Plastic Manufacture, Sale and Usage Rules, 1999. The

framers of the Rules did not refer to the directions or the

notifications issued by the competent authority in terms of

<a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_89">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act. In fact, even while superseding

the Rules of 1999, it protected the things done or omitted to be

done before such supersession. The effect of these Rules was

prospective over-ruling of the 1999 Rules. It is either by

implication or otherwise and cannot be extended to a notification

issued under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_90">Section 5</a> of the Environment Act, which has been

enacted for a different purpose and object. If we consider the

present case in light of the questions which, as per the Supreme

Court, needed to be answered while considering the question of

implied over-ruling, then all the questions would have to be

answered in the negative. As already noticed, there is no direct

conflict between the two notifications. The Legislature did not lay

down any exhaustive code on the subject-matter and both the

notifications do not occupy the same field. Once these questions

are answered in the negative, the question of implied over-ruling

would hardly arise in the present case. Reliance on <a href="/doc/1921918/" id="a_91">Section 24</a> of

the General Clauses Act is also irrelevant in the facts of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                          29</span>
 present case. Firstly, there is no direct or implied over-ruling of

the notification dated 30th July, 2008. Secondly, there is no

inconsistency between the two notifications. The implied over-

ruling can come into play only when it is so expressly stated or it

is an inevitable inference from the language of the relevant

provision. The earlier enactment should inevitably be in conflict

with the subsequent law to the extent that one could not operate

in face of the other. The Courts have even held that if the two

provisions or laws concerned may be read together and some

application may be made of the words in the earlier Act, a repeal

will not be inferred. In fact, there is no repealing provision in the

Rules of 2011. The reference to supersession of 1999 Rules is only

in the preamble of the Rules. Thus, there is no direct or implied

intention of the Legislature to render the laws or notifications

ineffective, much less invalid. Thus, this argument raised by the

applicants also has no substance.
</p>
<p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78">30. The last argument raised before us by the applicants is that

the ban is discriminatory and arbitrary on the following two

counts:
</p>
<p id="p_79">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">     (a) The ban has been imposed only on manufacture, sale,

          storage and utilisation of 'polythene carry bags' while plastic

          polythene products have not been banned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">     (b) The ban has been imposed only in the UT of Chandigarh

          vide the notification dated 30th July, 2008 while no such

          ban has been imposed or is in force in the adjoining


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                        30</span>
         districts of Punjab and Haryana, which are practically part

        of UT, Chandigarh.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_80">31. The notification dated 30th July, 2008, of course, imposes a

ban only on polythene carry bags and not on other packaging

plastic/polythene material like plastic rolls and all kinds of

industrial and food packaging material. The order banning the

manufacture, storage, sale, etc. of polythene carry bags is based

upon rational studies undertaken by the expert bodies. The

experience of the Government, is even obvious as the UT

Administration of Chandigarh felt it impossible to manage the

environmental hazards arising from littering of these plastic carry

bags and when its efforts in that behalf had failed, it invited

objections from all concerned to the draft notification dated 6th

December, 2005. Upon due consideration, the authorities had

taken a view putting a partial restriction. This would not render it

discriminatory inasmuch as even the applicants are carrying on

their business in all other fields of plastic manufacturing, sale, etc.

except to the extent of polythene carry bags. A reasonable

restriction can be imposed wholly or partially. The fact that it has

been imposed partially would not render the notification bad in law

on the ground of discrimination.
</p>
<p id="p_81">
</p><p id="p_82">32. Furthermore, there is a direct nexus between the object

sought to be achieved by issuance of the notification and the object

sought to be achieved under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_92">Environment Act</a>.

The intention is to stop the menace of littering of plastic carry bags

everywhere causing blockage of drains, animal deaths thereby

 leading to environmental pollution and degradation and causing

environmental hazards. The larger public purpose and interest is

sought to be achieved by issuance of this notification in comparison

to the small economic and business interests of the applicants or

persons placed like them. Thus, the private interest must give in to

the public interest or the greater good of the society. It is a matter of

common knowledge of which the Tribunal can even take a judicial

notice,   that   the   plastic   carry   bags   are   thrown   everywhere

indiscriminately and they result in serious environmental hazards.

This affects not only public health but also public conveniences.

The restriction imposed thus is neither unreasonable nor can it be

said that it has no nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_93">Environment Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_84">33. Many countries have largely replaced the use of plastic bags

by either switching over to re-usable bags and/or 'biodegradable'

and/or 'compostable' bags. In our country, share of plastic waste in

total municipal solid waste has risen from around half per cent in

1996 to over 9 per cent in 2005. It is reported that almost half of

this waste comprises of used plastic bags and packaging material.

The environmental consequences of such plastic waste in solid

waste are well known as it takes hundreds of years to degrade and

fill up landfill sites. Plastic litter can also lead to clogged drains,

which result in sanitation, flooding and sewage problems. In

addition, plastic bags can harm animals through ingestion and the

improper incineration of plastic bags pollutes the air and releases

toxic substances. These concerns have caused governments across

 the world, including the authorities in India, to introduce legislation

to limit the use of plastic bags (SANDEE working paper No. 65-11).

They have used a variety of regulatory instruments for this purpose

which include the mandatory pricing of plastic bags, explicit levies

on each bag, taxes at the manufacturing level, discounts on the use

of 'own bags', awareness campaigns, command and control

approaches and, in some cases, a total ban on the use of plastic

bags. The evidence on the effectiveness of such policies world over

is not very promising. For example, plastic bag retail levies in

Ireland have resulted in a dramatic fall in the demand for plastic

bags, and an environmental levy at the point of manufacturing in

Denmark has been similarly effective.

dated 30th July, 2008 by the Administrator, UT Chandigarh, on the

ground that the States of Punjab and Haryana have not issued

similar notifications. The Chandigarh Administration has no

administrative or legislative control over the States of Punjab and

Haryana. It is for those States to issue such notifications in that

behalf. However, we certainly would require the Chief Secretary of

both the States of Punjab and Haryana respectively to consider this

aspect and place such restrictions, as they may deem fit and proper

to help the cause of environment. Undoubtedly, places like S.A.S.

Nagar and Panchkula have become part of the city of Chandigarh

and the Administration of these towns/States would be well advised

to promulgate such law to bring it in uniformity with the

appropriate to direct the authorities concerned in all the States to

explore the possibility of introducing use of bio-degradable or

compostable plastic bags as opposed to polythene plastic bags of

any thickness.

Constitutional infirmity in the notification dated 30th July, 2008

issued by the Chandigarh Administration. Rather, this is a step

towards better environmental administration and in the larger

public interest. Therefore, we find these applications without any

merit and dismiss the same; however, without any order as to costs.
