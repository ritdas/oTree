 JUSTICE SWATANTER KUMAR, (CHAIRPERSON)

     By this common judgment we will dispose of the above

Original Application No. 74 and Appeal No. 14, both of 2014 as

they arise between the same parties and relate to one and the

same project on identical facts.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
FACTS AND LIMITATIONS


</p><p id="p_4">2.   The appellants (applicants in Application No. 74 of 2014

hereafter   commonly    referred   as   'appellants')   are   persons

interested in the protection of environment and ecology. They are

persons aggrieved and affected due to the Vizhinjam Port Project

(for short 'the project'). The Appellants are fishermen belonging to

families that traditionally do fishing in the project area and are

representatives of the larger community of fisher folk who inhabit

that area. By the project, not only the ecology and environment of

that area would be affected but there would also be adverse

impact on their livelihood. The Appellants are also the registered

members of the Fish Workers Welfare Board formed by the

Government of Kerala to give assistance to the people in the

fishing occupation. This is the benchmark to determine that

Appellants are sea going fishermen.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.   Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (Respondent No. 3,

hereafter 'the Project Proponent') formulated a project for

development of Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose

Seaport at Vizhinjam      in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum)

district, in the State of Kerala. This Project involves the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                    4</span>
 construction of quays, terminal area and port building and is

expected to be completed in three phases. The first phase is

proposed to be built on 66 hectares of land to be reclaimed from

the sea. The material required for phase I reclamation is proposed

to be obtained from dredging activity in the sea. This phase

requires 7 million metric tonnes of stone, aggregates, sand and

soil for construction of a breakwater stretching almost 3.180 kms

into the sea. This material is sought to be sourced from blasting

quarries     in   Trivandrum    and    in       neighbouring      district   of

Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu State, possibly falling in Western

Ghats region.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.   The project proponent was appointed by the State of Kerala

as   nodal    agency    to   develop   this       International     Container

Transhipment Terminal (deepwater port) at Vizhinjam. The Project

Proponent submitted an Application in the prescribed format for

obtaining the Environmental Clearance on 28th August, 2010. On

the basis of Application submitted, the Terms of Reference (for

short 'TOR') were prepared and considered by the Expert

Appraisal Committee (for short 'the EAC') in its 95th Meeting held

from 18th to 20th January, 2011 and 100th Meeting held from 11-

12th May, 2011 and 101st Meeting held on 31st May, 2011.

Agreeing with the Applicant, despite having serious reservations,

about the selection of the project site, the higher erosion shore

line of the site and the impact of              other nearby ports on the

project,   the    EAC   recommended         a    project-specific    (non-site


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                              5</span>
 specific) TOR, with the direction that after site selection based on

site selection criteria, it shall issue additional site-specific TOR.

The non-site specific TOR of the said project were finalised by the

Ministry of Environment and Forest (for short 'MoEF') vide its

letter dated 10th June, 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">5.   Thereafter, the Government of Kerala undertook the site

selection exercise and concluded that the area South of Vizhinjam

harbor is best suited for the project. This finding with relevant

extracts of the study were communicated to the concerned

officials in the MoEF vide their letter dated 14th June, 2011. EAC

in its 102nd meeting held from 23rd-24th June, 2011 agreed on the

Vizhinjam site and finalised the additional TOR. The additional

TOR (site-specific) were finalised for the said project by MoEF on

1st July, 2011. On the basis of the TOR issued by the EAC, the

Project Proponent commenced preparation of Comprehensive

Environmental Impact Assessment (hereafter 'EIA'). A draft

Comprehensive EIA Report was submitted by the Consultants to

the Project Proponent on 25th May, 2013 in furtherance of which a

public hearing was conducted on 29th June, 2013 and the final

EIA Report was submitted to EAC for securing Environmental

Clearance.   It   is   the   case   of   the   Applicant   that   various

organisations and individuals who had participated in public

hearing had voiced their opposition to various lacunae in the EIA

Report and raised doubts about the viability of the project. They

approached the EAC requesting that they be heard but EAC


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                        6</span>
 refused to grant them a hearing. Hence, they were compelled to

send their objections by email and in writing to the EAC, but even

those     objections   were   not     considered      while   granting

Environmental Clearance to the Project Proponent. Finally, the

EAC considered the final EIA Report in its 126th Meeting held from

19th-21st September, 2013 and 128th Meeting held from 20th-23rd

November, 2013. At the meeting held in November, 2013, the EAC

recommended the Project for Environmental Clearance. The

Environmental Clearance was granted for Stage I to the Vizhinjam

project by MoEF vide its letter dated 3rd January, 2014.


</p><p id="p_11">6.   Amongst other, an issue raised in opposition to the project at

the public hearing and otherwise, was that the project site was

located in Coastal Regulation Zone-I (for short 'the CRZ-I') area,

owing to its natural beauty as per the Coastal Zone Management

Plan (for short 'the CZMP'), Kerala, prepared in December, 1995.

Even this issue was not addressed by the EAC. The National

Coastal    Management     Authority    (for   short    'NCZMA')   had

recommended in its 21st and 22nd Meeting held on 19th April, 2011

and 30th May, 2011 respectively, that MoEF may not like to

encourage the reclassification of CRZ areas, which were approved

in September, 1996, as they were in danger of regularization of

violations through such reclassifications; and hence, the CZMP as

approved in 1996 may be frozen and the coastal States should

initiate the exercise of preparation of CZMP as per the Coastal

Regulation Zone Notification, 2011 (hereafter 'the Notification of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                     7</span>
 2011'). Vide CRZ Notification of 1991, the State Governments and

Union Territories were directed to prepare the CZMP with High

Tide Line, 500 metres regulation line, other boundaries and

different categories of coastal areas for the approval of MoEF. The

State of Kerala prepared the said Plan which identified Vizhinjam

area as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "This complex coast consisting of rocky areas (Mulloor,
       in the south and Vizhinjam-Kovalam sector), laterite
       cliffs (between Mullor and Vizhinjam), pocket beaches (at
       Vizhinjam-Kovalam), barrier beaches (Panathura) and
       an open coast (Poonthura-Beemapalli) has a total length
       of about 905 km. Karamana river, which debouches at
       Panathura-Pachallur area, has a 3km backwater system
       and a dynamic inlet. Vizhinjam has a fishing harbour
       with a wave energy plant and Kovalam is an
       international tourist destination. The Vizhinjam-
       Kovalam sector is of outstanding natural beauty (CRZ-I),
       but the area is not demarcated. The laterite cliff area
       which also comes under this category is subject to
       slumping at High Water and this can be accelerated by a
       rise in sea level. Hence, a 50m zone is identified as CRZ-
       I. Rest of the area (Mullor to Pachlloor) since comes
       under the rural sector is CRZ-III. North of Pachallur is
       the Trivandrum Corporation area, which is CRZ-II. The
       Parvathi Puthen Ar canal and the Karamana river up to
       about 1.5 km from HTL is subject to tidal influx and
       hence their flanks has to be regulated."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">7.    Aggrieved from the Order No. F. No. 11-122/0211-IA-111 of

MoEF, dated 3rd January, 2014, granting Environmental and CRZ

Clearance to the project for development, the Appellants have

challenged the impugned Order on various grounds:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     a. The project is sought to be established on the coastal area

       of outstanding natural beauty which is designated as CRZ-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       I, which is impermissible.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                    8</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      b. The issues raised at the public hearing, have not been

        considered by the concerned authorities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     c. The deletion of the area from the classification of CRZ-I

        areas, is arbitrary and shall irreparably damage these

        pristine coasts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     d. The Central Government is obliged to protect and improve

        the environment in terms of <a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_1">Section 3</a> of the Environment

        Protection Act, 1986 (for short 'Act of 1986').
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     e. The principle of Intergenerational Equity, as enshrined in

        the 1975 Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of State is

        directly violated in the present case.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_13">8.    The Appellants have filed the present Appeal in terms of the

provisions of Section 16 of the NGT Act. Under Section 16 of the

the appellants are not literate in English and are ignorant of

internet, computer etc., to be able to read or download

Environmental Clearance from internet. The Order dated 3rd

January, 2014 granting Environmental and CRZ Clearance to the

Project Proponent was not published in the local newspapers in

contravention of the Condition No. 15 of the Environment

Clearance. The appellants came to know of the impugned Order in

the first week of February, 2014 from their village men and went

to take the legal advice at Trivandrum where they were informed

that in terms of Condition No. 17 of the Environment Clearance,

the appeal should be filed within 30 days, which had already

lapsed. However, on seeking proper information later, the

appellants were told that they can file the appeal within 90 days

in terms of Section 16 of the NGT Act. Having come to know the

same in March, 2014, the appellants filed the present appeal on

1st April, 2014. There is delay of 58 days in filing the present

appeal. The appellants termed it as 'sufficient cause' justifying

condonation of delay of 58 days.
</p>
<p id="p_18">11. No reply to this application has been filed and, in fact, the

Learned Counsel appearing for the Project Proponent did not

seriously oppose the condonation of delay. In terms of Condition

No. 15 of the Environmental Clearance, the Order granting

Environment and CRZ Clearance ought to have been published in

atleast two local newspapers having wide circulation in that area.

Furthermore, in terms of the Environment Clearance Regulations,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                10</span>
 2006 (for short 'the Regulations of 2006'), Rule 10 such Order has

to be published as well as put in the public domain to ensure that

persons, particularly of that area are able to exercise their rights

in terms of the Regulations of 2006 and the provisions of the Act

of 1986. Reference can be made to the judgments of this Tribunal

in the case of <a href="/doc/189583188/" id="a_3">Savemon Region Federation v. Union of India</a>, 2013

Vol-1, All India NGT Reporter Page 1 and <a href="/doc/94910251/" id="a_4">Ms Medha Patekar v.

Ministry of Environment and Forest</a>, 2013 All India NGT Reporter,

Page 174, Delhi, wherein it was held that Courts should not adopt

an injustice oriented approach, while determining period of

limitation. In the case of Savemon Region (supra), the Tribunal

held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "42. Since the present case relates to a Category 'A'
      project, we are primarily concerned with Regulation 10
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (i)(a) of the Environment Clearance Regulations, 2006.</blockquote><p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">      The most noticeable expression used in this regulation
      is that it 'shall be mandatory' for the Project Proponent
      to make public the Environmental Clearance granted for
      their project along with the environmental conditions
      and safeguards at their cost by prominently advertising
      it in at least two local newspapers of the district or State
      where the project is located, and in addition, this shall
      also be displayed on the Project Proponent's website
      permanently. The use of the words 'shall' and
      'mandatory' in Regulation 10 of 2006 Regulations clearly
      exhibits the intent of the Legislature not to make the
      compliance to these provisions ''directory'. There is no
      legislative indication or reason for construing the word
      'shall' as 'may'. Settled canon of statutory interpretation
      contemplates that it is necessary to lay emphasis on the
      language used by the framers of the regulations. Once a
      provision has no element of ambiguity and the provision
      its being mandatory is clearly discernible from the plain
      language thereof, it would be impermissible to hold,
      even impliedly, that the provision is directory in its
      content and application. It would be required of the
      concerned stakeholders to comply with such provisions
      stricto sensu. The principle of substantial compliance
      would have no application to this provision and on its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                     11</span>
 plain reading the provision is mandatory and must be
complied with as provided. The Project Proponent is
legally obliged under this provision to make public the
Environmental Clearance granted for the project with
the environmental conditions and safeguards at their
cost by promptly advertising it in at least two
newspapers of the district or in the state where the
project is located. In addition, the order shall also be
displayed on its website permanently.
</p><p id="p_21">43. Still in addition thereto, the Project Proponent also
has an obligation to submit the copies of the
Environmental Clearance to the Heads of local bodies,
Panchayats and Municipal bodies in addition to the
relevant offices who in turn have to display the same for
30 days from the date of receipt thereof.
</p><p id="p_22">44. An obligation is also cast upon the MoEF or the
State/Union Territory Level Environmental Impact
Assessment Authority, as the case maybe, to place the
Environmental Clearance in the public domain on
Government portal. On the analysis of Regulation 10
and its sub-regulations, it is clear that the obligation to
communicate the Environmental Clearance in the
prescribed manner lies both upon the MoEF/State
Government/State Environmental Impact Assessment
Authority, on the one hand and the Project Proponent,
on the other. This mandatory legal obligation is intended
to safeguard the public interest, on the one hand and
protection of the environment, on the other. That is why
the legislature has given the right to 'any person' to
prefer an appeal against such order irrespective of his
locus standi or his interest in the lis.
</p><p id="p_23">45. This brings us to an ancillary question as to what is
required to be published/advertised in the two
newspapers of the district or the State where the project
is located. The answer is provided in the Regulation
itself which states that it is mandatory to make public
the Environmental Clearance granted for the project
along with        the  environmental     conditions and
safeguards. In other words, mere publication of
information about the order granting Environmental
Clearance would not be construed as compliance with
this provision stricto sensu. The conditions for granting
of Environmental Clearance with definite safeguards
have to be published in the newspaper. The purpose
behind publishing a notice with the contents of the
order is only that 'any person' would be able to make up
his mind whether he needs to question the correctness
or legality of such order."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                              12</span>
</p><p id="p_25"> 12. The Project Proponent has placed no documents on record to

show that there was compliance of condition No. 15 of the Order

granting Environmental Clearance and or the Regulations of

2006. Publication of the environmental conditions and safeguards

as stated in the Order of Environmental Clearance was not

published in the two legal newspapers. Such non-compliance

came to the notice of the appellant at much subsequent date. The

appellant is expected the delay on the ground that they are not

literate in English and are ignorant of internet and computer, as a

result of which they were unable to download the Environmental

Clearance Order. Immediately upon having come to know of the

impugned order they sought legal advice and later filed the appeal

resulting in delay. The explanation given appellant on affidavit for

condonation of delay appears to be bona fide and we have no

reason to disbelieve the same. The Project Proponent having failed

to comply with the requirements of law cannot be permitted to

take advantage of its own wrong. Thus, in terms of the proviso to

<a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_5">Section 16</a>, we are of the considered view that the Applicant was

prevented by a sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the

initial period of 30 days and the delay of 58 days in filing the

appeal requires to be condoned. Therefore, we allow Miscellaneous

Application No. 182 of 2014 and condone the delay of 58 days in

filing the present appeal without any Order as to cost.

APPLICATION NO. 74 of 2014:
</p>
<p id="p_26">13. As already noticed, the appellants have also filed another

Application No. 74 of 2014 under Section 14 of the NGT Act

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                  13</span>
 relatable to the same project with particular emphasis on areas of

outstanding natural beauty in the Western Ghats. The application

has been filed with the following prayers:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (a) "Direct that the coastal 'areas of outstanding natural
          beauty' and 'areas likely to be inundated due to rise
          in sea level consequent upon global warming and
          such other areas as may be declared by the Central
          Government or the concerned Authorities at the
          State/Union Territory level from time to time' along
          the coast line of India be protected as CRZ-1`areas or
          otherwise, notwithstanding their non-inclusion in the

          the CRZ Notification, 1991, be preserved and no
          activity which would damage such areas be
          undertaken."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_27">14. The factual matrix as projected by the applicant leading to

the above prayers is that the applicants being persons interested

in protection of environment, ecology of the coastal area of

Mulloor and being personally affected, are persons aggrieved and

entitled to invoke the provisions of Section 14 of the NGT Act.

According to the Applicants, they intend to protect and safeguard

'coastal areas of outstanding natural beauty' and 'areas likely to

be inundated due to rise in sea level consequent upon global

warming and such other areas as may be declared by the Central

Government or the concerned authorities at the State/Union

Territory level from time to time', which categories were deleted


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                     14</span>
 from the classification of CRZ-I areas in Para 7(i) CRZ-I of the

Notification of 2011. These areas have been categorised/classified

as CRZ-I areas from time to time. The Notification of 2011 deletes

these areas, which were categorised as 'areas of outstanding

natural beauty' and the 'areas likely to be inundated due to rise in

sea level consequent upon global warming and such other areas

as may be declared by the Central Government or the concerned

authorities at the State/Union territory level from time to time'

under the Notification of 1991. According to the applicants, the

project in question which has been granted Environmental and

CRZ Clearance vide Order dated 3rd January, 2014 by MoEF is

sought to be established on 'coastal areas of outstanding natural

beauty'. In the Notification of 1991, the Vizhinjam-Kovalam sector

was declared to be an 'area of outstanding natural beauty' in part

of CRZ-I, but the area has not been demarcated. The facts in

regard to grant of Environmental and CRZ Clearance and the

grounds stated in Appeal 14 of 2014 have been reiterated in this

Application. The applicants submit that they have instituted the

Application under Section 14 of the NGT Act to protect and

preserve 'coastal areas of outstanding natural beauty' and areas

which are 'likely to be inundated due to rise in sea level

consequent upon global warming and such other areas as may be

declared by the Central Government and other Authorities' which

have been deleted from the classification of CRZ-I vide Notification

of 2011. Applicants also submit that such non-inclusion of the

areas of outstanding natural beauty is arbitrary and violative of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                  15</span>
 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_6">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The Coastal Zone Management Plan

(for short 'CZMP') has been prepared contrary to the guidelines of

preparation of such CZMPs, as neither objections were invited nor

public hearing was held in accordance with the guidelines. The

applicants also rely upon the observations of the Supreme Court

of India in the case of Indian Council for <a href="/doc/998721/" id="a_7">Enviro-Legal Action v.

Union of India</a>, (1996) 5 SCC 281, to contend that the economic

development should not be allowed to take place at the cost of

ecology or by causing wide-spread environmental destruction and

violation. At the same time the necessity to preserve ecology and

environment    should    not   hamper     economic    and    other

developments. Both development and environment must go hand

in hand.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">15. The applicants have also contended that non-inclusion of

'areas of outstanding natural beauty' and 'areas likely to be

inundated due to rise in sea level consequent upon global

warming' etc. should not have been deleted from the Notification

of 2011 and such deletion is violative of the 'doctrine of Public

Trust'. Non-inclusion would not only adversely affect the coastal

areas in the State of Kerala but is likely to affect 6000 kms long

coastal line of the country. The coastal areas are under direct

threat of being damaged and destroyed permanently with CRZ-I

area protection being taken away, thus, also violating the

'Precautionary Principle'. Such areas need to be protected even if

they do not form part of the Notification of 2011. By defaulting in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                 16</span>
 protecting such areas, which should have been part of the

Notification of 2011 or otherwise, the Central Government has

omitted to discharge its obligation with respect to preservation

and protection of 'coastal areas of outstanding natural beauty'.

Intergenerational Equity is an integral element of ecological

sustainable    development   and    has   been   incorporated    into

international law as well. Applying that principle, it is the duty of

all concerned with the present to ensure that the next generation

is not exposed to undue hardship or ecological or environmental

degradation.
</p>
<p id="p_30">16. On the other hand, the Respondents, particularly the Project

Proponent contended that the present Application is barred by

time. It was contended that the Order granting Environmental

and CRZ Clearance was passed by the authorities on 3rd January,

2014 and that the Petition could be filed within the period of six

months from the date on which the cause of action for such

dispute first arose. It is alleged further that such Application

could be entertained by the Tribunal within a further period not

exceeding 60 days if the applicant was able to show 'sufficient

cause' for filing the Application beyond the period of six months.

The present Application has been filed beyond that period, hence

it is barred by time and not maintainable before the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_31">17. We are not able to find any merit in the contention of the

Respondent. Firstly, in this petition, the applicants are not

challenging the Environmental Clearance granted to the Project

Proponent vide Order dated 3rd January, 2014. Even if it is so

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                   17</span>
 assumed, the present Application has been filed within six

months from the date of that Order as the Application was filed on

3rd April, 2014. Secondly, in the present Application, the applicant

is claiming a general relief, praying before the Tribunal that the

'areas of outstanding natural beauty' and the 'areas likely to be

inundated due to rise in sea level consequent upon global

warming' should be protected, even if such areas do not form part

of the Notification issued by the Union or the State Government

as CRZ-I. According to the Applicant, the Notification of 2011

excluded these areas and hence the need to protect such areas is

a continuing cause of action, which would thus save the right of

the applicants to bring this Application within the stipulated

period. May be the cause of action for quashing of the Notification

and further for inclusion of these areas in the Notification arose in

the year 2011 when the said Notification was issued, but a relief

claiming for protection and preservation of such excluded areas

and issues relating to the environment and ecology thereof, would

squarely be a substantial question of environment, falling within

the purview of the provisions of the Act of 1986. De hors the

contents of the Notification of 2011, the cause of action for such

dispute though first arose in the year 2011, but protection of the

excluded areas being an environmental dispute would give rise to

subsisting cause of action or a continuing cause of action and

therefore, amenable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under

Section 14 of the NGT Act. In fact, as already noticed, the various

paragraphs and the prayers made in the Application clearly

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                   18</span>
 demonstrate that in this Application, the applicant is hardly

raising a direct challenge to the Notification of 2011.

</p><p id="p_32">18. The prayer of the Applicant also relates to the coastal CRZ-I

areas beyond Kerala. It is stated to be around 6000 kms along the

coastal line in different States of the country. We may notice that

the applicant also filed Miscellaneous Application No. 277 of 2014

for amendment praying that the Coastal Zone Management

Authority of 8 coastal States and 4 Union Territories be impleaded

as Respondents in the Application No. 74 of 2014 as that would

help in completely and fully adjudicating the environmental issues

in such areas over the entire coast line. This Application is

pending before the Tribunal. The cumulative effect of the above

discussion is that the present Application cannot be dismissed as

being barred by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">19. Having stated the facts of both the cases that we are dealing

with in the present judgment and having answered the question of

limitation, we would now notice the preliminary objections that

have been raised on behalf of the Respondents, particularly the

Project Proponent, as well as their objections to the transfer of

Application 17 of 2014 from the Southern Zonal Bench of NGT to

the Principal Bench at New Delhi. The preliminary and other

objections raised by the Respondents can precisely be stated as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_35">
  A. The NGT being a creation of a statute is not vested with the

     powers of judicial review so as to examine the constitutional

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                 19</span>
      validity/vires    or    legality   of   a    legislation   -     whether

     subordinate or delegated (in the present case, the CRZ

     Notification, 2011). Exercise of such jurisdiction would

     tantamount to enlarging its own jurisdiction by the Tribunal.

  B. The Principal Bench of National Green Tribunal does not

     have any territorial jurisdiction to entertain and decide these

     cases as the cause of action has arisen at Kerala and the

     coastal zone that is the subject matter of the Petition is in

     Kerala.
</p>
<p id="p_36">  C. The Chairperson of the National Green Tribunal, unlike

     some of the other statutes, is not vested with the power to

     transfer cases to its Principal or Regional Benches from

     other Benches.
</p>
<p id="p_37">  D. The Original Application No. 74 of 2014 is a device to

     indirectly and effectively seek insertion of certain words into

     the CRZ Notification, 2011, which is impermissible.


Discussion on issue (A) i.e. "The NGT being a creation of a
statute is not vested with the powers of judicial review so as
to examine the constitutional validity/vires or legality of a
legislation - whether subordinate or delegated (in the present
case, the CRZ Notification, 2011). Exercise of such
jurisdiction would tantamount to enlarging its own
jurisdiction by the Tribunal":
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">20. In order to effectively and meaningfully deliberate upon this

issue, the first and the foremost concern would be the legislative

scheme under the NGT Act. The rapid expansion in industrial

infrastructure   and        transportation       sector   and       increasing

urbanisation in the recent years have given rise to new pressures


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                            20</span>
 on the natural resources and particularly on the environment.

The risks to human health and environment arising out of

hazardous activities have also become a matter of concern. With

these considerations in mind and the decisions taken at the

United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held at

Stockholm in June, 1972, as well as United Nations Conference

on Environment and Development held at Rio De Janeiro in June,

1992, to which both Conferences India is a party, the legislature

enacted the NGT Act, to provide for strict liability for damages

arising out of any accident occurring while handling any

hazardous substance, for the establishment of this Tribunal for

effective and expeditious disposal of cases arising from such

accidents and to ensure that people receive the relief in the field of

environment in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The

legislature also felt that there was commensurate increase in

environment related litigation pending in various Courts and

authorities. In paragraph 5 of the Statement of Objects and

Reasons of the NGT Act, it is stated that taking into account the

large number of environmental cases pending in higher courts

and the involvement of multi disciplinary issues in such cases,

the Law Commission was required to consider the need for

constitution of the specialised environmental courts. It was felt to

enact a law to provide for establishment of National Green

Tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of civil cases

relating to environmental protection and conservation of forest

and other natural resources including enforcement of any legal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                    21</span>
 right related to environment. All this led to introduction of NGT

Bill, 2009 which was then passed and made the NGT Act.           The

essence of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act found

their trace in the Preamble of the statute. Besides reiterating that,

this Tribunal was being established for effective and expeditious

disposals of cases relating to environmental protection and

conservation of forests and other natural resources including

enforcement of any legal right relating to environment and with a

view to give relief and compensation for damages to persons,

property and for matters connected therewith or incidental

thereto, it was also due to the fact that in the Conferences afore-

stated, all States were required to provide for effective access to

judicial and administrative proceedings, including redressal and

remedy and to develop national laws in relation to liability and

compensation for the victims of pollution and other environmental

damage. The States were also required to take appropriate steps

for the protection and improvement of human environment. This

is the essence of the Statement of Objects and Reasons and the

Preamble that precedes the NGT Act.

<p id="p_40">

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">23. Section 2(f) of the NGT Act defines hazardous substance as

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">24. <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_11">Section 2(2)</a> further provides that the words and expressions

 other Acts relating to environment shall have the meaning,

respectively, assigned to them in those Acts.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">25. From the above stated definitions, it is clear that the

legislature   in   its   wisdom   has    used   expressions    of   wide

connotation. It necessarily implies that the legislature intended

that this Tribunal should exercise wide jurisdiction over all

matters relating to environment. The Tribunal is vested with three

kinds of jurisdiction within the framework of the NGT Act. Firstly,

<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_12">Section 14</a> gives original jurisdiction to the Tribunal. It is provided

that the Tribunal shall have jurisdiction over all civil cases where

a   substantial    question   relating   to   environment     (including

enforcement of any legal right relating to environment), is involved

and such questions arise out of implementation of the enactments

specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act. In terms of <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_13">Section 14</a> (2),

this Tribunal shall hear the disputes arising from the questions in

sub-section (1) and settle such disputes and pass orders thereon.

</p><p id="p_44">26. The Second type of jurisdiction that the legislature has

conferred upon this Tribunal is appellate jurisdiction. <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_14">Section 16</a>

contemplates that any person aggrieved by the orders passed by

the authorities or bodies under clause (a) to (j) of <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_15">Section 16</a>, may

file an appeal to this Tribunal. There is nothing in Section 16 of

the NGT Act that specifically or even by necessary implication

provides that the appellate jurisdiction of the Tribunal is

circumscribed by any limitation. The Tribunal shall be the

Appellate Authority competent to decide questions of law and fact

both. It may be noticed that the procedure laid down by the Code
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                      24</span>
 of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short 'CPC'), does not apply to the

proceedings before the Tribunal stricto sensu and the Tribunal is

to be guided by the principles of natural justice. It is further

stipulated under Section 19(4) of the NGT Act that the Tribunal is

vested with the same powers as are vested in a civil court under

CPC and would have specifically the powers enumerated under

clause (a) to (k) of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_16">Section 19</a>. Under the

provisions of CPC, particularly Order XLI, the Appellate Court,

particularly, the First Appellate Court is a Court of both fact and

law. It is a settled principle of law and in fact has been

consistently adopted by the Higher Courts. Thus, the questions of

law or fact arising before the Tribunal in the Appeals preferred by

the aggrieved persons can be examined by the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_45">27. In the case of <a href="/doc/1396621/" id="a_17">Santosh Hazari v. Purshottam Tiwari</a>, [2001]

251 ITR 84 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated the principle

that the Appellate Court has jurisdiction to reverse or affirm the

findings of the Trial Court. The first appeal is a valuable right of

the parties and unless restricted by law, the whole case is therein

open for rehearing both on question of fact and law. Similar view

was also expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the

case of <a href="/doc/905727/" id="a_18">Madhukar and Ors. v. Sangram and Ors</a>., AIR 2001 SC

2171. The scope of power of the NGT, particularly in reference to

its appellate jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_19">Section 16</a> of the Act can also be

explained with reference to the provisions of Order XLI Rule 1

read with Rule 33 of the same Order, which empowers the

Appellate Court to pass or make such further or other orders as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                  25</span>
 may be required. Thus, the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court is

very wide and extensive. The power is of wide and over-riding

nature and can be exercised ex debito justitiae, i.e. in the interest

of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_46">28. The third kind of special jurisdiction that is vested in the

Tribunal emerges from the provisions of Section 15 of the NGT

Act. This Section empowers the Tribunal to order relief and

compensation to victims of pollution and other environmental

damage arising under the enactments specified in the Schedule I,

for restitution of property damaged and for restitution of the

environment in such area/areas, as the Tribunal may think fit.

The liability that would accrue upon a person from the orders of

the Tribunal in exercise of its powers under Section 15 of the NGT

Act would be in addition to the liability that may accrue or had

accrued under the <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_20">Public Liability Insurance Act</a>, 1991.

</p><p id="p_47">29. All civil cases where substantial question relating to

environment arises with reference to implementation of the

Scheduled Acts are to be decided by the Tribunal. Jurisdiction of

the civil courts has been excluded under Section 29 of the NGT

Act. In terms of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_21">Section 29</a> (1), from the date of establishment of

Tribunal under the NGT Act, no civil court shall have jurisdiction

to entertain any appeal in respect of any matter, which the

Tribunal      is   empowered   to   determine   under   its   Appellate

jurisdiction, while under sub-section (2), no civil court shall have

jurisdiction to settle dispute or entertain any question relating to

any claim for granting any relief or compensation or restitution of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                     26</span>
 property damaged or environment damaged which may be

adjudicated upon by the Tribunal, and no injunction in respect of

the action taken shall be granted by the civil court.

</p><p id="p_48">30. Another very important provision is <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_22">Section 33</a> which gives

over-riding effect to the provisions of the NGT Act. The provisions

of the NGT Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything

inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force

or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than

the NGT Act. Also the appeals against the orders of the Tribunal

lie to the Supreme Court of India under Section 22 of the NGT

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_49">31. The cumulative reading of the above provisions outlines the

legislative scheme, scope and ambit of jurisdiction of this Tribunal

and the reliefs that can be granted by the Tribunal in exercise of

its jurisdiction under the NGT Act. As already discussed, different

jurisdictions are vested in this Tribunal with wide dimensions and

amplitude.
</p>
<p id="p_50">32. Next, we are expected to deal with the question as to the

impact of the provisions relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal

under this welfare legislation. From the Statement of Objects and

Reasons as well as the Preamble of the NGT Act, it is clear that

the framers of the law intended to give a very wide and

unrestricted jurisdiction to the Tribunal in the matters of

environment. Be it original, appellate or special jurisdiction, the

dimensions and areas of exercise of jurisdiction of the Tribunal


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                   27</span>
 are very wide. The various provisions of the NGT Act do not, by

use of specific language or by necessary implication mention any

restriction on the exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal so far it

relates to a substantial question of environment and any or all of

the Acts specified in Schedule I. <a href="/doc/1802112/" id="a_23">Sections 15</a> and <a href="/doc/1552391/" id="a_24">16</a> of the Act do

not enumerate any restriction as to the scope of jurisdiction that

the Tribunal may exercise. There is no indication in the entire

NGT Act that the legislature intended to divest the Tribunal of the

power of judicial review. It is the settled cannon of statutory

interpretation that such exclusion has to be specific or absolutely

implied from the language of the provisions governing the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Another relevant consideration which

the Tribunal should keep in mind is in regard to independence of

judicial functioning of the Tribunal. In the case of <a href="/doc/112850760/" id="a_25">S.P. Gupta v.

Union of India</a>, (1981) Supp. SCC 87, the Hon'ble Supreme Court

stated that the principle of independence of judiciary is not an

abstract conception but is a living faith which must derive its

inspiration from the Constitutional charter and its nourishment

and sustenance from the constitutional values. The principle of

independence of judiciary is the basic feature of the Constitution.

Any policy or decision of the Government which would undermine

or destroy the independence of the judiciary would not only be

opposed to public policy but would also impinge upon the basic

structure of the Constitution (<a href="/doc/1017222/" id="a_26">Brij Mohan Lal v. Union of India</a>,

(2012) 6 SCC 502).
</p>
<p id="p_51">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                   28</span>
</p><p id="p_52"> 33. The dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Supreme Court Advocates on <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_27">Record Association v. Union of India</a>,

(1993) 4 SCC 441, that independence of judiciary has always been

recognised as a part of basic structure of Constitution, squarely

applies to all the Courts and Tribunals performing the function of

dispensation of justice. Once the Courts and the Tribunals are

free from the influence that could be exercised by executive or

otherwise, their functioning would be in consonance with the

constitutional scheme and fundamental principles of democracy.

Any influence or pressure by any other organ of the State upon

the   functioning   of    the   Judges    would     impinge    upon     the

independence of the judiciary.
</p>
<p id="p_53">34. In light of the above, let us examine if the National Green

Tribunal, has the complete trappings of Original as well as

Appellate Court while dealing with all civil cases, does have

complete judicial independence. In terms of Section 5 of the NGT

Act, a person is not qualified for appointment as the Chairperson

or Judicial Member, unless he is or has been a Judge of the

Supreme Court of India or a Chief Justice of a High Court, or is or

has been a Judge of the High Court for being eligible to be

appointed as Judicial Member. The process of selection is

provided   under    the    National    Green      Tribunal    (Manner    of

Appointment    of   Judicial     and     Expert     Members,     Salaries,

Allowances and other Terms and Conditions of Service of

Chairperson and other Members and Procedure for Enquiry)

Rules, 2010 (for short 'the Rules'). In terms of Rule 5 of the said

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                                         29</span>
 Rules, the Government has to invite applications, screen and

shortlist the same and the shortlisted candidates have to appear

before the Selection Committee to be interviewed in terms of Rule

5 (5). The Selection Committee, particularly for selection of

Judicial Members is to be chaired by a sitting Judge of the

Supreme Court of India, along with the Chairperson of the

Tribunal (who is or has been a judge of the Supreme Court) and

other Members as nominated under Rule 3 of the said Rules. The

Chairperson, Judicial Members and Expert Members can be

removed on the grounds stated under clauses (a) to (e) of sub-

section (1) of Section 10 of the NGT Act by the Central

Government, but only after a regular enquiry is conducted by a

Judge of the Supreme Court, after receiving the preliminary

finding of a Committee constituted by the Government in terms of

Rule 21 of the Rules. The misbehaviour or incapacity of the

Chairperson or Judicial or Expert Member has to be in relation to

his tenure as such. It has to be in relation to performing the

functions of the office in respect of the post that the Chairperson

or the Judicial Member or the Expert Member holds. After the

enquiry by the Judge of the Supreme Court of India in accordance

with these provisions, a Judge has to be nominated by the Chief

Justice of India to conduct an enquiry. Findings and the report of

the enquiry have to be submitted to the President along with

reasons upon which an appropriate action in accordance with law

can be taken.
</p>
<p id="p_54">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                                 30</span>
</p><p id="p_55"> 35. The expression 'all civil cases' appearing in <a href="/doc/1756419/" id="a_28">Section 14</a> falling

under the Original jurisdiction of the Tribunal has to be construed

liberally as contemplated under the provisions of the Section. This

expression has to be given a wider meaning and connotation and

cannot be restricted to the civil cases under the CPC. From the

very language, it is abundantly clear that the Act is contemplating

appeals in civil cases provided not only by CPC but also by other

laws in force immediately before the NGT Act came into force. The

expression 'civil cases' in contemplation of the Act is, thus, not

limited to the cases governed by the CPC but extends to cases,

which are civil in nature, which raise a substantial question of

environment and arise from the Schedule Acts. As already

noticed, the three different kinds of jurisdiction that the Tribunal

exercises are free from any influences or control of the

Government or other organs of the State. However, appeals from

the Tribunal would lie to the Supreme Court of India in terms of

<a href="/doc/735328/" id="a_29">Section 22</a> of the Act and <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">Article 226</a> or 32 of the Constitution, as

the case may be. There is nothing in the provisions of the NGT Act

that directly or even by necessary implication is indicative of any

external control over the National Green Tribunal in discharge of

its judicial functions. MoEF is merely an administrative Ministry

for the National Green Tribunal to provide for means and

finances. Once budget is provided, the Ministry cannot have any

interference in the functioning of the National Green Tribunal.

Entire process of appointment and even removal is under the

effective control of the Supreme Court of India, as neither

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                                  31</span>
 appointments         nor    removal      can    be     effected     without     the

participation and approval of a sitting judge of the Supreme Court

of India. The administration is merely an executing agency within

the framework of the Act. <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_31">The Act</a> is comprehensive enough to

provide a complete mechanism for approaching the National

Green Tribunal, adjudication of disputes in accordance with law

and the appeals that would be preferred against the orders of the

Tribunal. Furthermore, it also provides limitation and complete

procedural     law     that      would   be     governing     the     process    of

adjudication before the Tribunal. The legislature under the Act

has     therefore,    provided      effective       and   efficient    alternative

institutional mechanism in relation to environmental cases. In the

case of <a href="/doc/1180101/" id="a_32">R.K. Jain v. Union of India</a>, 1993 (4) SCC 119, the Supreme

Court     discussed        the    concept      of    alternative      institutional

mechanism in adjudicatory process and held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">        "So long as a the (sic) alternative institutional
        mechanism or authority set up by an Act is not less
        effective than the High court, it is consistent with
        constitutional scheme. The faith of the people is the bed-
        rock on which the edifice of judicial review and efficacy
        of the adjudication are founded. The alternative
        arrangement must, therefore, be effective and efficient.
        For inspiring confidence and trust in the litigant public
        they must have an assurance that the person deciding
        their causes is totally and completely free from the
        influence or pressure from the Govt. To maintain
        independence and imperativity it is necessary that the
        personnel should have at least modicum of legal
        training, learning and experience."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_56">36. Another feature of Judicial Tribunal that has been spelled

out by the Supreme Court is stated with some elaboration in the

case of Union of India v Madras Bar Association (2010) 11 SCC 1,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                                                 32</span>
 where the Court stated that the legislature has the competence to

make laws and provide which disputes will be decided by the

Courts and which disputes will be decided by the Tribunal. It is

subject to constitutional limitations, without encroaching upon

independence of judiciary and keeping in view the principles of

rule of law and separation of power.         If the Tribunals are to be

vested with judicial powers exercised by Courts, such Tribunals

should possess independence, security and capacity associated

with Courts. All the three stated features are satisfied in the

present case. The scheme of the NGT Act clearly gives the

Tribunal    complete   independence     to     discharge   its   judicial

functions, have security of tenure and conditions of service and is

possessed of complete capacity associated with Courts. A

complete mechanism is provided for adjudication process before

the Tribunal as well as the method and procedures under which

the orders of the Tribunal could be assailed before the higher

courts. Thus, this Tribunal has the complete trappings of a civil

court and satisfies all the stated features for acting as an

independent judicial Tribunal with complete and comprehensive

powers.
</p>
<p id="p_57">37. In the above-referred case of <a href="/doc/522930/" id="a_33">Union of India v. Madras Bar

Association</a>, the Supreme Court while upholding the constitution

of National Company Tribunal and transferring of company

jurisdiction to it also held that such legislation was neither

unconstitutional nor violative of the doctrine of separation of

powers     and   independence   of    judiciary.    The    Constitution

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                                       33</span>
 contemplates judicial power being exercised by both Courts and

Tribunals, except the exercise of powers and jurisdiction vested in

superior Courts by the Constitution. The powers and jurisdiction

of courts are controlled and regulated by legislative enactments.

The legislature has the power to create Tribunals with reference to

a specific enactment and confer jurisdiction on them to decide

disputes in regard to matters arising from such enactments.

Therefore, it cannot be said that the legislature has no power to

transfer judicial functions traditionally perform by courts to

Tribunals. Judicial functions and judicial powers are one of the

essential attributes of sovereign states and of consideration of

policy the State transfer its judicial functions and powers mainly

to the courts established by the Constitution but that does not

affect the competence of the State by appropriate measures to

transfer parts of its judicial powers and functions to Tribunals.

The fundamental feature common to both the courts and the

Tribunals is that, they discharge judicial functions and exercise

judicial powers which inherently rest in sovereign State. If the

Tribunals are vested with the judicial power here to vested in or

exercise   by   courts   such   Tribunals   should   possess   the

independence security and capacity associated with courts. Once

Tribunals are created without impinging upon the above stated

doctrines, it being a creation of the statute, would have

jurisdiction to try and decide cases as contemplated under that

statute.
</p>
<p id="p_58">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                                 34</span>
</p><p id="p_59"> 38. The power of the Parliament to enact a law which is not

covered by an entry in List II and III is absolute, while Articles

323-A and 323-B of the Constitution specifically enable the

legislatures to enact laws for establishment of tribunals, in

relation to the matters specified therein. The power of the

Parliament to enact a law constituting a Tribunal, like the

Banking Tribunal, which is not covered by any of the matters

specified in <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_34">Article 323-A</a> or 323-B, is not taken away.          With

regard to any of the entries specified in List I, the exclusive

jurisdiction to make laws with respect to any of the matters

enumerated in List I is with the Parliament. The power conferred

by <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_35">Article 246(1)</a> can be exercised notwithstanding the existence

of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_36">Article 323-A</a> or 323-B of the Constitution.       In other words,

<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_37">Article 323-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_38">323-B</a> do not take away that legislative

competence. It is the law enunciated by the Supreme Court of

India in the case of <a href="/doc/925018/" id="a_39">State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi Housing

Building Coop. Society and Others</a>, (2003) 2 SCC 412.


</p><p id="p_60">39. Having dealt with the constitution of the Tribunal and

having established its independence, now let us proceed to

examine the scope of power of the Tribunal, with particular

reference to examining a subordinate or delegated legislation as

being ultra vires, unconstitutional or illegal. Judicial review is the

power of the court to review statutes or administrative acts or

determine their constitutionality or validity according to a written

constitution. In a wider sense, judicial review is not only


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                                    35</span>
 concerned with the merits of the decision but also the decision

making process. It tends to protect individuals against the misuse

or abuse of power by a wide range of authorities. Judicial review

is a protection to the individual and not a weapon. It is the

doctrine under which legislative and/or executive actions are

subject to review (and possible invalidation) by the judiciary. A

specific court with the power of judicial review may annul the acts

of the State, when it finds them incompatible with a higher

authority (such as the terms of a written constitution). Judicial

review is an example of checks and balances in a modern

governmental system, where the judiciary checks the other

branches of government. This principle is interpreted differently in

different jurisdictions, which also have differing views on the

different hierarchy of governmental norms. As a result, the

procedure and scope of judicial review may differ from country to

country and State to State. Unlike in England, where the judiciary

has no power to review the statutes/Acts made by the Parliament,

the United States Supreme Court in terms of Article III and Article

VI exercises the power of judicial review of the Acts passed by the

Congress    and    has    struck   down     several   statutes   as

unconstitutional. In India, the Supreme Court and the High

Courts have frequently exercised the power of judicial review

keeping intact the 'doctrine of separation of power'. Challenge to

legislation before the Courts in India has primarily been permitted

on a very limited ground. The legislation in question should either

be unconstitutional, or should lack legislative competence.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                  36</span>
 Challenge to such legislation as being unreasonable has also been

permitted, if it violates or unreasonably restricts the fundamental

rights, particularly under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_41">19</a> adumbrated in our

Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_61">40. The Courts are vested with the power of judicial review in

relation to legislative acts and even in relation to judgments of the

Courts. The power of judicial review has been exercised by the

Courts in India sparingly and within the prescribed constitutional

limitations. The Courts have also taken a view that functions of

the Tribunal being judicial in nature, the public have a major

stake in its functioning, for effective and orderly administration of

justice.   A Tribunal should have judicial autonomy and its

administration relating to dispensation of justice should be free of

opinions. (<a href="/doc/2089302/" id="a_42">Ajay Gandhi v. B. Singh</a>, (2004) 2 SCC 120). The

National Green Tribunal has complete control over its functioning

and all the administrative powers, including transfer of cases,

constitution of benches and other administrative control over the

functioning of the Tribunal, are vested in the Chairperson of the

NGT under the provisions of the NGT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_62">41. The Principle that the Courts have inherent powers to do

justice between the parties is equally applicable to administration

of justice by the Tribunals. We may examine certain settled

principles in this regard. In the case of <a href="/doc/1783995/" id="a_43">Jet Plywood Pvt. Ltd. v.

Madhukar Nowlakha</a>, AIR 2006 SC 1260, where the Supreme

Court held that the Principle is well established when the Code of

Civil Procedure is silent regarding a procedural aspect, the

 inherent power of the Court can come to its aid to act ex debito

justitiae for doing real and substantial justice between the parties.

Provisions of the Code cannot be stated exhaustively as legislature

cannot contemplate all possible circumstances. <a href="/doc/1867676/" id="a_44">In Union of India

and Anr v. Paras Laminates (P) Ltd</a>, AIR 1991 SC 696, the

Supreme Court stated the other equitable principle as:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">      "8. There is no doubt that the Tribunal functions as a
      court within the limits of its jurisdiction. It has all the
      powers conferred expressly by the statute. Furthermore,
      being a judicial body, it has all those incidental and
      ancillary powers which are necessary to make fully
      effective the express grant of statutory powers. Certain
      powers are recognised as incidental and ancillary, not
      because they are inherent in the Tribunal, nor because
      its jurisdiction is plenary, but because it is the legislative
      intent that the power which is expressly granted in the
      assigned field of jurisdiction is efficaciously and
      meaningfully exercised, the powers of the Tribunal are no
      doubt limited. Its area of jurisdiction is clearly defined,
      but within the bounds of its jurisdiction, it has all the
      powers expressly and impliedly granted. The implied
      grant is, of course, limited by the express grant and,
      therefore, it can only be such powers as are truly
      incidental and ancillary for doing all such acts or
      employing all such means as are reasonably necessary to
      make the grant effective. As stated in Maxwell on
      Interpretation of Statutes, (eleventh edition) "where an
      Act confers a jurisdiction, it impliedly also grants the
      power of doing all such acts, or employing such means,
      as are essentially necessary to its execution."

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">      "7. Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Eleventh

      essentially necessary to its execution. Cui jurisdiction
      data est, ea quoqe concessa esse vendentur, sine quibus
      jurisdictio explicari non potuit." An instance is given

       "where an inferior court is empowered to grant an

<p id="p_64">43. In the case of Grindlays Bank Ltd. v Central Government

Industrial Tribunal and Ors. AIR 1981 SC 606, the Supreme

Court while dealing with various provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_46">Industrial

Disputes Act</a> and examining the powers of the Tribunal held as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">      "6. We are of the opinion that the Tribunal had the power
      to pass the impugned order if it thought fit in the interest
      of justice. It is true that there is no express provision in
      the Act or the rules framed thereunder giving the
      Tribunal jurisdiction to do so. But it is a well-known rule
      of statutory construction that a Tribunal or body should
      be considered to be endowed with such ancillary or
      incidental powers as are necessary to discharge its
      functions effectively for the purpose of doing justice
      between the parties. In a case of this nature, we are of
      the view that the Tribunal should be considered as
      invested with such incidental or ancillary powers unless
      there is any indication in the statute to the contrary. We
      do not find any such statutory prohibition. On the other
      hand, there are indications to the contrary."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_66">44. From these stated principles it is clear that the Tribunal

has to exercise powers which are necessary to administer the

justice in accordance with law. Certainly the Tribunal cannot

have contrary to the powers prescribed or the law in force but it

certainly would have to expand its powers and determine the

various controversies in relation to fact and law arising before it.

This Tribunal has the inherent powers not only by implied

application of the above enunciated principles of law but the

provisions of the NGT Act particularly Section 19 of the NGT Act

 which empowers the Tribunal to regulate its own procedure and

to be guided by the Principles of natural justice.


</p><p id="p_67">45. The ancillary question that falls for consideration of the

Tribunal is whether this power of judicial review can be exercised

by the Judicial Tribunals and to what extent?
</p>
<p id="p_68">46. In the case of <a href="/doc/359668/" id="a_47">S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India</a> (1987) 1

SCC 124, the Apex Court in view of its earlier judgment,

considered the essentials of judicial review and its exercise by

alternative institutional mechanism. The court took the view that

the alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement for

judicial review could be framed by the legislature, provided it is

not less efficacious than the High Court but the jurisdiction of the

High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_48">Article 226</a> and that of the Supreme Court

under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_49">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India could not be ousted.

</p><p id="p_69">47. It needs to be noticed that the Supreme Court vide an

interim order passed in Sampat Kumar's case (supra) only which

is reported as (1985) 4 SCC 458, had directed the Government to

amend the existing law and take measures with a view of ensuring

the functioning of the Tribunals along with constitutionally sound

principles.   As a result of compliance to the directions of the

Supreme Court, the challenge before the Supreme Court in the

main Sampat Kumar's case was restricted to the constitutionality

of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_50">Administrative Tribunal Act</a>, 1985 (for

short 'CAT Act'). Inter alia the Court called upon to examine the

question whether the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to strike down

the rule framed by the President of India under the proviso to

 <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_51">Article 309</a> of the Constitution, being violative of Articles 14 and

61 of the Constitution. The Court took the view that the Tribunal

should be a real substitute of the High Court, not only in form but

in content, not de juro but de facto as well. Further, it was held

that the Tribunal has the power of judicial review.     The Court,

while dealing with the provisions of the CAT Act, took the view

that the Tribunal is a substitute of civil courts and High Courts

and has a very wide jurisdiction including the power of judicial

review. Similar view was also expressed by the Court in the case

of <a href="/doc/917853/" id="a_52">J.B. Chopra v. Union of India</a> AIR 1987 SC 357 where the Court

held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">           "2. The Administrative Tribunal being a substitute
          of the High Court had the necessary jurisdiction,
          power and authority to adjudicate upon all disputes
          relating to service matters including the power to
          deal with all questions pertaining to the
          constitutional validity or otherwise of such laws as

      <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_68">29</a>, it becomes apparent that in the case of proceedings
      transferred to the Tribunal from a civil court or High
      Court, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to exercise all
      the powers which the civil court could in a suit or the
      High Court in a writ proceeding could have respectively
      exercised. In an original proceedings instituted before
      the Tribunal under <a href="/doc/982307/" id="a_69">Section 19</a>, the Tribunal can exercise
      any of the powers of a civil court or High Court. The
      Tribunal thus, could exercise only such powers which
      the civil court or the High Court could have exercised by
      way of judicial review. It is neither less nor more.
      Because, the Tribunal is just a substitute to the civil
      court and the High Court. That has been put beyond the
      pale of controversy by this Court while upholding
      constitutional validity of the Act in <a href="/doc/359668/" id="a_70">S.P. Sampath Kumar

<p id="p_71">49. It needs to be noticed at this stage that in the case of <a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_71">L.

Chandra Kumar v. Union of India</a>, (1997) 3 SCC 261, a division

bench of the Supreme Court felt that the decision rendered by the

five judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court in S.P.

Sampath Kumar case (supra) needs to be comprehensively

reconsidered. It was also noticed in their order that there were

divergent views expressed by benches of the Supreme Court post

Sampath Kumar case (supra) and thus, the situation warrants a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                   42</span>
 fresh look by a larger bench over all the issues adjudicated by the

Supreme Court in Sampath Kumar's case.
</p>
<p id="p_72">50. Vide an interim order dated 31st October, 1985 passed in

Sampath Kumar, the Court directed to carry out certain measures

with a view to ensure better functioning of the Tribunal along

constitutionally sound principles.   These changes had already

been incorporated in the Act before Sampath Kumar's case came

up for final hearing. Finally, the Supreme Court concluded that

though judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution, the

vesting of power of judicial review in an alternative institutional

mechanism, after taking it away from the High Courts, would not

do violence to the basic structure so long as it was ensured that

the alternative mechanism was an effective and real substitute for

the High Court. In one of the connecting matters that was being

heard by the larger bench in L. Chandra Kumar (supra), the High

Court had taken a view that the Supreme Court and High Courts

are the sole repositories of the power of judicial review. It could

only be introduced by the Constitutional Courts and no other

alternative mechanism. The contention was that the Constitution

bench judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Sampath

Kumar (supra) defines proposition laid down in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_72">Kesavananda

Bharati v. State of Kerala</a>, (1973) 4 SCC 225.
</p>
<p id="p_73">51. The larger bench in L. Chandra Kumar (Supra) had

considered not only cases that we have afore-referred, but even

post Sampath Kumar cases. In these cases, divergent views had

been taken by various benches of the Supreme Court, either

 following judgment of the Court in Sampath Kumar case or taking

a view contrary thereto. The Supreme Court noticed the entire law

on the subject and noticed with some emphasis that in matters

relating to the laws and service matters which affect the

functioning of Civil Servants, who are an integral part of a sound

governmental    system,   testing   the   constitutionality   of   the

provisions would often arrive for the consideration of a Tribunal.

Specific arguments were raised before the bench, that Section 5(6)

of the CAT Act, in so far as it allows a single member of a Tribunal

to test the constitutional validity of a statutory provision, was

unconstitutional. Also, in so far as it excludes the jurisdiction of

the Supreme Court and the High Courts under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_73">Article 32</a> and <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_74">226</a>

of the Constitution respectively, is unconstitutional as it violates

the basic structure of the Constitution.    The correctness of the

decision of the Sampath Kumar case (supra) was challenged on

various grounds, specifically noticed by the Bench in Para 41 of

the judgment in L. Chandra Kumar (supra). Various contentions

raised were considered by the Bench at great length. It really may

not be necessary for us to refer to all the contentions at any

greater length. It would be sufficient for us to notice the relevant

concluding paragraphs of the judgment that would have a direct

bearing on the matter in issue before us:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      "82. There are pressing reasons why we are anxious to
      preserve the conferment of such a power on these
      Tribunals. When the Framers of our Constitution
      bestowed the powers of judicial review of legislative
      action upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court,
      they ensured that other constitutional safeguards were
      created to assist them in effectively discharging this

 onerous burden. The expectation was that this power
would be required to be used only occasionally.
</blockquote><p id="p_74">However, in the five decades that have ensued since
Independence, the quantity of litigation before the High
Courts has exploded in an unprecedented manner. The
decision in Sampath Kumar's case was rendered against
such a backdrop. We are conscious of the fact that when
a Constitution Bench of this Court in Sampath Kumar's
case adopted the theory of alternative institutional
mechanisms, it was attempting to remedy an alarming
practical situation and the approach selected by it
appeared to be most appropriate to meet the exigencies
of the time. Nearly a decade later, we are now in a
position to review the theoretical and practical results
that have arisen as a consequence of the adoption of
such an approach.
</p><p id="p_75">83.We must, at this stage, focus upon the factual
position which occasioned the adoption of the theory of
alternative institutional mechanisms in Sampath
Kumar's case. In his leading judgment, R. Misra, J.
refers to the fact that since independence, the
population explosion and the increase in litigation had
greatly increased the burden of pendency in the High
Courts. Reference was made to studies conducted
towards relieving the High Courts of their increased
load. In this regard, the recommendations of the Shah
Committee for setting up independent Tribunals as also
the suggestion of the Administrative Reforms
Commission that Civil Service Tribunals be set up, were
noted. Reference was also made to the decision in <a href="/doc/65797394/" id="a_75">K.K.
Dutta v. Union of India</a> : (1980)IILLJ182SC , where this
Court had, while emphasising the need for speedy
resolution    of   service   disputes,  proposed    the
establishment of Service Tribunals.
</p><p id="p_76">86. After analysing the situation existing in the High
Courts     at     length,  the   LCI    made     specific
recommendations towards the establishment of
specialist Tribunals thereby lending force to the
approach adopted in Sampath Kumar's case. The LCI
noted the erstwhile international judicial trend which
pointed towards generalist courts yielding their place to
specialist Tribunals. Describing the pendency in the
High Courts as "catastrophic, crisis ridden, almost
unmanageable, imposing ..an immeasurable burden on
the system", the LCI stated that the prevailing view in
Indian Jurisprudence that the jurisdiction enjoyed by
the High Court is a holy cow required a review. It,
therefore, recommended the trimming of the jurisdiction
of the High Courts by setting up specialist
courts/Tribunals while simultaneously eliminating the
jurisdiction of the High Courts.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                            45</span><p id="p_77">
</p><p id="p_78"> 91. We may first address the issue of exclusion of the
power of judicial review of the High Courts. We have
already held that in respect of the power of judicial
review, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_76">Article
226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_77">/227</a> cannot wholly be excluded. It has been
contended before us that the Tribunals should not be
allowed to adjudicate upon matters where the vires of
legislations is questioned, and that they should restrict
themselves to handling matters where constitutional
issues are not raised. We cannot bring ourselves to
agree to this proposition as that may result in splitting
up proceedings and may cause avoidable delay. If such a
view were to be adopted, it would be open for litigants to
raise constitutional issues, many of which may be quite
frivolous, to directly approach the High Courts and thus
subvert the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. Moreover, even
in these special branches of law, some areas do involve
the consideration of constitutional questions on a
regular basis; for instance, in service law matters, a
large majority of cases involve an interpretation of
Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution. To hold that
the Tribunals have no power to handle matters involving
constitutional issues would not serve the purpose for
which they were constituted. On the other hand, to hold
that all such decisions will be subject to the jurisdiction
of the High Courts under Articles 226/227 of the
Constitution before a Division Bench of the High Court
within whose territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal
concerned falls will serve two purposes. While saving the
power of judicial review of legislative action vested in the
High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_78">Article 226</a><a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_79">/227</a> of the Constitution,
it will ensure that frivolous claims are filtered out
through the process of adjudication in the Tribunal. The
High Court will also have the benefit of a reasoned
decision on merits which will be of use to it in finally
deciding the matter.
</p><p id="p_79">94. Before moving on to other aspects, we may
summarise our conclusions on the jurisdictional powers
of these Tribunals. The Tribunals are competent to hear
matters where the vires of statutory provisions are
questioned. However, in discharging this duty, they
cannot act as substitutes for the High Courts and the
Supreme Court which have, under our constitutional
setup, been specifically entrusted with such an
obligation. Their function in this respect is only
supplementary and all such decisions of the Tribunals
will be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the
respective High Courts. The Tribunals will consequently
also have the power to test the vires of subordinate
legislations and rules. However, this power of the
Tribunals will be subject to one important exception.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                               46</span>
</p><p id="p_80">       The Tribunals shall not entertain any question regarding
      the vires of their parent statutes following the settled
      principle that a Tribunal which is a creature of an Act
      cannot declare that very Act to be unconstitutional. In
      such cases alone, the concerned High Court may be
      approached directly. All other decisions of these
      Tribunals, rendered in cases that they are specifically
      empowered to adjudicate upon by virtue of their parent
      statutes, will also be subject to scrutiny before a
      Division Bench of their respective High Courts. We may
      add that the Tribunals will, however, continue to act as
      the only courts of first instance in respect of the areas of
      law for which they have been constituted. By this, we
      mean that it will not be open for litigants to directly
      approach the High Courts even in cases where they
      question the vires of statutory legislations (except, as
      mentioned, where the legislation which creates the
      particular Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the
      jurisdiction of the concerned Tribunal."
</p>
<p id="p_81">
</p><p id="p_82">52. The Supreme Court has, thus, clearly stated the law as to

the exercise of power of judicial review by the Tribunals. From an

analysis of above paragraphs, it can precisely be stated that the

Tribunal can exercise the power of judicial review but not in

relation to the law that constituted it. Even this limited power of

judicial review is to ensure that the powers of the High Courts and

the Supreme Court in terms of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_80">article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_81">32</a> respectively, are

not entirely excluded. The Tribunal functions to supplement and

not supplant the powers of the High Courts or the Supreme Court

of India. There has to be judicial independence of the Tribunal. It

must inspire confidence and public esteem. It should be manned

by expert minds and persons of judicial acumen and experts from

the relevant field with capacity to decide cases with the judicial

Members. With such judicial powers and functions, the Tribunals

can also exercise limited power of judicial review, of course it



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                                     47</span>
 would not substitute the High Courts and or the Supreme Court.

The Tribunal should have effective and efficacious mechanism.

</p><p id="p_83">53. Another facet of this constitutional aspect is that there

cannot be a total exclusion of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

and the High Courts in terms of Articles 32 and 226 of the

Constitution of India respectively. The plain consequence of such

exclusion would be divesting the High Court of its constitutional

powers, which is impermissible, being the basic structure of the

Constitution of India.    Any such law, even if enacted by the

Parliament, would still be unsustainable, being violative of the

basic structure. Complete exclusion has to be understood in its

correct perspective.     If the decisions of the Tribunal, while

exercising the power of judicial review can be subjected to the

constitutional jurisdiction of the higher courts, in that event also

there is no complete exclusion and the functions of the Tribunal

would only be supplemental. In the case of <a href="/doc/1443146/" id="a_82">State of West Bengal

v. Ashish Kumar Roy and Ors</a>., (2005) 10 SCC 110, the Supreme

Court was concerned with the provisions of the West Bengal Land

Reforms and Tenancy Tribunal Act 1997. The Tribunal had been

given the jurisdiction to entertain disputes with regard to the five

Specified Acts therein.     The issue therein related to certain

provisions of that Act being ultra vires to the Constitution, as well

as declaring the provision directing transfer of cases to the

Tribunal as being violative of the basic structure of the

Constitution. The Supreme Court while declining to declare the

provisions as unconstitutional, took the view that the Tribunal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                                   48</span>
 was performing the functions which may be of a supplementary

role and without complete exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High

Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_83">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The Court

held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">      "21. After analysing the constitutional provisions, the
      Constitutional Bench of this Court pointed out that
      <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_84">Article 323-A</a> and clause (3)(d) of <a href="/doc/1249292/" id="a_85">Article 323-B</a>, to the
      extent they exclude totally the jurisdiction of the High
      Court and the Supreme Court under Articles 226 and
      227 and 32 of the Constitution were unconstitutional.
      The constitutionality of the said provisions was saved by
      the well-known process of reading down the provisions.
      This Court held that while the jurisdiction of the High
      Court under Articles 226/227, and that of the Supreme
      Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_86">Article 32</a>, could not be totally excluded, it
      was yet constitutionally permissible for other courts and
      tribunals to perform a supplementary role in
      discharging the powers conferred on the High Court and
      the Supreme Court by Articles 226/227 and 32 of the
      Constitution, respectively. Hence, it was held that as
      long as tribunals constituted perform a supplementary
      role, without exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High
      Court under Articles 226 and 227 and of the Supreme
      Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_87">Article 32</a> of the Constitution, the validity of
      the legislation constituting such tribunals could not be
      doubted. It was in these circumstances that a direction
      was given that the tribunals would act as authorities of
      the first instance, whose decisions could be challenged
      before the Division Bench of the High Court in its writ
      jurisdiction. Thus the Constitution Bench of this Court
      upheld <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_88">Section 56</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act,
      1985 as valid and constitutional, interpreted in the
      manner indicated in its judgment. We are, therefore,
      unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel
      for the respondent for we are of the view that the matter
      is no longer res integra."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_85">54. It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court in its judgment in L

Chandra Kumar's case (supra) declared dictums of far reaching

consequences     under   our   constitutional   jurisprudence.      In

paragraph 35 of the judgment while referring to constitution of

Tribunals under <a href="/doc/1254475/" id="a_89">Article 323 (b)</a> of the Indian Constitution and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                                                    49</span>
 referring to the provisions of the Constitution which empower

Parliament or State Legislature to enact laws for adjudication of

trial by Tribunals of certain disputes, the Supreme Court said

that the Constitutional provisions therefore, vest in Parliament or

the State legislature as the case may be with power to divest the

traditional Courts of a considerable portion of their judicial work.

Further, in paragraph 90 of the judgment while rejecting the

contention that the Tribunals should not be allowed to adjudicate

upon matters where the vires of the legislation is questioned and

that they should restrict themselves to handling matters where

constitutional issues are not raised. The Supreme Court said we

cannot bring ourselves to agree to this proposition as that may

result in splitting up proceedings and may cause avoidable delay.

If such a view were to be adopted, it would be open for the

litigants to raise constitutional issues, many of which may be

quite frivolous, to directly approach the High Courts and thus

subvert the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. Moreover, in these

special branches of law, some areas do involve the consideration

of constitutional questions on a regular basis; for instance, in

service law matter, a large majority of cases involve an

interpretation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution. To

hold that the Tribunals have no power to handle matters involving

constitutional issues would not serve the purpose for which they

were constituted. The Supreme Court did not declare in

paragraph 98 of judgment that Section 5(6) of CAT Act as

unconstitutional   but   applying   the   doctrine   of   harmonious

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                                  50</span>
 construction and accepting that cases involving the questions of

interpretation of statutory provision or rule in relation to the

Constitution arises, the same was directed to be heard by a bench

consisting of at least a Judicial Member.
</p>
<p id="p_86">
</p><p id="p_87">55. The above declaration of law by the highest Court of the land

unambiguously support the view that the Tribunal within the

framework of the NGT Act would be entitled to exercise power of

the judicial review within its prescribed limitations. As already

noticed, the questions of interpretation of law, examination of

Notifications, their correctness or otherwise is being raised before

the Tribunal every day. The questions of law had environmental

issues are so closely linked that it would hardly be possible to

fully and finally decide the cases by segregating the jurisdiction

which is neither the purport of the Act. These questions can

squarely be heard and decide by the Tribunal keeping in view the

constitution of the Bench which is always presided by judicial

Member as per the constitution of the Benches prescribed under

the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_88">56. In light of the unequivocal law stated by the Supreme Court

in L. Chandra Kumar's case (supra), and other cases afore-

noticed, we may relook the provisions and the legislative scheme

of the NGT Act. First and foremost, there is no provision in the

NGT Act that completely excludes the jurisdiction of the High

Courts and/or that of the Supreme Court under Articles 226 or

227 and 32 of the Constitution of India. In terms of <a href="/doc/248520/" id="a_90">Section 29</a> of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                                  51</span>
 the NGT Act, it excludes the jurisdiction of the civil courts to

entertain any appeal or settle any dispute in relation to the matter

specified and the matter which the Tribunal is empowered to

determine under its appellate jurisdiction.                  The civil court's

jurisdiction to grant injunction is also excluded in those matters.

A statutory appeal against the orders of the NGT lies to the

Supreme Court of India in terms of <a href="/doc/943860/" id="a_91">Section 22</a> of the Act. Both

these provisions read co-jointly with other provisions of the Act,

clearly   state    the   position    that      there   is   no    exclusion   of

constitutional     courts   by      specific    words       or   by   necessary

implication.      Complete procedure for settlement of disputes and

hearing of appeals is provided under the provisions of the Act,

including how the appeals or proceedings are to be instituted

before the Tribunal and the manner in which they would be

adjudicated upon.        The Tribunal is completely independent in

discharge of its judicial functions and no authority of the

executive or any other organ of the State has any say or opinion

over the functioning of the Tribunal.             The Tribunal consists of

sitting or former Supreme Court Judge as Chairperson, Chief

Justice/Judges of the High Courts as its Judicial Members and

experts of outstanding acumen in various fields of environment as

Expert Members. Every Bench has to have one Judicial and one

Expert Member for hearing the matters. The presiding members

of the NGT are not administrative officers but duly represent the

State to administer justice and perform judicial functions.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                                              52</span>
</p><p id="p_89"> 57. There is also no provision in the Act that specifically or even

by implication is suggestive of the legislative intent to exclude the

power of judicial review of the Tribunal.     The power of judicial

review in the scheme of the NGT Act would be implicit and

essential for expeditious and effective disposal of the cases. <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_92">The

Act</a> itself has been enacted for expeditious and effective disposal

of environmental cases and that itself would stand defeated if

every question relating to examining the validity and correctness

of subordinate or delegated legislation under the Scheduled Acts

is to be first examined by a Constitutional Court and then the

matter has to be relegated to the Tribunal. The very object and the

purpose of the Act would then stand defeated and frustrated.

</p><p id="p_90">58. In fact, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as stated under

<a href="/doc/796793/" id="a_93">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1250406/" id="a_94">15</a> and <a href="/doc/1330702/" id="a_95">16</a> of the Act, not only vests a very wide

jurisdiction in the Tribunal, but by necessary implication gives

the power of judicial review to the Tribunal. It will be travesty of

justice if it was to be held that the Tribunal does not have the

power to examine the correctness or otherwise or constitutional

validity of a Notification issued under one of the Scheduled Acts to

the NGT Act. In the absence of such power, there cannot be an

effective and complete decision on the substantial environmental

issues that may be raised before the Tribunal, in exercise of the

jurisdiction vested in the Tribunal under the provisions of the Act.

Besides all this, the Tribunal has the complete trappings of a

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_91">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                                                   53</span>
</p><p id="p_92"> 59. The courts have drawn a fine distinction between a 'court'

and a 'tribunal'. However, this fine distinction is going thinner by

the day. The word 'Tribunal' is a word of wide import and the

words 'courts and tribunals' embrace within them the exercise of

judicial power in all its forms. In the case of <a href="/doc/1300797/" id="a_96">S.D. Joshi and Ors.

v. High</a> Court of Judicature at Bombay and Ors., (2011) 1 SCC

252, the Supreme Court         referred to the judgment of the

Constitution Bench of that Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1531171/" id="a_97">Harinagar Sugar

Mills Ltd. v. Shyam Sunder Jhunjhunwala</a>, AIR 1961 SC 1669

where the Court discussed the distinction between a 'Court' and a

'Tribunal'. In the said case, the Constitution Bench of the

Supreme Court was dealing with the question whether the Central

Government while exercising appellate powers under <a href="/doc/1907970/" id="a_98">Section 111</a>

of the Companies Act,1956 (before its amendment by Act 65 of

1960) would be a Court or a Tribunal and if it is subject to

appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_99">Article 136</a> of

the Constitution.    A direct question arose as to when such

authority could be termed as a 'Tribunal' or 'Court'. The Supreme

Court followed the test stated in The King      v.   London County

Council, [1931] 2 K.B. 215, where L.J Scrutton stated as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "It is not necessary that it should be a court in the sense
      in which this Court is a court; it is enough if it is
      exercising, after hearing evidence, judicial functions in
      the sense that it has to decide on evidence between a
      proposal and an opposition; and it is not necessary to be
      strictly a court; if it is a tribunal which has to decide
      rights after hearing evidence and opposition, it is
      amenable to the writ of certiorari."
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                                                    54</span>
<p id="p_93"> 60. Further, referring to the trappings of a judicial tribunal, the

Supreme Court in the case of Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd (supra)

observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_94">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">      "16. The Attorney-General contended that even if the
      Central Government was required by the provisions of
      the Act and the rules to act judicially, the Central
      Government still not being a tribunal, this Court has no
      power to entertain an appeal against its order or
      decision. But the proceedings before the Central
      Government have all the trappings of a judicial tribunal.
      Pleadings have to be filed, evidence in support of the
      case of each party has to be furnished and the disputes
      have to be decided according to law after considering the
      representations made by the parties. If it be granted that
      the Central Government exercises judicial power of the
      State to adjudicate upon rights of the parties in civil
      matters when there is a lis between the contesting
      parties, the conclusion is inevitable that it acts as a
      tribunal and not as an executive body. We therefore
      overrule the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the
      Union of India and by the respondents as to the
      maintainability of the appeals."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_95">61. The word 'Court' is used to designate those tribunals which

are set up in an organized state for the administration of justice.

When a lis is pending between the parties and is adjudicated

upon by the Tribunal, following the procedure in accordance with

the rules of law and when it administers justice, the Tribunal

dealing with such lis will have the trappings of a Court.

</p><p id="p_96">62. Finally, the Supreme Court took the view that all Tribunals

are not courts though all Courts are tribunals.      This view has

been reiterated by the Court, more particularly in relation to

drawing a distinction between the two terms. A 'Tribunal' may be

termed as a 'Court' if it has all the trappings of a court and

satisfies the essential parameters. Every court may be a tribunal


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                   55</span>
 but every tribunal necessarily may not be a court.        There are

many tribunals which have trappings of a court.


</p><p id="p_97">63. It may not be possible to state precisely the parameters that

would determine whether a Tribunal is a court or not.         It will

largely depend upon the facts, provisions of the relevant Acts and

the functions that the said Tribunal is performing.       Generally,

where a Tribunal determines the issues before it, gives a final

decision, has the power to hear witnesses and gives decision

affecting rights of the parties, the orders of such Tribunal are

appealable. Then such Tribunals could be termed as a 'Court'.

There could be specialized Tribunals also which deal with the

cases of a particular subject, has the powers of a court and

maintains judicial independence; its members are all of judicial

acumen and expertise. It again may be a relevant consideration

that the Tribunal is a creature of a statute and is vested with the

powers to adjudicate and determine the disputes between the

parties which fall within the scope and ambit of its jurisdiction, in

accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Tribunal is a part

of an ordinary hierarchy in the administration of justice and is

akin to a Court. The Supreme Court has also held that though

the independence of judiciary stricto sensu applied to the Court

system, by necessary implication, it would also apply to Tribunals

whose functioning is quasi-judicial and akin to the Court system

and the entire administration of justice has to be so independent

and managed by persons of legal acumen, expertise and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                   56</span>
 experience that persons demanding justice must not only receive

justice, but should also have the faith that justice would be done

(<a href="/doc/47938967/" id="a_100">Union of India v. Namit Sharma</a>, AIR 2014 SC 122). The Supreme

Court in S.D. Joshi case (supra) also accepted the Family Courts

as Courts in view of the fact that it had the trappings of a court

and satisfied the essential parameters. However, the Judges of

the family court independently appointed were considered not to

be part of the regular higher judicial services cadre of that State.


</p><p id="p_98">64. Under the NGT Act, as already noticed, this Tribunal

performs all judicial functions and determines the disputes

between the parties in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

It evolves its own procedure in consonance with the principles of

natural justice and is not strictly bound by the provisions of the

CPC. But, at the same time, for discharging its functions under

the NGT Act, the Tribunal is vested with the powers as are vested

in a civil court under the CPC. Furthermore, all the proceedings

before the Tribunal shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings

within the meaning of <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_101">Sections 193</a>, <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_102">219</a> and <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_103">228</a> for the purposes

of <a href="/doc/814524/" id="a_104">Section 196</a> of the Indian Penal Code,1860 and the Tribunal

shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_105">Section 195</a>

and Chapter 26<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_106"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in terms

of <a href="/doc/1529673/" id="a_107">Sections 19(4)</a> and (5) of the NGT Act. Jurisdiction of the Civil

Court is barred under Section 29 of the NGT Act.       Thus, in our

considered view, the National Green Tribunal has all the trappings

of a court and is vested with original, appellate and special


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                       57</span>
 jurisdiction, performing exclusively judicial functions and hence is

a Court.
</p>
<p id="p_99">65. Having come to the conclusion that National Green Tribunal

has all the trappings of a Court and is, thus, a Court and further

that within the framework of the NGT Act, the Tribunal is vested

with the power of judicial review, still we will have to deal with the

contention raised on behalf of the Respondents, particularly, the

Project Proponent, that there is no provision in the NGT Act which

empowers it to exercise the power of judicial review and that the

Tribunal cannot examine the correctness or constitutional validity

of even a subordinate or delegated legislation. In the present case,

under the Notification of 2011, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is a

very limited one. Major part of this contention we have already

dealt with. Much emphasis have been placed upon the judgments

of the Supreme Court in the cases of PTC India Limited v. CERC,

(2010) 4 SCC 603, <a href="/doc/28441/" id="a_108">Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v. Telecom

Regulatory Authority of India &amp; Ors</a>., (2014) 1 Comp LJ 229 <a href="/doc/1885523/" id="a_109">SC

margin at 4 paise/kWh for inter-state trading of electricity. The

appellant before the Supreme Court had challenged the validity of

the Regulations so framed, inter alia on the ground that the

Commission could cap trading margin by issuing an order under

<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_110">section 79(1)(j)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, and not by issuing

regulations under <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_111">Section 178</a>. The Appellate Tribunal rejected

appeal on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction under

<a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_112">Sections 111</a> and <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_113">121</a> to examine the validity of the Regulations.

The appellants preferred the statutory appeal under <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_114">Section 125</a>

to the Supreme Court of India which was heard by three judges

bench. The Bench felt that the appeal involved important question

of law and the matter was referred to the Constitution Bench of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court.       In the Order of reference, the

question formulated was with regard to the power of the Tribunal

to decide questions as to the validity of the Regulations framed by

the Central Commission. It related to the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_115">Section

111</a> and <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_116">121</a> of the 2003 Act. The Constitutional Bench stated

that the case involved the doctrine and jurisprudence of delegated

legislation and the power of the judicial review by the appellate

Tribunal. In the very opening of the judgment, the following

questions of law were framed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      (a) Whether the Appellate Tribunal under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_117">Electricity

</blockquote>

<p id="p_102">67. The Court referred to the various Sections of the Act as well

as the Regulations. It referred to the functions and duties of the

authority, constitution of the Central Commission and its

functions. It also noticed <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_122">Section 111</a> of the 2003 Act, under

which appeal laid to the appellate Tribunal. Reference was also

made to <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_123">Sections 177</a> and <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_124">178</a>, under which the authority and

Rules and Regulations framed under these Sections were required

to be laid before the Parliament in terms of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_125">Section 179</a>. <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_126">Section

similar manner.

provisions of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_127">Section 111</a> of the 2003 Act. Referring to the

language of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_128">Section 111</a>, which empowers the appellate authority

to hear an appeal against the order made by the appropriate

Commission, the Court came to the conclusion that on general

application, the provisions indicate the width of powers conferred

on CERC.    The Regulations framed were thus in the nature of

subordinate legislation and which could be made in exercise of its

 the word 'order' under <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_130">section 111</a> of the 2003 Act cannot include

regulations framed under <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_131">Section 178</a> of the 2003 Act.


</p><p id="p_105">69. Further, the Court while referring to the ambit of powers of

the Tribunal in terms of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_132">Section 121</a> of the Act stated that the

expression 'issue such orders, instructions or directions as may

deem fit' in <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_133">Section 121</a>, does not confer power of judicial review

to the Tribunal. Referring to the case of <a href="/doc/1712107/" id="a_134">Raman and Raman Ltd. v.

the State of Madras and Ors</a>, AIR 1959 SC 694, the Court stated

that the authority was vested with the power to issue directions

which was administrative in character.
</p>
<p id="p_106">
</p><p id="p_107">70. We may notice that language of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_135">Section 121</a> clearly states

that after hearing the appropriate Commission, the appellate

authority can issue orders, instructions or directions but only for

the purposes of appropriate Commission to perform its statutory

functions. On the plain construction of the language of the

Section, it is clear that the power of judicial review was neither

vested nor can be impliedly construed, as it would fall much

beyond the language of the Section.
</p>
<p id="p_108">
</p><p id="p_109">71. We may also notice that the power to make regulations

under <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_136">Section 178</a> of the Act cannot be subjected to challenge

within the scope of <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_137">Section 111</a> and <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_138">Section 121</a> of the Act.

Furthermore, to put the matters beyond ambiguity and to ensure

that the law is clearly stated in the judgment in relation to these

regulations, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                                                 61</span>
 that the Tribunal is not vested with the power of judicial review in

relation to regulations framed under <a href="/doc/1529733/" id="a_139">Section 178</a> of the Act. It was

clearly noticed that the judgment would have no applicability as a

principle of law and was confined to the facts of that case.

Paragraph 94 of the judgment reads as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">         "Our summary of findings and answer to the reference

         of law to be applied to Appellate Tribunals vis-a-vis
         Regulatory Commissions under other enactments. In
         particular, we make it clear that the decision may not be
         taken as expression of any view in regard to the powers
         of the securities Appellate Tribunal vis-a-vis Securities

<p id="p_110">72. It may also be noticed that the Judgment of the Constitution

brought to the notice of the Constitution Bench in this case (PTC

case).

framed the following preliminary issue:

<p id="p_115">75. The appeals before the Supreme Court were filed by Bharat

Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), Cellular Operators Association of

India (COAI) and Ors., against the order dated 28th May, 2010

passed by the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal

(for short 'TDSAT'), whereby, the appeal preferred by BSNL

against the Telecommunication Interconnection (Port Charges)

Amendment Regulation (1 of 2007) was allowed and the Authority

was directed to give fresh look at the Regulations and the BSNL

was directed not to claim any amount from the operator during

the interregnum, i.e., from the date of coming into force of the

Regulations and the date of the Order. Port charges were

prescribed   under    Schedule   3   of   the   Telecommunication

Interconnection (Charges and Revenue Sharing) Regulations,

1999, which came into force on 28th May, 1999. By virtue of

clause 8, the Regulations were given overriding effect qua the

interconnection agreements. Upon challenge, the High Court held

the Regulations framed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_145">Section 36</a> of the Act could not be

given overriding effect. The port charges were specified in the

Schedule to the amended Regulations, which were challenged and

were allowed by the TDSAT.

</p><p id="p_117"> 76. From the above noticed facts, it is clear that the Court was

only dealing with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1171314/" id="a_146">Telecom Regulatory

Authority of India Act</a>, 1997 (for short 'TRAI') and was concerned

with the question whether the Authority was vested with the

power of judicial review keeping in view the various provisions of

the Act. After noticing the sections particularly <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_147">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_148">14(a)</a>

and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_149">14(b)</a> of the Act, the Court came to the conclusion that the

Appellate Tribunal was not vested with the power of judicial

review, to examine the validity or constitutionality of the

regulations framed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_150">Section 36</a> of the Act. In Para 52 of the

judgment, the Supreme Court stated that while entertaining

appeals under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_151">Section 18</a> of the Act, the High Court itself was not

vested with the power of judicial review in terms of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_152">Section 14</a>.

The amendment made in the year 2000 intended to vest the

original jurisdiction of the Authority in TDSAT. The appellate

jurisdiction exercisable by the High Court was also vested with

the TDSAT vide <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_153">Section 14(b)</a> but that did not include decision

made by the Authority. The Bench held:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      "Since High Court while hearing appeal did not have
      power of judicial review of subordinate legislation, the
      transferee adjudicatory forum, i.e., TDSAT cannot

</blockquote>
<p id="p_118">77. In this judgment, heavy reliance was placed by the Bench

upon the judgment of the Court in the case of PTC India Ltd.

(supra) and the Court in this case also held that the expression

'direction, decision or order' would not include regulations framed

under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_155">Section 36</a> of the Act. The Supreme Court in this case


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                                  64</span>
 distinguished the judgment of the larger bench in L. Chandra

Kumar (supra) on the ground that language of Section 14 of the

CAT Act was very wide. The judgment in that case and in the case

of <a href="/doc/522930/" id="a_156">Union of India v. Madras Bar Association</a>, (supra), did not have a

bearing on the decision of the question formulated by the Bench

and it held that TDSAT does not have the jurisdiction to entertain

the challenge to the regulations framed by the Authority under

<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_157">Section 36</a> of the Act. It requires to be noticed at this stage that

the Authority as well as the Appellate Tribunal are creations of the

same statute and examination of the regulation under the Act

which created them could hardly be examined by the said

Appellate Authority. Furthermore, the language of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_158">section 14</a>

which establishes the Appellate Tribunal restricts the jurisdiction

in specific terms. The jurisdiction of the Appellate Tribunal is only

to settle dispute between parties stated in the provision of this

Act. The power is restricted by the very section that creates the

appellate Tribunal. Furthermore, under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_159">Section 14(a)</a>, the power

of the Appellate Tribunal to decide application for disputes and

appeals preferred is to be in terms of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_160">Section 14(a)</a> sub-section(1)

and the 'direction, decision or order' of the Authority would not

include the regulations framed under the provisions of the same

Act. In light of these clearly stated provisions, it is apparently

clear that this judgment would have no application to the facts of

the present case and the statutory provisions are not pari materia

to the provisions of the NGT Act. More importantly, the Tribunal is

not examining the constitutionality, legality or validity of any of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                                                   65</span>
 the provisions framed under the NGT Act or an action purported

to be have been taken under the provisions of that Act which has

created this Tribunal.

West Bengal Electricity Regulation Commission (supra):


</p><p id="p_120">78. In this case, the Supreme Court was concerned with

examining the correctness of the judgment of the High Court,

which in an appeal before it had allowed appeals of the

companies, re-determined the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory

Commission by an Order dated 7th November, 2001 and

determined the tariff for the sale of electricity by the Calcutta

Electricity Supply Company Ltd. for the years 2000-2001 and

2001-2002.     Being aggrieved by this fixation of tariff, the

Company preferred an appeal before the High Court of Calcutta

under <a href="/doc/718656/" id="a_161">Section 27</a> of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act,

1998. Upon publication of the tariff so formulated, the Supreme

Court was concerned with the question whether the consumers

had the legal right or not to be heard in the proceedings before the

Commission under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_162">Section 29(2)</a> of the 1998 Act, as also in an

appeal under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_163">Section 27</a> of the said Act.      The High Court had

taken a negative view on the above question. Other question

raised was whether the High Court can exercise powers under

Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India while hearing an

appeal under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_164">Section 27of</a> the Act. The Supreme Court concluded

that the High Court while exercising its statutory appellate power

 under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_165">Section 27</a> of the Act could not have gone into the validity

of the regulations which are part of the statute itself.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">80. The contention of the Respondents before us is that the

language of Para 45 above would have to be construed as that the

Tribunal cannot question the vires of the provisions of any Act

with which it is dealing, in exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it

under the provisions of the NGT Act. We are afraid that this

argument is misconceived. The legal proposition stated in Para 45

above is undisputable. In fact, we have referred to some of the

judgments above stating the same proposition. The law is that the

National Green Tribunal cannot decide questions relating to the

vires of the NGT Act under which it is created, but this cannot be

extended to the examination relating to the vires, validity or

legality of the Notifications or actions taken in furtherance to the

Scheduled Acts under the NGT Act over which this Tribunal

  exercises exclusive jurisdiction. Referring to the case in hand, the

 Tribunal is not examining any provision of the NGT Act or any

 Notification issued in exercise of delegated or subordinate

 legislation under the NGT Act. The CRZ Notifications are issued

 under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_170">Environment (Protection) Act</a>, 1986

 and the Rules framed thereunder, which is not the Act under

 which the Tribunal has either been created or been functioning.

<p id="p_139">
</p><p id="p_140">82. A comparative study of the various provisions under the

afore referred Acts, in fact, gives a much wider power to the

Chairperson of National Green Tribunal in relation to the

transfer of cases.   Rule 3 of The National Green Tribunal

(Practices and Procedure) Rules, 2011 (for short 'Rules of

2011') states that the decision of the Chairperson as regards

whether the matter falls within the purview of the business

allocated to a place of the sitting or not, would be final. Such

a provision is conspicuous by its very absence in the most of

the other Acts relating to different Tribunals. The provisions

relating to the powers of Chairperson for allocation of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                                                              88</span>
 business, transfer of cases and constitution of benches have

to be construed in light of the settled principles. These

aspects are the prerogative of the head of the Tribunal and

even judicial discipline and proprietary, being two significant

facets of administration of justice, have to be the precepts for

such interpretation. Such interpretation should be given that

would adhere to these principles and not be in opposition

thereto. At this stage, we may notice that in the absence of

any specific provision in relation to the power of the Chief

Justice of a High Court to transfer cases from one bench to

another and in relation to marking of cases, roaster of the

benches and matters relating thereto are the exclusive

prerogative of the Chief Justice.     In the case of <a href="/doc/172073149/" id="a_263">Kishore

Samrite v. State of U.P</a>, (2013) 2 SCC 398, the Supreme Court

held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">     "25. The roaster and placing of cases before different
     Benches of the High Court is unquestionably the
     prerogative of the Chief Justice of that Court. In the
     High Courts, which have Principal and other
     Benches, there is a practice and as per rules, if
     framed, that the senior most Judge at the Benches,
     other than the Principal Bench, is normally
     permitted to exercise powers of the Chief Justice, as
     may be delegated to the senior most Judge. In
     absence of the Chief Justice, the senior most Judge
     would pass directions in regard to the roaster of the
     Judges and listing of cases. Primarily, it is exclusive
     prerogative of the Chief Justice and does not admit
     any ambiguity or doubt in this regard.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">     29. Judicial discipline and propriety are the two
     significant facets of administration of justice. Every
     court is obliged to adhere to these principles to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">                                                               89</span>
       ensure hierarchical discipline on the one hand and
      proper dispensation of justice on the other. Settled
      canons of law prescribe adherence to the rule of law
      with due regard to the prescribed procedures.
      Violation thereof may not always result in
      invalidation of the judicial action but normally it
      may cast a shadow of improper exercise of judicial
      discretion. When extraordinary jurisdiction, like the
      writ jurisdiction, is very vast in its scope and
      magnitude, there it imposes a greater obligation
      upon the courts to observe due caution while
      exercising such powers. This is to ensure that the
      principles of natural justice are not violated and
      there is no occasion of impertinent exercise of
      judicial discretion."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_141">83. Having due regard to the stated principles in light of the

facts before us, we have no hesitation in coming to the

conclusion that the Chairperson of the National Green

Tribunal, in terms of the provisions of the NGT Act, Rules of

2011 and the general practice in relation to such matters, is

vested with the power to transfer cases from one bench to

another, from one ordinary place of sitting to other place of

sitting or even to a place other than that.
</p>
<p id="p_142">
</p><p id="p_143">84. The National Green Tribunal is vested with the wide

jurisdiction which includes the powers of civil court, complete

judicial independence, restriction-free procedure, authority and

the determinative process, the power to pass final orders; which

could be appealed only in accordance with the provisions of the

Act, jurisdiction to hear all civil cases relating to environment and

further the scheme of the Act sufficiently provides for exercise of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                                                                   90</span>
 power of judicial review in relation to the specified subjects by the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_144">
</p><p id="p_145">85. The Courts and Tribunals that are engaged in judicial

functions dispensing justice to the public at large are expected to

have powers which are necessary to perform its basic functions.

As already noticed, unless there is a specific exclusion, such

normal powers stated to be inherent in its functioning. The

Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1136885/" id="a_264">Grindlays Bank Ltd vs Central

Government Industrial Tribunal And Ors</a>. AIR 1981 SC 606 while

dealing with the powers of the Tribunal in relation to setting aside

ex parte award in absence of any such power and the award

which has become enforceable as a result of its being published

rejecting the contention that the Tribunal had become functus

officio, Court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      "We are of the opinion that the Tribunal had the power to
      pass the impugned order if it thought fit in the interest of
      justice. It is true that there is no express provision in the
      Act or the rules framed thereunder giving the Tribunal
      jurisdiction to do so. But it is a well-known rule of
      statutory construction that a Tribunal or body should be
      considered to be endowed with such ancillary or
      incidental powers as are necessary to discharge its
      functions effectively for the purpose of doing justice
      between the parties. In a case of this nature, we are of
      the view that the Tribunal should be considered as
      invested with such incidental or ancillary powers unless
      there is any indication in the statute to the contrary. We
      do not find any such statutory prohibition. On the other
      hand, there are indications to the contrary."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_146">86. From the above, it is clear that ancillary or incidentally

powers which are necessary to discharge its functions effectively

for the purpose of doing justice between the parties should be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">                                                                      91</span>
 considered to be endowed. If the power of judicial review in its

limited scope is not expected to be endowed upon the Tribunal

then majority of the cases wherein Orders, Circulars, Notifications

issued in exercise of subordinate legislation are challenged could

not be fully and completely decided by the Tribunal, though they

exclusively fall in the domain of the Tribunal.


</p><p id="p_147">87. Another very important aspect that cannot be overlooked by

the Tribunal is that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_265">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is a

discretionary jurisdiction to be exercised by the High Courts. It

does not give an absolute right to a person.              For variety of

reasons, the High Court may decline to entertain a petition in

exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_266">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, while

the NGT Act gives a statutory right to an applicant, aggrieved

person or any person to approach the Tribunal in all matters

relating to Acts specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act. It is not a

discretionary   jurisdiction   like   under     <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_267">Article   226</a>   of    the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_148">
</p><p id="p_149">88. On a comparative analysis of various provisions of the

different Acts afore-stated, it is evident that power, jurisdiction,

judicial   independence,   exclusion   of     jurisdiction   and     other

determinative factors prescribed under the NGT Act are of wide

connotation and are free of restrictions. <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_268">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_269">15</a> and <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_270">16</a>

read co-jointly give three different jurisdictions to the Tribunal

over all disputes and appeals relating to various fields of

environment.    The jurisdiction is exercisable in relation to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                                                        92</span>
 matters arising from any or all of the Scheduled Acts. Examined

objectively, the provisions of the NGT Act are more akin to the

provisions of the CAT Act, in contradistinction to the provisions of

the TDSAT. The various features and aspects of the NGT Act that

we have discussed above would bring the case before the Tribunal

within the ambit of L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), as opposed to

the case being covered by BSNL case (supra). We have already

dealt above, in some elaboration, the aspect as to how the cases

relied upon by the respondents do not apply to the facts of the

present case, keeping in view the provisions and the legislative

scheme of the referred Acts and various judicial pronouncements.

At the cost of repetition, we may record here that the language of

the various provisions of the NGT Act by necessary implication

gives power of judicial review to the Tribunal. There is no specific

or even by necessary implication exclusion of such power

indicated in any of the provisions. Furthermore, in the scheme of

various environmental acts and if the object and purpose of such

acts are to be achieved then the power of judicial review would

have to be read into the provisions of the NGT Act.          If the

notifications issued under any of the Scheduled Acts, by virtue of

the powers vested by subordinate or delegated legislation, are

ultra vires the Act itself or are unconstitutional as they violate

Articles 14 or 19 of the Constitution of India, then it has to be

construed that the Tribunal is vested with the power of examining

such notifications so as to completely and comprehensively decide

the disputes, applications, appeals before it.      Of course, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                                                  93</span>
 powers of the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles

226 and 32 of the Constitution of India have not been excluded

under the provisions of the NGT Act, thus ensuring that the

Tribunal performs supplemental functions and does not supplant

the Higher Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_150">
</p><p id="p_151">89. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1266374/" id="a_271">K.S. Venkatraman and Co.

v. State of Madras</a>, (1966) 2 SCR 229, has stated the proposition

that an authority or Tribunal constituted under an Act cannot,

unless expressly so authorised, question the validity of the Act or

any provisions thereof under which it is constituted. This is a

sound principle and has been followed consistently. To put it in

other words, a Tribunal or an authority constituted under an Act

can even examine the validity of the provisions of the Act which

created it, provided it is so expressly authorized by the Act itself.

This Tribunal is not travelling into that realm of law, but is

concerned with the validity of the notifications issued under the

Acts other than the Act that created the National Green Tribunal.

For this proposition, we have referred to various judgments above.


Subordinate or Delegated Legislation and Executive Order:


</p><p id="p_152">90. During the course of arguments, an attempt has been made

to raise an issue as to whether issuance of CRZ Notifications is an

act of subordinate legislation or is an executive act. This

distinction has to be clearly understood in terms of law to enable

the Tribunal to examine the merit or otherwise of this contention

and the consequences thereof. In our Constitution 'doctrine of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                                                                   94</span>
 separation of power' clearly demarcates the areas of operation of

respective organs of the State. <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_272">Article 13(3)</a> of the Constitution

defines 'law' which includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule,

regulation, notification, custom or usages having in the territory

of India the force of law. The Indian Constitution does not contain

any express or implied prohibition against delegation of legislative

powers. Delegated legislation is not a new phenomenon. Ever

since statutes came to be enacted by the Parliament, the concept

of delegated legislation also came into existence. In exercise of

such delegated power, the concern authority framed rules or

regulations. The exigencies of the modern state, specially, the

social and economic reforms have given rise to making of

delegated   legislation   on   a   large   scale.   Salmond   (Salmond

jurisprudence 12th edition page 116) defines "delegated legislation"

as "that which proceeds from any authority other than the

sovereign power and is, therefore, dependent for its continued

existence and validity on some superior or supreme authority".

One of the reasons for delegating the power to legislate to the

Government is that the areas for which powers are given to make

delegated legislation may be so complex that it may not be

possible and even may be difficult to set up all the permutations

in the statute. The statute may not be so comprehensively drafted

so as to provide for all and every situation, thus, to make a law

efficacious, practical and effective, normally, the tool of delegated

legislation is called in aid. Legislature is to make or enact laws.

'<a href="/doc/1369884/" id="a_273">Legislative Act</a>', as defined in The Law Lexicon, 3rd ed. 2012, is an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                                                    95</span>
 Act which prescribes what the law shall be in future cases arising

under it; an act of legislative department of the Government, by

which the law to be applied in future cases under particular

states of fact is established in the form of statute, ordinance, or

other written form. The expression 'executive action' as appearing

in <a href="/doc/1838225/" id="a_274">Article 166(1)</a> of the Constitution is comprehensive enough and

apt to include even orders which emerge after, and embody the

results of a judicial or quasi-judicial disposal by Government.

(<a href="/doc/1870357/" id="a_275">Pioneer Motors Ltd. v. O.M.A Majeed</a>, AIR 1957 Mad 48, 51).


</p><p id="p_153">91. The Oxford Dictionary of English, 3rd Edition, 2010 describes

'executive order' as a rule or order issued by the President to an

executive branch of the government and having the force of law.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_276">U.O.I v. Cynamide India

Ltd. and Anr</a>. etc., (1987) 2 SCC 720, stated the distinction

between the executive order and power of legislation as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">      "7. The distinction between the two has usually been
      expressed as 'one between the general and the
      particular'.'A legislative act is the creation and
      promulgation of a general rule of conduct without
      reference to particular cases; an administrative act is
      the making and issue of a specific direction or the
      application of a general rule to a particular case in
      accordance with the requirements of policy'. 'Legislation
      is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct
      without reference to particular cases and usually
      operating in future; administration is the process of
      performing particular acts, of issuing particular orders
      or of making decisions which apply general rules to
      particular cases.' It has also been said "Rule making is
      normally     directed    toward   the   formulation     of
      requirements having a general application to all
      members of a broadly identifiable class" while,
      "adjudication, on the other hand, applies to specific
      individuals or situations". But, this is only a bread
      distinction, not necessarily always true. Administration

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                                                   96</span>
       and administrative adjudication may also be of general
      application and there may be legislation of particular
      application only. That is not ruled out. Again,
      adjudication determines past and present facts and
      declares rights and liabilities while legislation indicates
      the future course of action. Adjudication is
      determinative of the past and the present while
      legislation is indicative of the future. The object of the
      rule, the reach of its application, the rights and
      obligations arising out of it, its intended effect on past,
      present and future events, its form, the manner of its
      promulgation are some factors which may help in
      drawing the line between legislative and non-legislative
      acts."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_154">92. An act of issuing a Notification is a part of a legislative

action. The Notification issued by the Government or any

competent authority in exercise of its delegated powers can be

judicially noticed. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/23940/" id="a_277">State v. Gopal

Singh</a> on 21 September, 1956 CriLJ 621 held that "such a

notification is a part of the law itself and, therefore, judicial notice

of the notification can be taken." In exercise of the power of

subordinate legislation when a regulation is made and is validly

approved by the legislation, if so required. It becomes a part of

the Act and should be read as such (<a href="/doc/1751605/" id="a_278">Uttar Pradesh Power

Corporation Ltd v. NTPC</a>, (2009) 6 SCC 235). The executive order

may not be a law but a legislative order is part of the law (<a href="/doc/121478/" id="a_279">Edward

Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Ajmer', (S</a>) 1955 1 SCR 735)


</p><p id="p_155">93. The Supreme Court while dealing with the cases involving

challenge to such Orders and Notifications, stated the precepts

<p id="p_157">94. From the afore-stated principles, there is clear distinction

between a legislative order/notification and an executive order

and the consequences thereof in law. Even a delegated or

subordinate legislation can be challenged on some of the similar

grounds upon which the principal legislation itself can be

challenged. In the case of <a href="/doc/317461/" id="a_284">Mahalakshmi Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. and

Anr. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors</a>., (2009) 16 SCC, 569, the

legislation can be challenged on all those grounds on which the

validity of a legislation can be challenged. The grounds are as

follows: it is ultra vires the Constitution; it is ultra vires of the

parent Act; It is contrary to the statutory provisions other than

those contained in the parent legislation; The law making power

has been exercised unreasonably or in bad faith or goes against

the legislative policy and does not fulfil the object and purpose of

the parent Act. Thus, the power of judicial review would extend

both to legislative as well as acts of delegated or subordinate

legislation. The correctness and legality of an executive order can

be challenged besides these grounds, on arbitrariness, culpable

the authority passing the order etc.


</p><p id="p_158">95. Reverting to the present case the CRZ Notification dated 19th

February, 1991, which has been amended on 3rd of October,

2001, was issued in exercise of the powers conferred under

<a href="/doc/105902756/" id="a_285">Section 3(1)</a> and Section (2) (v) of the Act of 1986 and Rule 5(3) (d)

of the Rules of 1986, in declaring coastal stretches as coastal

regulation zone and for regulating activities in the coastal

regulation zone. The legislature has delegated legislative power to

the Central Government to take all measures as it deems

necessary or expedient for the purposes of protecting and

improving quality of the environment and preventing controlling

and abating environmental pollution. This is a very wide power,

which has been vested in the Central Government by delegated

legislation under these provisions. In the exercise of its powers

and with the object of satisfying the stated purpose, the

Notification of 2011 has been issued under the power of

delegated/subordinate legislation. Thus, there cannot be any

doubt that the Notification of 2011 in the case before us, is a

piece of delegated legislation and its legality, correctness or

otherwise can be questioned only on the limited grounds afore-

stated.
</p>
<p id="p_159">
</p><p id="p_160">96. To bring out this distinction illustratively and more clearly,

we may refer to the power of the MoEF (Central Government) to

issue Environmental Clearance in terms of the provisions of the

 Act of 1986 read with the Regulations of 2006. The order granting

or refusing Environmental Clearance to a Project Proponent, is

not an act of subordinate or delegated legislation but clearly is an

executive act. The Central Government in exercise of its executive

powers, passes an order whether or not a given project should be

granted Environmental Clearance for commencing its operation.

In passing such orders, the Central Government does not act in

furtherance to the powers vested in it by virtue of delegated

legislation. It is merely an executive act relatable to the statutory

powers vested in the Central Government. The CRZ Notification

issued by the Central Government is therefore an act of delegated

legislation while passing of an order of Environmental Clearance

is an executive order. This view finds support from the judgment

of the Delhi High Court in the case of Utkarsh Mandal vs. Union of

India, Writ Petition (civil) no. 9340/2009 which held that "grant of

environmental clearance is an executive order which involves

application of mind by the executive."

</p>
<p id="p_166">
</p><p id="p_167">98. The expression 'cause of action' has been used in the

provisions of the NGT Act and the Rules framed there under,

only at two different places - one under Section 14(3) of the

NGT Act and the other under Rule 11 of the Rules of 2011.

The earlier relates to prescription of period of limitation of six

months while the latter relates to the places of filing of an

application before the Tribunal which would be its ordinary place

of sitting falling within the jurisdiction. 'Cause of action' has been

used in different context and would operate entirely in different

fields, as discussed above. The bare reading of Rule 11 which we

have      reproduced   hereafter    shows     that   ordinarily    an

application or an appeal could be filed with the Registrar of

the Tribunal at its ordinary place of sitting falling within the

jurisdiction, the cause of action, wholly or in part, has arisen.

In other words, right to institute a petition is relatable to the

cause of action having been arisen wholly or in part. Part of

cause of action provides a right to an applicant or appellant

to institute the appeal or application as the case may be,

normally at the bench which has territorial jurisdiction over

the place whether cause of action wholly or in part has

arisen.

Benches   may    have   concurrent    jurisdiction   to   entertain    a

petition/appeal, as the cause of action may have arisen in part in

the territorial jurisdiction of either of the benches. The concept of

territorial jurisdiction has to be clearly understood as

provide alternative jurisdiction at two or even more places/

        element to confer the jurisdiction upon any Court

part of the cause of action and the respondents had
to satisfy the Court that the aforesaid notification
supported their claim for exemption from payment of
sales tax on the purchase of raw materials. No
doubt, in these circumstances the State of
Jharkhand ought to have been made a party-

in view of the fact that the State of Jharkhand itself
sought to prefer an appeal against the order of the

respondents. It did not object to the jurisdiction of
the High Court at Patna to entertain the writ
petition. Since a part of the cause of action lay in
the State of Bihar, it cannot be disputed that the
High Court of Patna also had the jurisdiction to
entertain the writ petition. The objections that the
State of now since the State itself preferred an
appeal and contested the case of the writ petitioners.
Moreover, this objection as to jurisdiction cannot be
raised in Civil Appeal No.2450 of 2003 since in that
case the State of Bihar itself had refused to grant the
benefit of exemption to the appellant therein. So far
as Civil Appeal No.2450 of 2003 since in that case
the State of Bihar itself had refused to grant the
benefit of exemption to the appellant therein. So far
as Civil Appeal No.3765 of 2003 is concerned, the
judgment has been rendered by the High Court of
Jharkhand at Ranchi. Since common questions
arise in all these appeals, we consider it appropriate
to decide the questions that arise in all these
appeals, we consider it appropriate to decide the
questions that arise in all these appeals,
particularly, when we find that a part of the cause of

reject the objection raised by the State of Jharkhand

that since the constitutionality of the <a href="/doc/51092038/" id="a_309">Parliamentary Act</a> was

in   question,   the Delhi High      Court   had   the requisite

jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition. On this premise, in

paragraph 10 of the judgment, the Supreme Court noticed:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">       Keeping in view the expressions used in clause (2) of
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_310">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, indisputably
       even if a small fraction of cause of action accrues
       within the jurisdiction of the court, the court will
       have jurisdiction in the matter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">     In paragraph 21 of the judgment, the court noticed that:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">     If passing of a legislation gives rise to cause of action,
     a writ petition questioning the constitutionality thereof
     can be filed in any High Court of the country. It is not
     so done, because a cause of action will arise only when
     the provision of the Act or some of them which were
     implemented shall give rise to civil or evil
     consequences to the petitioner.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_185">109. The Court stated the principle that courts would not

determine a constitutional question in a vacuum. The court

further held that framing of a statute, statutory rule or issue

of an executive order or instruction would not confer

jurisdiction upon a court only because of the situs of the

office of the maker thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_186">
</p><p id="p_187">110. From the analysis of the above paragraphs of the

judgment in Kusum Ingots and Alloys Ltd. (supra), it is clear

that even a small fraction of 'cause of action' that accrues

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                                                  110</span>
 within   the   jurisdiction   of   the   court   gives   territorial

jurisdiction to that court. Furthermore, it is not the situs of

the office of the maker of a statute, rule, or statutory

provision or even the executive order that would confer

jurisdiction upon a court. The theory of part of cause of

action may not be of help to applicant in such cases. But,

where issuances of such provisions, rule, instruction or

executive order gives rise to affecting the rights of the people

at large or individually or sets into motion the impact of

issuance of such notification, then that place would fall

within the framework of expression 'cause of action' as arisen

wholly or in part. It may be noticed that when an order is

passed by a Court or a Tribunal or an executive authority

under a provision of a statute or otherwise a part of cause of

action arises at that place. Similar reasoning had been

adopted by the Supreme Court in Swarn Rekha Cokes and

Coals (P) Ltd., (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_188">
</p><p id="p_189">111. Another test would be whether the facts constitute a

material, essential or integral part of 'cause of action' and

once such a small fraction of the 'cause of action' arises

within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, the court would

have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit / petition.

</p><p id="p_190"> 112.     The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/93127/" id="a_311">Oil Natural Gas

Commission v. Utpal Kumar Basu and Ors</a>., (1994) 4 SCC 711,

held that the facts forming an integral part of the cause of

action would give jurisdiction to the Court, immaterial facts

would not.    It may be part of the cause of action, free of

ulterior motives that would provide jurisdiction to the Court.

In Rajasthan High Court <a href="/doc/1432902/" id="a_312">Advocates Association v.         Union of

India and Ors</a>., AIR 2001 Supreme Court 416, the Supreme

Court stated that cause of action in its wider sense means

the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the suit,

including not only the infraction of the right, but the

infraction coupled with the right itself. It may also be noticed

that Courts have also taken the view that merely because

some incidental correspondence is exchanged between the

parties, having no material or substantial bearing on the

integral cause of action, would not vest jurisdiction with a

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_191">
</p><p id="p_192">113. At this stage, itself, it may be useful to notice that even

under the un-amended <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_313">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

India, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the

case of Lt. Col. <a href="/doc/1166220/" id="a_314">Khajoor Singh v. The Union of India and Anr</a>, AIR

1961 SC 532, had held that the High Court within whose

 sought, would have the jurisdiction to entertain and decide

a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_315">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.


</p><p id="p_193">114. In light of the above legal principles, now let us examine

the applicability of Kusum Ingots and Alloys Ltd. (supra) to the

facts of the present case. Firstly, the facts of Kusum Ingots

and Alloys Ltd. (supra) are very different and distinguishable.

No doubt, the vires of the Act had been challenged before the

High Court. But as claimed, the cause of action in favour of

the petitioner therein had arisen only and at a place where

and when a notice recalling the loan and threat to resort to

other civil consequences was issued at Bhopal. The impact or

the civil consequences flowing from the said notice were

triggered at Bhopal. In absence of service of such notice, no

cause of action would have arisen in favour of the applicant.

The company was located at Bhopal, though had its

registered office at Mumbai and notice of recalling the loan

and directing civil consequences to follow was issued at

Bhopal and given at Bhopal. It was on this premise that the

court took the view that Delhi High Court had no territorial

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_194">
</p><p id="p_195">115. In the case in hand, the Notification of 2011 was issued

by MoEF (6th January, 2011), who are respondents in these

petitions and against whom the relief has been claimed at


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">                                                             113</span>
 New Delhi. The moment the CRZ Notification is issued, its

impact and consequences follows in the entire country,

particularly   the   entire   coastal    zone    area.    The    CRZ

Notification is a Notification in general and is in rem. It binds

all, including the States, the Central Government, all persons

and legal entities, etc. Upon issuance of such Notification, the

restriction as contemplated in law, to the area covered under

the Notification, operates without any further action from any

quarter.   Thus,     the   impact   of   the    Notification   follows

instantaneously with its issuance, without any further

requirement. Thus, in our considered view it fully satisfies

the principles laid down in the aforesaid judgments and even

in the case of <a href="/doc/1876565/" id="a_316">Kusum Ingots and Alloys Ltd. v. Union of India

and Anr</a>. (supra), in so far as the issuance of the Notification

by MoEF at New Delhi has itself triggered the consequences

thereof. Hence, not only but specifically cause of action has

also arisen at Delhi in as much as the consequences of the

Notification published at New Delhi have come into play

instantaneously.
</p>
<p id="p_196">
</p><p id="p_197">116. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it has to be

held that a part of cause of action has arisen within the area

under jurisdiction of the Principal Bench. Of course, it has

also arisen at Kerala and the areas squarely falling in other

coastal states within the territorial jurisdiction of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">                                                                   114</span>
 Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal. The Courts

and Tribunals have often invoked the doctrine of forum

conveniens.   The Authority which issued the Notification of

2011 and which is expected to deal with the consequences

thereof is situated at New Delhi. The Notification was itself

issued at New Delhi. The applicants have approached both

the Southern Bench and the Principal Bench by filing distinct

applications, claiming for different reliefs in terms of Rule 14

of the Rules of 2011, where the application or appeal is to be

filed upon a single cause of action, claiming one or more relief

provided that they are consequential to one another.         The

Notification, its correctness, legality or otherwise and a prayer

for maintaining 'areas of outstanding natural beauty' and

'areas likely to be inundated due to rise in sea level

consequent upon global warming and such other areas as

may be declared by the Central Government or the concerned

authorities at the State/Union Territory level from time to

time', not covered under the Notification, are the prayers

which will have serious ramification for the larger parts of the

country and falling under the jurisdiction of different

benches.
</p>
<p id="p_198">
</p><p id="p_199">117. Thus, even applying the doctrine of forum conveniens, it

would be appropriate for the Principal Bench to hear these

matters. In support of what we have concluded, we may refer

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">                                                              115</span>
 to Para 30 of <a href="/doc/1876565/" id="a_317">Kusum Ingots and Alloys Ltd. v. Union of India

and Anr</a>. (supra) that reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_64">      "We must, however, remind ourselves that even if a
      small part of cause of action arises within the
      territorial jurisdiction of the High Court, the same by
      itself may not be considered to be a determinative
      factor compelling the High Court to decide the
      matter on merit. In appropriate cases, the Court
      may refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction
      by invoking the doctrine of forum conveniens".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_200">118. The applicability of doctrine of forum conveniens is more

aptly applicable to the provisions of the Act in relation to the

field of territorial jurisdiction of the Tribunal.   The use of

word 'ordinarily' in Rule 11 is indicative of the legislative

intent to provide for 'otherwise'.    This appears to be the

purpose of law, the Tribunal could refer to the intent of the

legislature. This is not a new theory. It was pithily put by

Learned Judge L. Hand who observed that the statutes

"should be construed not as theorems of Euclid but with

imagination of purpose behind them".       One can call it the

"liberal" approach.
</p>
<p id="p_201">
</p><p id="p_202">119. Thus, keeping in mind the purpose of the NGT Act and

the Rules of 2011, we are impressed with the contention of

the Project Proponent.

<p id="p_203">120. In view of the fact that all the petitions raised common

question of law based on somewhat similar facts, for a complete,

 comprehensive and final decision, it will be appropriate to hear all

these petitions together and at one place. Furthermore, to avoid

the possibility of passing of conflicting orders by different

benches, it is not only desirable but imperative that all cases are

heard by one and in the same bench. It will meet the ends of

justice. The Chairperson has the power to transfer cases from one

bench to another bench, ordinary place of sitting to other place

of sitting or even to the place other than that.


</p><p id="p_204">121. In view of the above detailed discussion, we hold that the

Principal Bench of the Tribunal has territorial jurisdiction to

entertain and decide these cases as a part of cause of action has

arisen in the areas within the territorial jurisdiction of the

Principal Bench. As already held, the Chairperson has the power

to transfer cases to and before benches and even places other

than that.

<p id="p_205">
</p><p id="p_206">122. Therefore, we allow Miscellaneous Application No. 239 of

2014 and direct that the Appeal No. 17 of 2014 pending before

the Southern Bench shall stand transferred to the Principal

Bench at New Delhi and would be heard together with

Application No. 74 of 2014. This application stands disposed of

accordingly.

<p id="p_207">123. There are no specific provisions in the NGT Act which deal

with the requirements of territorial jurisdiction and cause of

the Central Government in consultation with the Chairperson of

the Tribunal can make rules, regulating generally the practice and

procedure of the Tribunal. These rules could relate to the various

aspects indicated in clauses (a) to (d) of sub-Section 4 of the NGT

Act. The same reads as under:-
</p>

number of Judicial Members and the Expert Members in hearing

an application or an appeal has to be equal. However, Rule 5 of

the Rules of 2011 contemplates that an application or an appeal

<p id="p_214">127. One common expression appearing in <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_321">Section 4</a>; Rule 11 and

the Notification is 'ordinary place of sitting'.              The Notification

dated 17th August, 2011 identifies the ordinary places of sitting of

the NGT and the areas indicated over which the respective

Benches of the Tribunal shall exercise jurisdiction.                         This

Notification essentially must be read and construed subject to the

Rules of 2011 and the provisions of the NGT Act. A notification is

law but is subject to the parent Act and even the subordinate


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                                                                                121</span>
 legislation under which it is issued.         The powers of the

Chairperson to constitute a Bench, the place where the cases or

class of cases would be heard cannot be limited by the notification

of August, 2011. The provisions of <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_322">Section 4</a> and Rules 3, 6 and

11 cannot be frustrated by construing the notification in such

strict or narrower manner that it would defeat the very object and

purpose of the provisions of the Acts and the Rules framed

thereunder.   The power of the Chairperson to transfer cases in

accordance with the Rules is free of any other restriction. The

whole purpose is for better attainment of the ends of justice and

for better administration of justice. The framers of the Rules of

2011 have specifically used the words "ordinarily be filed by an

applicant or appellant with the Registrar of the Tribunal at its

ordinary place of sitting falling within the jurisdiction, the cause

of action, wholly or in part, has arisen" under Rule 11. The

language of the Rule is not suggestive of application of doctrine of

strict or restricted construction. The legislature in its wisdom has

used the words which are capable of being given liberal

construction on their plain reading. We see no reason as to why

we should give them a restricted construction, particularly when

this would amount to frustrating the purpose and object of the

Act and the Rules thereunder.       We are unable to accept the

contention on behalf of the respondents that the provisions of

other Acts relating to other Tribunals and the language of the NGT

Act and the Rules thereunder grant a limited or restricted power

to the Chairperson.     We have already reproduced supra, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                                                                 122</span>
 comparative chart of the provisions of the Act even in relation to

the power of the Chairperson to transfer cases. Under the NGT

Act, power of the Chairperson to constitute Benches, distribution

of the business of the Tribunal amongst the members of the

Tribunal sitting at different places, transfer cases from one place

of sitting to other place of sitting (including the ordinary place of

sitting) as well as adoption of circuit benches, is wide enough to

transfer cases from one bench to another, from one ordinary place

of sitting to another ordinary place of sitting, as well as from one

ordinary place of sitting to another place of sitting or even

temporarily. If this interpretation is not accepted, then the very

purpose of Section 4(4)(b) of the NGT Act and Rules 4 and 6 of the

Rules of 2011 would stand defeated.         It is a settled rule of

interpretation that an interpretation which would further the

cause and object of the Act and would render it more practical

and effective in the interest of justice administration, should be

preferred to the one that would invite results to the contrary.

Even upon conjoint reading of the provisions afore-referred, it is

not possible for us to come to any other conclusion. The use of

the words 'ordinarily'    and 'ordinary place of sitting' clearly

indicate that the legislature had in its mind that there could be

possibility of a case being filed at a place other than the ordinary

place of sitting of the Bench. The expression necessarily implies

that the cases could be filed at a place other than the ordinary

place of sitting.
</p>
<p id="p_215">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                                                                  123</span>
</p><p id="p_216"> 128. Rule 11 of the Rules of 2011 itself carves out an exception

that depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case, it

could be filed at another ordinary place of sitting as well.     For

instance, the Notification of 17th August, 2011 itself says that

other Benches which may not have become operative, their cases

could be filed at the Principal Bench. If the framers of the Rules

of 2011 intended to totally restrict filing of cases at any other

place, then it could not have used the expression 'ordinarily'.

"Ordinarily" in its common parlance would mean 'usually' or with

no special or distinctive features. The Black's Law Dictionary, 9th

Edition, explains the word 'ordinary', as occurring in the regular

course of events, normally, usually. The expression 'ordinarily'

with its connotations should be understood as opposed to 'solely'

or 'required' or 'primarily'. The first of these expressions ex facie

attract the rule of liberal construction, while others have a greater

element of being mandatory. It is unreasonable to think that the

word 'ordinarily' does not admit of any inbuilt expansion and has

to be construed in prohibitory terms. It has to be presumed that

the rule framing authority was aware of all the relevant

considerations, including the fact that there are alternative words

available to the word 'ordinarily'. Once the legislature uses such

word, it cannot be said that the word has been used without a

purpose and intendment, particularly when the language used is

unambiguous, clear and admits no confusion.         The expression

'ordinarily' has to be understood keeping in view the scheme of

the Act and the Rules framed thereunder and is not to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">                                                                  124</span>
 understood in isolation.    The view finds due support from the

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1543150/" id="a_323">State of Andhra

Pradesh v. V. Sarma Rao</a>, (2007) 2 SCC 159.         In this case, the

Supreme Court was concerned with the meaning of the expression

'ordinarily' under <a href="/doc/137884/" id="a_324">Section 195(4)</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, 1973.    In terms of <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_325">Section 195(4)</a>, a Court shall be

deemed to be subordinate to the Court to which the appeals

ordinarily lie from the appealable decrees or sentences of such

former Court, or in the case of a Civil Court from whose decree no

appeal ordinarily lies, to the Principal Court having ordinary

original civil jurisdiction within whose local jurisdiction such civil

court is situated. The Supreme Court held as under: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">      "12. <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_326">Section 195</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code does
      not recognise administrative discipline; it recognises
      judicial discipline with regard to the right of the higher
      authority to exercise appellate powers. The expression
      "ordinarily" may mean "normally", as has been held by
      this Court in <a href="/doc/475053/" id="a_327">Kailash Chandra v. Union of India</a> and
      <a href="/doc/1590311/" id="a_328">Krishan Gopal v. Prakashchandra</a>, but the said
      expression must be understood in the context in which
      it has been used. "Ordinarily" may not mean "solely" or
      "in the name", and thus, if under no circumstance an
      appeal would lie to the Principal District Judge, the
      court would not be subordinate to it. When in a common
      parlance the expression "ordinarily" is used, there may
      be an option. There may be cases where an exception
      can be made out. It is never used in reference to a case
      where there is no exception. It never means "primarily"."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_217">129. Still in another case, <a href="/doc/475053/" id="a_329">Kailash Chandra v. Union of India</a>, AIR

1961 SC 1346, the Supreme Court was concerned with the

following rule:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_76">      "Rule 2046(2): A ministerial servant who is not governed
      by sub-clause (b) may be required to retire at the age of
      55 years but should ordinarily be retained in service if

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">                                                                   125</span>
       he continues to be efficient up to the age of 60 years.
      He must not be retained after that age except in very
      special circumstances which must be recorded in
      writing and with the sanction of the competent
      authority."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_218">130. Therein, while interpreting the word 'ordinarily' appearing in

the said Rule, the Supreme Court held as under: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_77">      "8. Reading these words without the word "ordinarily"
      we find it unreasonable to think that it indicates any
      intention to cut down at all the right to require the
      servant to retire at the age of 55 years or to create in the
      servant any right to continue beyond the age of 55 years
      if he continues to be efficient. They are much more
      appropriate to express the intention that as soon as the
      age of 55 years is reached the appropriate authority has
      the right to require the servant to retire but that
      between the age of 55 and 60 the appropriate authority
      is given the option to retain the servant but is not bond
      to do so.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">      9. This intention is made even more clear and beyond
      doubt by the use of the word "ordinarily". "Ordinarily"
      means "in the large majority of cases but not invariably".
      This itself emphasises the fact that the appropriate
      authority is not bound to retain the servant after he
      attains the age of 55 even if he continues to be efficient.
      The intention of the second clause therefore clearly is
      that while under the first clause the appropriate
      authority has the right to retire the servant who falls
      within clause (a) as soon as he attains the age of 55, it
      will, at that stage, consider whether or not to retain him
      further. This option to retain for the further period of
      five years can only be exercised if the servant continues
      to be efficient; but in deciding whether or not to exercise
      this option the authority has to consider circumstances
      other than the question of efficiency also; in the absence
      of special circumstances he "should" retain the servant;
      but what are special circumstances is left entirely to the
      authority's decision. Thus, after the age of 55 is reached
      by the servant the authority has to exercise its
      discretion whether or not to retain the servant; and
      there is no right in the servant to be retained, even if he
      continues to be efficient."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_219">131. From the discussion of the above two cases, it is clear that

the word 'ordinarily' means 'in the large majority of cases' but not

invariably.   This itself emphasizes that there is an element of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                                                                     126</span>
 discretion vested in the Tribunal in relation to the institution of

cases. In appropriate cases where the interest of justice may so

demand, the cases could be permitted to be instituted in either of

the ordinary place of sitting of two Benches, in whose jurisdiction

the cause of action has partly arisen.
</p>
<p id="p_220">132. Thus, this expression appearing in Rule 11 cannot be termed

as absolute and without any exception, as that is the legislative

intent and purpose. It is also a well-known rule of construction

that a provision of a statute must be construed so as to give it a

sensible meaning. Legislature expects the Courts to observe the

maxim ut res magis valeat quam pareat. The Supreme Court, in

the case of <a href="/doc/1592182/" id="a_330">H.S. Vankani v. State of Gujarat</a>, (2010) 4 SCC 301,

stated that "it is a well-settled principle of interpretation of

statutes that a construction should not be put on a statutory

provision which would lead to manifest absurdity, futility,

palpable injustice and absurd inconvenience or anomaly."


</p><p id="p_221">133. <a href="/doc/1126318/" id="a_331">In Navinchandra Mafatlal v. CIT</a>, AIR 1955 SC 58, the

Supreme Court stated the law that "the cardinal rule of

interpretation is that the words should be read in their ordinary,

natural and grammatical meaning subject to this rider that in

construing words in a constitutional enactment conferring

legislative powers the most liberal construction should be put

upon the words so that the same may have effect in their widest

amplitude.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                                                                127</span>
</p><p id="p_223"> 134. Another aspect under this very submission would be in

relation to the interpretation of the words appearing in Rule 11

above "at its ordinary place of sitting falling within the

jurisdiction, the cause of action, wholly or in part has arisen."


</p><p id="p_224">135. "Cause of Action" means every fact which is necessary to

establish to support the right to obtain a judgment. It is a bundle

of facts which are to be pleaded and proved for the purpose of

obtaining the relief claimed in the suit. In a recent judgment in

the case of <a href="/doc/88347937/" id="a_332">Kehar Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, (2013) All India NGT

Reporter   556,   this   Tribunal   explained   the   meaning       and

implications of the words "cause of action" as follows -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">      "16. 'Cause of action', therefore, must be read in
      conjunction with and should take colour from the
      expression 'such dispute'. Such dispute will in turn
      draw its meaning from <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_333">Section 14(2)</a> and consequently
      Section 14(1) of the NGT Act. These are inter-connected
      and inter-dependent. 'Such dispute' has to be
      considered as a dispute which is relating to
      environment. The NGT Act is a specific Act with a
      specific purpose and object, and therefore, the cause of
      action which is specific to other laws or other objects
      and does not directly relate to environmental issues
      would not be 'such dispute' as contemplated under the
      provisions of the NGT Act. The dispute must essentially
      be an environmental dispute and must relate to either of
      the Acts stated in Schedule I to the NGT Act and the
      'cause of action' referred to under Sub-section (3) of
      <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_334">Section 14</a> should be the cause of action for 'such
      dispute' and not alien or foreign to the substantial
      question of environment. The cause of action must have
      a nexus to such dispute which relates to the issue of
      environment/substantial       question     relating    to
      environment, or any such proceeding, to trigger the
      prescribed period of limitation. A cause of action, which
      in its true spirit and substance, does not relate to the
      issue of environment/substantial question relating to
      environment arising out of the specified legislations,
      thus, in law cannot trigger the prescribed period of
      limitation under Section 14(3) of the NGT Act. The term
      'cause of action' has to be understood in distinction to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">                                                                     128</span>
      the nature or form of the suit. A cause of action means
     every fact which is necessary to establish to support the
     right to obtain a judgment. It is a bundle of facts which
     are to be pleaded and proved for the purpose of
     obtaining the relief claimed in the suit. It is what a
     plaintiff must plead and then prove for obtaining the
     relief. It is the factual situation, the existence of which
     entitles one person to obtain from the court remedy
     against another. A cause of action means every fact
     which, if traversed, would be necessary for the plaintiff
     to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of
     the court. In other words, it is a bundle of facts which,
     taken with the law applicable to them, gives the plaintiff
     a right to relief against the defendant. It does not
     comprise evidence necessary to prove such facts but
     every fact necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable
     him to obtain a decree. The expression 'cause of action'
     has acquired a judicially settled meaning.           In the
     restricted sense, cause of action means the
     circumstances forming the infraction of the right or the
     immediate occasion for the action. In wider sense, it
     means the necessary conditions for the maintenance of
     the suit including not only the infraction coupled with
     the right itself. To put it more clearly, the material facts
     which are imperative for the suitor to allege and prove
     constitute the cause of action. (Refer: Rajasthan High

</blockquote>
<p id="p_225">136. In this very judgment, the Tribunal emphasised that the

cause of action must be construed and relate to environmental

issues arising from the Scheduled Acts and 'such dispute'

appearing in Section 14 of the NGT Act.          Besides this, the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">                                                                    129</span>
 Tribunal has to keep in mind that Section 14 of the NGT Act does

not, in any manner, restrict the locus standi of the person who

may   file   application      relating   to   substantial     question    of

environment, (including enforcement of a legal right in relation to

the environment) which arises from the implementation of the

specified acts in Schedule I of the NGT Act. Similarly, <a href="/doc/131444632/" id="a_344">Section 16</a>

uses the words "any person aggrieved" which again is a very

generic term.     Under Section 15 of the NGT Act, a person is

expected     to   file   an   application     who    claims    relief    and

compensation, restitution of property damaged for restitution of

environment for such area or areas.                 Again restitution of

environment may not be person specific but purpose specific. A

person aggrieved may not necessarily be a person who has

suffered a personal injury. Any person aggrieved can challenge an

order granting Environment Clearance even though the applicant

might not have suffered personally. <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_345">Section 14</a> gives a very wide

meaning to the person seeking to invoke jurisdiction of the

Tribunal under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_346">Section 14</a>.         At this stage, we may refer to the

judgment of the Tribunal in the case of Samata v. Union of India,

(2014) 1 All India NGT Reporter (South Zone) where the Court

held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">      "29. Both under Section 11 of the NEAA Act,.1997 and
      Section 18 of the NGT Act, 2010 any person aggrieved
      by the grant of EC as shown above can maintain an
      appeal. The 'aggrieved person' as contemplated in the
      Act came up for interpretation before the Tribunal in a
      number of cases. An aggrieved person contemplated in
      the above provisions would refer to the substantial
      grievance as to denial of some personal, pecuniary or
      property right or imposing an obligation on a person.

<blockquote id="blockquote_81">       The grievance so ventilated should not be either fanciful
      or sentimental, but must be substantial. A person
      calling himself as an 'aggrieved' must have suffered a
      legal grievance that he has been wrongfully deprived of
      something or refused wrongfully. The aggrieved person
      can either be aggrieved either directly or indirectly. In so
      far as the environmental matters are concerned, it
      cannot be stated that the person really aggrieved should
      alone be permitted to initiate an action. It is not
      necessary that the person, who initiates action, is a
      resident of that particular area wherein the proposed
      industrial site is located. It is true that the appellants
      have not participated in the proceedings of the public
      hearing. It is true that it is necessary to scan the
      credentials of the appellants as to their intention and
      motive. Even assuming that the appellants have not
      participated in the proceedings of the public hearing,
      they would lose their right to challenge the approval or
      the EC. If the appellants come forward with a case
      apprehending damage and danger to environment and
      ecology if the project in question was not properly
      envisaged and did not satisfy the Principles of

      as to the correctness of the study made in respect of
      ecology and environment. In the instant case, nothing
      substantial has been demonstrated in order to doubt the
      credentials of the appellants. What are all stated by the
      3rd respondent is that the appellants are residents of a
      different area though within the State and they are not
      aggrieved persons. The first appellant is a registered Non
      Governmental Organisation working in the field of
      Environment and the 2nd appellant is a social and
      environmental group with the objective of working for
      the welfare of the local communities and creating
      awareness on environmental issues and have filed the
      letter of authorisation issued by the respective bodies to
      initiate proceedings. Hence, they are to be termed as
      'aggrieved persons' as envisaged under the above
      provisions, who can maintain the appeal and thus, this
      question is answered in favour of the appellants."

and purposive construction.     Certainly, not only infraction of a

<p id="p_230">Discussion of Objection D:

<p id="p_231">The Original Application No. 74 of 2014 is a device to
indirectly and effectively seek insertion of certain words into
the CRZ Notification, 2011, which is impermissible.

the Notification of 2011, what areas have been excluded, which is

impermissible. Thus, petition is not maintainable.


</p><p id="p_233">141. To examine the merit or otherwise of this contention, we may

recapitulate the prayers made in the above referred cases.


</p><p id="p_234">142. In the Appeal no. 14 of 2014, the applicants have challenged

and prayed for setting aside the grant of Environmental and CRZ

Clearance dated 3rd January, 2014 to the Project Proponent by

Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests, in

relation to the Vizhinjam Port Project, International Deep Water

Multi-purpose sea port at Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram

(Trivandrum) district of Kerala and no other relief has been prayed

though in this application a reference has been made to CRZ

Notification of 2011 and its effects. In application 74 of 14, the

same applicant has prayed that the coastal 'areas of outstanding

natural beauty' and 'areas likely to be inundated due to rise in sea

level and consequent upon global warming and such other areas,

as may be declared by the Central Government or concerned

authorities at the State/Union Territory level from time to time'

along the coast line of India, be protected as CRZ-I areas or

otherwise, notwithstanding their non-inclusion in the Notification

of 2011. It is also prayed that these areas be preserved and no

activity which would damage such areas be undertaken. In this

application, the applicant has also referred in some detail to the

Notification of 1991 as well as of 2011, but has not prayed either


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">                                                                 134</span>

praying for inclusion of the excluded areas back into the said

Notification.
</p>
<p id="p_235">
</p><p id="p_236">143. Learned Counsel appearing for the applicant during the

course of submission clearly took a stand that they were not

challenging the legality, correctness or validity of the Notification

of 2011. De hors the Notification, they are praying for protection

and preservation of the areas which are of outstanding natural

beauty and are likely to be inundated due to rise in sea level

consequent upon global warming.         According to the applicant,

these claimed reliefs are required to be considered independent of

the Notification. However, the contention of the Project Proponent

is that in the garb of the prayer made in this application, in fact

the appellant is challenging exclusion of areas from Notification of

1991 and prays for inclusion of the same areas in the Notification

of 2011 which amounts to raising indirect challenge to the said

Notification, which is impermissible.

<p id="p_237">
</p><p id="p_238">144. We have heard the Learned Counsel appearing for the

parties on these preliminary submissions at some length.           We

must even at the cost of repetition clarify that at this stage, we are

not concerned with the merit or demerits of the case but are only

dealing with the preliminary submissions made by the Learned

Counsel    appearing   for   the   Project   Proponent   as   to   the

maintainability of the present application. We have already held

that even if there was a challenge to the validity of the Notification


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">                                                                   135</span>
 of 2011, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to examine the same, of

course, within the limitations laid on the grounds of challenge

which are available for a delegated or a subordinate legislation. It

is contended that for the purpose of arguments on the merits of

the case, the applicant does not question the validity of the

Notification of 2011. Thus to that extent, objection taken by the

Project Proponent cannot be sustained and is inconsequential.

What remains is the relief claimed by the applicant that the

aforesaid areas must be preserved and protected de hors the fact

that they do not form part of the Notification of 2011. This is the

contention which has to be examined by the Tribunal when the

case is heard on merits. At this stage, we are only concerned with

the facts that whether a prayer of this kind is contemplated under

<a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_350">section 14</a> read with Section 15 of the NGT Act or not. The

moment the area is covered under the Notification of 2011, the

restriction contemplated in law in relation to activity, construction

and other matters would apply instantaneously. The areas which

are not covered under the Notification of 2011 can still be

required to be preserved and protected in different ways known

under the accepted norms, in so far as it relates to a substantial

question relating to environment.        The competent authority

including the Central Government may be called upon to

formulate such guidelines or directions as contemplated under

<a href="/doc/162712998/" id="a_351">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_352">5</a> of the Act of 1986 and the Rules framed

thereunder, particularly Rule 5.     Thus, it is also possible that

after hearing the matter on merits, the Tribunal comes to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">                                                                  136</span>
 conclusion that these areas need no environmental protection and

being not covered by any specific notification, any use of or

activity in such areas would be permissible in accordance with

law. But this is a question that can be determined only after the

matter has been heard fully on merits.             The expression

'environment' has been defined under <a href="/doc/142996678/" id="a_353">Section 2(a)</a> of the 1986

Act. It is a very wide definition and covers not only water, air and

land but even the interrelationship which exists among and

between water, air and land, and human beings, other living

creatures, plants, micro-organism and property. <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_354">Section 2</a> (b) of

the said Act describes 'Environmental pollutant' as any solid,

liquid or gaseous substance present in such concentration as may

be, or tend to be, injurious to environment. In addition thereto,

Section 2(c) of the NGT Act similarly defines the expression

'environment', while in <a href="/doc/89100821/" id="a_355">Section 2(m)</a> 'substantial question relating

to environment' has been explained so as to include a direct

</blockquote><p id="p_243">23.        The legislature, in its wisdom, has defined the
word 'environment' in very wide terms. It is inclusive of
water, air, land, plants, micro-organisms and the inter-
relationship between them, living and non-living
creatures and property. Similarly, 'substantial question
relating to environment' also is an inclusive definition
and besides what it means, it also includes what has
been specified under Section 2(m) of the NGT Act.
Inclusive definitions are not exhaustive. One has to,
therefore, give them a very wide meaning to make them
as comprehensive as the statute permits on the principle
of liberal interpretation. This is the very basis of an
inclusive definition. Substantial, in terms of the Oxford
Dictionary of English, is of considerable importance,
strongly built or made, large, real and tangible, rather
than imaginary. Substantial is actual or real as opposed
to trivial, not serious, unimportant, imaginary or
something. Substantial is not the same as unsubstantial
i.e. just enough to avoid the de minimis principle. In In
re Net Books Agreement [1962] 1 WLR 1347, it was
explained that, the term 'substantial' is not a term that
demands a strictly quantitative or proportional
assessment. Substantial can also mean more than
reasonable. To put it aptly, a substantial question
relating to environment must, therefore, be a question
which is debatable, not previously settled and must
have a material bearing on the case and its issues
relating to environment.
</p><p id="p_244">24. Section 2(m) of the NGT Act classifies 'substantial
question relating to environment' under different heads
and states it to include the cases where there is a direct
violation of a specific statutory environmental obligation
as a result of which the community at large, other than
an individual or group of individuals, is affected or is
likely to be affected by the environmental consequences;
or the gravity of damage to the environment or property
is substantial; or the damage to public health is broadly
measurable. The other kind of cases are where the
environmental consequences relate to a specific activity
or a point source of pollution. In other words, where
there is a direct violation of a statutory duty or
obligation which is likely to affect the community, it will
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">                                                              139</span>
       be a substantial question relating to environment
      covered under <a href="/doc/102400682/" id="a_363">Section 14(1)</a> providing jurisdiction to the
      Tribunal. When we talk about the jurisdiction being
      inclusive, that would mean that a question which is
      substantial, debatable and relates to environment,
      would itself be a class of cases that would squarely fall
      under Section 14(1) of the NGT Act. Thus, disputes must
      relate to implementation of the enactments specified in
      Schedule I to the NGT Act. At this stage, reference to one
      of the scheduled Acts i.e. <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_364">Environment Protection Act</a>,
      1986 may be appropriate."
</p>
<p id="p_245">
</p><p id="p_246">147. Keeping in view these definitions of wide magnitude and

connotations, it is       obvious   that any question relating to

environment, falling within the Scheduled Acts would have to be

examined by the Tribunal, subject to the provisions of the relevant

Acts. In light of this, the Tribunal would have to examine on

merits whether the areas in question, even though not covered

under the CRZ Notification 2011 require some protection or

preservation within the ambit and scope of environmental

jurisprudence. Thus, in light of the above, we are unable to hold

that the application 74 of 2014 is liable to be dismissed at the

very threshold.
</p>
<p id="p_247">
</p><p id="p_248">148. Ergo and for the reasons afore-stated, we answer the four

issues framed by us with reference to the preliminary and other

objections raised by the Respondents as follows:


  A. NGT has complete and comprehensive trappings of a court
      and within the framework of the provisions of the NGT Act
      and the principles afore-stated, the NGT can exercise the
      limited     power    of   judicial   review   to   examine   the
      constitutional validity/vires of the subordinate/delegated
      legislation. In the present case the CRZ Notification of 2011,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">                                                                   140</span>
    that has been issued under provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_365">Environment
   Protection Act</a>, 1986.     However, such examination cannot
   extend to the provisions of the statute of the NGT Act and
   the Rules framed thereunder, being the statute that created
   this Tribunal. The NGT Act does not expressly or by
   necessary implication exclude the powers of the higher
   judiciary under Articles 226 and/or 32 of the Constitution
   of India. Further, while exercising the 'limited power of
   judicial review', the Tribunal would perform the functions
   which are supplemental to the higher judiciary and not
   supplant them.
</p>
<p id="p_249">B. In the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, part of
   cause of action has risen at New Delhi and within the area
   that falls under territorial jurisdiction of the Principal
   Bench of NGT.       Thus, this bench has the territorial
   jurisdiction to entertain and decide the present cases.

C. On the cumulative reading and true construction of <a href="/doc/11187870/" id="a_366">Section
   4</a> (4) of the NGT Act and Rules 3 to 6 and Rule 11 of Rules
   of 2011, the Chairperson of NGT has the power and
   authority to transfer cases from one ordinary place of sitting
   to other place of sitting or even to place other than that. The
   Chairperson    of   NGT    has   the   power   to   decide   the
   distribution of business of the Tribunal among the members
   of the Tribunal, including adoption of circuit procedure in
   accordance with the Rules. An applicant shall ordinarily file
   an application or appeal at ordinary place of sitting of a
   Bench within whose jurisdiction the cause of action, wholly
   or in part, has arisen; in terms of Rule 11 which has an
   inbuilt element of exception.
</p>
<p id="p_250">D. Original Application No. 74 of 2014 cannot be dismissed as
   not maintainable on the ground that it attempts to do
   indirectly which cannot be done directly and which is
   impermissible.
