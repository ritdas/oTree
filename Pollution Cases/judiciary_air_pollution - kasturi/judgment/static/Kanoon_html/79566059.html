<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   It is not in dispute the petitioners are a licensees and

the licenses are valid to run the stone crushing units.       In

this writ action they have sought a writ of certiorari to

      All   dated   29.8.2012       vide   Annexures-C    to   C7

respectively   issued   under   <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_3">Section     31(A)</a>   of   the   Air

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution Act</a>, 1981, by the 2nd

respondent . He also seeks issuance of a writ of mandamus

to direct the 3rd respondent (competent authority under the

Act) to consider the applications filed by them on different

dates vide Annexures-D to D7 respectively to permit them

to operate their crushing units pending consideration of the

applications, and consequential reliefs.


</blockquote><p id="p_4">3.    These    writ petitions   and several other        petitions

seeking similar relief are listed for consideration and we

have heard learned counsel, Sri Hanumanthreddy Sahukar

for the petitioner, Sri R.G.Kolle, AGA, who accepts notice on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   6</span>
behalf of respondents 1 and 3 and Sri Gururaj Joshi, learned

advocate who accepts for respondent no.2.             Notice to

respondents 5 and 6 is dispensed with as no relief is sought

against them.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.     The contextual facts manifesting from the averments

in the writ petitions and the submissions of the learned

counsel for the petitioners and respondents leaves no scope

for doubt that this writ action is similar to the writ action of

similarly placed owners of crushing units in which questions

raised in this writ petition were considered in detail in

W.P.41069/12 disposed of by the Division Bench of this

court on 21.11.2012 quashing the closure notice issued by

the   Karnataka      Pollution    Control   Board   arrayed     as

respondent no.2 in that writ petition and issuing a writ of

mandamus to permit the petitioner therein to continue

stone crushing activity till its application for re-locating the

unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent

authority,   i.e.   Deputy   Commissioner     (respondent     no.3

arrayed in that writ petition).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   7</span><p id="p_7">


</p><p id="p_8">5.    We are satisfied the orders impugned in that writ

petition, grounds against it and the relief sought are the

same as in this writ action. Therefore, we cannot summon

ourselves to take a different view but to follow the decision

of the Division Bench in W.P.41069/12 dated 21.11.2012 in

which, while rendition of the judgment, all facts and

circumstances      have   been        taken        into   consideration.

However, to avoid any doubt, we need to extract the core of

the judgment which is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_9">           'In    the   present   case,       by    Gazette
        Notification dated 14.8.2012 safer zones in
        Haveri had been duly notified to the public.
        Section 3(3) of the Karnataka Regulation of
        Stone Crushers Act, 2011 (for short, 'the
        Act') permits a period of three months to
        existing stone crusher units to trans-locate
        themselves to safer zones. In this regard
        an application has to be filed with the
        Licensing Authority within a reasonable
        time.     Unfortunately, the Act does not
        prescribe this period. In the present case,
        the Petitioner applied to the Licensing
        Authority on 24.9.2012. It is not disputed
        that     consequent   upon     the     petitioner's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                        8</span>
application, the Licensing Authority till date
has neither granted or refused the license
under the provisions of the said Act. Since
<a href="/doc/33909115/" id="a_5">Section 3(4)</a> of the Act prescribes an outer
limit of six months for shifting from the
date of grant, it could be inferred that the
application has to be made within three
months of the requisite Gazetting of the
safer zones.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">2. In these circumstances, the petition is
allowed by directing the respondents to
permit the operation of the petitioner at
the present site upto 23.12.2012 or till
such time the application is considered and
disposed of, by the Licensing Authority.


</p><p id="p_12">3. Learned counsel for the Karnataka State
Pollution Control Board (for short 'the
Board) submits that the petitioner did not
apply for the consent of the Board on the
expiry    of   the   previous   consent    on
30.6.2012.     In normal circumstances, the
contention would be well founded since no
one is permitted to operate without current
permission or consent.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">4. In the circumstances of the present
case,    however, a piquant situation has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 9</span>
         arisen, inasmuch as the Pollution Control
         Board cannot grant permission to         the
         petitioner to operate in its present site,
         since it must statutorily relocate to a safer
         zone as identified by the State.   Needless
         to add that if and when the petitioner is
         granted a license to relocate to a safer
         zone, conditions under <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_6">Section 6(9)</a> of the
         Act will have to be complied with as also
         the permission would have to be obtained
         from the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">         5. With these observations, the petition is
         allowed and Annexure-H dated 5.9.2012 is
         quashed.'


</p><p id="p_17">6.     Under the circumstances, Annexures-C to C7 dated

29.8.2012 impugned in these writ petitions issued by the

2nd respondent are quashed.           In terms of the order

extracted above, these petitions are also allowed directing

the respondents to permit operation of the stone crushing

units of the petitioners at the present site till such time their

applications is considered and disposed of by the licensing

authority, or for a period of four weeks from now, as

ordered in that writ petition.       Rule issued and made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            10</span>
absolute. In the circumstances, there shall be no order as

to costs.
