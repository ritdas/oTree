                    W.P.(C).No.28200 of 2017

                          J U D G M E N T

<p id="p_1">          Ext.P4 order, by which the integrated consent

granted to the petitioner under the Water (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 for the purpose of operating

a water theme park has been cancelled, is under

challenge in this writ petition mainly on the ground that

the petitioner has not been afforded an opportunity of

being heard before the impugned order was passed, as

mandated under second proviso to Sub section (4) of

<a href="/doc/109604480/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(c).No.28200 of 2017         : 2 :</span>




Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              2.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner,

the learned Standing Counsel for the Kerala State Pollution

Control Board as also the learned counsel for respondents 3

and 4.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              3.     On 04/10/2017, as per the interim order, this

Court directed the second respondent, the Environmental

Engineer of the          Kerala State Pollution Control Board to

conduct a fresh inspection in the park referred to in the writ

petition and to file a report before this Court as to the

compliance of the various statutory requirements by the

petitioner. Pursuant to the said interim order, a report has

been filed by the second respondent stating that the

conditions of consent to operate the park issued to the

petitioner on 16/5/2017 stands complied with by the

petitioner and therefore, the impugned order can be

withdrawn.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              4.     When the matter was taken up, the learned

Standing Counsel for the Kerala State Pollution Control

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(c).No.28200 of 2017        : 3 :</span>




Board pointed out that the petitioner can make a request to

the second respondent for the purpose of withdrawing the

impugned order and if a request is made by the petitioner

for the said purpose, the same will be considered and a

proper decision will be taken thereon, in the light of the

report submitted before this Court pursuant to the interim

order referred to above.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              5.     The learned counsel for the third respondent

contended that the petitioner is not entitled to run the park

for various other reasons and therefore, he may not be

permitted to run the park without adjudication of the

entitlement of the petitioner to run the park.

</p><p id="p_6">              6. As noted above, the above writ petition is one

challenging Ext.P4 order and as such, the scope of the writ

petition is only to examine the correctness of Ext.P4 order.

Further, it is seen that the third respondent has          filed a

separate writ petition as W.P.(C).No.20189/2017 voicing his

grievance concerning the running of the park by the

petitioner and the said writ petition is pending. In the said

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(c).No.28200 of 2017      : 4 :</span>




view of the matter, I do not think it is necessary or proper for

this Court to consider the contentions of the third

respondent as to the entitlement of the petitioner to run the

park in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">              In the result, this writ petition is disposed of

permitting the petitioner to prefer an application for

withdrawing the impugned order. It is directed that if the

petitioner prefers an application for the said purpose, the

same shall be considered and appropriate decision shall be

taken thereon by the second respondent having regard to

the report filed before this Court pursuant to the interim

order. In so far as it is pointed out that the petitioner has

complied with all the conditions incorporated in the consent

granted to him, he is permitted to run the park until a

decision is taken on the application directed to be preferred

as above. Needless to say that the functioning of the park

shall, thereafter, be subject to the conditions already

incorporated in the consent issued to the petitioner and the

further conditions, if any, incorporated in the order to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(c).No.28200 of 2017    : 5 :</span>




passed by the second respondent. It is made clear that the

disposal of this writ petition is without prejudice to the

contentions taken by the third respondent and his right to

pursue W.P.(C).No.20189/2017.
