                                CIVIL JUDGE-01(NORTH) : DELHI

                                                   Suit No.345/2011

                                                     Mohd. Shahid
                                                          v.
                                                      BSES RPL


Present :            None

ORDER:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.        Vide this order, I shall dispose off the preliminary issue "Whether the
Civil Court has jurisdiction to entertain the present suit in view of
<a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_1">Section 46</a> of Air Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution Act</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/598206/" id="a_3">Section 58</a> of
Water Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution Act</a>?OPP" as framed on
17.10.2011. I have heard the arguments of both the parties and gone through
the record carefully.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.        The counsel for defendant no.3 has taken a preliminary objection that
the present suit is not maintainable u/s 46 of Air Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of
Pollution Act</a> (hereinafter referred to as <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Act</a>) &amp; <a href="/doc/598206/" id="a_7">Section 58</a> of Water
Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Control of Pollution Act</a> (hereinafter referred to as <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_9">Water Act</a>)
as the civil courts jurisdiction to entertain such disputes is expressly barred.
Counsel for defendant no.3 submits that under the Acts, such disputes can be
entertained only by the authority as established under the Act and in case, the
consumer has any grievance, he can taken up the matter with the Appellate
Authority. Hence, it is submitted that the present suit is not maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.        The counsel for plaintiff has argued that as per defendant no.3
directions dated 13.7.2011, the plaintiff had been directed to close the dhaba


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Mohd. Shahid v. BSES RPL                                        Suit no.345/2011   Page 1 of 3  </span>
 which he has already done. It is argued that despite the same, defendant no.
3 gave directions to the defendant no.1 &amp; 2 to disconnect the electricity and
water meter respectively. Hence, he filed the present suit. It is argued that in
these circumstances, he has no other remedy but to approach the civil court.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.        Undoubtedly <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_10">Section 46</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Section 58</a> as mentioned earlier bar the
jurisdiction of the court. However, the jurisdiction is barred only with respect
of those matters which the Appellate Authority is empowered to deal with. In
these circumstances, it is necessary to examine as to what all matters come
within the jurisdiction of the Appellate Authority. The provision of appeal has
been laid down u/s 28 of the <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Water Act</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1970789/" id="a_13">Section 30</a> of the Air Act. Under this
section, it has been provided that when a person is aggrieved by an order of
the Board, then that person can appeal to the Appellate Authority within 30
days from the date of the order. Hence, the appeal can be filed against those
orders from which the person is aggrieved.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.        In the present suit, the plaintiff does not challenge the order passed by
the board. He is infact alleging that he has already complied with the order
and has closed down his dhaba. The defendant alleged that the dhaba is still
working. Whether the dhaba is closed or not is a matter of trial. The present
matter has been filed seeking injunction that the plaintiff's electricity and water
connection may not be disconnected.                                    The plaintiff nowhere disputes the
validity of the order passed by the court.                                    In these circumstances, in the
opinion of the court, <a href="/doc/92973732/" id="a_14">Section 46</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_15">58</a> does not apply.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.        It is further relevant to note that under these sections, the civil courts
have been barred from passing any injunction order in respect of any action
taken or to be taken in pursuance of the Act. At the cost of repetition, the
plaintiff has alleged that he has already complied with the order of the Board.
In these circumstances, the defendant no.3 shall not be justified in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Mohd. Shahid v. BSES RPL                                        Suit no.345/2011                   Page 2 of 3  </span>
 disconnecting the electricity and water connection of the plaintiff. The same
can be done only if the order had not been complied with, which is a matter of
trial. Hence, this part of the section also does not apply to the facts and
circumstances of the present case. In view of the above discussion, the court
is of the opinion, the present suit is maintainable. Hence, this issue is decided
in favour of the plaintiff.
