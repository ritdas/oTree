<p id="p_1">[1]	The
present appeal, under <a href="/doc/487026/" id="a_1">Section 378</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973, is directed against the judgment and order of acquittal dated
26.09.2008 passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamnagar
in Criminal Case No.3332 of 2004, whereby the accused has been
acquitted of the charges under <a href="/doc/96507/" id="a_2">Sections 21</a>, <a href="/doc/1494432/" id="a_3">31(a)</a> r/w. <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_4">Section 37</a> of
the Prevention of Air (Pollution and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_5">Control) Act</a>, 1981, leveled
against him. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_2">[2]	The
brief facts of the prosecution case are that the respondent No.2 is
running business of manufacturing bricks, at Village Falla, District
: Jamnagar. It is alleged that the pollutants are required to be
brought to the specific parameters by giving certain treatment and
then after only, can be discharged to the atmosphere. It is
allegation that the respondent No.2  found discharging pollution in
air, which was untreated and was hazardous to mankind and to
environment and agriculturists. On inspection  at the site and on
completion of investigation, the complaint came to be filed in the
Court of learned Judicial Magistrate. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">[3]	Thereafter,
the trial was conducted before the learned Magistrate. The
prosecution examined the witnesses and also relied upon the oral as
well as documentary evidence. After considering the oral as well as
documentary evidence, the learned Magistrate acquitted the respondent
No.2 from the charges alleged against him, vide judgment and order
dated 26.09.2008.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">[4]	Being
aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated
26.09.2008 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamnagar in
Criminal Case No.3332 of 2004, the appellant has preferred the above
mentioned Criminal Appeal.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_5">[3]	I
have heard learned advocate Mr.K L. Dave for the appellant and
learned APP Mr.D. C. Sajpal for the respondent No.1. I have also gone
through the papers and the judgment and order passed by the trial
Court. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_6">[4]	Learned
advocate Mr.K. L. Dave for the appellant has taken me through the
evidence of witnesses and documentary evidence and submitted that
from the above, it is established that the accused has not
successfully proved his case beyond reasonable doubt. It was
contended by learned advocate for the appellant that the judgment and
order of the learned Magistrate is not proper, legal and it is
erroneous. He has vehemently argued that the learned trial Magistrate
has not considered the evidence of the witnesses and the oral as well
as documentary evidence produced on record. He has vehemently argued
that  learned Magistrate erred in discussing the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_6">Sections 31</a> and <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_7">37</a> of the said Act. It is also contended by the
learned advocate for the appellant that the learned Magistrate erred
in considering the fact that the Unit has neither obtained the NOC
from the Board nor obtained CCA, though it is mandatory provision and
without following due procedure, they have started unlawful
activities of manufacturing brick, which is breach of provisions of
the said Act and, therefore, the judgment and order of the trial
Court is deserved to be quashed and set aside.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_7">[5]	I
have gone through the Judgment and order of the trial Court. I have
also perused the reasons assigned by the learned Magistrate.  From
the record, it clearly appears that the learned Magistrate has
considered the evidence of the complainant as well as oral as well as
documentary evidence. I have also perused the Notification of the
Central Government and other relevant papers produced on record. It
also appears that  the appellant has no personal knowledge as to
whether the notice under <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_8">Section 37-A</a> issued against the accused, is
served or not and  he has not produced any acknowledgment receipt
regarding the ownership of the place of the accused. After going
through the judgment of the trial Court and also the record, it
clearly appears that the trial court has not committed any error in
acquitting the accused. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_8">[6]	In
the above view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that the
trial court was completely justified in acquitting the respondent of
the charges leveled against him. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_9">[7]	
I find that the findings recorded by the trial court are absolutely
just and proper and in recording the said findings, no illegality or
infirmity has been committed by it. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_10">[8]	I
am, therefore, in complete agreement with the findings, ultimate
conclusion and the resultant order of acquittal recorded by the court
below and hence find no reasons to interfere with the same. Hence the
appeal is hereby dismissed. R &amp; P to be sent back to the trial
Court, forthwith. Bail bond, if any, stands cancelled.
