                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner at

length, we are not persuaded to entertain these writ petitions

against the order dated 16.09.2018 [Annexure-`A'], issued by

the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, essentially for

the reason that the order in question is an appealable one

under Section 33B (c) of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      Learned counsel for the petitioner has endeavored to

submit that the imputation of causing pollution on the

petitioner is not correct and in fact, the entire problem has its

genesis in the encroachment over Rajakaluves whereby the

drainage water, which was otherwise supposed to be drained

out, is entering the industrial premises of the petitioner.


</p><p id="p_4">      We have only noted these submissions, but would not

be making any comment thereupon for the reason that all

such submissions could effectively be made for appropriate

consideration of the Appellate Authority. Even otherwise, the

matter entails such inquiry into the facts, which we do not
                                           W.P.Nos.26343-26345/2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -4-</span>



consider appropriate to take up in writ jurisdiction, particularly

when an alternative statutory remedy is available.


</p><p id="p_5">      Therefore, without any other comment in the matter,

exercise of writ jurisdiction is declined. The petitions stand

dismissed, while leaving it open for the petitioner in taking

recourse to appropriate remedy in accordance with law.
