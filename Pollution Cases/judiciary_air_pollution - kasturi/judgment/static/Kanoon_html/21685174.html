A.K. SIKRI, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    "Delhi, as an idea as well as a space, has not stood still in the decades

      since Independence. From its stolid imperial beginnings to the

      extravagant multiple universes that make up the city today, Delhi has

      experienced a rapidity of change unmatched by any other Indian

      metropolis. If New Delhi was the capital Britain‟s Indian Empire,

      post independence India created newer Delhi, a new capital, but one

      perched securely on the foundations of the older one. Its purpose

      was to showcase that new nation‟s commitment to modernity and

      development. A well-established belief of that time, and one

      advocated by Jawaharlal Nehru, India‟s first prime minister, was that

      creating an egalitarian, progressive environment would lead to an

      egalitarian and progressive society" - Ranjana Sengupta "Delhi

      Metropolitian The making of an unlikely city" Penguin Brothers

      (2007), p. 44.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.    Keeping the above conviction in mind, the respondents feel that the

      capital city is all set to transform itself for the upcoming XIX

      Commonwealth Games, 2010 (hereinafter referred to „CWG-2010‟).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                            Page 2 of 96</span>
       It is going to be the first mega-event hosted by the city since the 1982

      Asian Games, a gap of nearly thirty years. Much has changed, and yet

      much has remained unchanged in this time. Commonwealth Games,

      originated as the British Empire Games in 1930, are held every four

      years in a commonwealth country. Like the Olympics, these games

      are termed as a hallmark event as the infrastructure and facilities built

      for the event are geared to serve the host city - long after the event.


</p><p id="p_4">3.    On 13.9.2003, the Games were allotted to Delhi by the

      Commonwealth Games Federation and are now scheduled to be

      held on 3rd to 14th October, 2010. Thus, the CWG-2010 are being

      hosted in Delhi pursuant to a commitment made by Indian Olympic

      Association (hereinafter referred to as the „IOA‟) in the form of an

      agreement, in which the IOA has undertaken to host the games in

      India with the requisite standards and requirement of the

      Commonwealth Games Federation.           Thus, the city is planning a

      major overhaul of its urban infrastructure as well as its sporting

      facilities to meet the said standards and requirements. The city

      infrastructure being developed includes construction of games village,

      new sporting facilities, modernization of existing sporting facilities

      and stadia; new flyovers, bridges and stadia; transport connectivity

      including parking facilities; improvement and widening of roads;

      augmentation of power and water supply, among other services.


</p><p id="p_5">4.    While governmental agencies, including the Delhi Development

      Authority (DDA), are boasting about the developmental projects


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                            Page 3 of 96</span>
       undertaken in this behalf, some environmentalists are terribly upset.

      Reason - Much of the construction activity is coming up on the

      periphery of Yamuna river. According to them, it is on the riverbed

      itself which is not only going to destroy the river but would pose

      severe threat to the city as well.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Thus, being aggrieved by the infrastructure planned on the

      Yamuna riverbed, the petitioners herein, who are environmentalists,

      have approached this Court with a view to halt this part of the

      construction. The said construction includes the Delhi Metro Depot

      called Yamuna Depot, the Metro Mall and the Games Village for the

      proposed CWG-2010. The basic contention of the petitioners is to

      the effect that the said construction will threaten the ecological

      integrity of the River besides causing irreversible damage to the

      floodplain. The petitioners have made prayer for a writ of

      mandamus and order/direction/declaration whereby :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "(a) Declaring the respondent to remove any construction,
                 fill up, digging etc made so far and restore the ecology

                 will permanently destroy the ecology of river Yamuna,

                 of public trust doctrine, precautionary principle which
                 are part of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                          Page 4 of 96</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">             (g)   Directing the respondent to restore the ecology of river

</blockquote>

<p id="p_7">5.    On the other hand, the Respondents herein (Government of Delhi,

      Ministry of Environment and Forest, Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp;

      Sports, Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty, Delhi

      Development Authority, and Delhi Metro rail Corporation Ltd.)

      submit that the said construction is being done after extensive

      deliberations for the purpose of development of the river Yamuna

      and after obtaining required clearances from the authorities

      concerned. They are emphatic that events like CWG-2010 happen

      once in decades and will surely have the ability to transform the

      capital city.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.    Thus, the entire matter revolves around the two distinguishing but

      contrasting interests: Development of the city coupled with National

      Prestige on the one hand and Ecology of the River Yamuna on the

      other. The respondents contend that the Commonwealth Games are

      a matter of national pride and any order prohibiting the construction

      would have an impact on the reputation of the country so far as

      international community is concerned. For the petitioners, that is

      secondary, and the prime consideration should be „Save the

      Environment‟. They argue that the impact of the construction would

      have irreversible impact and cause permanent damage to the

      ecologically fragile environment of the river Yamuna, its bed, banks,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                           Page 5 of 96</span>
       basin and flood plain. As per them, the concerns of reputation

      cannot be permitted to impact the constitutional rights of the citizens

      or to override the health of the citizens; the river and the

      environment.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">7.    PRELIMINARY OBJECTION

             Before we delve on the core issue, we would like to address

      the preliminary submission raised by the respondents to the

      maintainability of this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">8.    The preliminary objection raised is to the effect that the petition is

      grossly barred by delay and latches. The Respondent DDA submits

      that the change of land use for the site falling in Zone O was done

      on 21.09.1999 from "agricultural and water body" to "public and

      semi-public" purpose. The site in question was finalized way back in

      2003 and DDA had also put up a notice board at the site indicating

      that the site was meant for Commonwealth Village Games Complex.

      A period of five years has elapsed since then. Further, the global

      Tender Process for Public Private Partnership ("PPP") participation in

      the residential portion of the Commonwealth Games project was

      floated in December 2006 and was completed in June 2007, thereby

      creating 3rd party rights. Therefore, the writ petition deserved to be

       could have approached this Court somewhat earlier. Howsoever, at

      the same time the issue in hand, viz. preservation and protection of

      ecology of river Yamuna, is extremely important. The issue raised

      requires due deliberations and adjudication. Therefore, we would

      not like to throw this petition on this ground without discussing the

      merits thereof. At the same time, the delayed action will naturally

      have some bearing on the nature of directions which we propose to

      issue at the end.

SUBMISSION OF THE PETITIONERS

      Mr. Sanjay Parikh, Advocate, ably supplemented by Mr. Arvind Sah,

      Advocate and Mr. S.M. Aggarwal, Convener, Yamuna Monitoring

      Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_29">             The foremost submission of the petitioners is that despite the

      recommendations of the NEERI that no residential or industrial

      facilities requiring permanent structures be provided on the river bed,

      the DDA as well as DMRC chose Yamuna riverbed for construction

      activities of permanent nature. The choice of riverbed by the DDA

      for construction of the CommonWealth Games Village and by the

      DMRC for the construction of metro lines, yard, depot and

      residential houses goes against the Constitutional obligation and is in

      breach of Doctrine of Public Trust. The Petitioners submit that the

      entire process of grant of the Environment Clearance by MoEF is

      faulty and vitiated.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                           Page 9 of 96</span>
</p><p id="p_31"> 11.   The Environment Clearance dated 14.12.2006 was based on the

      recommendations of the Expert Appraisal Committee had permitted

      raising of temporary, dismantable structures. It had said that 'unless

      detailed studies lead to the conclusion that the proposed structures

      can be left behind permanently, the proposal should proceed with

      the assumption that the riverbed may have to be restored to the

      river'. This conclusion of the Expert Appraisal Committee was on the

      basis of NEERI 1999 Report which affirms independently NEERI 2005

      Report though the said 2005 Report was concealed by DDA from

      the Expert Appraisal Committee. The DDA was already in possession

      of NEERI 2005 as the same was at the behest of DDA itself which

      had clearly stated that 'no permanent structure of residential or

      industrial nature be provided in the river bed'. It is further submitted

      that the modified clearance letter dated 22.1.2007 stipulated two

      conditions, i.e.: (i) That DDA could go ahead with only „planning‟ of

      their construction work; and (ii) That the actual work on

      construction      will   not   start   till   such   time   that   work    on

      mitigation/abatement are identified; and none of these condition are

      complied with by the Respondents.

<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">12.   It is further argued that the NEERI 2005 Report also reviewed past

      development plans for river Yamuna in Delhi and had rejected the

      recommendations of CWPRS Report of 1993 for channelization of

      river as being unviable which may also pose considerable risk of

      flooding of the city area. The CWPRS Report of 2007 was on the

      basis of same data of earlier study conducted in May 1993. Out of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                                Page 10 of 96</span>
       the three studies which were recommended by the EAC of MoEF to

      the DDA, one on flooding risk, the other on river dredging and the

      third on extent of loss of recharge of ground water due to exclusion

      of the area under consideration, the second and third studies were

      not part of the CWPRS study.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">13.   The petitioners submit that the report of CWPRS, Pune submitted by

      DDA to MoEF was found to be not in conformity with the

      conditions of Environmental Clearance issued by MoEF dated 22

      January 2007. The said study was inadequate and there were certain

      contradictions and lacunae according to MoEF itself but no further

      study was carried out. Therefore, there was no proper study of the

      magnitude of additional afflux in the river during high flow and none

      at all as far as extent of loss of recharge of groundwater is concerned.

      The MoEF found several shortcomings in the report of the CWPRS,

      Pune as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           (i)     The study has not identified any particular area or part of
                   the Yamuna catchment in Delhi which are prone to flooding
                   during rainy season and how they should be protected.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           (ii)    Flooding or river Yamuna may result into blocking the drains
                   and nallas discharging into river Yamuna which may lead to
                   back flow from the drains and nallas causing flooding of low
                   lying areas and water logging.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">           (iii)   The study report is silent on this aspect.

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">           (iv)    The study report is based on earlier study conducted in May
                   1993. The study has not covered dredging aspect of river
                   Yamuna in Delhi.

<p id="p_36">14.   The MoEF still went ahead with the Environmental Clearance dated

      14.12.2006 as modified by letters dated 22.1.2007 and 29.3.2007

      under pressure from the DDA to allow construction of permanent

       structures in the riverbed. The DDA even before the clearance was

      granted informed EAC of MoEF vide various letters dated

      19.01.2007, 6.03.2007, 2.04.2007 that they are going ahead with

      the planning and the construction of the structures. Hence the MoEF

      modified the Environmental Clearance, illegally and under pressure

      from DDA to allow construction of permanent structures without

      being in full know of the dangers involved. The steps taken after the

      Environmental Clearance dated 14.12.2006 and the discussions

      between the DDA and MoEF officials show arbitrariness in their

      actions, against their statutory and constitutional obligations of

      protecting the river Yamuna and its riverbed, compromising the very

      purpose of the EIA.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">15.   It is further submitted that the DDA did not consider any other site

      for the CommonWealth Games Village and rejected the MoEF

      suggestion of Safdarjang Airport as alternate site on indefensible

      grounds. The EAC in its meeting held on 1st December 2006 noted

      that DDA did not consider any other site for the Common Wealth

      Games Village and this was the only site shown to the Common

      Wealth Games Federation.

<p id="p_41">17.   The next contention of the petitioners is to the effect that the

      creation of embankment cannot change the basic character and role

      of a riverbed. The construction of embankment does not mean that

      the present site is not part of a river bed. While an embankment may

      compromise the ability of the river bed and flood plain to play its

      rightful role of passage of flood waters and recharge of ground water

      it does not imply that the land ceases to remain a river bed and flood

      plain by such an encroachment over it. The River Yamuna and its eco

      system consisting of 9700 Hectare (97 sq. kms) of active flood

      plain/river bed in Delhi have been accepted by the Master Plan-

      Perspective 2021, NEERI 2005 Report and also by this Court in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                              Page 13 of 96</span>
       Baldev Singh Dhillon (supra). The NEERI Report 2005 at Page 1.3

      clearly lays down the same in the following words:

             Toposheets No. 53H."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_42">18.   The petitioners further submit that the river Yamuna has been

      damaged, polluted and silted up in such a manner that the NEERI

      Report of 2005 gave a finding to the effect that the stretch/river has

      lost its carrying capacity. This has happened because of various

      authorities not taking care of the nature's bounty and not applying

      the precautionary principle. This riverbed and the entire ecosystem

      cannot be allowed to get further exhausted. At present what is

      required is not application of precautionary principle but infact

      sincere efforts to rejuvenate the river as an obligation under the

      Constitution of India and the Doctrine of Public Trust.


</p><p id="p_43">19.   The learned counsel highlighted the danger of developing the

      Yamuna riverbed. The proposed Commonwealth Games Village on

      the Yamuna riverbed will only expose the Capital to the risk of

      severe flooding and will cause irreversible ecological damage. The

      construction will not only lead to reduction of ground water

      reserves, but will also completely stop the ground water recharge

      occurring from the flood plains. In the light of acute scarcity of fresh

      water in Delhi, reduction of the ground water reserve will further

      aggravate the water problem. It would destroy the natural reservoir,

      which collects water during the monsoon and releases them gradually

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                            Page 14 of 96</span>
       through the river. The other risk factor highlighted is that Yamuna

      floodplain lies on the seismic zone or the earthquake vulnerable

      zone. It is submitted that the dangers involved with developing a

      river bed and flood plains were brought home to the people in

      Mumbai and those in the country on 26th July, 2005 in a rather

      tragic manner where incessant rains in the city marooned larger parts

      of Mumbai city with consequent loss of life and property. It is widely

      believed that one of the main reasons for the devastation wrought

      by the deluge in Mumbai was the channelisation of river Methi in

      Mumbai. The Counsel referred the Report by Concerned Citizens‟

      Conclusion (CCC) - An inquiry into the Mumbai Floods, 2005

      wherein it was concluded that vast reclamation of land over the

      years for purposes such as BKC, the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, the

      unabated construction of unauthorized settlements along the banks

      and the "channelisation" of the river are three main interventions

      that have interfered to varying degrees with the Mithi‟s free flow

      causing the destruction witnesses on July 26. The Petitioner also

      referred various studies wherby highlighting the importance of flood

      plains, valuation of ecological functions and benefits, risks due to

      floods, and seismic hazard assessment for Delhi region. Hence, there

      is an apprehension, which according to the petitioners is based on

      logic and substance, that any construction on the floodplain will

      expose it to natural disaster and will only aggravate the bad shape of

      the river.

      being carried out by Respondent DMRC in the riverbed between ITO

      massive metro yard hardly at a distane of 200-250 meters from the

      present edge of the riverbed, residential complex in about 1.85 acres

      riverbed and a huge Games Village Metro Station, along with a mall

      permanent structures which are in violation of the this Court‟s orders

      river bed is to be restored to its original position with a clear

      intention that "Yamuna has to be redeveloped in such a manner that

      it becomes a habitat for trees, forests and centre of recreation." Vide

      removed and permitting concrete structures which permanently

      damage the river bed of the flood plain, to come up. The argument

      that the structures are permitted/sanctioned cannot be a ground to

      justify violation of directions of this Court, notwithstanding the fact

             glory which it once upon a time used to enjoy. River Yamuna
             is the lifeline for the citizens of Delhi. Right from its entry into
             Delhi till it leaves Delhi, the purity, sanctity and the cleanliness
             of its water has to be maintained. It is repeatedly claimed that

      a wetland of great importance has no legal protection in the country.

      The 10th Five Year Plan document in Chapter 9 dealing with Forests

      and Environment had mandated that: "A legislation for a River

      Regulation Zone on the lines of Coastal Regulation Zone would be

      attempted." Realizing this fact a committee to formulate draft

       the said committee was held on 8.1.2002 and 26.9.2002 at which a

      draft proposal on River Regulation Zone (RRZ) was presented and

      discussed. According to the Draft Document on River Regulation

      Zone - "The conservation of river requires that they are treated as

      ecosystem and their ecological integrity (physical, hydrological,

      chemical and biological characteristics and natural functions) is

      maintained." Rivers are not merely channels that transport water;

      they are dynamic ecosystems that change over time in response to

      hydrological and biological processes and human interventions.

      Therefore all those human/ anthropogenic activities that directly or

      indirectly damage the river and flood plain habitat or degrade the

      water quality also need to be prohibited or regulated by the Water

             Mr. Vahanvati, learned Solicitor General of India submitted

      that the area where the Commonwealth Games village is located is in

      NH-24 on the southern side, embankment on the western side,

      railway line on the northern side and Marginal bund on the eastern

      side. He submits that post 2002, after the construction of bund the

      site, where the construction is being done cannot be considered to be

      a floodplain. The Solicitor General argued that the petitioners

      themselves stated via the Experts‟ Study annexed as Annexure P-1

      that "Flood Plain are the areas between manmade embankments and

      level of the river channel (Fig. 1)". Therefore, the site which is

      beyond manmade bund cannot be said to be a Flood Plain. In this

      respect the Solicitor General also read over the relevant portion with

      respect to the NEERI Report of 1999 and 2005 wherein it is clearly

      recommended that the area beyond bund is to be reclaimed for

      development and construction, inter alia, stating as under :-

             constructed on either side of the water channel in a span
             between 550 m to 600 m depending upon the model studies.
             On this basis, an area of 2400 ha would be under the water
             channel including the two bundhs, which will act as major
             circulation roads, and the balance of 7300 ha will be
             reclaimed."

       bund created in 2002 and the area earmarked in 2003 for games.

      Therefore, the general guidelines provided by NEERI 2005 are

      subject to what is specifically approved. It is stated in the General

      Guidelines for Development of Riverbed, NEERI Report of 2005 that

      no residential or industrial facilities requiring permanent structure

      should be provided on the riverbed. He further submits that the

      NEERI Report of 2008 clearly takes note of the fact that the final

      report submitted by it in October 2005 did not assess the

      embankment (Akshardham Bund) which had come into existence as

      it was not part of the original study carried out by NEERI in the year

      1999. And taking note of the embankment clearly observed that the

      said area does not form part of the flood plain, and same is

      reproduced herein :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">             "Given the definition of the project area, as considered by

      been reclaimed as per the approval of the Yamuna Committee of

      Central Water Commission. In the instant case, the construction is

      being done on the CWG Village site near the Akshardham Temple

      which area is protected by the construction of bund.          Hence, no

       site is not in the flood plain of the river Yamuna. The present site is

      more than 1.3 Kilometers from the river bed. In this respect the

      reliance was further placed upon the order dated 12.1.2005 of the

      Apex Court in UP Employees Federation case i.e., WP No. 353/2004

      wherein the Apex Court approved the construction of a permanent

      structure, namely, the Akshardham temple in the Pocket III area,

      which is abutting the present site of construction. The Hon'ble

      Supreme Court recorded the fact that Akshardham construction was

      1.7 Kms. away from the riverbank.

      of DDA on the site in question have got the necessary clearances

      from the concerned authorities, including environmental clearances.

      The project was started by DDA after carrying out detailed and

      necessary studies through competent bodies. The permission and

      necessary clearances were given to DDA after adopting the

      suggestions/opinions given by research bodies. The MoEF vide its

      letter dated 29.3.2007, while granting permission to DDA to

      continue with the construction work, entailed specific conditions

      with respect to the development/construction phase of the

       The construction activity would not impact any eco-system as all

      remedial measures are in place. Based on the recommendations of

      NEERI, change of land admeasuring 42.5 hectares in Pocket III was

      notified by Gazette Notification dated 21.9.1999. It is submitted that

      in its Report of 2005, NEERI has suggested the proposed use in

      accord with eco-friendly development. It is submitted that DDA has

      not changed any water body in the Zone „O‟ and Part „P‟ to other

      uses. It is submitted that the groundwater recharge pond area, as

      suggested by NEERI, has not been disturbed and retained.             It is

      submitted that rain water from the pocket shall be transferred to

      ground aquifers by means of recharge wells. Thus, there shall be no

      adverse impact on the ground water recharge system of the area. It is

      clear that despite the desirability and necessity of the permanent

      structures for the Commonwealth Games Village, the MoEF did not

      allow construction of the permanent structures to begin till such time

      the mitigation measures against upstream flooding were duly

      identified and a condition to implement the said mitigation measures

      were imposed on the project proponent.

      transform the capital into a "Global City". 71 countries are making

      extensive preparations based on the above commitment for

      participation in the CWG, 2010. Should the hosting of the games be

      delayed or not take place, it would result in loss of national prestige.

      It is in national interest that the project is to be completed in time

      because a delay in the completion of the project would be fatal and

      would deprive the country of the various benefits which will accrue

      to India on account of the holding of the Games, which are being

      organized        by     the   Technically   qualified   officials   and   sports

      administrators with rich experience. It is submitted that if the Games

      for any reason whatsoever are either delayed or do not take place, it

      would not only be a loss of prestige of the country but would result

      in a colossal waste of national resources and the considerable time

      Court are with respect to the encroachments and the same has

      nothing to do with the Planned Development. It was further

      submitted that all facts were not placed before the Court, especially

      with respect to the 2010 Commonwealth Games. It is submitted that

      the order dated 8.12.2005 of this Court is to be read in the context

      and the subject matter with respect to removal of illegal

       authorized construction is not permissible. So far as the order dated

      3.5.2003 is concerned, this Court directed that the Yamuna bed and

      both sides of the river are to be clear from encroachments. Further,

      vide order dated 3.5.2005, the High Court directed that the

      authorities concerned, DDA, MCD etc. to forthwith remove "all

      unauthorized structures, jhuggi, places of worship another structures

      in the riverbed and its embankment within two months of the said

      date." A perusal of the aforesaid two orders will clearly show that

      the intention of the High Court was loud and clear that the riverbed

      should be made free from encroachments and unauthorized

      structures.      This Court never intended to stop the development

      project of general public importance with regard to construction of

       at the cost of environmental degradation. For giving answer to the

      arguments        involving   this   dilemma,   we   need   to   take    into

      consideration the law which has developed on the subject.




</p><p id="p_64">33.   SETTLED PRINCIPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL JURISPRUDENCE

             In the beginning of civilization man was simply a part of

      natural system he inhabited, utilizing a small share of its energy and

      material requirements. As his numbers increased and his culture and

      technology changed, he found it difficult to cope up within the

      framework of existing natural system. So, he simplified the natural

      system into an artificial, young and highly productive system.

      Improved technology and new discoveries incited him to extract

      more and mare from natural system. Any kind of advances/

      development no doubt plays a vital role in improving the standards

      of the society but the same entails associated costs, many of which

      are environmental costs. As Zygmunt J.B. Plater (Zygmunt J.B. Plater,

      et al., Environmental Law and Policy: Nature, law and Society,

      (1992) West Publishing Co, p.2):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">             Tradeoff between short-term material welfare and long-term
             ecolgical integrity do occur, although environmentalists often
             argue against false tradeoff decisions where rational
             alternatives are available. "You have to choose: either
             economic development, or environmental quality, you can't
             have both."- that cliché is the classic false tradeoff.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_65">34.   Each case of environmental issue involves a highly individualized set

      of scientific facts, economic and political issues, and social and natural

      consequences. There is, however, a special environmental perspective

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                             Page 25 of 96</span>
       that provides a common ground for all environmental cases. The

      positions taken by environmentalists are typically based upon a

      broadened accounting of the considerations involved in decision-

      making. Almost every environmental case starts in response to

      someone‟s decision to do something: new products or technologies;

      construction projects; the start, continuation or cessation of various

      programs that affect the physical world. The people who make these

      decisions        are     usually   not   environmentalists.   Indeed,    the

      environmental position often surfaces relatively late in the game,

      long after the planning stage and well into the implementation stage,

      when citizens finally see bulldozers rolling. A common complaint of

      the environmental camp is that these ongoing decisions are

      predicated on irrationally and unrealistically narrow grounds. The

      proposed actions, it is argued, unwisely ignore facts, costs, and

      impacts on social and natural values that have real importance to the

      well-being of the community.              By virtue of their broad view of

      problems and sometimes skeptical view of benefits, environmentalists

      often end up sounding negative (ZygmuntJ.B. Plater, et al.,

      Environmental Law and Policy: Nature, law and Society, (1992) West

      Publishing Co, p.3). The environmental perspective does not

      reflexively condemn economic activity; it insists only that decisions to

      pursue environmentally detrimental activities be made in a way that

      gives an adequate accounting of the full range of impacts. As

      President Barber Conable of the World Bank summarized it, "Good

      to each other. In this context, the Chairman of World Commission

      on     Environment        and    Development   (1987)    forwarded        that

      „environment‟ is where we all live; and „development‟ is what we all

      do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are

      inseparable. It was further observed in the Report that there is need

      to re-examine the critical environment and development issues and

      to formulate realistic proposals dealing with them. Keeping this

      paradigm in mind, the term „sustainable development‟ came in

      frequent     use       whereby   development   was      supposed     to    be

      economically viable, socially just and ecologically sound. Thus,

             Industrialization, burning of fossil fuels and massive
             deforestation are leading to degradation of environment.
             Today the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide, the principal
             source of global warming, is 26% higher than pre-industrial
             concentration.

      Kamal Nath</a> (1997) 1 SCC 388, the court took notice of an article in a

      leading daily alleging ecological damage in Kullu Valley due to illegal

      construction of a motel. In 1995, Span Motels built a resort on the

      bank of Beas river. Kamal Nath, former Minister of Environment

      and Forests had links with the hotelier, who had encroached a swath

      of forest land. The encroachment was validated in 1993-94 during

      Nath‟s tenure as Minister.       During the 1995 monsoons, the river

      engulfed part of the land and threatened the resort. Span Motels

      carried out work to deflect the flow of the river, which was causing

      environmental damage. An article to this effect was published in one

      of the leading dailies of which the court took notice. The court held

      that the motel interfered with the natural flow of the river by trying

      to block the natural relief/spill of the river and thus directed

      cancellation of the lease deed in favour of the motel. The motel was

      also asked to pay compensation by way of restitution of the

      environment and ecology of the areas. Besides, several other

      directions were issued to the motel and the government. The court

      held the doctrine of public trust to be a part of the law of the land

       and the state, as a trustee of all natural resources, was under a legal

      duty to protect them, and that the resources were meant for public

      use and could not be transferred to private ownership, stating :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_94">             17. The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle
             that certain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests have
             such a great importance to the people as a whole that it would
             be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private
             ownership. The said resources being a gift of nature. They
             should be made freely available to everyone irrespective of the
             status in life. The doctrine enjoins upon the Government to
             protect the resources for the enjoyment of the general public
             rather than to permit then- use for private ownership or
             commercial purposes. According to Professor Sax the Public
             Trust Doctrine imposes the following restrictions on
             governmental authority.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">             Three types of restrictions on governmental authority are often
             thought to be imposed by the public trust: first, the property
             subject to the trust must not only be used for a public purpose,
             but it must be held available for use by the general public;
             second, the property may not be sold, even for a fair cash
             equivalent; and third, the property must be maintained for
             particular types of uses.

<blockquote id="blockquote_97">             If any of the analysis in this Article makes sense, it is clear that
             the judicial techniques developed in public trust cases need not
             be limited either to these few conventional interests or to
             questions of disposition of public properties. Public trust
             problems are found whenever governmental regulation comes
             into question, and they occur in a wide range of situations in
             which diffuse public interests need protection against tightly
             organized groups with clear and immediate goals. Thus, it
             seems that the delicate mixture or procedural and substantive
             protections which the courts have applied in conventional
             public trust cases would be equally applicable and equally
             appropriate in controversies involving air pollution, the
             dissemination of pesticides-, the location of rights of way for
             utilities, and strip mining or wetland filling on private lands in
             a state where governmental permits are required.

             appropriate virtually the entire flow of 4 of the 5 streams
             flowing into the lake. As a result of these diversions, the level
             of the lake dropped, the surface area diminished, the gulls were
             abandoning the lake and the scenic beauty and the ecological
             values of the Mono Lake were imperiled. The plaintiffs
             environmentalist - using the public trust doctrine - filed a law
             suit against Los Angeles Water Diversions. The case eventually
             came to the California Supreme Court, on a Federal Trial
             Judge's request for clarification on the States public trust
             doctrine. The Court explained the concept of public trust
             doctrine in the following words:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_99">             By the law of nature these things are common to mankind -
             the air, running water, the sea and consequently the shores of
             the sea." (Institutes of Justinian 2.1.1.) From this origin in
             Roman law, the English common law evolved the concept of
             the public trust, under which the sovereign own "all of its
             navigable waterways and the lands lying beneath them 'as
             trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_101">             The objective of the public trust has evolved in tandem with
             the changbg public perception of the values and uses of
             waterways. As we observed in Marks v. Whitney, supra, 6 Cal.
             3d 251, "(public trust easements [were] traditionally defined in
             terms of navigations commerce and fisheries. They have been
             held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for
             boating and general recreation purposes the navigable waters
             of the State, and to use the bottom of the navigable waters for
             anchoring, standing, or other purposes. We went on, however,
             to hold that the traditional triad of uses-navigation, commerce
             and fishing-did not limit the public interest in the trust res. In
             language of special importance to the present setting, we stated
             that "[T]he public uses to which tidelands are subject are
             sufficiently flexible to encompass changing public needs. In
             administering the trust the state is not burdened with an
             outmoded classification favoring one mode of utilization over
             another. There is a growing public recognition that one of the
             most important public uses of the tidelands-a use encompassed
             within the tidelands trust-is the preservation of those lands in
             their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for
             scientific study, as open space, and as environments which
             provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and which
             favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

             scenic views of the lake and its shore, the purity of the air and
             the use of the lake for nesting and feeding by birds. Under
             Marks v. Whitney, supra, 6 Cal. 3d 251, it is clear that

             common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands,
             surrendering that right of protection only in rare cases when

<blockquote id="blockquote_106">             The state has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into
             account in the planning and allocation of water resources, and
             to protect public trust uses whenever feasible. Just as the
             history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary
             for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public
             trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriate water rights
             system administered without consideration of the public trust
             may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests,
             (See Johnson, 14 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 233. 258-257; Robie,

             necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite
             foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the
             state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect
             of the taking on the public trust (see United Plainsmen v. N.D.

<blockquote id="blockquote_108">             It is no doubt correct that the public trust doctrine under the

             such as navigation, commerce and fishing. But the American
             Courts in recent cases have expanded the concept of the public
             trust doctrine. The observations of the Supreme Court of
             California in Mono Lake case clearly show the judicial concern

              in protecting all ecologically important lands, for example fresh
             water, wetlands or riparian forests. The observations of the
             Court in Mono Lake case to the effect that the protection of
             ecological values is among the purposes of public trust, may
             give rise to an argument that the ecology and the environment
             protection is a relevant factor to determine which lands, waters
             or airs are protected by the public trust doctrine. The Courts in
             United States are finally beginning to adopt this reasoning and
             are expanding the public trust to encompass new types of lands
             and waters. In Phillips Petroleum co. v. Mississippi 108 S.C.C.
             791 [1988], the United States Supreme Court upheld
             Mississippi's extension of public trust doctrine to lands
             underlying no navigable tidal areas. The majority judgment
             adopted ecological concepts to determine which land can be
             considered tide lands. Phillips Petroleum case assumes
             importance because the Supreme Court expanded the public
             trust doctrine to identify the tide lands not on commercial
             considerations but on ecological concepts. We see no reason
             why the public trust doctrine should not be expanded to
             include all eco-systems operating in our natural resources.

      the Apex Court discussed the Doctrine of Public Trust. The Court

      approved of artificial methods of water recharging and protection of

      ground water. It was laid down that the disposal of assets which are

      subject matter of public trust can be disposed of in a manner

             Doctrine of Public Trust. This doctrine, though in existence
             from Roman times, was enunciated in its modern form by the
             US Supreme Court in Illinois Central Railroad Company v.
             People of the State of Illinois 146 US 537 (1892) where the
             Court held:

<blockquote id="blockquote_112">             The bed or soil of navigable waters is held by the people of the
             State in their character as sovereign, in trust for public uses for
             which they are adapted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_113">             [...] the state holds the title to the bed of navigable waters
             upon a public trust, and no alienation or disposition of such
             property by the State, which does not recognize and is not in
             execution of this trust is permissible.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_114">             What this doctrine says therefore is that natural resources,
             which includes lakes, are held by the State as a "trustee" of the
             public, and can be disposed of only in a manner that is
             consistent with the nature of such a trust. Though this doctrine
             existed in the Roman and English Law, it related to specific
             types of resources. The US Courts have expanded and given
             the doctrine its contemporary shape whereby it encompasses
             the entire spectrum of the environment.

<blockquote id="blockquote_117">              Thus the public trust is more than an affirmation of state power

<blockquote id="blockquote_118">             This is an articulation of the doctrine from the angle of the
             affirmative duties of the State with regard to public trust.
             Formulated from a negatory angle, the doctrine does not
             exactly prohibit the alienation of the property held as a public
             trust. However, when the state holds a resource that is freely
             available for the use of the public, it provides for a high degree
             of judicial scrutiny upon any action of the Government, no
             matter how consistent with the existing legislations, that
             attempts to restrict such free use. To properly scrutinize such
             actions of the Government, the Courts must make a distinction
             between the government's general obligation to act for the
             public benefit, and the special, more demanding obligation
             which it may have as a trustee of certain public resources,

             Law: Effective Judicial Intervention", Michigan Law Review,
             Vol.68 No.3 (Jan.1970) PP 471- 566)]. According to Prof. Sax,
             whose article on this subject is considered to be an authority,
             three types of restrictions on governmental authority are often
             thought to imposed by the public trust doctrine [ibid]:

             Century as never before envisaged. While the crisis of
             economic growth is still on, the key question which often arises
             and the Courts are asked to adjudicate upon is whether
             economic growth can supersede the concern for environmental
             protection and whether sustainable development which can be
             achieved only by way of protecting the environment and
             conserving the natural resources for the benefit of the
             humanity and future generations could be ignored in the garb
             of economic growth or compelling human necessity. The
             growth and development process are terms without any
             content, without an inkling as to the substance of their end
             results. This inevitably leaves us to the conception of growth
             and development which sustains from one generation to the
             next in order to secure `our common future'. In pursuit of
             development, focus has to be on sustainability of development
             and policies towards that end have to be earnestly formulated
             and sincerely observed. As Prof. Weiss puts it, "conservation,
             however, always takes a back seat in times of economic stress."
             It is now an accepted social principle that all human beings
             have a fundamental right to a healthy environment,
             commensurate with their well being, coupled with a
             corresponding duty of ensuring that resources are conserved
             and preserved in such a way that present as well as the future
             generations are aware of them equally. The Parliament has

      SCC 281 the Apex Court concerned with the problems faced by

      other things, ordered the Government to strengthen environment

      protection measures and take remedial action to remove sludge. It

      also ordered that industrial units not complying with its orders

      should be closed. The Court observed that in matters relating to

      environment, it may not always be possible to lay down rigid or

      uniform standards for the entire country. While issuing notifications

      like the present, the government has to balance various interests

      including economic, ecological, social and cultural. While economic

      development should not be allowed to take place at the cost of

      ecology or by causing widespread environmental destruction and

      violation, at the same time, the necessity to preserve ecology and

      environment should not hamper economic and other developments.

      Both development and environment must go hand in hand. In other

      words, there should not be development at the cost of environment

      and vice-versa, but there should be development while taking due

      care and ensuring the protection of the environment.

      necessary to take stock of some relevant and underlying facts

      concerning Yamuna. Therefore, at this juncture, let us take judicial

      notice of the critical condition of the river Yamuna and the steps that

      have been taken in the past few years by the judiciary and

      governmental organizations, hand in hand, to improve the same.

      Likewise, some other relevant facts having bearing on this issue also

</p><p id="p_83">46.   It is a known fact that the river Yamuna in Delhi has been in a bad

      shape for quite some time now and is referred to as a dead river.

      Once the lifeline of Delhi, Yamuna has now become the most

      polluted water resource of the country. It has been reduced to a

      pale, sickly drain and poses a threat to the human life. It overflows

      with filth, effluents, dirt and even dead bodies. It is said that there is

      a visible difference between the water quality at Palla (where the

      Yamuna enters Delhi) and at Okhla (where it leaves Delhi). As the

      Yamuna traverses through the city, it is slowly converted from a river

      to a drain. It is estimated that the 22 km stretch of the Yamuna that

      runs along Delhi - from Wazirabad in the north to the Okhla Barrage

      in the south- contributes 80-90 percent of the total sewage discharge

      into the river, reducing it to a stinking drain. From big industries and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                            Page 49 of 96</span>
       factories to people living in big colonies, slums and rural areas, all

      pollute the river with impunity because of untreated water.


</p><p id="p_84">47.   The change of status of Yamuna (from a river to a drain) is owing to

      several factors. First, the huge water demand of Delhi city makes sure

      that a lot of water is withdrawn the very moment Yamuna touches

      Delhi. This reduces the volume of total water in the river as it flows

      through the city, leading to a reduction in the self-cleaning capacity.

      This water is then released back into the river, when it leaves the city

      (as sewage) which is the second most serious problem. There is a

      paucity of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in the capital. There is also

      an incorrect estimation of the total number of such plants needed as

      the volume of water that is diverted from the river for drinking

      purpose is less than that released as waste - back to the river.

      Increasing pollution of the Yamuna has now become an international

      issue and a cause of concern for environmentalists. No doubt there

      was a time when river Yamuna was a lifeline of Delhi providing

      precious potable water to its residents. At present, the quality of river

      Yamuna is categorized as 'E'. This makes the water of river Yamuna

      unfit       for         even   animal       consumption.        (Source:

       water in the river Yamuna. The Courts giving its raison d'etre have

      adopted a proactive approach in matters pertaining to the protection

      and preservation of the river Yamuna. <a href="/doc/1980462/" id="a_49">In Dr. B.L.Wadehra v. Union

      of India</a>, AIR 1996 SC 2969 it was taken on record by the Apex

      supply - is the free dumping place for untreated sewage and

      industrial waste and whereby placing statutory obligation upon

      Municipal Corporation to scavenge and clean the city. In 2004, the

      matter of pollution of river Yamuna came up for consideration

      before the Supreme Court In Re: News Item published in Hindustan

      Times titled "And quite flows the Maily Yamuna, (2004) 8 SCC 638

      and it was noted that although the Court had directed its attention

      to cleaning up the river almost a decade ago, there has been no

      improvement. However, the water quality has in fact deteriorated

      during the last about five years on a comparison of reports which

      were filed by the CPCB. The Court further noticed that figures placed

      before it showed that the quality of the river water was better before

      it entered Delhi; and stressed upon the need and expectations from

      the Government and all the agencies to take curative as well as

      preventive measures. The Apex Court has been monitoring the work

      of cleaning the river for the past 12 years after taking a suo motu

      cognizance of a news report about the pollution caused to the

      river.(See: <a href="/doc/1948587/" id="a_50">News Item 'Hindustan Times' A.Q.F.M. Yamuna v. Central

</p><p id="p_89"> 49.   A number of projects have been launched by various organizations to

      clean the Yamuna, but till date nothing encouraging has happened.

      The situation is worsening by the day. The Yamuna Action Plan

      (YAP) was launched in April 1993 but so far has been of no avail.

      More than a decade after its inception, YAP's achievements have

      been woefully short of its stated goals. However, newspaper reports

      have since indicated that despite an expenditure of Rs.87 crores on

      what is called the Yamuna Action Plans I and II, the river continues to

      remain as dirty as it was about a decade ago (perhaps more) and

      most people believe it to be nothing more than a sewer.

<blockquote id="blockquote_141">             "The river Yamuna is one of the most important natural
             features of Delhi and supposed to be a major source of water
             supply to the city. River Yamuna in NCT of Delhi cuts through
             the city from the North to south for a length of merely 50 kms.
             The total of about 9700 hectares of land is situated in the
             designated river bed defined by the existing marginal bund on

             practically without any natural source of water. With swelling

             year, there is serious water crisis. Need/Demand of water far
             exceeds the supply. For this limited supply also, Delhi has to
             depend on neighbouring Cities/States. It is a matter of common

<p id="p_91">51.   The Central Pollution Control Board's Report of 2007, "Water

      Quality Status of Yamuna River", covers the findings of monitoring

      studies undertaken between 1999 and 2005 and lists the Yamuna as

      the most polluted river stretch in the country and the 22 km long

      Delhi stretch is severely polluted. It is stated that Delhi contributes

      around 3,167 MLD (million litres per day) of sewage through 22

      major drains joining the Yamuna. The Report further states that over

      Rs 2,000 crore (Rs 20 billion) has flown into the sewage canal

      (which the river Yamuna has become) since the government began its

      efforts to clean it up in 1985 - [Delhi's allocation of the Yamuna

      Action Plan is around Rs 573 crore (Rs 5.73 billion) and the state

      spent another Rs 1,200-1,500 crore (Rs 12-15 billion) on its sewage

      treatment plants since 1993]. Yet, the Bio Oxygen Demand, or BOD

      levels, in the river have gone up, not just steadily, but alarmingly. In

      1993, these were measured at around 130 tonnes a day. This more

      than doubled to 276 tonnes a day in 2004 and, in February last year,

                    Due to flood protection measures undertaken in the
             upstream, after the severe floods of 1978, the peak flood
             discharge in NCT-Delhi has been steadily increasing. In the
             absence of adequate measures to improve the channel
             capacity, the flooding in flood plains and contiguous areas has
             increased.     This increase besides effecting the human
             settlements, has altered the vegetation pattern too. The
             subsequent flood protection measures exacerbated these
             impacts in many cases resulting in drying up of some pools,
             swamps and marshes.

          expected to be 433 ha-m. The water spread areas are predicted
          through HEC-2 simulation model for different discharges after
          dredging is outlined in Figs. 4.2 and 4.3. The model predictions
          for flood way analysis with dredging is in Table 4.5. In this
          scenario, the Reed-Swamp Associations and herbaceous
          communities still receive 25th percentile flood waters. But the
          wooded community and pond near the New Railway Bridge in
          the Pocket III would receive water only during once in 50 years
          flood discharge. The stream geometry is not effected and

<blockquote id="blockquote_195">                   Being centrally situated and considering pressures on the
                    land, the land in riverbed is precious. If not developed
                    in a planned manner, it would be encroached upon and
                    built upon as already going on. Prevention and removal
                    of encroachments is always difficult; so such situation
                    should be avoided.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_196">                   It will result into less and under utilization of the
                    precious land resource situated in the centre of the Delhi
                    Metropolitan Area.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_197">                   It will lead to urban sprawl since the housing and other
                    activities for the growing population of Delhi is being
                    spread out and located at the urban fringes.
                   The heavily built-up and congested area (e.g. Old City)
                    will not have any opportunity for relief and
                    decentralization of economic activities.
                   A large amount of water in the river is evaporated
                    because of its low dept and wide spread, resulting in
                    shortage of water, affecting ultimately the supply of
                    potable water and irrigation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_198">             Alternative (ii)

             This includes 85% green for recreational purposes and partly
             (15%) for gainful purposes residential, commercial, public and
             semi-public uses. Overriding advantages of this strategy over
             the first one:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_199">                 It will release about 7300 ha of land for urban activities
                     largely for recreational use and provide an opportunity
                     to restructure the land use pattern, not only of Delhi but
                     also of the Delhi Metropolitan Area.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_200">                 This would integrate the two parts of Delhi each of
                     metropolitan character, with the river front on either
                     side.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_201">                 Trans-Yamuna area which is extremely deficient in
                     recreational facilities and open spaces could be
                     compensated by this scheme of development of
                     recreational use in the riverbed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_202">                 The urban sprawl could be controlled without disturbing
                     the green character of the area and need for recreational
                     use.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_203">                 The controlled discharge of water will avoid

<p id="p_123">      OUR ANSWER

</p><p id="p_124">69.   We started our judgment by pointing out that this case involves

      balancing of two extreme and conflicting ideologies. On the one

      hand, the respondents are concerned with the development of the

      capital city and the opportunity which has come in the form of 19th

      CWG-2010 for which Delhi is the host is seen as an opportunity to

       plan the city by creating such infrastructure which would place the

      city on the world map by its inclusion in the list of world-class cities.

      The world over, cities vie with each other to host "hallmark" events

      such as the Olympics, World Cup‟s etc. It is seen by many as a sure

      way of shooting the host city into the limelight, resulting in an

      „economic windfall‟ (Baade, R and Matheson, V. 2002. Bidding for

      the Olympics: Fool‟s Gold? Transatlantic Sport: The Comparative

      Economics of North American and European Sports, (London:

      Edward Elgar Publishing, 2002), 127-151.), and at the same time

      giving these host cities the impetus to improve domestic facilities and

      infrastructure. The impact of the nomination of a city as organizer,

      range from the physical (construction projects) to the intangible

      (local self-esteem or international impact). The impact that an event

      of this kind has on the urban landscape can largely be gauged by the

      size of the „legacy‟ that it creates. It is important to note here that it is

      not only legacy creation that is important, but creating a legacy

      which is beneficial to the host community post games, and which

      justifies the costs involved.
</p>
<p id="p_125">
</p><p id="p_126">70.   In recent years, therefore, hosting sporting events has been viewed as

      a prestigious achievement resulting in opportunities for economic

      profit, urban regeneration and global media exposure. Increasingly

      such sporting events are being aimed at increasing the exposure and

      visibility of the host city, and many academicians believe that success

      cannot be simply decided by profit and loss, as there are many

      intangible and unaccounted for benefits (Brown, A and Massey, J.

      an economic superpower, and the games are a step in propelling

      India on to the world stage. In Delhi‟s bid for the games, it states that

      through the games, the city wishes to, among other things: 1.

      Stimulate economic growth and development; 2. Improve city

      infrastructure. (The Report of the Commonwealth Games Evaluation

      Commission for the 2010 Commonwealth Games). Thus two of the

      professed aims of the games are to improve the welfare of the

      citizens of the city through improving facilities and promoting

      investment in the city. This Court in <a href="/doc/1027546/" id="a_54">Shivaai Industries (P) Ltd. v. Rites

               participating. These include countries from almost all
               continents. It also cannot be disputed that for holding these
               games, the host country is bound to meet the specification and
               requisite standards as laid down by the Organizers of these
               games relating to the infrastructure, proper and necessary
               facilities at the venues of the games etc. Of course, need to
               revamp existing stadia and construct more; provide facilities for
               player and sports persons, including 'Games Village' is manifest.
               Such facilities and infrastructure are not and cannot be confined
               to various stadia and venues alone where games are to be
               held. For watching these games, people from all the
               participating countries would be thronging the city. In fact, to
               make the event a success and generate revenue, it is necessary
               to attract the people from all over and to achieve that proper
               infrastructure in all respects has to be in place. Such an event is

              always exploited as 'Sports and Tourism' combined. It is for this
             reason, these requirements include providing adequate hotel
             and other accommodation, necessary infrastructure outside
             venues, including transportation, etc. Above all, Delhi as a city
             and NCR region will have to show its best face. For this, all
             types of facilities like more luxury and budget hotels, making
             metro rail fully operational, modernisation of airports etc. is
             needed. Other facilities like proper and well constructed roads,
             flyovers, availability of all forms of transportation including
             private and public modes of transportation is required as well.
             This brings the necessity of state of art BQS and construction of
             toilets as well. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that
             Organizers of the games have been visiting Delhi and
             inspecting the progress insofar as the preparation for these
             games are concerned and they have also expressed, in the past,
             their concern over the slow progress. To meet the deadlines, it
             is necessary to bring impetus to progress in this direction."

      on "The Impact of the Commonwealth Games 2010 On Urban

      Development of Delhi" which raises some hard questions that need

      to be answered before one can conclude that such an event has a

      positive effect on the host community. Can the financial requirements

      for such an event be possible to generate? Some other questions that

      arise out of such events, with particular relevance in this paper, is its

      impact on the urban scenario. Will the event lead to rampant and

      unchecked development, possibly unplanned? Will the infrastructure

      created be beneficial post-event or will it remain under utilised? Will

      the city‟s infrastructure be able to bear the strain of additional visitors

      that flood the city during such an event? Will the event prove to be a

      hindrance to the city‟s residents during the event? The author

      concludes the said paper in the following words :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_212">             "One can see that at least on paper; the city is all set to
             transform itself by the time it plays host to the Commonwealth
             Games. However it is also necessary to keep one thing in mind,
             and that is that Delhi is otherwise too a rapidly growing city, a
             dynamic economy and an integral part of India‟s growth
             engine. Delhi is estimated to have a population of approx. 192
             lakh people by 2010, compared to 140 lakh in 2001, a growth
             of nearly 40% (www.delhistat.com). This means that it would
             be wrong to place the causation of all infrastructure and urban
             development onto the Commonwealth Games. A large
             amount of it would probably have taken place anyway, the
             games just gives it a geographical bias and a deadline.

<blockquote id="blockquote_213">             The world over there is a serious re-think taking place among
             city officials as well as academics about the way to go about
             these events. Do they do more harm than good is not a
             question that has been answered conclusively, as many of the
             benefits derived are intangible ones. However it has yet to be
             conclusively shown that these events are beneficial as well and

              it is crucial to examine each event independently, studying its
             unique characteristics, as well as examine previous events and
             try and learn from their mistakes.

<blockquote id="blockquote_214">             Delhi‟s citizens have a right to know about the benefits that
             such events can have to the city, but need to be informed of
             the downsides as well. The present plan for the
             Commonwealth Games may be a recipe for an ecological and
             financial disaster, or they might finally put the city, and the
             country, on the world map. They may bring in a new era
             where electricity and water problems, perennial problems in
             the city, are no longer an issue or they might increase the
             burden on an already overloaded system. Popular perception
             tells us that the Asian Games was an unmitigated success. Closer
             analysis tells us that it was not so simple. The Commonwealth
             Games, with some smart marketing, may just follow in those
             footsteps."

<p id="p_131">74.   On the other hand, the environmentalists perceived some of the

      construction activities, particulary on the periphery of Yamuna, as

      dangerous to the environment and particularly Yamuna river. It is,

      thus, again a matter of sustainable development where two apparent

      conflicting interests are to be balanced and it is the duty of the courts

      to ensure that the infrastructural development is not at the cost of

      environment. We have already outlined the principles of law which

      are to be kept in mind while dealing such an issue. To recapitulate in

      brief, the concept of Sustainable Development would mean balancing

      ecology and development. To achieve this, the State is to adopt an

      integrated and coordinated approach in the development planning

      so as to ensure that development is compatible with the need to

      protect and improve environment for the benefit of its people. In

      other words, eco-systems and organisms, including land, marine and

      atmospheric resources, are to be managed in such a manner to

      achieve and maintain optimum sustainable productivity, but not in a

      way which would endanger the integrity of those other eco-systems

       or species with which they co-exist.       Activities which might have

      impact on nature are to be controlled and best available techniques

      that minimize significant risk to nature or other adverse affects are to

      be used.         Infrastructure is to be created keeping in view „eco-

      development‟ whereby development is aimed for, along with

      adoption of mitigating measures so as to avoid devastation of natural

      resources/environment.

      standards of the people of the country is also the need of the hour.

      It is necessary that the economic conditions of the people in this

      country improve and economic welfare grows; India becomes

      economic super-power and is brought at par with the developing

      nations, such economic grows for the welfare of common people is

      the need of the hour, which is also the mandate enshrined in the

      Constitution in the Chapter entitled „Directive Principles of State

      Policy‟. The achieve this, if the State adopts certain measures and

      take policy decisions with that end in view, courts generally keep

      their hands off and do not interfere with such decision taken by the

      policy makers who are experts in their field. It also hardly needs to

      be emphasized that the development of basic infrastructure is sine

      qua non of the economic growth. Today, all the countries in the

      world, and particularly most of the developing countries in Asia, are

      striving hard to achieve this and we cannot leave ourselves left

      behind. It is for this reason that the growth is taking place in most of

      the countries in the 21st Century at a level never envisaged before.

      resources and environment. The challenge, therefore, is to ensure

      that the economic growth does not supersede the concern for

      environmental protection and the natural resources are conserved as

      far as possible. In order to achieve this Sustainable Development, the

      principles which have been developed are: (a) the Precautionary

      Principle; (b) the Polluter Pays principle; (c) the Public Trust doctrine;

      activities as formulated by the Respondents are to be implemented

      keeping in view the principles and doctrines discussed hereinabove.

      That is to say, there has to be simultaneous care of the river Yamuna

      and its flood plains to as much extent as possible. The fact that the

      river Yamuna has lost its carrying capacity, as argued by the

      petitioners herein on the basis of the NEERI Report of 2005 is to be

      kept in mind and effort need to be made in the direction of restoring

      and reinstating the river as a natural resource. It goes without saying

      that the same will be by the way of cooperation and participation of

      not only the respondents but also of the petitioners, and other

      people/organization associated with the drive of cleaning the river

      Yamuna.

      concerns in the fore-front while undertaking the project of

      construction activities at the periphery of Yamuna, be it CWG-2010

      or the Metro project. As pointed out above, as per the respondents,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">WP (C) No. 7506/2007   nsk                                            Page 76 of 96</span>
       the construction began only after the environmental clearances were

      obtained by the MoEF and these clearances were granted after

      conducting expert studies, as recommended by it.


</p><p id="p_138">78.   Insofar as construction relating to the CWG-2010 is concerned, as per

      the counter affidavit of MoEF, the constructions of buildings would

      be taken up in only 3 hectares of the site area of 11 hectares and DDA

      will construct, as temporary structures, the dining hall, polyclinic and

      some related temporary structures in consultation with the

      Organizing Committee of the Commonwealth Games Federation in

      the remaining areas. Therefore, they maintain that the total area of

      3 hectares where buildings are to be constructed under the CWG

      project is miniscule when compared to the total area near the river

      Yamuna and the same poses no ecological threat and feasibility of

      construction of permanent structures over a small area out of the

      total area which forms a part of the NEERI Report.

      of the project. Further on account of permanent structure being

      constructed, the MoEF vide its letter dated 29.3.2007, while granting

<p id="p_142"> 82.   There was a great debate as to whether the construction is on the

      riverbed or not.       The term „riverbed‟ and „flood plain‟ are used

      interchangeable throughout the Report of Experts referred to. One

      may say, as submitted by the Learned Counsel for the Respondent

      DMRC, that riverbed is only the bed on which the actual river flows

      while as the rest is the river floodplain. The authorities on this aspect

      hold distinguishing views and are to be taken note of. In the

      Conservators of the River Thames v. Smeed, Dean &amp; Co. (1897) 2

      QB 335 (at 337), it was held that the word riverbed denotes that

      portion of the river which in the ordinary or regular course of nature

      is covered by the waters of the river. However, in <a href="/doc/1372364/" id="a_55">Ashgar Ali &amp; Ors

      v. Secy. of State &amp; Ors</a>., AIR 1930 Cal 764 the bed of the river was

      defined as the area covered by the river and is the space sub-adjacent

      to the river and is the space sub-adjacent to the river over which it

      flows between the banks. It is the space between the banks occupied

      by the river at its fullest flow. The Black‟s Law Dictionary (6th Edn.

      Pg. 154) describes a river bed as the hollow channel of a water

      course; the depression between the banks worn by the regular and

      usual flow of water; the land which is covered by the water in its

      ordinary low stage; the area extending between the opposing banks

      measured from the foot of the bank from the top of the water at its

      ordinary stage. In P. Ramanatha Aiyer‟s „Advanced Law Lexicon (Vol-

      IV, 2005 Edn., pg. 4157-4158) has described the bed of a river as the

      space contained between the banks; „riverbank‟ in turn has been

      defined in the same law lexicon as the boundaries of a river

       throughout its width when the water flows to its maximum quantity.

      Wikipedia Encyclopedia states that stream bed is the channel bottom

      of a stream or river or creek, the physical confine of the normal

      water flow. The lateral (channel margins) during all but flood stage

      are known as „stream banks‟ or „river banks‟. In fact, a flood occurs

      when a stream overflows its banks and flows onto its flood plain.

      at Akshardham. If the stand of the petitioners on the interpretation

      of „riverbed‟ is to be accepted, the petitioners conceded that even the

      construction at Akshardham was on the riverbed.         However, it is

      difficult to gloss over the fact that this very construction of

      Akshardham was the subject matter of challenge before the Supreme

      Court in U.P. Employees Federation‟s case and the Apex Court

      dismissed the said writ petition vide orders dated 12.1.2005

      recording that the said construction was in accordance with the

      sanctioned plan and with nearly 1700 mts. away of the „riverbank‟.

      Therefore, whether the present construction is on the „riverbed‟ or

      not itself would be a disputed question. We are, therefore, of the

      opinion that so far as the issue raised by the parties herein as to the

      present site not being part of flood plain/ river bed after the creation

      of embankment in 2002, the same requires consideration of an

      expert committee.

      Nile, London on Thames, Paris on Seine, Frankfurt on Rhine, Karachi

      on Indus etc.          Whether such a project can be replicated for river

      Yamuna also is a matter which experts can decide. We may point

      out that as per the petitioners channelization of river Yamuna is

      neither feasible nor environment friendly.

             of the project. The conception and the decision to undertake a
             project is to be regarded as a policy decision. While there is
             always a need for such projects not being unduly delayed, it is
             at the same time expected that as thorough a study as is
             possible will be undertaken before a decision is taken to start a

             execution of the same should be taken expeditiously. It is for
             the Government to decide how to do its job. When it has put
             a system in place for the execution of a project and such a
             system cannot be said to be arbitrary, then the only role which

<p id="p_155">91.   While the aforesaid features go in favour of the ongoing construction

      in the vicinity of river Yamuna, we also find on record the following

      features: Though, according to the MoEF, necessary environmental

      clearances have been obtained on the basis of the report of CWPRS,

      this Court may not move into the correctness of the Report of the

      CWPRS commissioned by the DDA for the purpose of the instant

      construction or for that matter the NEERI Reports of 1999 and 2005.

      So far as NEERI Report of 2005 is concerned, it is clear that the same

      is silent over the embankment created in 2002. It is clear that the

      said Report is with respect to the rejuvenation of the river Yamuna

      and made recommendation with respect to the whole riverbed. The

      same neither specifically covers the area where the construction is

      going on at present nor restricted to area earmarked in 2003 for the

      Games.
</p>
<p id="p_156">

      14.12.2006, as modified by letters dated 22.1.2007 and 29.3.2007

      by MoEF was a conditional clearance. The above-listed conditions

       by MoEF over the construction only require strict monitoring.

      Moreover, during the course of arguments when the aforesaid

      aspects of NEERI Reports of 1999 and 2005 were pointed out by the

      counsel for the petitioners, NEERI submitted its affidavit dated

      29.1.2008 clarifying that the site in question was not even a „flood

      plain‟, much less a „riverbed‟. We are constrained to observe that

      this affidavit is the result of some of the loopholes in its earlier

      reports which were picked up by the petitioners and pointed out to

      the Court. From an institution of this repute, it was not expected

      that report of this kind would be submitted. The Court gathers an

      impression that it is a tailor-made report given to suit the

      requirement of the respondents.       In the earlier report given by

      NEERI, as is pointed out above, it had recommended only the

      construction of temporary structures. It is not at all explained as to

      what were the changed circumstances which weighed with NEERI to

      opine that structures can be of permanent nature. Even otherwise,

      when DDA is permitted to go ahead with permanent structures, the

      same is subject to so many conditions and it is necessary to ensure

      that these conditions are complied with.

      to stop the construction, which may have far more serious

      consequences, more particularly when at this juncture no alternative

      is available.     As noted in the beginning, the petitioners did not

      approach the Court well in time to enable it to direct the

      respondents to undertake further studies or think of alternate site, if

       it was ultimately to be found that the site in question was not very

      appropriate. There is hardly any time for such an exercise if CWG-

      2010 are to take place as scheduled. Furthermore, the respondents

      have at least the necessary clearances to go ahead with the

      construction. While permitting this construction activity, we are also

      the opinion that some further steps are needed to address some very

      important and significant aspects highlighted by the petitioners before

      us, insofar as impact of this construction on river Yamuna is

      and directly related to the essential operational requirements of the

      ha under water and the balance 7300 ha under dry land. DDA has

      proposed to reclaim and utilize these dry lands for more usual

      purpose like recreational and similar other uses. Further, the NEERI

      Report of 2005 approved total area of 219 for roads and metros out

      of which the DMRC was given 40 hectares. The relevant portion is at

             site and in case it was not feasible, it should propose
             reclamation of the bare minimum area away from the active
             river edge. In the 63rd meeting of YSC the representatives of

             not be located anywhere and that the bare minimum
             requirement for the depot in Yamuna Khadir has been worked
             out as 45 ha. instead of 71.42 ha. indicated earlier. It has also
             been mentioned therein that Delhi Government had approved
             six corridors as part of MRTS Phase-II. The Connaught Place to

              Line. A new connection from Yamuna Bank to New Ashok
             Nagar which will run along the Noida Link Road and would
             terminate at New Ashok Nagar has also been proposed. It is
             stated in the proposal that the alignment of this new line
             would be on viaduct and would comprise of stations at
             Yamuna Bank, Games Village, Mayur Vihar Phase-I and Mayur
             Vihar Phase-I Extn. enroute in the Yamuna Khadir.            A
             presentation on the new proposal was made by the DMRC
             before the Yamuna Standing Committee. It was mentioned by
             the DMRC that 45 ha. of land is required for the Depot and
             11.92 ha. for Yamuna Bank Station and the corridor. The
             Chairman of the Committee pointed out that for Depot at
             Shastri Park, DMRC required 34 ha. of land whereas 45 ha. of
             land was proposed for the Depot on this line. DMRC
             representative explained that there is only one line in Shastri
             Park corridor, whereas there would be two corridors starting
             from the Yamuna Bank Station. One would lead to Anand
             Vihar and other to New Ashok Nagar. The land in between the
             two corridors cannot be used for Depot purpose that is why
             the land requirement for this depot is more. Chairman stressed
             that DMRC may work out the barest minimum land required
             for this depot.

<blockquote id="blockquote_242">                    The Committee noted that the stations on the corridor
             from Yamuna Bank to Ashok Nagar may be constructed on the
             raised platform so that the minimum flood plain of the river
             Yamuna is encroached and these stations may not obstruct the
             flow of water during floods. On this DMRC representative
             told the Committee that the alignment of this new line was
             discussed by them with the CE (I&amp;F) Delhi and he had agreed
             to allot the alternative land or this line on the bank of the
             drain after crossing the Noida link road. Therefore DMRC is
             now planning that this line after crossing the Noida link road
             near the Noida morh will run parallen to the road on the left
             side at the bank of the Nallah. CE (I&amp;F) Delhi agreed to allot
             the alternative land for this line just on the bank of the drain
             after crossing the Noida link road. This whole alignment then
             will be away from the Yamuna Flood plains. He sought that
             construction of Depot be approved in principle subject to the
             DMRC again reviewing the proposal and submit the revised
             proposal with barest minimum land requirement for the
             Depot. The Committee was of the view that DMRC should
             not construct any staff quarters in this area and approach DDA
             to allot alternative land for the same. The Chairman desired
             that the DMRC may prepare a revised proposal and submit to
             the Yamuna Standing Committee for consideration.

<blockquote id="blockquote_243">                   The Committee also decided that the guide bunds of the
             proposed bridge on river Yamuna for the DMRC line and
             Railway Bridge should not be joined and flood water should
             be allowed to spread in the area freely. The DMRC may
             explore the possibility for providing alternative access to the
             Depot in consultation with CWPRS."

      depot was reduced to 33.72 hectares from 45 hectares along with

      land for a station and vidaduct alignment 11.08 hectares. The said

      proposal was circulated to the members of the Standing Committee

             proposal of 2 ha. DMRC also mentioned that CWPRS, Pune
             had completed their studies for the left guide bund for the
             proposed rail bridge and the details are given in technical
             report No. 4246 of July 2005 received on 12.7.2005. 300m

             aligned normal to the bridge axis but upstream guide bund is
             to be aligned at an angle of 1000 with the bridge axis. A side
             slope of 1:2 and an approx width of 30m are proposed to be

             whether it was possible to increase the gap between guide
             bunds of proposed bridge for DMRC line and ITO bridge.
             Similarly there should be a gap in d/s guide bund of the DMRC
             bridge &amp; the Nizamuddin Railway Bridge for allowing free
             passage of flood water keeping in view the requirement of
