CAV JUDGEMNT
 


 


 
	  


	By way of this
	application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
	Code, 1973, the petitioners have prayed for quashing and setting
	aside the impugned complaint filed by respondent No.1-Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board, which is registered as Criminal Case No.273
	of 1991 in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class,
	Gondal, Dist:Rajkot, for the alleged offence under <a href="/doc/1271595/" id="a_2">Sections 24</a> and
	<a href="/doc/90679/" id="a_3">25</a> read with <a href="/doc/344989/" id="a_4">Sections 43</a>, <a href="/doc/1757074/" id="a_5">44</a> and <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_6">47</a> of the Water (Prevention &amp;
	<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 ( the Act  for short). The
	present petitioners were partners of the Firm namely  M/s.Chhaya
	Dyes and Chemicals .
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_9">	2.	It appears from bare
	reading of the impugned complaint that the officers of Gujarat
	Pollution Control Board visited the factory premises of the said
	Firm on 16.11.1990 and accordingly, inspection report came to be
	prepared as provided under <a href="/doc/791447/" id="a_8">Section 23</a> of the Act, wherein it was
	found that the effluent is being discharged without obtaining any
	consent and a sample came to be collected as can be culled out from
	the said inspection report. On basis of the said report, the
	Competent Authority of respondent No.1-Board got permission to file
	the present complaint on 08.02.1991 and accordingly, the impugned
	complaint came to be filed against the Firm being original accused
	no.1 and others-accused nos.2 to 8 being partners of the said Firm.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_10">	3.	It is further
	averred in the impugned complaint, more particularly, Para-10 of the
	complaint that the sample came to be collected on 16.11.1990 and on
	basis of which the impugned complaint has been filed. 
</p>	

 


 


 


 


 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_11">	4.	It further appears
	that the discharge application came to be preferred by the present
	petitioners being original accused nos.6, 7 and 4  respectively. It
	was, inter alia, contended in the said application that as far as
	petitioner nos.1 and 3 are concerned, they have retired from accused
	No.1-Firm w.e.f 08.04.1987. It was further contended that when the
	inspection was carried out on 16.11.1990, petitioner nos.1 and 3
	were not even partners of the said Firm, and therefore, petitioner
	nos.1 and 3 cannot be held liable for the alleged offence.
	Similarly, petitioner no.2 i.e. original accused no.7 filed a
	discharge application on the ground that petitioner no.2 stays in
	U.S.A. and is only a sleeping parter and is not involved in
	day-to-day affairs and management of the said Firm.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_12">	5.	It further appears
	from the record that the said applications came to be dismissed by
	learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gondal on 10.02.2012 and came to
	the conclusion that as once the process is issued, there are no
	powers of review of an order and
	opined that remedy lies in invoking <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section 482</a> of the Code. 
</p>	
	 


	
	 


<p id="p_13">	6.	Mr.Vimal Patel,
	learned counsel for the petitioners contended that petitioner Nos.1
	and 3 have retired from the original accused No.1-Firm w.e.f
	08.04.1987 and relied upon the copy of the Deed of Dissolution of
	the partnership Firm dated 08.04.1987. Mr.Patel, further contended
	that on the date on which, inspection was carried out on basis of
	which the impugned complaint is filed, petitioner Nos.1 and 3 were
	not even the partners of the said Firm and therefore, they cannot be
	saddled with criminal liability and that too vicariously only
	because of the fact that they are once the partners of the said
	Firm. He further contended that as far as petitioner No.2 is
	concerned being original accused No.7, she also stays in U.S.A. and
	entered as sleeping partner in the said Firm w.e.f 19.10.1987 as can
	be seen from the Partnership Deed at Annexure-D to the application,
	and therefore, was not in day-to-day management of original accused
	No.1-Firm. It was thus submitted that petitioner No.2 cannot be held
	vicariously liable for the alleged offence under the said Act.
	Mr.Patel, contended that no prima facie case is made out
	against any of the petitioners and even if, the complaint is taken
	at its face value in view of the fact that petitioner Nos.1 and 3
	were not partners on the date on which, the inspection was carried
	out by respondent No.1. Mr.Patel, further submitted
	that on wrong information about the petitioners, petitioner Nos.1
	and 3 are straightway arraigned as accused in the impugned complaint
	without proper verification. He further submitted that no specific
	allegations are made in the complaint as to the role played by the
	petitioners. It was further submitted that it bornes out from bare
	reading of the impugned complaint that no offence is culled out
	against the petitioners and therefore, the complaint amounts to
	harassment to the petitioners and even petitioner No.2 being
	sleeping partner and was not in day-to-day management of the Firm,
	no vicarious liability that too criminal liability can be fastened
	upon petitioner No.2. 
</p>	

 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_14">	Mr.Patel, submitted
	that impugned complaint qua present petitioners would amount to
	abuse of process of Court and law and therefore, this Court may
	exercise its inherent powers to secure the ends of justice and quash
	the impugned complaint as prayed for. Mr.Patel, learned counsel for
	the petitioners in order to buttress his arguments has relied upon
	the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Anita
	Malhotra Vs. Apparel Export Promotion Council and Anr., reported in
	2012(1)SCC 520 and National
	Small Industries Corporation Ltd. Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal &amp;
	Anr., reported in AIR 2010 SC (Supp) 569 and
	in the case of Shri Moosa Raza Vs. State of Gujarat &amp; Anr.,
	reported in 2009 (2) GLH 200 passed
	by this Court.
</p>
 


 


 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_15">	8.	Per contra,
	Mr.Rituraj Meena, learned counsel for respondent No.1-Board has
	opposed this application and submitted that, even though, 
	undertaking was filed by all the partners of accused No.1-Firm, the
	same was violated and even earlier, criminal case was launched
	against accused No.1-Firm and all its partners being Criminal Case
	No.628 of 1956 before the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate First
	Class, Gondal.    He further submitted
	that whether the petitioners were in day-to-day affairs of the
	management or not, is a matter of trial and submitted that this
	Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_10">Section 482</a> of the Code should not embark upon an
	inquiry whether the evidence in question is relied or not. Relying
	upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Uttar
	Pradesh Pollution Control Board Vs. Bhupendra Kumar Modi, reported
	in 2009(2) SCC 147
	submitted that the impugned complaint cannot be quashed on the
	grounds, which are set out by the petitioners. Relying upon the
	affidavit filed before this Court, it was submitted that undertaking
	was given by the petitioner Firm, wherein petitioner Nos.1 and 3
	were signatory and therefore, it is not believable that petitioner
	Nos.1 and 3 have resigned as partners of accused No.1-Firm. It was
	therefore, submitted that the petition is misconceived and has
	disputed question of facts arise, this Court may dismiss the
	same.
</p>
 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_16">	9.	Ms.Moxa Thakkar,
	learned counsel for respondent No.2-State has adopted the arguments
	made by Mr.Meena, learned counsel for respondent No.1-Board and has
	opposed this application.
</p>	 


	

 
	  


<p id="p_17">	Before considering the
	submissions made by learned counsel for the respective parties, on
	bare perusal of the impugned complaint, it appears that the same is
	filed by authorized officer of respondent No.1-Board on 16.03.1991
	before the Court of learned Magistrate at Gondal.  It is stated in
	the complaint that the petitioners along with other persons are
	partners and accused No.8 is the Manager of accused No.1-Firm. It is
	alleged that on 16.11.1990, when the Deputy Engineer along with
	other officers of the Board conducted inspection of the premises of
	Industrial unit of accused No.1-Firm and at that time, accused
	No.8-Manager was present and it was found that water effluent was
	being discharged in total defiance to the provisions of the Act and
	on basis of the said inspection report, the petitioners have been
	arraigned as accused in the impugned complaint on the ground that
	they are partners of accused No.1-Firm.
</p>	 


	

 
	 


<p id="p_18">	11.	It may further be
	noted that except the bare fact that the petitioners are partners of
	the said Firm, there are no averments, much less any specific
	averment to the effect that the petitioners were engaged in
	day-to-day affairs and management of accused No.1-Firm. The
	complaint further indicates that on the date on which, the
	inspection was carried out by Inspecting Team of respondent
	No.1-Board, original accused No.8  Manager was present. It is
	further alleged that as no consent was obtained by accused
	No.1-Firm, Criminal Case being Criminal Case No.628 of 1986 was also
	lodged before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Gondal
	and the same is pending. In context of the said complaint, even
	though undertaking was given by the Firm as well as its partners,
	the same is not adhered. 
</p>	
	 


	
	 


<p id="p_19">	12.	Considering
	the complaint and version of the complaint as far as present
	petitioners are concerned, except the fact that they are the
	partners, nothing is alleged. The petitioners have specifically
	averred on basis of the documents that petitioner Nos.1 and 3 have
	retired from accused No.1-Firm w.e.f. 08.04.1987, whereas petitioner
	No.2 is only sleeping partner and
	stays at U.S.A and she is entered the partnership Firm on
	19.10.1987. 
</p>	
	 


	
	 


<p id="p_20">	13.	It is also brought
	on record that by communication dated 28.01.1998, accused No.1-Firm
	did inform the officers of respondent No.1 that present petitioner
	No.1 has retired from the Firm. It may further be noted that as
	averred in the complaint that, criminal complaint was lodged being
	Criminal Case No.628 of 1986 before the Court of learned Judicial
	Magistrate First Class, Gondal. It may further be noted that in
	order to ascertain as to the status of the said complaint, this
	Court has called for the details from the concerned Court and as per
	the report submitted by the learned Principal District Judge,
	Rajkot, it has been revealed that Criminal Case No.628 of 1986  is
	disposed of and the accused i.e. present petitioner No.1 and the
	partners of accused No.1-Firm were acquitted vide judgment and order
	dated 19.02.1998.
</p>
 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_21">	14.	At this juncture,
	it would be appropriate to refer to the judgment of the Hon ble
	Apex Court in the case of Anita Malhotra (supra),
	wherein the question of vicariously liability of Directors of the
	Company is considered. The Hon'ble Apex Court has observed thus:-
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_22"> 7.	Accused No.1
is a Company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_11">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and in the
complaint it was stated that accused Nos.2 and 3 are its Directors.
Insofar as the roles of A-2 and A-3 are concerned, it was stated in
the compliant that they are the Directors of the Company and are
responsible for the conduct of the business and also responsible for
day to day affairs of the Company. It was further stated that all the
accused persons, who were in charge of and were responsible to the
Company for the conduct of its business at the time the offence was
committed, shall be deemed to the guilty of the offence.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_23">22.	This
Court has repeatedly held that in case of a Director, the complaint
should specifically spell out how and in what manner the Director was
in charge of or was responsible to the accused Company for conduct of
its business and mere bald
statement that he or she was in charge of and was responsible to the
Company for conduct of its business is not sufficient.(Vide National
Small Industries Corporation Ltd. Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal.) In the
case on hand, particularly, in para 4 of the complaint, except the
mere bald and cursory statement with regard to the appellant, the
complainant has not specified her role in the day-to-day affairs of
the Company. We have verified the averments as regards to the same
and were agree with the contention of Mr.Akhil Sibal that except
reproduction of the statutory requirements, the complainant has not
specified or elaborated the role of the appellant in the day-to-day
affairs of the Company. On this ground also, the appellant is
entitled to succeed.

<p id="p_24">		The
	Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of National
	Small Industries Corporation  (supra) while
	considering the vicarious liability of Directors, in
	paragraph No.25 has observed thus:- 
</p>	

 


<p id="p_25"> 25. From the
above discussion, the following principles emerge : 
</p>
 


<p id="p_26">(i) The primary
responsibility is on the complainant to make specific averments as
are required under the law in the complaint so as to make the accused
vicariously liable. For fastening the criminal liability, there is no
presumption that every Director knows about the transaction. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_27">(ii) <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_12">Section 141</a>
does not make all the Directors liable for the offence. The criminal
liability can be fastened only on those who, at the time of the
commission of the offence, were in charge of and were responsible for
the conduct of the business of the Company. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_28">(iii) Vicarious
liability can be inferred against a Company registered or
incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_13">Companies Act</a>, 1956 only if the requisite
statements, which are required to be averred in the
complaint/petition, are made so as to make accused therein
vicariously liable for offence committed by Company along with
averments in the petition containing that accused were in-charge of
and responsible for the business of the Company and by virtue of
their position they are liable to be proceeded with. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_29">(iv) Vicarious
liability on the part of a person must be pleaded and proved and not
inferred. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_30">(v) If accused is
Managing Director or Joint Managing Director then it is not necessary
to make specific averment in the complaint and by virtue of their
position they are liable to be proceeded with. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_31">(vi) If accused is
a Director or an Officer of a Company who signed the cheques on
behalf of the Company then also it is not necessary to make specific
averment in complaint. 
</p>
 
	  


<p id="p_32">	The person sought
	to be made liable should be in-charge of and responsible for the
	conduct of the business of the Company at the relevant time. This
	has to be averred as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a
	Director in such cases.  
</p>
 
	 


<p id="p_33">		This Court in the case
	of Shri Moosa Raza
	Vs. State of Gujarat &amp; Anr., reported in 2009(2) GLH 200,
	has examined identical issue and has  observed thus:- 
</p>	
	 


	
	  


<p id="p_34">	8.	Having heard
	the learned Counsels for the parties and having considered their
	rival submissions in light of the statutory provisions as well as
	the decided case law on the subject, the Court is of the view that
	there is no averment in the complaint which shows the deemed
	involvement of the petitioner in the day to day affairs or business
	transactions of the company. <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_14">Section 16(1)</a> of the Act makes it clear
	that where the offence was committed by every person who at the time
	of offence committed was directly incharge or was responsible to the
	company for the conduct of the business of the company. If one reads
	the complaint and takes into consideration the averments made in the
	complaint, it is abundantly clear that the ingredients of <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_15">Section
	16(1)</a> are not found in the complaint and simply because the
	petitioner was a Director of the company, he could not be presumed
	to be incharge of the affairs of the company. This is not the
	requirement of <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_16">Section 16(1)</a>. A positive averment should have been
	made in the complaint to hold the petitioner liable. 
</p>	
	 


<p id="p_35">	9.	Apart
	from this, the facts clearly reveal that at the time when the
	offence was committed, the petitioner was not the Director of the
	Company. In the complaint, it is specifically stated that the period
	under consideration was the period from 09.11.2005 to 11.11.2005.
	Admittedly the petitioner was not the Director during this period.
	Form 32 is placed on record which shows that the petitioner has
	tendered his resignation on 13.05.2005 and Form 32 was filed with
	the Registrar of Companies on 09.07.2005. As per the complaint, the
	Environment Engineer, Vigilance Dept. of the Board visited the
	company premises on 09.11.2005 to 11.11.2005 and formed prima facie
	opinion that the company has committed breach of provisions of
	Environmental laws. Complaint was, thereafter, filed in 2006. Thus,
	at the time of commission offence for which complaint was filed, the
	petitioner was not a Director. 
</p>	
	 


<p id="p_36">	10.	The legal
	position is also very clear on this aspect. In the case of Nalin
	Thakore and Others (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly
	held that the issue of summons to the appellants was without any
	application of mind as nothing was said in the complaint or in the
	statement recorded by the Vth Joint Judicial Magistrate before issue
	of summons that the offence was committed with the consent or
	connivance of or was attributable to any negligence on the part of
	the appellants. The Court further held that sub-section (2) of
	<a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_17">Section 47</a> requires that where an offence under this Act has been
	committed by a company and it is proved that the offence has been
	committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to
	any negligence on the part of any Director, Manager, Secretary or
	other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or
	other officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of that offence and
	shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
	There being no allegation as regards the requirement of sub-section
	(2) of <a href="/doc/1873888/" id="a_18">Section 47</a>, the Vth Joint Judicial Magistrate committed an
	error in issuing summons. 
</p>	
	 


<p id="p_37">	11.	In the case
	of State of Haryana Vs. Brij Lal Mittal and Others (supra), the
	Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the vicarious liability of a
	person for being prosecuted for an offence committed under the Act
	by a company arises if at the material time he was in charge of and
	was also responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.
	Simply because a person is a Director of the company it does not
	necessarily mean that he fulfills both the above requirements so as
	to make him liable. Conversely without being a director a person can
	be in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of
	its business. In the case before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, except a
	bald statement in the complaint that the respondents were directors
	of the manufacturer Company, there is no other allegation to
	indicate, even prima facie, that they were in charge of the company
	and also responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.
	Therefore, the complaint was liable to be quashed. 
</p>	
	 


<p id="p_38">	15.	In the case
	of Nicosulf Industries and Exports Private Limited Vs. State of
	Gujarat 2002 (2) GLR 1580, this Court has held that from <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_19">Section
	47(1)</a> of the Act, it is clear that alongwith the company a person
	who has in-charge of the company and was responsible to the company
	for the conduct of the business of the company shall be liable for
	the offence committed by the company. This vicarious criminal
	liability can be fastened only when it is proved by the prosecution
	that the revisionist no.2 was in-charge of the company and was
	responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the
	company. He was only one director and there were two other directors
	who were acquitted by the lower Appellate Court on the ground that
	the ingredients of <a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_20">Section 47(1)</a> of the Act could not be established
	against those two directors. However the initial burden lay upon the
	prosecution to prove that the revisionist no.2 was in-charge of the
	company and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the
	business of the company. The Court further held that the Director
	cannot be said to be responsible to the company for the conduct of
	the business of the company. In absence of evidence, the revisionist
	no.2 was not required to prove that the offence was committed
	without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to
	prevent the commission of such an offence as contained in proviso to
	<a href="/doc/759065/" id="a_21">Section 47(1)</a> of the Act.  
</p>	

 


 


 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_39">	15.	Considering the
	submissions as well as judgments cited, it clearly borne out from
	the complaint that no specific role is attributed to the petitioners
	and hence, they cannot be held vicariously liable for the alleged
	offence. There is nothing in the complaint, which goes to show that
	the petitioners were in active and day-to-day affairs of the Firm,
	hence, as per the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Apex Court as
	well as this Court, the petitioners cannot be saddled with the
	criminal liability. In addition to this petitioner Nos.1 and 3 have
	resigned in the year 1987, whereas inspection of the Industrial Unit
	of original accused No.1-Firm was undertaken on 16.11.1990 on basis
	of which impugned complaint is filed, and therefore on the date on
	which the inspection was carried out, petitioner Nos.1 and 3 were
	not even the partners of accused No.1-Firm and therefore, they
	cannot be held liable for day-to- day affairs of the Firm.
	Similarly, petitioner No.2 who is a sleeping partner cannot be held
	to be vicariously liable. 
</p>	

 


 


 


 


 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_40">	16.	Reliance placed for
	upon the earlier case, as observed above is already disposed of and
	original accused No.1.-Firm and its partners, who were accused in
	the said compliant have already been acquitted by the Competent
	Court vide judgment and order dated 19.02.1998 and therefore, even
	on that ground, the petitioners cannot be held vicariously liable.
	It is however made clear that present petition is filed by original
	accused Nos.6, 7 and 4 and the observations made in the judgment
	would apply to only the petitioners herein and the trial Court shall
	proceed with other accused in accordance with law. Even, at the cost
	of repetition, it is observed that the observations made in this
	judgment judgment and order shall apply only to the petitioners and
	the same shall not in anyway prejudice the rights and contentions of
	the complainant to proceed with other accused in accordance with
	law. 
</p>	
	 


	

 
	 


<p id="p_41">	17.	Considering the
	averments made in the application, contentions raised by learned
	counsel for the parties and also considering the ratio laid down by
	the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as this Court, it appears that to
	continue criminal proceedings against the petitioners would be
	unnecessary harassment to the petitioners. The same would amount to
	abuse of process of law and Court. Hence, to secure the ends of
	justice, the impugned complaint deserves to be quashed and set aside
	in exercise of inherent jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_22">Section 482</a> of the Code
	of Criminal Procedure, 1973 qua present petitioners.
</p>
 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_42">	18.	For
	the reasons stated hereinabove, the present application is allowed.
	The impugned complaint being Criminal Case No.273 of 1991 filed by
	respondent No.1 against the petitioners being original accused
	Nos.6, 7 and 4 is hereby quashed. Rule is made absolute to the
	aforesaid extent.
