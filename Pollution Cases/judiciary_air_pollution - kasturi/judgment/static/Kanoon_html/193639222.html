<p id="p_2">U.C. Dhyani, J (Oral)

              By means of present writ petition, the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)    to issue a writ, order or direction in the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (ii)   to issue a writ, order or direction in the
       nature of certiorari quashing the impugned order /

</p>

being processed after the judgment of Hon'ble NGT.

submitted that the respondents may also be directed to
restore the power supply and remove the seal of the
plant.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7)          Learned counsel for the respondent Board
submitted that Board is ready to re-consider the case of
the petitioner in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_9">8)          Learned counsel for the parties stated before
this Court that writ petitions filed against similar
notices have already been allowed by this Court and
identical order can be passed.
</p>

<p id="p_10">9)          Writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of at
the admission stage itself by directing the petitioner to
make representation to the respondent Board within a
week, annexing therein copy of the writ petition, which
it has filed before this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_11">10)         The respondent Board is directed to decide
the representation of the petitioner and re-consider its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             4</span>




case by a reasoned and speaking order in accordance

in abeyance till then.

supply to the plant, in that event, power supply will be
restored within forty eight hours from the time of
supply of certified copy of the order as well as copy of
writ petition.

learned counsel for the parties today itself on payment
of usual charges.
