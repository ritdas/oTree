M.M. KUMAR, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            This order shall dispose of C.W.P. Nos. 3918, 3919 and

4755 of 2008 as common question of law and facts are involved. The

petitioners have approached this Court for quashing closure notice

dated 26.11.2007 (P-9), issued by the Haryana State Pollution Control

Board under <a href="/doc/1915687/" id="a_1">Section 33-A</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of

Pollution) Act</a>, 1974. A further prayer has been made for directing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> C.W.P. No. 3918 of 2008                                              2</span>

the respondents to allot a plot of bigger size in Dyeing Zone Sector

29, Part-II, Panipat.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.           Brief facts of the case are that the matter regarding

contamination of ground water being caused by in-discriminate

discharge of pollution by small and tiny units engaged in dyeing and

printing activities in Panipat Town was considered in various

meetings of the Environment Protection Council, Haryana, under the

Chairmanship of His Excellency the Governor of Haryana. It was

noticed that out of 500 units of Panipat, about 300 tiny units, which

were employing 5-6 persons, were operating from residential and

non-conforming areas of the Panipat Town. Thus, in principle it was

decided to formulate a time bound action plan for relocation of small

scale industrial units working in the congested areas of Panipat Town

in a separate industrial estate so that their effluent could be treated in

a common effluent treatment plant.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.           In the meeting of the Environment Protection Council,

held on 19.9.2001 it was decided that Sector 29 Part-II and Sector 30,

Panipat, being developed by the HUDA, would be suitable site for

relocating the aforementioned units. The issue with regard to cost of

sites for relocating the units was also considered and it was decided

that cost of the plot may be realised as per the following formula:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "i)    5% of the price along with the application form.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             ii)    10% within 30 days of issue of allotment letter.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             iii)   Balance 85% in half yearly instalments payable

                    over a period of 10 years."</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">             It was further decided that the HUDA will carry out an

exercise to work out a scheme in which the larger units would be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> C.W.P. No. 3918 of 2008                                            3</span>

charged more, so that the price payable by the tiny units could be

reduced further i.e. less than Rs. 1,428/- per square yards.

</p><p id="p_6">4.           Again the subject was considered in a meeting held on

26.2.2002 and at Item No. A-84(2) Suppl. A-84. A policy decision

was taken that the units involved the dyeing and printing activities in

Panipat Town which were functioning from residential and non-

conforming zone should be shifted to the new industrial area and land

be given to them on 'no profit no loss basis' by the HUDA in Sector

29 Part-II, Panipat. Thereafter, a survey was conducted by the Survey

Team of the Regional Office of the Board at Panipat to identify all

such units for being relocated to the new sites in Sector 29 Part-II,

Panipat. A survey list of 494 units was prepared, which were found

existing in the non-conforming zone in Panipat Town. In the list

complete information was incorporated viz. name of the unit, address,

name of the owner, type of industries, total area of plant in square

meters, total area of dyeing section in square maters, total investment,

quantity of effluent discharged, point of discharge, status of effluent

treatment plan whether installed or not, proof of ownership, status of

air pollution and land recommended by team in square meters. The

policy decision dated 26.2.2002 has been placed on record as

Annexure P-2.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.           It is conceded position that the petitioners in these

petitions were transacting the dyeing and printing activities in the

non-conformity zone and their units were identified by the Survey

Team and their names figure in the survey list at Sr. Nos. 219, 494

and 15. In the survey list, in the column of 'Total area of plant in Sq.

Mtr.' the area against the names of the petitioners has been mentioned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> C.W.P. No. 3918 of 2008                                             4</span>

as 7000, 8500 and 4500 square meters. However, in the last column

of the survey list with head 'Land recommended by team in Sq.

Mtrs.', recommendation was made for allotment of plots measuring

500 square meters only in each case. It is also conceded position that

all the petitioners have already been allotted plot Nos. 505, 488 and

509 in the Dyeing Zone Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat, measuring 525

square meters each. The grouse of the petitioners is that they are not

able to shift their units due to small size of the plots allotted to them

because at the new site they could not fix their huge machinery. They

have also made representations for allotment of bigger size plots in

the Dyeing Zone in Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat. The petitioners have

also placed on record a communication dated 31.1.2007 made by the

Regional Office of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board to the

Chief    Administrator,      HUDA,      Panchkula      (P-5)    wherein

recommendation has been made in favour of the petitioners for

allotment of 1500 square meters plots.        It has been specifically

mentioned in the aforementioned letter that the cases of the

petitioners fall well within the policy and eligible for consideration

for allotment of bigger size of plot.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.           The petitioners have claimed that their claims have not

been decided and now the Haryana State Pollution Control Board has

issued notices of closure, dated 26.11.2007, directing them either to

shift their units to Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat or the same would be

closed down. The petitioners submitted reply to the notice of closure

and requested that recommendations dated 31.1.2007 made by the

Regional Office of the Board be implemented and plots of 1500

square meters be allotted to them. A copy of one such reply is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> C.W.P. No. 3918 of 2008                                           5</span>

available as Annexure P-10 with C.W.P. No. 3918 of 2008.

However, the reply submitted by the petitioners has evoked no

response.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.          During the course of hearing some other petitions

concerning allotment of plots in the Dyeing Zone Sector 29, Part-II,

Panipat, it has come to our notice that the HUDA has also issued an

advertisement, dated 11.7.2007, in the newspapers for allotment of

industrial plots in Dyeing Zone, Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat. It was

mentioned in the advertisement that in the 84th meeting of the

Authority, held on 26.2.2002, the policy for shifting of Dyeing units,

functioning from Panipat Town/non-conforming zone, as identified

by the survey conducted by the Board in the year 2001, was approved

but despite lapse of 5 years, some of the entrepreneurs who had been

identified for the allotment of plots in the zone have not come

forward till that date seeking allotment of plot. Since the plots could

not be left as such for an indefinite period, therefore, a last chance

was again given to such entrepreneurs and applications were invited

upto 10.8.2007. It was further mentioned that the applicants who had

already made an application should apply afresh alongwith the

difference of earnest money and other required documents.

</p><p id="p_10">8.          We have heard learned counsel for the parties at a

considerable length and also perused the paper book with their able

assistance. It is an undisputed fact that the Authority in its 84th

meeting held on 26.2.2002 has taken a conscious decision for shifting

of dyeing and printing units to the Dyeing Zone Sector 29, Part-II,

Panipat because the effluent is being discharged by such units, which

are operating from the residential and non-conforming zones of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> C.W.P. No. 3918 of 2008                                              6</span>

Panipat Town and result in contamination of the ground water. Thus,

it was decided to formulate a time bound action plan for relocation of

small scale industrial units working in the congested areas of Panipat

Town in a separate industrial estate so that their effluent could be

treated in a common effluent treatment plant. Accordingly, a survey

was conducted by the Board and 494 units were identified. Some of

identified units have already been allotted plots. The advertisement

dated 11.7.2007 also notices that inspite of lapse of more than five

years some of the entrepreneurs who were identified for allotment of

plots in the Dyeing Zone did not come forward for allotment of plot

and one last chance was given to such units. It is thus obvious that

the ultimate object is to shift the polluting dyeing and printing units

from the residential and non-conforming zone of Panipat Town to the

newly carved out Dyeing Zone in Sector 29, Part-II, Panipat so as to

bring clean environment and to obviate the possibility of

contamination of ground water. The only grievance of the petitioners

is that they are not able to shift their units to the newly allotted sites

because of their small size. They have already represented to the

respondents in that regard and recommendation dated 31.1.2007 (P-5)

by the Regional Office of the Haryana Pollution Control Board has

already been made for allotment of 1500 square meters of plots in

their favour.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.              Keeping in view the above, we are of the considered

view that ends of justice would be met if a direction is issued to the

Chief Administrator, HUDA, to consider viability of allotting bigger

size plots to the petitioners. Accordingly, we direct the petitioner to

make a fresh representation under Registered A.D. to the Chief
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> C.W.P. No. 3918 of 2008                                           7</span>

Administrator, HUDA by taking all the pleas which have been taken

in these petitions, within 15 days from the date of receipt of a

certified copy of the order. If any such representation is made then

the same shall be examined and decided by the Chief Administrator,

HUDA, within a period of two months from the date of its receipt.
