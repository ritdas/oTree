CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 20-05-2016

                   Heard Mr. Kameshwar Prasad Gupta, learned counsel

     appearing for the petitioner, counsel for the State and Mr. Shivendra

     Kishore, learned senior counsel appearing for the Bihar State Pollution

     Control Board and its authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                   The petitioner is a firm running a brick kiln in the district of

     Madhubani and is aggrieved by the order dated 7.1.2016 passed by the

     Chairman, Bihar State Pollution Control Board (hereinafter referred to as

     'the Board'), whereby the operation of the brick kiln has been stopped

     with immediate effect, inter alia, on grounds that it is being operated

     without complying with the provisions of Air (Prevention and Control of
 Patna High Court CWJC No.7208 of 2016 dt.20-05-2016                                2




          <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').

</p><p id="p_17">                         Mr. Kameshwar Prasad Gupta, learned counsel appearing

          for the petitioner has submitted that the brick kiln is being operated by

          the petitioner since last couple of years and has continuously been

          granted consent by the respondent and copy of the last consent is placed

          at Annexure-7/e at page 47 which is dated 19.10.2015 and whereunder

          the petitioner has been granted Emission Consent Order for the period up

          to 30.6.2018. He thus submits that this single document is sufficient to

          indicate that the order impugned dated 7.1.2016 putting a restraint on the

          operation of the petitioner-unit is without application of mind.

</p><p id="p_18">                         Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned senior counsel appearing

          for the Board has tried to defend the action of 'the Board' on the

          proceedings arising from CWJC No.19471 of 2015 as well as the order

          passed by the National Green Tribunal, Eastern Zone Bench at Kolkata

          in O.A. No.61 of 2015/EZ (Joydeep Mukherjee vs. Pollution Control

          Board, State of Bihar) on the issue, in which the petitioner has been

          arraigned as respondent no.239 and to submit that certain directives have

          been issued by the Tribunal in relation to operation of brick kilns under

          the control and supervision of 'the Board'. A copy of the order passed by

          the National Green Tribunal, Eastern Zone Bench at Kolkata (hereinafter

          referred to as 'the Tribunal'), passed on 6.5.2016 in O.A. No.61 of

          2015/EZ has also been produced by Mr. Kishore and with reference to

          the operative part imposing compensation/penalty on the defaulting and

          illegally operated brick kilns, it is submitted by Mr. Kishore, learned
 Patna High Court CWJC No.7208 of 2016 dt.20-05-2016                                3




          counsel appearing for 'the Board' that the petitioner would also have to

          abide by the directives. The order passed by the 'Tribunal' takes note of

          the stand of the Member, Bihar State Pollution Control Board in which

          he has admitted that in all 6186 brick kilns have been identified and out

          of them 5908 brick kilns have been granted consent to establish and of

          these 5908 brick kilns only 2824 have been granted consent to operate. It

          is the stand taken by the 'Board' that those brick kilns who are operating

          without consent to operate have been issued notice against the proposed

          action and it is in consideration of such stand taken that the 'Tribunal'

          has allowed 'the Board' to take necessary steps in this regard but in

          accordance with law after following the principles of Natural Justice.

</p><p id="p_19">                         In so far as those brick kilns are concerned who are

          operating even after expiry of the validity period of the consent order as

          well as the brick kilns who are operating without any such permission

          from inception, the 'Tribunal' has imposed a compensation/penalty of

          Rs.1,00 lakh and 1.5 lakh respectively, to be deposited with the 'Board'.

          The 'Tribunal' has further directed the respondents against whom show

          cause notices have been issued to approach 'the Board' with supportive

          documents enabling 'the Board' to pass appropriate orders. Let the order

          passed by the National Green Tribunal, Easter Zone Bench at Kolkata

          dated 6.5.2016 be maintained on the records of the proceedings.

</p><p id="p_20">                         In my opinion, the order of the 'Tribunal' does not in any

          manner casts any obligation on the petitioner for the directions requiring

          a brick kiln to respond, is only in respect of those brick kilns to whom
         Patna High Court CWJC No.7208 of 2016 dt.20-05-2016                                4




                  any show cause notice has been issued in this regard. In so far as the

                  petitioner is concerned understandably, since the consent order is issued

                  in favour of the petitioner and is operative and valid up to 30.6.2018

                  there was no occasion for 'the Board' to issue any show cause notice to

                  the petitioner. In my opinion a mere arraignment of this petitioner in the

                  proceedings before the National Green Tribunal in the nature of the order

                  passed by the Tribunal, neither casts any obligation on the petitioner nor

                  can be a foundation for the impugned orders. In fact in view of the

                  Emission Consent Order granted by 'the Board' dated 19.10.2015

                  present at Annexure-7/e, the order dated 7.1.2016 passed by the

                  Chairman of 'the Board' impugned at Annexure-1 together with the

                  order dated 15.3.2016 of the District Magistrate, Madhubani in so far as

                  it relates to the petitioner as well as the order of the Circle Officer,

                  Madhepur dated 19.3.2016 impugned at Annexure- 3 and 5 respectively

                  are held unsustainable and are accordingly set aside.

</p><p id="p_21">                                 The writ petition is allowed
