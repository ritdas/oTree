                       ----------------------------
                      W.P.(C)Nos.38385 of 2010,
                         1450 &amp; 3174 of 2011
                       ----------------------------
                         Dated 27th June, 2011

                              JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">         Common issues posed for consideration in these writ petitions

and therefore, they were heard jointly and are being disposed of by this

common judgment. For the sake of convenience, W.P.(C)No.38385 of

2010 is taken as the leading case and the documents are being referred

to in this judgment in the order they are set out in the said writ petition

unless otherwise specifically mentioned. The petitioner, on the strength

of Ext.P1 licence, started a fire brick manufacturing unit by name

`Vazhappilly Bircks'. Ext.P2 is the consent to operate issued by the

Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The third respondent filed Ext.P3

complaint before the Ombudsman for Local Self Government Institutions

mainly alleging that the said unit of the petitioner is functioning without

any statutory licence and consent. W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010 has been

filed challenging Ext.P5 order. Ext.P5 is virtually a stop memo issued by

the second respondent directing the petitioner to stop all activities in the

petitioner's unit. According to the petitioner, it was issued in terms of

Exts.P4 and P6 orders. It is the contention of the petitioner that Exts.P4

and P6 were issued on the premise that the petitioner is functioning

without a valid licence. Therefore, it is contended that the said orders

WP(C).No.38385/2010 &amp; connected cases   2


cannot be relied on to issue a stop memo to the petitioner as the unit

belonging to the petitioner is being operated on the strength of a valid

licence.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            2. W.P.(C)Nos.1450 and 3174 of 2011 are filed by two

persons who are residing near the brick kiln belonging to the petitioner in

W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010.       The petitioner in W.P.(C)No.1450 of 2011,

contends that the petitioner in W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010 viz., the first

respondent in the said writ petition is operating the brick kiln in violation

of the circulars issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board and

without obtaining sanction under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment Protection Act</a> and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Prevention of Air Pollution Act</a>. The prayer in the said writ petition is for

issuance of a writ of mandamus commanding respondents 2 to 6 therein

to ensure that the first respondent is not conducting the brick kiln

without obtaining sanctions under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_3">Environment Protection Act</a> and

<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Prevention of Air Pollution Act</a> and for such other reliefs. In W.P.(C)

No.3174 of 2011, the petitioner seeks issuance of a writ of mandamus

commanding the second respondent therein viz., Kuzhur Grama

Panchayat to ensure that the first respondent therein is not conducting

the brick kiln in violation of Ext.P5 order of the Ombudsman. Ext.P5 in

W.P.(C)No.3174 of 2011 is an order passed on Ext.P3 complaint in W.P.

(C)No.38385 of 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_3">WP(C).No.38385/2010 &amp; connected cases  3


</p><p id="p_4">            3. The grievance of the petitioner in W.P.(C)No.1450 of 2011

to the extent that the petitioner in W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010 viz., the

first respondent therein is conducting the brick kiln without obtaining the

requisite licence from the Kuzhur Grama Panchayat and without

obtaining consent to operate from the Kerala State Pollution Control

Board are not true to facts in view of Exts.P1 and P2 in W.P.(C)No.38385

of 2010.    As already noticed hereinbefore, the petitioner in W.P.(C)

No.38385 of 2010, who is the first respondent in the other writ petitions,

started the brick manufacturing unit in question on the strength of

Ext.P1 licence dated 19.4.2010. Ext.P2 is the consent to operate issued

by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. When that be the admitted

position, the allegation that the the petitioner in W.P.(C)No.38385 of

2010 is conducting the brick kiln without the requisite licence and

consent to operate from the Pollution Control Board is bereft of any

basis.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            4. As already noticed hereinbefore, the third respondent in

W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010 filed Ext.P3 complaint before the Ombudsman

for Local Self Government Institutions. Obviously, in the said complaint

a direction was issued to the Deputy Director of Panchayats to conduct

an inspection into the premises where the petitioner is conducting the

brick kiln in question and to submit a report. The said report has been

WP(C).No.38385/2010 &amp; connected cases  4


produced as Ext.P1 in W.P.(C)No.1450 of 2011 and Ext.P4 in W.P.(C)

No.3174 of 2011. I am of the view that for the disposal of these writ

petitions the said report as also Ext.R1(d) order of the Ombudsman

assume relevance. The contentions in the other writ petitions as also the

counter affidavit filed by the Panchayat and the Pollution Control Board

would reveal that on account of the ill-functioning of the brick kiln in

question the nearby residents are facing pollution and nuisance. The

degree of the nuisance as also pollution have been elaborately explained

by the Deputy Director of Panchayats in his report referred to as Ext.P1

in W.P.(C)No.1450 of 2011. Since I have already found, based on the

relevant documents produced in these writ petitions, that the petitioner

in W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010 possessed the requisite licence from the

Panchayat and consent to operate from the Pollution Control Board, the

question to be considered is whether there is any substance in the

contention of the respondents regarding the degree of pollution and

nuisance being caused on account of the functioning of the brick kiln. It

is also to be looked into whether the petitioner is conducting the said unit

in such a manner to cause health hazards. It is in that context Ext.P1

referred to in W.P.(C)No.1450 of 2011 assumes relevance. The relevant

portion in Ext.P1 report reads thus:-

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7">A perusal of Ext.P1 that is, the report of the Deputy Director of

Panchayats would thus reveal that indiscreet excavation made by the

petitioner has adversely affected the water table in the locality besides

causing air and water pollution. That apart, it is reported therein that

about 25 families including children and women are engaged in the

manufacturing of bricks in the brick kiln belonging to the petitioner and

they are not even provided with hygienic circumstances even to answer

the call of nature. The way of living itself is a source of pollution and a

cause for nuisance.    In fact, all those aspects have been specifically

detailed in Ext.P1.   Ext.R1(d) is the order of the Ombudsman dated

20.12.2010 in Complaint No.1656/2010.         I am of the view that this

document assumes relevance for the purpose of disposal of these writ

petitions. It would reveal that the petitioner entered appearance in the

proceedings before the Ombudsman. The petitioner has stated before

the Ombudsman that he is proposing to take the remedial measures as

WP(C).No.38385/2010 &amp; connected cases   8


suggested by the Environmental Engineer attached to the Pollution

Control Board.      In view of the said submission made before the

Ombudsman the Ombudsman directed the petitioner to intimate the

Environmental Engineer attached to the Pollution Control Board the steps

taken to abate and avert the pollution and nuisance and the Engineer

was, in turn, directed to conduct an inspection into the premises wherein

the petitioner is conducting the brick kiln with notice to the petitioner.

</blockquote><p id="p_6">The Secretary of the Panchayat was directed to consider the question of

withdrawal of the stop memo on receipt of the report from the

Environmental Engineer attached to the Pollution Control Board. I am of

the view that the said direction issued by the Ombudsman especially in

the light of the report submitted before the Ombudsman by the Deputy

Director of Panchayats cannot be said to be uncalled for. In fact, the

said direction issued by the Ombudsman is not only proper but

prophylactic as well in the facts and circumstances of this case.       The

learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that since the petitioner is

running the brick manufacturing unit on the strength of the          licence

issued by the Panchayat and also on the strength of the consent to

operate issued by the Pollution Control Board, there is no reason to

interfere with its functioning. At the same time, it is to be noted that the

state of affairs depicted by Ext.P1 report of the Deputy Director of

WP(C).No.38385/2010 &amp; connected cases   9


Panchayats cannot go unnoticed. If the state of affairs reported by the

Deputy Director of Panchayats is a true reflection of the situation it

certainly calls for immediate attention by the competent authority. True

that, the right of the petitioner to conduct brick kiln on the strength of

the requisite licence and consent to operate after complying with the

directions from the competent authorities also has to be recognized.

However, that cannot outweigh the right of the people of the locality to

have health and hygienic surroundings to live on. In view of the said

position obtained in these cases, I do not think it necessary to consider

the other contentions raised in these writ petitions independently.

</p><p id="p_7">             5. As already noticed, the contention of the petitioner in W.P.

(C)No.38385 of 2010 is that he is conducting the unit on the strength of

valid permit and consent to operate and the contentions of the

respondents regarding the pollution is absolutely without any basis. Per

contra, it is the contention of the respondents and the petitioners in the

other writ petitions that on account of the ill-functioning of the

manufacturing unit the life of the residents in the locality is virtually

reduced to limbus.     Prima facie the said contention cannot be said to be

without any substance in the light of the report of the Deputy Director of

Panchayats. In the said circumstances, these writ petitions are disposed

of with a direction to the Environmental Engineer attached to the District

WP(C).No.38385/2010 &amp; connected cases   10


Office, Thrissur of the Pollution Control Board and also the District

Medical Officer, Thrissur to conduct inspection into the premises wherein

the petitioner in W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010 is conducting the fire bricks

manufacturing unit by name `Vazhappilly Bircks'          with notice to the

petitioner, the party respondents viz., the petitioners in the other writ

petitions and also the Panchayat and to prepare and submit reports to

the Secretary of the Kuzhur Grama Panchayat regarding the degree of

pollution, nuisance and health hazard etc.       This shall be done within

three weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. They

may also specifically state in their reports as to the remedial measures, if

any, to be taken by the petitioner in W.P.(C)No.38385 of 2010.          On

receiving such reports from the said authorities, the Secretary of the

Kuzhur Grama Panchayat shall consider the question whether the

application of the petitioner for renewal of licence should be favourably

considered or not. Needless to say that renewal can be granted subject

to the said reports and only if the petitioner takes all remedial measures,

if any, suggested by the said authorities. The Secretary of the Panchayat

shall take such a decision subject to the observations in the reports

within two weeks from the date of receipt of such reports. Even in case

the Secretary of the Panchayat renewed the licence as requested by the

petitioner, it will be open to the Environmental Engineer to conduct

revisit to ascertain and ensure proper functioning of unit without

emanating pollution.
