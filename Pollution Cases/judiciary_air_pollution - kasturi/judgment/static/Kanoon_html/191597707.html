               THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA
                       Date of Judgment: 06.07.2012

B.N.Mahapatra,J.         The petitioners claiming tobe owners of Clinical

      Establishments and Nursing Homes have filed this writ petition with a

      prayer to declare the Orissa Clinical Establishments (Control and

      Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2006 (for short, "Rules, 2006") published

      under Notification dated 1st February, 2006 (Annexure-1) ultra vires the

      Orissa Clinical Establishments (Control and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Regulation) Act</a>, 1990 (for

      short, "Act, 1990") or in the alternative to quash the provisions contained
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>




in the said Notification being not in consonance with the Act, 1990 and

declare the same ultra vires.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.           Mr. S.K. Sarangi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

petitioners submitted that the Rules, 2006 being not in consonance with

the Act, 1990, the very purpose of establishing Nursing Home and

Clinical Establishments for rendering service to the common men is

frustrated at the instance of the Rule implementing authorities. Under

the provisions of the Act, 1990, the Clinical Establishments were to be

registered with the Director of Medical Education and Training (for short,

"DMET") through the respective Chief District Medical Officers (for short,

"CDMOs") on payment of certain registration fees. <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_2">The Act</a>, 1990 further

prescribes that on compliance of certain formalities, the registration

certificate is to be issued to the Establishments. Referring to sub-rule (6)

of Rule 3 of the Rules, 1994, Mr. Sarangi, submitted that certificate of

registration shall remain valid for a period of two years from the date on

which it is granted. The Rules, 2006 came into force with effect from

23.05.2006 which provide for payment of charges towards the Clinical

Establishments. Though objections were invited to the Draft Rules, 2006

and several objections were received, without considering the same the

Government made the Rules, 2006 which is not in consonance with the

Act, 1990 and the earlier Rules, 1994. Therefore, it causes great

prejudice,   hardship    and    unequal    treatment    to   the    Clinical

Establishments. According to <a href="/doc/29754957/" id="a_3">Section 2(b)</a> of the Act, 1990, "Clinical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>




Establishment" includes Nursing Home. However, under the Rules,

2006, all Clinical Establishments having nursing facilities are asked to

separately register for Nursing Home paying the registration fees twice.

The Rules, 1992 prescribed that Rs.1,500/- (Rs.1,000/- towards

grant/renewal of licence fees and Rs.500/- for inspection) shall be

charged for each Clinical Establishment for registration and same

amount for renewal. The validity of the registration certificate was for a

period of two years which continued till 2008. The Notification dated 1st

February, 2006, however, enhanced the said registration fees by several

times with new stipulations made therein regarding the same inasmuch

as the fees so payable were made annually. The DMET is charging more

than what is prescribed under the Act, 1990 in the matter of registration

and renewal. The DMET in its letter dated 11.09.2008 has clarified the

said anomaly stating that the Certificate though would be valid for a

period of two years yet the fees for registration and renewal are to be

charged double. The proviso to Clause (5) of Rules, 2006 to obtain

clearance from Orissa State Pollution Control Board for disposal of Bio-

medical waste is a condition precedent prior to grant of registration,

though the Act, 1990 was silent about the same. As a result, clearance

from the Pollution Control Board is insisted though the same is neither

recognized under the Act, 1990 nor under the <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Air Pollution Control Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_5">3.          Mr. Sarangi, learned counsel further submitted that though

the applications have been made in time, yet the registration certificates
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     4</span>




have not been issued for years together, thus, the Nursing Homes were

uncertain as to whether their applications for registration were allowed

or not. The Rules regarding registration have not been followed

uniformly. There are cases, where the registration is being done once in

every two years with one set of registration fee as would be evident from

letter dated 09.04.2009 (Annexure-4) issued by the DMET. Despite

bringing this unequal treatment in the matter of registration to the notice

of the concerned authorities, no action has been taken on such

allegation. It is further submitted that the competent authorities are not

registering the Nursing Homes and thereby the Nursing Homes are not

aware of the date of renewal as per Clause 2(ii) of the Rules, 2006. On

the other hand, they are charging 10% for the delayed registration. This

action of the opposite parties, does not stand to logic. This anomaly has

been brought to the notice of the Chief Secretary by way of

representation dated 06.07.2009 (Annexure-5) but the same has not yet

been considered.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.          Per contra, Mr. R.K. Mohapatra, learned Government

Advocate referring to the counter affidavit dated 30.06.2011 submitted

that the writ petition is misconceived in fact and law and is liable to be

dismissed at the threshold. Rule 2 of the Rules, 2006 is very clear

wherein the annual rate of Clinical Establishments for Registration/

Renewal for M.R.I., C.T. Scan, Ultrasound, Endoscopy, Bio-Chemical and

Pathological Examination has been defined in a Table as categorized
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         5</span>




under category of A.B.C.D. Further, category has also been indicated as

A.B.C.D. for Nursing Homes depending upon number of beds provided in

the Nursing Homes. In Rule 5 of the Rules, 2006, it has been clarified

that "A fee of Rs.10,000/-, Rs.8,000/-, Rs.6,000/-, Rs.5,000/- whichever

is applicable has to be credited to Government under the Head of

Account-0210-Medical &amp; PH-020-Receipt from patients for Hospital &amp;

Dispensary Services-9906480-other fees". All C.D.M.Os have been issued

with clarification to the effect that those clinical establishments having

beds     and     diagnostic      facilities   are        required         to     deposit

Registration/Renewal fees for both the facilities. The Rules, 2006 has

been proportionately applied with regard to the renewal/registration fees

vis-à-vis number of beds in the Nursing Home. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">The Act</a>, 1990 and the

Rules, 2006 are having laudable objects. Rule 5 of the Rules, 2006

indicates that all the Clinical Establishments and Nursing Home shall

possess clearance certificate from Orissa State Pollution Control Board

for disposal of their Bio-Medical Waste under Bio-Medical Waste

(Management      &amp;    Handling)      Rules,       1998      prior    to        grant   of

registration/renewal. Pollution Control Board Authorities are inspecting

and    issuing   authorization     certificates    to     the   proposed         Clinical

Establishments/Nursing        Homes     and   the       Clinical    Establishments/

Nursing Homes already established are observing the said formalities. On

receipt of complete documents, the renewal/registration is being

considered observing all paraphernalia under the Act, 1990 and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>




Rules, 2006. The Rules, 2006 regarding registration is always followed

uniformly. Prior to deposit of Rs.6,000/- the Clinical Establishments had

deposited Rs.21,300/- as against Rs.27,300/- (due fees + 10% fine) for

grant of renewal for the period from 20.02.2008 to 19.02.2010. In

support of the contention, Mr. Mohapatra, learned Government Advocate

referred to letter dated 21.09.2008       addressed to DMET, Orissa

(Annexure-C/2). Once the Clinical Establishment/Nursing Home has

been registered, the owner of the Clinical Establishment should have

been aware of the date of next renewal before one month of expiration of

period of renewal. It is the duty of the owner to take steps for deposit of

dues in shape of Treasury Challan failing which, 10% of the prescribed

fees will be charged for every month of subsequent delay as per Rule 2(ii)

of the Rules, 2006. Taking a plea of non-receipt of information from the

Directorate, the fees are not being deposited in time. The registration of

applications of the Clinical Establishments/Nursing Homes is considered

within the prescribed period. For want of documents, some cases are

being delayed and lingering. After complete compliance, the registration/

renewal is being done. Therefore, question of pick and choose in the

matter of registration and/or renewal does not arise. The Rules, 2006 is

not contrary to the provisions of the Act, 1990 rather both are

complimentary and intended to carry out the purpose of the Act. The

Rules, 2006 is intra vires the Act, 1990. There is not a single tenable

proposition of law or submissions stated in the entire writ petition which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            7</span>




can even remotely support the plea of invalidity of Rules, 2006.

Concluding his argument, Mr. Mohapatra, learned Government Advocate

submitted for dismissal of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.          The contentions taken in the counter affidavit filed by the

State are denied in the rejoinder affidavit filed by the petitioners. In the

rejoinder affidavit, the petitioners have reiterated the contentions as

taken in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.          On the rival contentions advanced by the parties, the

following questions fall for consideration by this Court :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            (i)     Whether the Rules, 2006 provides for grant of
                    registration for one year and the same is contrary to
                    the Act, 1990, which provides that the certificate of
                    registration shall be valid for a period of two years
                    w.e.f. the date on which it is granted ?

                    i.e. one for clinical establishment and other for

                    1990      in    which       <a href="/doc/1022950/" id="a_7">Section   2(b)</a>   defines   Clinical

</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">7.               Question No.(i) is with regard to validity of period of

registration. <a href="/doc/1652403/" id="a_8">The Act</a>, 1990 came into force with effect from 1st February,

1992. Sub-Section (4) of <a href="/doc/1625588/" id="a_9">Section 6</a> of the Act, 1990 provides that every

certificate of registration shall, unless revoked earlier under <a href="/doc/1446350/" id="a_10">section 8</a> or

deemed to be revoked under the first proviso to sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1717850/" id="a_11">section

5</a>, be valid for a period of two years with effect from the date on which it

is granted. The Rules, 2006 does not contain any provision to the effect

that certificate of registration shall be granted for a period of one year. It

may be noted that in the writ petition the petitioners have not referred to

any particular rule of the Rules, 2006 which provides that the certificate

of registration shall be granted for one year. Therefore, question no. (i) is

answered against the petitioner.

</p>
<p id="p_15">            It is true that the Clinical Establishment means a nursing

home and it includes maternity home. Thus, in a Clinical Establishment

not only the various medical examinations are undertaken but also

Nursing Homes are provided for reception and medical care including

nursing care in any form to persons suffering from sickness, injury or

infirmity. Therefore, it is not necessarily meant that all clinical

establishments provide facility of nursing home, maternity home and

also provision for medical investigation. Hence, the Amended Rules, 2006
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>




provides a fee structure for registration and renewal of Clinical

Establishments     without    having     Nursing   Home     and    Clinical

Establishments having different types of medical investigation. Similarly,

there is also different fee structure provided for Nursing Homes on the

basis of number of beds provided in the Nursing Homes. This

classification is reasonable and beneficial to the Clinical Establishments

and Nursing Homes. Without such classification, if a consolidated fee is

charged for Clinical Establishments, a Clinical Establishment without

having Nursing facility for running Nursing Home and providing lesser

number of medical investigations would be required to pay same/equal

registration/renewal fee with that of a Clinical Establishment which with

all facilities would pay. Similarly, in case of Nursing Home, if a

consolidated fee will be charged, then the Nursing Homes having lesser

number of beds will pay the same/equal registration and renewal fee

with that of the Nursing Homes having more number of beds. Therefore,

the different fee structure provided for the Clinical Establishments on the

basis of the facilities available with it and in case of Nursing Homes

providing more or less number of beds is perfectly justified and

reasonable.

pay higher charge than the Clinical Establishments having provisions for

lesser number of medical investigations. Similarly, the Nursing Homes

having more number of beds are required to pay more fee than the

Nursing    Homes     having   lesser    number     of   beds.    If    any   Clinical

Establishment has both medical investigation facility as well as Nursing

Home facility, it has to pay fees for both. Again that fee varies according

to number of medical facilities and number of beds provided in the

Nursing Home. Moreover, sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/1040631/" id="a_17">Section 4</a> of the Act, 1990

provides that every application under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2)

shall be in such form and be accompanied by such fee, as may be

prescribed. Therefore, it cannot be said that the fee prescribed under the

Rule is contrary to the fee provided under the Act, 1990. Thus, question

Nos.(ii) and (iii) are answered against the petitioners.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">11.          Question No.(iv) is with regard to obtaining clearance from

Orissa State Pollution Control Board for disposal of their Bio-Medical

Waste.
</p>
<p id="p_20">             Proviso to sub-Rule (5) of Rule 3 of the Rules, 2006 provides

that all Clinical Establishments and Nursing Homes shall possess

clearance certificate from Orissa State Pollution Control Board for

disposal   of   their   Bio-Medical     Wastes    under    Bio-Medical        Waste

(Management      &amp;      Handling)      Rules,    1998    prior        to   grant   of

registration/renewal certificate from the authority. Needless to say that

every citizen of the Nation has a right to get pollution free air and water.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                     13</span>




Therefore, Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_18">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 have been enacted. Under

the Bio-Medical Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 1998, if the

Amended sub-rule (5) of Rule 3 of the Rules, 2006 requires the Clinical

Establishments and Nursing Homes to possess clearance certificate from

the OSPCB prior to grant of registration/renewal certificate from the

authority, there is nothing wrong in it. It is in consonance with the Bio-

Medical Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 1998. The law is now

well settled that Parliament cannot only enact a law for avoidance or

evasion of commission of an illegal trade, but also make law to see that

the law is not evaded by taking recourse to machination or camouflage.

The loopholes, if any, in such matters can and should be plugged.

"Means affecting means" principle as adumbrated in United States v.

Darby is an illustration on the point. Both substantial and procedural

provisions can be made to make a law in furtherance of the object for

which the Act has been enacted and to see that what is sought to be

prohibited directly may not be achieved by the traders indirectly. [<a href="/doc/1231613/" id="a_20">See

Indian Handicrafts Emporium and others vs. Union of India and

others</a>, (2003) 7 SCC 589]

            In view of the above, it cannot be said that proviso to sub-

rule (5) of Rule 3 of the Rules, 2006, which provides the pre-condition of

obtaining clearance certificate, is ultra vires the Act, 1990. Therefore,

question no.(iv) is answered against the petitioners.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                      14</span>




</p><p id="p_21">12.          Question No.(v) is as to whether the opposite parties are

adopting unequal treatment with regard to grant of registration to the

Nursing Homes/Clinical Establishments.
</p>
<p id="p_22">


</p><p id="p_23">                   Further case of the petitioners is that the DMET is

unequally treating the Nursing Homes and Clinical Establishments, who

are applying for registration/renewal. There are cases where the

registration is being done once in every two years with one set of

registration fee. In support of his contentions, Mr. Sarangi, learned

counsel for the petitioners has referred to letter No.3530 dated

09.04.2009 (Annexure-4) issued by the DMET. According to Mr. Sarangi,

in some other cases DMET insists upon registration of the Clinical

Establishments every year. As stated above, there is nothing available in

the Rules, 1994 and the amended Rules, 2006 for grant of registration

annually. Mr. Sarangi has also not brought to our notice any instance

where registration or renewal has been granted for one year by the

DMET. Charging of fee annually for registration and renewal is different

from granting registration for a period of two years. Therefore, there is no

substance in the submission of Mr. Sarangi, learned counsel appearing

for the petitioners on this score.

</p><p id="p_25">13.         Question No.(vi) is as to whether the opposite parties are

justified in charging 10% for the delayed registration while keeping

pending renewal application with them.
</p>
<p id="p_26">            Petitioners' case is that the authorities are not registering

the Nursing Homes within the time specified in the statute. Therefore,

the Nursing Homes are not aware of the date of their renewal as per Rule

2(ii) of the Rules, 2006. When the Nursing Homes are not aware of the

date of renewal of their registration, they were unable to make

application for further renewal of the registration. However, opposite

party-authorities are insisting on charging 10% of the registration fee for

delayed registration. This allegation of the petitioners has been denied in

the counter affidavit, wherein it has been stated that in some cases the

registration is delayed due to want of some documents. After completion

of all formalities, the registration is done. Under <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_21">Section 5</a> of the Act,

1990, power is vested with the Supervising Authority to grant or refuse

registration. However, under sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_22">Section 6</a> of the Act, 1990,

it is prescribed that a certificate of registration may be renewed from time

to time on an application made in that behalf to the Supervising

Authority, in such form and accompanied by such fee, as may be

prescribed, and every such application shall be made not less than one

month before the date on which the period of validity of the certificate of

registration is due to expire. <a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_23">Section 5</a> of the Act, 1990 provides that the

Supervising Authority before making any order refusing to grant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      16</span>




certificate of registration, the applicant is required to be given reasonable

opportunity of being heard and the reasons for such refusal shall be

communicated to the applicant in such manner as may be prescribed.

Provided that the renewal of certificate of registration shall not be refused

unless the supervising authority is satisfied that the certificate holder--

</p><p id="p_27">(i) is not in a position to comply with the requirements envisaged in

<a href="/doc/105256107/" id="a_24">Section 5</a>, or (ii) has contravened any of the provisions of this Act or any

rules made thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_28">             Sub-rule (8) of Rule 3 of the Rules, 2006 provides that the

order of refusal to grant of registration shall be communicated to the

applicant by Registered post with A.D.

</p><p id="p_29">14.          In view of the same, the opposite party-authorities are

required to communicate to the petitioners the fate of their applications

for registration or renewal of registration within a reasonable period of

time. If the competent authority grants registration or renewal of

registration certificate, the same shall also be communicated to the

applicant by Registered post with A.D. so as to enable him to apply for

renewal before expiry of validity of the registration certificate. Question

No.(vi) is answered accordingly.
