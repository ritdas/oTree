                                   JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">       Petitioners in all these Writ Petitions are    aggrieved by the denial of

affiliation by the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University to the educational

institutions run by them, on the ground that the petitioner Colleges do not fulfill

the conditions/norms fixed by the University. In all these cases except in one, the

petitioners seek affiliation based on approval granted to them by the All India

Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for commencing additional/new

courses. The petitioner in W.P.(C) No.11949 of 2020 seeks affiliation based on

approval granted for MBA programme.            According to the petitioners, the

University has no authority to insist any further condition once approval is granted

by the AICTE. The contentions raised in all these Writ Petitions are more or less

similar and the issue raised is also common. The claims and contentions in each of

the Writ Petitions are as given below:
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.WP(C) No.11778 of 2020



      2.1. The petitioner college started B.Tech courses in 2010-11 with a total

intake of 300 seats in (1) Civil Engineering (2) Mechanical Engineering (3)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES           22</span>


Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering (4) Electronics &amp; Communication

Engineering (5) Computer Science &amp; Engineering, with approval from AICTE and

affiliation from M.G University.      On formation of the APJ Adbul Kalam

Technological University in the year 2015, the affiliation got transferred to the

respondent University by virtue of Section 60 of the APJ Abdul Kalam

Technological University Act, 2015, ('the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_1">University Act</a> 2015' for short). On

account of the low turn out of students, the intake capacity in the branches

Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Electronics and Communication

Engineering was reduced from 60 to 30 seats in the year 2018. In the year 2020-

21, the petitioner college submitted application for approval to start undergraduate

courses in B.Tech Agricultural Engineering and B.Tech Artificial Engineering and

Machine Learning with an intake of 30 seats each. As per Ext.P3 e-mail dated

06.03.2020, the University informed the Colleges that applications if any for

commencement of new courses/additional batches shall be submitted in the

prescribed format on or before 10.03.2020 and the petitioner submitted its

application in the format on the same day, before the University. The AICTE, as

per Ext.P2 order dated 9.6.2020 granted extension of approval for the

Undergraduate courses in (1) Civil Engineering and (2) Mechanical Engineering

with an intake of 60 each, (3) Electrical and Electronics Engineering, (4)

Electronics and Communication Engineering with an intake of 30 each and (5)

Computer Science and Engineering with an intake of 60.            Along with that,

approval was granted for new courses in (6) Agricultural Engineering and (7)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES              23</span>


Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence Engineering and

Machine Learning) with an intake of 30 each. Even though the petitioner had

submitted application for affiliation and also for NOC from the University as well

as the State Government as per Exts.P4 and P5 letters on 9.3.2020 and 10.03.2020,

the University or Government did not respond. It was stated that the petitioner

could not remit the processing fee and inspection fee of Rs.1 lakh with the

University for the new courses, since the web portal was not open after

22.05.2020. Whileso, the University circulated Ext.P6 letter dated.10.6.2020 to the

Principals of the Colleges informing that the syndicate has taken a decision fixing

the following norms for grant of affiliation: 1) at least one of the existing

programmes should be NBA accredited. In case of PG programmes, the concerned

UG Programmes should have NBA accreditation, 2) the average annual intake in

the institution for the previous 3 years should be more than 50% of the sanctioned

intake, 3) the proposed programme should have AICTE approval and NOC from

the Government and 4) the proposed programme should have industry

demand/employment potential. The petitioner is challenging the conditions fixed

for granting affiliation alleging that it is arbitrary. It is also stated that though the

petitioner institution does not have NBA accreditation, it is having accreditation

from National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) which is an

equivalent accreditation granted by the autonomous institution of the UGC.

According to the petitioner, as per the Approval Process Handbook issued by the

AICTE, NBA accreditation or NOC are not necessary for sanctioning additional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES             24</span>


courses; when the intake capacity in other branches of study is reduced, additional

courses can be granted without NBA accreditation; when AICTE has granted

approval for the 2 additional courses with intake of 30 each, the University has no

authority to deny affiliation, fixing such norms; University cannot insist the very

same condition when AICTE granted approval; deficiency, if any, is to be looked

into by the AICTE; NOC cannot be insisted in the light of Ext.P8 judgment of the

Division Bench in W.A.No.1487 of 2019, which was affirmed in Ext.P9 judgment

of the Apex Court. The petitioner alleged that the denial of affiliation is illegal and

beyond the authority of the University.         The petitioner also alleged that the

syndicate has no authority to fix any norms in the matter of affiliation; as per

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_2">Section 63(2)</a> of the University Act, the procedure for affiliation is to be prescribed

in the Statutes; State Government has not framed any Statute so far, as provided in

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_3">Section 43</a> of the Act 2015. The petitioner challenges the decision in Ext.P6 on that

ground also. It is also stated that the fundamental right of the petitioner under

<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_4">Article 19(1)(g)</a> to establish an educational institution is curtailed unlawfully and

the restriction does not come within the purview of reasonable restriction under

<a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_5">Article 19(6).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.2. In the statement filed on behalf of the University on 24.06.2020 it was

stated that the syndicate had in its meeting held on 04.02.2020 resolved to fix the

following norms for granting affiliation for new programmes for the year 2020-21.

</p><p id="p_4">1) at least one of the existing programmes should be NBA accredited. In case of

PG programmes, the concerned UG Programmes should have NBA accreditation,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES           25</span>


</p><p id="p_5">2) the average annual intake in the institution for the previous 3 years should be

more than 50% of the sanctioned intake, 3) the proposed programme should have

AICTE approval and NOC from the Government and 4) the proposed programme

should have industry demand/employment potential. It was stated that the matter

of granting new programme was under active consideration and yet to be finalised.

Producing Ext.R1(a) minutes of the meeting of the syndicate held on 17.06.2020,

it was stated that even after the AICTE granted approval for the commencement of

course, the University has the authority to consider the same as per Chapter IV

para.30 clause 2 sub clause xiv of the Act, according to which, the syndicate has

the power to arrange for and direct investigation into the affairs of affiliated

colleges, to issue instructions for maintaining their efficiency, for ensuring

academic and administrative resources, infrastructural facilities, academic

performance, performance of teacher etc., and       in case of disregard of such

instructions, to modify the conditions of affiliation or take such steps as it deems

proper. The minutes dated 17.06.2020, would show that the matter relating to the

request of 28 Colleges which applied for new programmes but were not shortlisted

was considered in it and it was noticed that some of the colleges were having pass

percentage above 50%; some having intake above 50%, though not having NBA

accreditation and hence required to be examined separately; syndicate resolved to

place the matter before the standing committee for affiliation with Prof: POJ Lebba

as Chairman to examine the request for affiliation and to revise the norms and to

submit the recommendations. It was stated that under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_6">Section 8(4)</a> in Chapter II of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES             26</span>


the Act, University is vested with the power to affiliate institutions as constituent

colleges, autonomous colleges or regular colleges or colleges with academic

autonomy and also to withdraw the affiliation of the colleges; the academic

autonomy of the University has been upheld by this Court in various judgments;

the criteria fixed by the syndicate of the University in the year 2019-20 for

granting new programmes was upheld by this Court in the judgments in

W.P(c).Nos.18319/2019, 17087/2019 and 16479/2019; in the judgment in

W.P(C).No.2748/2017; it was observed that the Universities are obligated to

consider the application for affiliation and to deal with the factors on a case to case

basis. The University stated that on account of the out break of COVID 19

pandemic the University could not conduct the inspection; at the same time the

University has to be vigilant as a regulatory body to prevent further dropping of

academic standard of engineering branch; therefore, it was necessary for the

University to take its own measures invoking its power conferred on it under the

Act to safeguard the interest of the student community. It was stated that Degrees

of NBA accredited tier-1 Engineering institutions are valid in 20 nations. While

NAAC certifies institutions, NBA accredits the programmes run by the

institutions; NBA is more specific that it expects that the graduating Engineers

should have the graduate attributes as defined in Washington accord; an institute

may have a mix of excellent programmes as well as some average programmes;

being an institution, obliged to improve the academic standards of the Graduate,

Post Graduate and Research Programmes in Engineering Science, Technology and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            27</span>


management the University has chosen NBA accreditation instead of NAAC; the

syndicate has not acted beyond its authority.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      2.3.   In the counter affidavit dated 07.07.2020, the University stated that

the petitioner is not entitled to affiliation for the additional courses; as per para

2.15.4(a) and (b) of the Approval Process Handbook (APH) issued by the AICTE

for the year 2020-21, those technical institutions which are not eligible for

applying for NBA accreditation alone are permitted to apply for additional courses;

an institution becomes eligible to apply for NBA accreditation when 2 batches

have passed out from the institution; for engineering courses it would be 5 years.

Under para.8 of Ext.R2(a) proforma for accreditation, the institution has to state

whether two batches have passed out in the programmes under consideration; as

the petitioner institution was established in 2010, it became eligible for applying

for accreditation in 2015; since a physical visit of the institution was not possible

for the scrutiny committee of AICTE, the AICTE required all the institutions

seeking additional courses to file an affidavit in Ext.R2(b) proforma, para.11 of

which was production of NOC from University before the scrutiny committee of

AICTE. As the University has not issued any NOC, the approval granted by

AICTE for the year 2020-21 is subject to production of NOC from University; the

grant of affiliation by University is not automatic; but on fulfillment of the norms

fixed by the University; the petitioner would not fall under para 2.15.4(b) of APH

also, as it only enables an existing institution where the approved intake of

students is more than the actual number of students admitted, to apply for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES             28</span>


additional courses with an intake of the seats which remain vacant; for that the

institution has to surrender the seats which are vacant; the petitioner institution has

not surrendered any seat; closure application of the existing course is only pending

consideration of the University;      affiliation for additional course could       be

considered only on production of NOC from the University; in the meeting held on

25.06.2020 , the Syndicate decided to fix higher norms for granting additional

courses to institutions without NBA accreditation; the student intake in an

institution is a relevant factor for evaluating its excellence as per the parameters

laid down in Ext.R2(c) by the National Institute of Ranking Frame (NIRF); the

University has granted affiliation for additional courses to all colleges having NBA

accreditation; norms in Ext.R2(b) are fixed only for those institutions which do not

have NBA accreditation. It is stated that the qualification of norms laid down by

central agency is only benchmark; State or other agency in the State including

University are entitled to lay down higher norms for granting affiliation; even as

per the norms fixed by AICTE, NBA accreditation is a mandatory requirement for

additional courses; Regulation 6(3)(a) of the AICTE regulation provides that

university has to consider the grant of affiliation after confirming that the applicant

had fulfilled all norms and standards through the procedure prescribed in the

Approval Process Handbook. At the same time, as per Clause 4.9 of the AICTE

Regulations, production of NOC from affiliating university/ board/State

Government is one of the conditions to be fulfilled by the new/existing institutions

conducting technical programmes and hence NOC from the University is required
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            29</span>


for grant of approval for the additional courses by the AICTE. It is also stated that

the provisions contained in para.2.15, 2.15(1), 2.15(2), 2.15(3) etc. of Ext.R2(d)

APH also would show that NBA accreditation is necessary to seek approval for

additional courses from the AICTE. The petitioner, who does not have NBA

accreditation, is not entitled for approval for starting the additional courses. It is

stated that the syndicate had, in order to ensure that only deserving technical

institutions are granted NOC for starting additional courses, appointed a sub

committee to look into the matters regarding recommendation of new courses or

programmes from among the applications of affiliated colleges; the subcommittee

after considering the Annual Employability Survey 2019 submitted by an agency

appointed by the Government of India and NASSCOM-McKinsey report

"Perspective 2020" and the duties and functions of NBA constituted by AICTE,

found that NBA accreditation of an institution should be an important criterion for

selection of institution; the Sub Committee further found that institutions which

have undergone the process of NBA accreditation were getting higher rating in the

academic audit of the affiliated institutions, conducted by external auditors and

therefore concluded that the decision of the syndicate to award new programme

only to NBA accredited institutions would ensure academic quality benchmarks

envisaged under the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_7">University Act</a> 2015 and the same was in tune with the APH

and the sub committee submitted Ext.R2(e) report accordingly. The syndicate, in

the meeting held on 24.06.2020, as per Ext.R2(f) minutes decided to adopt a

criteria for granting affiliation to new courses/programmes in colleges without
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES           30</span>


NBA accreditation. The University further stated that in Ext.R2(f) minutes, the

Syndicate has used the expressions "programme/course" in tune with the AICTE

regulations as well as its APH. Alternatively it is also stated that the meaning of

the expressions used by the University in its norms cannot have the same meaning

as the words and expressions defined by AICTE in its regulations and APH; it has

an agency under the AICTE; referring to the communications between NBA and

the Principal of TKM college of Engineering in Ext.R2(g) letter dated 16.05.2017

and Ext.R2(h) letter of NBA to the Principal, College of Engineering,

Thiruvananthapuram, it is stated that NBA awarded accreditation status to those

colleges in the "undergraduate program in Civil Engineering and Mechanical

Engineering", as against the distinction made in the definition of "programme"

and "course" in the Regulations and APH. According to the University, it used the

word programme to mean the specific branch of learning in Engineering and not to

mean the field of Technical education as understood by AICTE. It is stated that as

per para 2.5.2 of the APH, the Council shall decide granting of approval only after

confirming that the applicant has fulfilled all the norms and standards specified in

APH; the Council has not visited the institution due to the outbreak of Covid 19

pandemic; approval is granted without confirming whether the applicants fulfilled

the requirements and therefore approval has been granted to those without NBA

accreditation; absence of Statutes would not preclude the University from fixing

the norms for affiliation; in the light of the judgment in 2018 KHC 6863, the

NBA accreditation is not necessary for emerging courses. Intention behind para

2.15.4(b) of APH is that additional courses can be granted in lieu of increase in

intake, provided, total strength is not exceeding the total intake. As per para

2.15.4(c) of APH, instead of full division of 60 seats two courses with an intake of

30 each can be granted in the same level; NBA accreditation is not necessary for

starting emerging course as additional course within the total intake capacity; it is

further stated that Ext.R2(b) affidavit pertains to reduction in intake/closure of

programme and that NOC from University/State Government under clause 11

therein, is necessary only in such circumstances. It is stated that for additional

courses, affidavit in format no.8 alone is required and that Ext.R2(b) format is not

necessary. It is stated that if at all there is any violation it is for the AICTE to take

action and not for the University; University cannot fix any higher norms;

syndicate does not have any authority to fix norms; as per Ext.P10 notification

issued by the University on 12.03.2020, calling for applications for affiliation, it

was stated that the process of affiliation would be based on the norms and

standards specified in the APH; it was stipulated after AICTE granted affiliation;

the University has not notified any norms or guidelines after the APH 2020-2021

was issued; under Clause 4.9, NOC is required only when it is required under

APH; the petitioner is entitled to be granted affiliation in tune with the approval

constituted for the same apart from the one constituted on 17.06.2020 for

examining the request for affiliation and to revise the norms. It is pointed out that

the Chairman of the committee constituted on 17.06.2020 was Dr.Lebba; whereas

the Chairman of the Sub Committee which submitted the report in Ext.R2(e) was

one Dr.Radhakrishna Pillai and Dr.Lebba has expressed his dissenting note and the

syndicate fixed some other criteria in Ext.R2(f) and the said decision is not based

on the recommendation of the sub committee constituted on 17.06.2020; in case

there was a report of the sub committee, the University ought not have circulated

the decision taken on 04.02.2020, as per Ext.P6 order on 10.06.2020; the AICTE

never consults any University before granting approval to start new institution or

additional courses; agencies mentioned in Section 10(k) of the AICTE Act is not

universities; those agencies are appellate committees, scrutiny committee,

association of Indian Universities etc; regional office at Thiruvananthapuram is not

the University which initially fixed the condition of NBA accreditation, has

incorporated other conditions; the institutions which are granted affiliation do not

have 50% pass; it is stated that the pass percentage in MES College Kuttipuram is

only 36.55% ; in Adi Sankara College it is only 46.95%; Sree Buddha College of

Engineering has got only 49%; Toc.H Institute of Science and Technology,

Rajadhani Institute of Engineering College and Technology and College of

Engineering and Technology are having pass percentage of 47.48%, 34.61% and

37% respectively. AICTE has granted approval to the courses in emerging areas in

tune with its perspective plan; the action of the University is in violation of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_9">Article

254</a> of the Constitution. The petitioner asserts that its intake is 50% for the current

year and its grading is good/excellent per Exts.P11 and P12; the colleges which

are already granted affiliation do not fulfill the new criterion; the AICTE has

granted approval in emerging areas only to one third of the total of 149 colleges.

</p><p id="p_10">      2.7.   In the statement filed by the learned Government Pleader it is stated

that there were only 15 Engineering Colleges in the state in the year 1997 with an

intake of 4844 students. Engineering education in the State was opened upto to

private self financing sector since 2000. For the last one and half decades private

self financing institutions were indiscriminately sanctioned in the State without

any proper study of the need for such institutions. At present there are 149

Engineering Colleges in the State with a total annual intake capacity of 47,420

students of which 3,430 are in Government Engineering Colleges, 1,844 are in 3

Government aided Engineering Colleges, 80 are in 1 Agricultural University, 120

Kerala Fisheries University, 6819 in 25 Government controlled self financing

Engineering Colleges and the remaining 35,087 are in 105 private self financing

Engineering Colleges. Apart from that there are Engineering Institutions in the

State. Annual intake of UG Engineering Colleges in the State amounts to almost

4% of the all India intake. It is stated that due to mushrooming of self financing

engineering colleges unhealthy competition among them and the poor

infrastructure and faculty in most of the self financing and engineering colleges in

the State resulted in serious dent in the quality of Engineering education and

approximately 80% of those graduates from such institutions are not employable;

large section of Engineering graduates are under-employed and majority of them

are seeking employment in sectors not related to engineering; the demand for

undergraduate courses in Engineering in the private self-financing sector is on a

steep decline for the last decade as evident from the approved intake and the

vacancies in private self financing colleges; vacant seats in such colleges were

19,468 in 2015-16; 20,038 in 2016-17 and 22,819 in 2017-18; except in almost 20

self financing engineering colleges rate of admission is below 10%, based on the

statistics collected from the Commissioner for Entrance Examination who allots

candidates against 50% of the seats in private self financing colleges; . pointing

out the admission rate in the petitioner college from Annexures I to III it is stated

that the petitioner institution is totally discarded by public as there is no public

demand in core Engineering subject; whereas in certain private self financing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            35</span>


Colleges good academic standard is maintained. It is submitted that study

conducted by academic experts in the engineering field reported to the

Government that the low rate of admission in colleges like the petitioner institution

make such institutions financially unviable and consequently they further

compromise on faculty and infrastructure which in turn undermine the already

depleted standards of education in such institutions; no such experiments shall be

permitted in such institutions by sanctioning new courses. It is stated that the

Government had issued Anenxure IV order dated 22.06.2019 in that back ground.

The University had as per Annexure V order dated 10.07.2020 sanctioned new

courses in 23 colleges which satisfied the conditions in Annexure V. It is further

stated that under section 10(1)(k) of the Act the AICTE shall grant permission for

new courses in consultation with the agency concerned. A proper study should

have been conducted on the requirement of the courses in consultation with the

State Government and affiliating University or Board, which are the agencies

referred to in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_10">Section 10(1)(k)</a>.       The provisions contained in the AICTE

Regulations as well as the Approval Process Handbook prescribe NBA

accreditation as a condition for grant of additional courses in existing institutions.

According to the Government, there cannot be any objection in sanctioning new

courses in institutions which have good academic records and therefore the

decision of the University is accepted; the AICTE has to conduct survey in various

fields of technical education, collect data on all related matters and make forecast

of the needed growth and development in technical education and it shall grant

permission to new courses in consultation with the agencies concerned.

According to the Government, the agencies referred to in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_11">Section 10(1)(k)</a> are the

State Government and the affiliating University/Board.

<p id="p_11">      2.8.   After the hearing was over, the learned Standing Counsel for the

AICTE filed a statement on behalf of the AICTE. It is stated that NOC is

mandatory only for starting a new course, as per page 231 of the APH; affidavit

no.8 is required for additional course as provided in Clause 17.7 of the APH - page

196 of APH, in the format given in form no.8 at page 219 of the APH; for closure

of course NOC is required from the University/State Government before 30 th April;

due to Covid 19 pandemic the council in its meeting held on 27.04.2020 decided

that an affidavit with regard to submission of NOC for closure of the course from

the State Government would be obtained from the institution as a condition

precedent for processing of application for approval of additional courses and the

institutes have submitted affidavits that they would submit the same; NOC

mentioned in clause 11 in Ext.R2(b) is applicable only for reduction in intake or

closure of course; the AICTE has taken care by way of Clause 7.4 of the APH by

insisting that 60% of the courses should have NBA accreditation within the next 3

years; Director of Technical Education was a member of the Regional Committee;

so far AICTE has not received any objection from the University or the Director of

Technical Education regarding the procedure followed in grant of approval.

stated that approval for conversion of the College as a co-education institution was

received in 2019-20; as there are only 85 students in the College after conversion,

the petitioner submitted application for approval for starting emerging courses of

B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence as well as in Block Chain. Approval was granted

as per Ext.P2 on 09.06.2020 along with Extension of Approval for the ongoing

courses in Civil Engineering with an intake of 30, (in the place of 21 in 2019-20),

Intelligence and Machine Learning and Block chain with an intake of 30 each.

Even though Ext.P4 application was submitted for affiliation for which inspection

fee was already remitted on 18.05.2020, University did not take any positive steps.

Petitioner challenges the order dated 10.06.2020 issued by the University fixing

the norms for affiliation. According to the petitioner, when the AICTE has granted

approval, a further evaluation by a sub-committee and imposing of further

restriction for affiliation is beyond authority. It is also urged that University is

arbitrarily enabling some institutions in granting affiliation with political motives

and the criteria like 50% of the students actual intake and pass percentage in some

existing subjects are adopted with such motives. According to the petitioner,

University can only look into the infrastructure, faculties and other facilities for the

petitioner has filed reply affidavit producing academic audit report for the year

2019-20, according to which, it has got the rating "good/excellent" in various

stages. It is stated that wherever there was fair and poor rating that has been

improved. It is the further contention that criteria fixed by the University in

Ext.R2(f) on 24.06.2020 after filing of the Writ Petition, are not satisfied by the

Colleges which are already granted affiliation.        According to the petitioner,

petitioner institution is on a better footing than those colleges. It is their further

contention that the reason for dearth of students in the previous years was that the

students were joining courses in colleges outside the State, in emerging fields. It

is also stated that new courses in emerging area are having larger demand when the

students are unable to go outside the State due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is

also stated that out of the 149 colleges, only 1/3 colleges are granted approval by

AICTE for the emerging courses. In case the University is not granting affiliation,

the opportunity of students would be lost which will affect the society also.

accordingly the said course was closed. On the basis of the application submitted

by the petitioner, the AICTE granted Ext.P2 approval for starting B.Tech degree

same. At the same time, NOC was granted for closure of B.Tech in Applied

Electronics and Instrumentation on 01.06.2020 as per Ext.P4 letter. It is stated that

the petitioner would have got NBA accreditation this year itself, but for the lock

down. It is also its case that NBA accreditation is not mandatory for emerging

courses as per Approval Process Handbook. It is stated that a sub committee was

proposed to take a decision for evaluating the colleges for granting affiliation but

no such sub committee is necessary for evaluating any aspects for getting

affiliation for additional courses when AICTE has approved the courses. It is

stated that several of the Government colleges and IHRD colleges which are

granted affiliation are not having NBA accreditation.          Even without NBA

accreditation, the University has granted affiliation to 21 colleges for starting

additional courses, without conducting any inspection. It is also their case that

certain colleges have been discriminated. According to the petitioner, the dearth of

students or reduction in pass percentage is not on account of any fault of the

college. The University is only called upon to verify whether there is sufficient

infrastructure, faculties, and other facilities for the proper conduct of the course.

The denial of affiliation for additional courses in emerging areas is arbitrary.

that upto 2018-19 the intake in the college was more than 50% and because of

affiliation for the entire intake for the ongoing courses, the University would have

given the same without any objection. Therefore, there is no purpose to be

achieved in limiting or restricting the additional course on the ground of stipulated

norms. It is stated that the College is having a strength of 300 seats in the

undergraduate level. Request for closure of the course in Power Systems and

Engineering is already submitted before the University whereby the intake

capacity is reduced to 240. It is stated that the College will be able to function

with the available infrastructure on grant of the additional course limiting the

maximum intake to 300. As per Ext.P3 dated 15.06.2020 Extension of Approval is

course is granted in accordance with para. 2.15.4 of the APH 2020-21. It is stated

that in the academic year 2019-20, the University had decided to grant affiliation

only to innovative and integrated programmes seeing 50% of the sanctioned seats

were left vacant in the conventional programmes. It was also stipulated that NBA

accreditation and more than 30% of the sanctioned strength along with satisfactory

academic performance should be the criteria. It is stated that the clarification

is the further contention that intake of 30% or less is not at all relevant with the

innovative programmes in emerging areas. It is also stated that as the average pass

percentage in the petitioner College is more than that in the colleges which were

granted affiliation already, there cannot be any discrimination. It is the further

contention that NOC is necessary only for closure of the Colleges and even for

starting new Colleges what is required is the views of the State Government. The

Government had on 22.06.2019 (Ext.P6) fixed the norms for issuing NOC. It is

stated that the Government does not have any authority to issue such norms and an

NOC is not necessary from the Government, when the AICTE is granted approval.

Referring to the judgment in W.A.No.1487/2019 it is stated that there is no basis

for the order issued by the Government. The petitioner challenges the order Ext.P6

issued by the State Government on 22.06.2019 as the same is in violation of the

raised objection if any before the last date of submission; during the academic

years 2017-18 to 2020-2021, a total of 150 intake was reduced and closed one

course of 60 intake. It is alleged that respondents 1 and 2 are diluting the norms

fixed by them and the petitioner does not require NBA accreditation.

University is mandatory as specified in the Approval Process Handbook. It is

      Petitioner College has been offering Undergraduate courses in Civil,

Mechanical and Computer Science and Engineering with an intake of 60 each and

in Electrical and Electronics and Electronics and Communication Engineering with

30 seats each. Based on application submitted by petitioner, AICTE issued Ext.P5

on 09.03.2020 granting approval for a new course in Data Science with an intake

of 30 and extension of approval for the other courses. The contention of the

petitioner is that NOC from Government or accreditation by NBA is not necessary

for the new courses in 2020-21, as per clause 2.15.4(a) and (b). As the total intake

was only 240, the petitioner is entitled to a new course without exceeding the total

intake of 300 as provided in Appendix 3. It is also urged that the University

cannot fix any criteria contrary to those fixed by AICTE and that the University

can fix higher qualifying norms only in respect of factors directly connected to the

maintenance of standard of education and not for the purpose of affiliation for

additional course. It is urged that NOC is required under Clause 4.9(d) only in

their contention that the University cannot pick and choose in granting affiliation.

While challenging Ext.P6 order dated 10.06.2020, the petitioner points out that

those norms are applicable only for new programmes and not courses and seeks a

direction to University to grant affiliation dehors Ext.P6. Contention of the

petitioner is that AICTE has taken a conscious decision in 2020-2021 to do away

with accreditation with NBA and therefore it cannot be insisted.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            53</span>


college has been offering 5 streams of Undergraduate Engineering courses with a

total approved intake of 240 students. Based on application dated 20.02.2019 the

AICTE as per Ext.P3 order dt.30.4.2019 granted extension of approval for the

academic year 2019-20 for the 5 existing Engineering courses as well as

Postgraduate course in Business Administration (MBA) with an intake of 60

students. The petitioner had also submitted application for affiliation with the

University. It is stated that the University conducted an inspection of the college

on 20.03.2019 and though no deficiencies were noted in the Affiliation

Application/Report of Deficiency Ext.P4, University did not grant affiliation to the

new courses when it granted affiliation to the ongoing courses as per Ext.P6 order

dated 15.5.2019. Without issuing any orders on its application, the University

unnecessarily forwarded it to the State Government for its approval. Government

issued a general order Ext.P7 on 22.06.2019 fixing 3 criteria for issuing NOC for

commencing new UG/PG courses ie. (1) the programmes in the colleges should

have NBA accreditation; (2) admission in the previous years should be more than

50% of their sanctioned strength and (3) the courses sought to be started should be

innovative and should have the approval of the AICTE.             According to the

petitioner, the petitioner was fulfilling all the criteria. As per Ext.P9 letter dated

04.01.2020 the Government rejected the application for commencement of MBA

course on the ground that it did not have AICTE approval and did not meet the

criteria set out in the Government Order dated 22.06.2019. The petitioner points

out that both the reasons stated are factually incorrect, as it was having approval
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES           54</span>


from AICTE and it was not necessary for the University to forward the application

to the State Government or for the State Government to issue NOC as there is no

provision under the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_12">University Act</a>, 2015 which insists production of NOC for

grant of affiliation to start PG courses. Once the AICTE, which is the supreme

authority, has granted approval, neither the University nor the State Government

has any power to dilute the same unless and until they get the approval set aside in

a due process known to law; therefore the University ought to have granted

affiliation on the basis of the approval already granted by the AICTE.          The

petitioner had approached this Court in W.P(c).No.1635/2020 when the University

refused to pass orders on the application and based on the submission made by the

learned Standing Counsel that it was under consideration of the University, this

Court disposed of the Writ Petition as per Ext.P10 judgment dated 09.03.2020,

directing to take a decision and to communicate the same within two weeks.

Despite the judgment, the University did not pass any orders. The petitioner points

out that it has already received the prospectus in respect of MBA course approved

by the Admission Supervisory Committee as per Ext.P12 proceedings. It is also

stated that the petitioner college received a communication from the University by

e-mail dated 03.04.2020 (Ext.P13 e-mail) from the Convener (MBA Programme)

calling for suggestion from the college to revise the syllabus of MBA for the

academic year 2020-21. It is stated that the Acting Director of the petitioner

college had forwarded the revised syllabus as per letter dt.14.04.2020. The AICTE

has as per Ext.P15 order dated 30.04.2020 granted extension of approval for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            55</span>


commencement of MBA course. Though the petitioner submitted Ext.P16

application for affiliation and there is a zero deficiency report Ext.P17, the

University did not pass any orders on the same. The University has as per Ext.P18

decision dated 10.06.2020 formulated new norms for grant of affiliation to new

programmes insisting      NBA accreditation for at least one of the existing

programmes. In the case of PG programmes the concerned UG Programmes

should have NBA accreditation; (2) the average annual intake for the previous 3

years should be more than 50% of the sanctioned intake; (3) the proposed

programme should have AICTE approval and NOC from the Government and (4)

the proposed programme should have industry demand/employment potential.

Petitioner challenges Ext.P18 order dated 10.06.2020 of the University to the

extent it insists NBA accreditation to one of the programmes and NOC from

Government for the new programme and seeks a direction. Petitioner challenges

Ext.P7 order dated 22.06.2019 of the Government also and seeks a direction to the

University to grant affiliation to the new programme without insisting NBA

accreditation or NOC from Government and for a direction to the Vice Chancellor

to issue orders of affiliation in tune with Ext.P15 approval.

</p><p id="p_41">       19.2. The petitioner submits that insisting NOC from the Government and

NBA accreditation for at least one of the programmes is arbitrary and it goes

against the AICTE regulations. It is the contention of the petitioner that there is no

provision which insists NOC from the Government under the AICTE regulations

as well as the 2015 Act and in the light of the judgment in <a href="/doc/150338760/" id="a_13">K.V.M College of

Nursing v. State of Kerala</a> [2017 (3) KHC 63], NOC from the Government is not

required for affiliation by the University. It is also stated that in the absence of any

statutes framed for the University, the conditions fixed are unsustainable and

without authority; the University does not have any authority to deny affiliation

once approval is granted and the University cannot be permitted to collaterally

attack the approval granted by the competent body as per a central enactment; the

only area where the University can lay down any condition is regarding the

faculties or seats and it does not have any authority to insist on any further

condition than that is insisted by the AICTE. Affiliation cannot be denied on the

basis of policy decisions.

<p id="p_42">      19.3. In the counter affidavit the University has stated that      production of

no objection certificate from the University before the scrutiny committee is a

mandatory requirement for granting approval of new programme as per the

provisions contained in para 17.3 of the APH. The University has not issued a no

objection certificate to the petitioner institution to start MBA programme. It was

stated that the petitioner was required to file an affidavit before the AICTE stating

that it will produce NOC from the University for commencing new programme.

According to the University, it is entitled to prescribe higher norms to grant

affiliation to new programmes.       According to the University, the application

submitted by the petitioner along with the list of facilities before the AICTE in the

year 2019 cannot have any relevance for the affiliation in the year 2020. The

petitioner should have obtained NOC from the University before submitting the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            57</span>


application before the AICTE for affiliation to start a new programme. Since the

petitioner does not satisfy the condition mentioned in Ext.P18 order, it is not

entitled to get affiliation.   It is stated that as per clause 4.9 of the AICTE

regulations, NOC from the University is necessary for commencement of a new

programme.

well as affiliation for additional course on application by a college or institution

shall be as prescribed in the Statutes. Admittedly, no statute is made.                            The

contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioners, is that it is for the Vice

Chancellor to take action in the absence of statutes and not the syndicate.

Therefore, it is necessary to have a look at <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_32">Section 14(6)</a> of the Act which read as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      14. (6): Where any matter is required to be regulated by Statutes or Regulations but no
      Statutes or Regulations have been made in that behalf, the Vice-Chancellor shall, for
      the time being,regulate the matter by issuing such directions as the Vice-Chancellor
      thinks necessary, and shall, as soon as may be, submit them before the Board of
      Governors or other authority or body concerned for approval.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">Even under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_33">Section 14(6)</a>, Vice Chancellor has to submit the order before the

Governing body or such other body for approval. It cannot be said that syndicate

is not a body envisaged under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_34">Section 14(6)</a> of the Act. The powers and functions

of the syndicate are given in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_35">Section 30</a> of the University Act, 2015. Clause (xiv)

of <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_36">Section 30(2)</a>, relied on by the University to issue norms, read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      S.30. Powers, functions and duties of the Syndicate--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (1)    Subject to the provisions of this Act and the Statutes, the executive powers of the
      University, including the general superintendence and control over the institutions of the
      University, shall be vested in the Syndicate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (2)      Subject to the provisions of this Act and the Statutes, the Committee shall have
      the following powers, namely:--

      to issue instructions for maintaining their efficiency, for ensuring academic and
      administrative resources, infrastructural facility, academic performance, performance of
      teachers of these colleges and in the case of private colleges ensure payment of adequate
      salaries and service conditions to the members of the staff and in case of disregard of
      such instructions, to modify the conditions of affiliation or take such steps as it deems
      proper in that behalf.</blockquote><p id="p_49">

</p><p id="p_50">      23. The argument of Sri. Krishnamoorthy that the syndicate has issued the

norms in violation of the judgment in W.A.Nos.738 of 2018, 862 of 2018 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES             62</span>


connected cases is unsustainable because in those cases this Court has not

considered the authority of the syndicate vis a vis Vice Chancellor.             Those

judgments were rendered when the University did not entertain the applications on

the ground that there is no Statute. When the action of Vice Chancellor under

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_37">Section 14</a> requires approval of either the governing body or such other body and

the power of the syndicate under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_38">Section 30(2)(iv)</a> extends to matters relating to

affiliation also, it cannot be said that syndicate did not have any authority to fix the

norms for affiliation.
</p>
<p id="p_51">      24.    The norms challenged in almost all the cases are those issued by the

University on 10.06.2020, by which the conditions for affiliation of new

"programme" were stipulated as (1) should have NBA accreditation (2) average

annual intake shall be more than 50% of the sanctioned intake for the last 3 years

(3) NOC from state Government and (4) proposed programme should have

industry demand/employment potential. The syndicate modified those norms on

24.06.2020 and fixed new conditions to be fulfilled by the colleges for affiliation

of new courses/programmes, apparently, taking note of the contentions raised in

these Writ Petitions with respect to the definition of programme and course.

</p><p id="p_52">      25.    Regarding the norms issued on 10.06.2020, though the University

employed the word 'programme' it is seen that almost all the institutions except

one or two have not also understood the difference between `programmes' and

`course', in tune with definition given by AICTE, as evident from the pleadings.

Therefore, the said difference alone would not make the petitioner institutions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES           63</span>


eligible for affiliation. Though the order dated 10.06.2020 laid down the norms

fixed for affiliation of the 'programme', as in the previous orders, all those

concerned have understood the same as those applicable to the courses. As pointed

out by Sri.Elvin Peter, even the NBA, which is a statutory agency constituted

under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_39">Section 10(u)</a> of the Act, has in Exts.R2(g) and (h) granted accreditation to

the programmes in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, etc in the place of

'courses' . Therefore, it cannot be said that the norms fixed in the order dated

10.06.2020 are not applicable for the courses

</p><p id="p_53">      26.   Now it is also necessary to have a look at the provisions contained in

the AICTE Act, Regulations and the APH. The All India Council for <a href="/doc/30550664/" id="a_40">Technical

Education Act</a>, 1987 ('the Act" for short) was enacted to provide for the

establishment of an All India Council for Technical Education ('the Council' for

short ) with a view to the proper planning and co-ordinated development of the

technical education system throughout the country, the promotion of qualitative

improvement of such education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the

regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical

education system and for incidental matters. As per <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_41">Section 10(k)</a> of the Act, in

order to ensure coordinated and integrated development of technical education and

maintenance of standards, one of the duties of the Council is to grant approval for

starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new courses or

programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned.       Under Clause (u) of

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_42">Section 10</a>, the Council has to set up a National Board of Accreditation (`NBA' for

short) to periodically conduct evaluation of technical institutions or programmes

on the basis of guidelines, norms and standards specified by it and to make

recommendation to it, or to the Council, or to the Commission or to other bodies,

regarding recognition or de-recognition of the institution or the programme.                     In

exercise of the powers conferred on the Council under <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_43">Section 23</a> read with

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_44">Section 10</a> and <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_45">11</a> of the Act, the Council has made 'The AICTE (Grant of

Approvals for Technical Institutions) Regulations, 2020' ("Regulations" for short).

Clause 1.1.(l) makes the Regulations 2020 applicable for the following

applications among others mentioned in sub-clause (a) to (z) and (aa):

</p><p id="p_55">      27.      As per Clause 3.1(b) of the Regulations, approval from AICTE is

mandatory for any existing technical institution either to conduct/increase/reduce

the   intake    in    the    existing     courses/     Programmes         or    introduce       new

programmes/Courses at any level in regular mode. As per sub-clause (c) of Clause

3.1, approval from the AICTE as well as the affiliating University is necessary for

a Technical institution to participate in the counselling and admission process or to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES                   65</span>


admit students.     As per sub-clause (d) and (e) of Clause 3.1, the affiliating

University or the State Government, as the case may be, shall not admit any

student in the absence of approval of AICTE.                    Clause 4 relates to generic

conditions for approval. Clause 4.4 provides that in order to maintain quality of

education, 60% of the eligible courses in any technical institution shall be

accredited in the next three years or else EoA would not be granted. It also

provides that appropriate action would be taken against institutions with

admissions consistently meagre. Under clause 5.5, the Council has to publish,

Approval Process Handbook (APH) detailing all the documents to be attached to

the application; the Technical Education Regulatory (TER) charges to be remitted,

the norms and standards, the requirement and procedure by which the applications

are processed for grant of approval of the new/existing institutions. Clause 4.9

deals with the requirements for the new/existing institution/deemed to be

Universities conducting Technical Programmes.                  As per Clause 4.9.a, all the

Technical Institutions shall fulfill requisite norms as specified in the APH. Clause

4.9.b relates to documents showing ownership of land, etc; 4.9.c relates to

construction of built up area; Clause 4.9.d reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      "4.9.d: NOC from affiliating University/ Board/ State Government/ UT shall be required,
      as applicable, for such applications as specified in the Approval Process Handbook."</blockquote><p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">      28.    Under Clause 4.14 the institutions shall have to fulfill all facilities

such as infrastructure, Faculty and other requirements to offer regular courses as

per the norms specified in the APH for the total approved intake and all such

institutions shall create such infrastructure and other facilities within 2 years to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES                    66</span>


fulfill the norms. Clause 5 deals with submission of applications. Under Clause

5.6 existing institutions have to submit online applications for the cases listed in

Clause 1.2 of the Regulations, using their unique user ID, remitting prescribed

TER charges as specified in the APH and they have to upload documents in the

web-portal/submit to the scrutiny/re-scrutiny committee/Expert Visit Committee,

as applicable, as specified in the APH. The applicants have to submit/upload an

affidavit in the format as specified in the APH setting the Council at liberty to take

action against it if the information furnished in the application is found to be false.

Applications received after the cut off date mentioned in the public notice shall not

be processed. Clause 6 relates to the processing of applications and grant of

approval. Under Clause 6.1 the applications shall be processed in accordance

with the procedure prescribed in the Handbook. Clause 6.2 which relates to the

procedure for setting up new Technical Institution reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">      6.2. For setting up new Technical Institution
      a. The State Government/UT and the Affiliating University/Board shall forward their
      views on the applications received for setting up new institutions submitted under
      Clause 1.2.a of the regulations to the concerned Regional Office, not later than one week
      from the last date of submission of application as notified.
      In the absence of receipt of views from the State Government/UT and the Affiliating
      University/Board, the Council shall proceed for further processing.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_58">Therefore, the opportunity for the State Government and University to submit their

views is available only when the application is for setting up new institutions.

None of the petitioners herein have applied for setting up new institution.

Therefore, the contention of the petitioners that the University ought to have raised

objection if any, within the time prescribed in Clause 6.2 or when applications
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES                    67</span>


were received for approval, is unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_59">      29.     Clause 6.2.k provides that new technical institutions granted letter of

Approval and existing institutions granted approval for introduction of new

courses, divisions, programmes, variation in intake capacity shall comply with

appointment of Faculty and Principal/Director as the case may be, as per the policy

of the Council and institutions except minority institutions, shall appoint Faculty

and Principal/Director and other technical staff as per the method and procedure of

the affiliating University/State Government and information about the appointment

shall be uploaded in the web Portal of the AICTE. As per sub-clause l, Expert

Visit Committee may be conducted to verify the fulfillment of the norms as

specified in the APH, any time before the first batch of students have passed out.

Clause 6.3 deals with processing of applications of the existing institutions. Sub-

clause (a) provides that for applications submitted under Clause 1.2, the Council

shall grant approval only after confirming that the applicant has fulfilled all the

norms and standards through the procedure as specified in the APH. In all these

cases, except in one, the petitioners have stated that they are granted approval for

additional courses. Clause 6.3(f) and (g) which are relevant, read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      "6.3(f): Institutions shall be eligible for new course(s)/ expansion of existing course(s),
      equal to the number of valid NBA accredited course(s), limited to a maximum of FOUR
      within the definition of Division/Programme/ level.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">              Increase in intake/additional course in undergraduate Degree/Post Graduate
      Degree level in Engineering and Technology shall be permissible only in EMERGING
      AREAS."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      6.3(g): Institutions having an "Approved Intake" less than a Division size in any of the
      course(s) as prescribed by the Council may apply for intake of full division size
      themselves and shall maintain Faculty: student ratio accordingly, without NBA
      accreditation/ NOC from affiliating University/ Board/ State Government/ UT, subject to
      "Zero Deficiency" based on self-disclosure on AICTE web-portal. However, this is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES                     68</span>

      applicable in case of institutions under penal action.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">As per Clause 2.9 of the Regulation, "Approved intake" means the maximum

number of students that can be admitted in a course (excluding supernumerary

seats) as approved by the Council. Under Clause 2.21, 'course' means one of the

branches of learning in a programme such as Civil Engineering, Mechanical

Engineering, etc. As per sub-clause (a) of Clause 2.22 `division' means a batch of

maximum of 60 students in Diploma/Undergraduate courses in Engineering and

Technology/Hotel Management/Catering Technology/Post Graduate Courses in

MCA/PGCM/MBA Programme, excluding supernumerary seats, if any. Therefore,

under Clause 6.3(f), the new courses or expansion of existing courses would be

permitted in an institution only if it has got NBA accreditation and number of such

courses/size of expansion permissible would be upto the number of NBA

accredited courses subject to a ceiling of 4 division. Increase in intake/additional

courses can be permitted in undergraduate and post graduate courses only in

Emerging areas. The aforesaid provision refers to new course in the first part

where NBA accreditation is made mandatory; whereas nothing is stated for

granting additional courses. While it is stipulated that additional courses should be

only in emerging areas it is not clear whether the new course cannot be an

additional course or vice versa. It is necessary to have a look at the corresponding

provision in APH, ie. para. 2.15, which deals with increase in intake/additional

course(s). Para. 2.15.1 provides that the existing institutions shall expand its

activities by the addition of new/additional courses/Divisions, provided, they have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES              69</span>


a valid NBA, for the reasons (a) increased demand in certain domains as per the

industrial need for technical personnel (b) to increase the utilisation of

infrastructure available at the technical institutions (c) ensure quality of Technical

Education being imparted. Therefore, as per para. 2.5.1 of APH, the activities of

the college can be expanded either by adding new course or additional courses and

it is mandatory to have NBA accreditation for both new and additional courses.

Though <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_46">Section 10(k)</a> of the Act refers to introduction of new course and

regulations 6.3 as well as several provisions in APH refer to new courses as well as

additional course, there is no definition for either of it. It is relevant to note that in

all the orders by which the petitioners have been granted approval in 2020-21, the

AICTE has specifically instructed that those are new courses and shall be only in

emerging areas. Nowhere it is stated as additional courses.
</p>
<p id="p_61">      30.    At any rate, Clause 6.3 (f) of the regulations read with para.2.5.1

makes it clear that NBA accreditation is necessary for granting both.              Under

Clause 6.3.(g) of the Regulation, NBA accreditation or NOC from the affiliating

University is not necessary for applying for intake of full division size, for

institutions where the approved intake in any of the courses is less than division

size ( 60), subject to zero deficiency on self disclosure on AICTE web-portal.

That would also indicate that NBA accreditation is necessary for all other kind of

expansion. Para. 2.15.2 deals with requirement and eligibility. Under clause (a)

thereof, accreditation is mandatory for existing courses; under clause (b)

institutions awaiting the results of the visit for accreditation are also eligible; but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES              70</span>


they have to produce valid NBA certificate at the time of scrutiny. As per sub-

clause c, increase in intake and additional course is permitted only in emerging

areas.         As per clause d, such institutions shall apply for increase in

intake/additional course along with additional documents as per Appendix 17 of

the APH; institutions shall have zero deficiency based on self disclosure as per the

deficiency report generated through web portal. Para 2.15.5 again provides that

the number of new course/expansion of existing courses that would be permitted,

would be equal to the number of valid NBA accredited course subject to a

maximum of 4 within the definition of division/programme/level on condition that

the maximum of two divisions alone can be added in the valid NBA accredited

undergraduate course provided that the total number of divisions after expansion

per course shall not exceed the maximum intake allowed as specified in Appendix

3 of the APH. All the provisions in Clause b to h of 2.15.3 would show that NBA

accreditation is mandatory for new courses as well as additional courses and even

for that there is an upper limit for the maximum intake. It also provides that the

NBA accreditation can be utilised for increase in intake or introduction of new

course only once in 6 years.
</p>
<p id="p_62">         31.     In several of the Colleges the number of ongoing courses itself is 5

and more than 5. But the maximum intake is maintained at 300. According to the

University, as per the provisions contained in the APH, the maximum number of

courses permissible is 5 and maximum total intake is 300 in an institution. The

University has not granted affiliation to colleges having more than 5 courses. But
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES                    71</span>


the case of some of the colleges is that if maximum intake is 300, there can be any

number of courses. It is also their contention that number of courses is limited to 5

in new institutions alone. In this context para 2.15.4(a) and (b) of the APH and

Clause 6.3.(i) and (j) of the regulations are relevant, which read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">      6.3(i): The existing institutions having total "Approved Intake" equal to/less than the

Division is 60. The upper limit prescribed in Appendix 3 is made applicable in the

cases coming under 2.15.4(a) and (b).
</p>
<p id="p_68">      34.       Clause 6.3.i as well as Para. 2.15.4a relate to institutions where

approved intake is equal to the maximum intake allowed, institutions having less

than the maximum intake allowed and institutions which are not eligible for NBA

accreditation. For such institutions, permission can be granted for increase in the

same level in a programme upto the maximum intake without NBA accreditation;

application for the same should be as per Appendix 3. One fails to understand how

any increase can be effected in an institution having 'approved intake' equal to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            73</span>


'maximum intake allowed', upto the 'maximum intake allowed' in the same

programme. At any rate, what is permitted is for increase in intake to the extent of

difference between approved intake and the maximum intake of 300 in the same

level in the same programme and the same is permissible without NBA

accreditation.
</p>
<p id="p_69">      35.    Under clause 6.3.j the institution where the approved intake is in

excess of total intake allowed, can apply for closure of the course and thereafter

apply for increase in intake/additional course in lieu of such closure. In that event

also, total approved intake/additional course/division shall not exceed the total

approved intake of 300, number of course(5)/division(6) as specified in appendix 3

of APH ie. this facility is available without NBA accreditation. Para. 2.15.4 (b)

provides for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_70">      36.    From clauses (a) and (b) of 2.15.4 it is clear that increase in intake as

well as number of courses shall not exceed the maximum provided in Appendix 3.

In both (a) and (b) increase provided is in the programme and same level. For

institutions where the total approved intake exceeds the maximum intake allowed,

increase in intake/additional courses in lieu of closure can be permitted even

without NBA accreditation, in accordance with Appendix 3 and such addition can

only be in emerging areas. But in other cases (covered by sub-clause a) NBA

accreditation is necessary except for institutions which did not become eligible for

the same on completion of course by 2 consecutive batches. Para 2.15.(c) provides

that in lieu of one course with 60 intake, two courses with 30 intake can be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES             74</span>


permitted. In this provision no ceiling is given as given in clause (a) or (b). NBA

accreditation is also not provided. It therefore means after reduction in intake in

one course another course can be granted in lieu of reduction. However, that can

be applied only to an institution which has not become eligible for NBA

accreditation, as Clause 15.4 starts with eligibility for accreditation.

</p><p id="p_71">      37.    It is also pertinent to note that para.2.15.5 provides for the procedure.

Under clause (a) thereof, scrutiny committee shall verify the additional document

as per Appendix 17 of APH. Clause (b) provides for an appeal for submitting

NBA certificate if it was not issued at the time of scrutiny. On par with clause 6.g

of the Regulations, para. 2.15.6 of APH permits institutions with intake less than

division size to apply for full division size in any of the courses, without NBA

accreditation or NOC from the affiliating University or State Government.

</p><p id="p_72">      38.    The arguments of Sri.Jawad as well as Sri.Saji Isaac are to the effect

that the clause 2.15.4 (a) or (b) cannot be interpreted in isolation; but all the

provisions in 2.15 have to be read together and in that event what is intended is

that ceiling is only on maximum intake of 300 and not on the number of courses.

It was also argued by all the Counsel that NBA accreditation is not required for

additional courses and, at any rate, for courses in emerging areas. However, both

those provisions are not worded properly for comprehension by a person of

normal prudence.
</p>
<p id="p_73">      39.    A reading of the entire provisions in 2.15 would show that NBA

accreditation is necessary except where it is not specifically excluded. Moreover,

Annexure 14 of the APH also states that accreditation is mandatory for increase in

intake/starting new course.          Appendix 17 provides for the documents to be

submitted    or     uploaded       for    various      purposes      including      "increase     in

intake/additional course(s)." Appendix 17.3 provides as follows:

<p id="p_77">From Appendix 17.7 it is seen that the additional documents to be submitted for

approval of increase in intake as well as for additional course would include an

Affidavit, valid NBA accreditation certificate of current academic year and No

objection certificate from affiliating University in the format is necessary for

institutions having approved intake less than maximum intake in format.

</p><p id="p_78">      42.    However, NOC is required for starting new courses as per clause ix

of format 2. As per the statement of the learned Standing Counsel of the AICTE

also, NOC is required for new courses. But the regulations or the APH do not

define new course or additional course. But in the orders granting approval to the

petitioners, the courses for which approval is given are stated to be in "new

courses" with instruction that it should be in emerging areas only. But the

petitioners' grievance is that affiliation is denied to the additional courses.

Therefore, it is necessary to get NOC from the University for the new courses as

well as for institutions with approved intake less than the maximum intake

allowed. None of the petitioners have got NOC from the University as prescribed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            77</span>


in Appendix 17.7 or       NBA accreditation as required in the APH, which is

necessary under Clause 2.15.4. The number of courses is also 5 and above in most

of the cases. The action of the University in ensuring that the colleges have

fulfilled the requirements in the provisions in the clause 6.3(f) and 2.15.4(a) and

</p><p id="p_79">(b) of APH cannot be said to be illegal. The denial of affiliation on the basis of

the norms or for non complaince with the provisions in the regulations or in the

APH cannot be said to be a collateral attack to the order of approval.

</p><p id="p_80">      43.     Now that the syndicate has taken a decision on 24.06.2020

fixing/revising the norms issued on 10.06.2020, specifically making it applicable

to the programmes as well as courses. That decision is not under challenge in any

of these Writ Petitions. The requirement of NOC from Government is no longer a

requirement. Now the question to be determined is whether the University can fix

any such condition as done in Ext. R2(f) (produced in W.P.(C) 11778 of 2020).

</p><p id="p_81">      44.     It is seen from Ext.R2(f) that the deletion of the requirement of NOC

from the Government has been done correctly. But regarding the other conditions,

though it is stated that the said norms are for those not having NBA accreditation,

the University is supposed to adopt a uniform yardstick in the matter of affiliation.

If at all any norms are relaxed that can only be after issuing an order incorporating

the revised norms. At any rate, one set of Colleges cannot be subjected to onerous

conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_82">      45.     In the common judgment in W.P.(C)No.16479 of 2019, I had upheld
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES             78</span>


the denial of affiliation on more or less similar norms. That judgment is not varied

so far. However, I find that the difference between `programme' and `course' was

not noticed in it. But that alone would not make the petitioners in these Writ

Petitions eligible for affiliation. At any rate, I will consider whether the definitions

would make any difference in these Writ Petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_83">      46.     The conditions to be fulfilled for those colleges without NBA

accreditation are (1) institution should have more than 50% pass for the outgoing

students at the time of application for affiliation (ii) the institution should have

most recent academic audit overall score of "GOOD" and it should have 3 years'

average intake of more than 50% sanctioned intake. The conditions fixed by the

University in the year 2019-20 were (1) programmes should be innovative (2)

student intake for the last 3 years should be more than 30% of the sanctioned

intake and academic performance should be satisfactory. The only substantial

difference in the present norms is regarding pass percentage and enhancement in

percentage of intake. The norms fixed on 24.06.2020 are for the institutions

without NBA accreditation.
</p>
<p id="p_84">      47.    In this context it is relevant to note that Ext.R2(a) proforma of

application for accreditation by NBA would show that the percentage of admission

in the courses for 3 years' period is a factor relevant for NBA accreditation. The

contention of the University is that they had fixed only those conditions fixed by

AICTE in its APH. It is also their contention that they can fix such conditions

without lowering the standard set by the AICTE, relying on the 3 Judge Bench
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES                       79</span>


judgment of the Apex Court in State of T.N and another V S.V. Bratheep (Minor)

and others: (2004) 4 SCC 513.                    There the Tamil Nadu Government fixed

separate minimum marks in the related subjects in the qualifying examination as

eligibility to be considered for admission to Engineering Colleges; whereas AICTE

prescribed only aggregate 60% marks in 3 subjects together.                             The contention

relying on the judgment in Adhiyaman Educational Research Institute's case

(supra) that the State has no authority to tinker with the norms fixed by AICTE for

the purpose of ensuring uniformity with extended access of educational

opportunity, was repelled following the judgment of the Constitution Bench in

Preeti Srivastava (Dr) V State of M.P: (1999) 7 SCC 120 and it was held as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">                   10. xxxxTherefore, it is difficult to subscribe to the view that once they are
           qualified under the criteria fixed by AICTE they should be admitted even if they
           fall short of the criteria prescribed by the State. The scope of the relative entries
           in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has to be understood in the manner as
           stated in Dr Preeti Srivastava case and, therefore, we need not further elaborate
           in this case or consider arguments to the contrary such as on application of
           occupied theory no power could be exercised under Entry 25 of List III as they
           would not arise for consideration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">           xxxxxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">           12.       One other argument is further advanced before us that the criteria fixed
           by AICTE were to be adopted by the respective colleges and once such
           prescription had been made, it was not open to the Government to prescribe
           further standards particularly when they had established the institutions in
           exercise of their fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_47">Article 19</a> of the
           Constitution. However, we do not think this argument can be sustained in any
           manner. Prescription of standards in education is always accepted to be an
           appropriate exercise of power by the bodies recognising the colleges or granting
           affiliation, like AICTE or university. If in exercise of such power the prescription
           had been made, it cannot be said that the whole matter has been foreclosed.

have any authority to prescribe any norms or even to look into the compliance of

norms fixed by the AICTE, there the matter was relating to colleges governed by

S.V.Pradeep's case was with respect to Engineering Colleges. There is much

difference between the provisions contained in NCTE Act and in AICT Act,

though both are <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_48">Central Act</a>s within the entry 65 of List I. Moreover, in the light

Central statute or the standards laid down by the Central body and that their policy

has to be in conformity with the directives issued by the Central body. It was held

that all these authorities have to work ad idem as they all have a common object to

achieve i.e. imparting of education properly and ensuring maintenance of proper

supervision over the Private Colleges and whether approval from AICTE was

required for the Private Colleges affiliated to a University, conducting MCA and

MBA courses. It was found that AICTE is not intended to be controlling or

supervising authority over the University merely because the University is also

imparting courses of "technical education"; following the judgment in

said that the University has transgressed into the area occupied by the central

enactment.
</p>
<p id="p_89">      52.     In the additional counter affidavit the University stated that the

AICTE or the regional committee did not consult it before approval was granted,

as required in <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_54">Section 10(k)</a>. Though it was vehemently argued by the learned

Counsel for the petitioners that there cannot be any collateral challenge, relying on

various judgments, in view of the contentions raised by some of the petitioners, I

find it necessary to examine whether the University is to be consulted before

granting approval. <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_55">Section 10(k)</a> which relates to the duties of the AICTE reads

as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_90">       "grant approval for starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new
      courses or programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned"
But according to Sri.Krishnamoorthy, 'consultation with agencies' envisaged in

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_56">Section 10(k)</a> would not include the State Government and University. But I find

that the said contention cannot be accepted in view of the findings of the Apex

Court in Adhyaman's case as well as Jaya Gokulam's case. In para. 22 of the

judgment in Jayagokulam (supra) it was found as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">         " As pointed out in T.N. case there were enough provisions in the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_57">Central Act</a> for
      consultation by the Council of AICTE with various agencies, including the State
      Governments and the universities concerned. The State-Level Committee and the
      Central Regional Committees contained various experts and State representatives. In
      case of difference of opinion as between the various consultees, AICTE would have to
      go by the views of the Central Task Force. These were sufficient safeguards for
      ascertaining the views of the State Governments and the universities. No doubt the
      question of affiliation was a different matter and was not covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_58">Central Act</a> but
      in T.N. case it was held that the University could not impose any conditions inconsistent
      with the AICTE Act or its Regulation or the conditions imposed by AICTE.

<p id="p_91">Similarly, it was argued on behalf of some of the petitioners that the objections, if

any, for the University or State Government ought to have been communicated to

the AICTE on receipt of its application within the time permitted under the

Regulations. But under the Regulation 2020, the only provision for the State

Government and University to submit their views is under Clause 6.2 when the

application is for setting up new institutions. None of the petitioners herein have

applied for setting up new institution.
</p>
<p id="p_92">      53.   In the common judgment dated 02.08.2019 in W.P.(C)No.16479 of

2019, I have found that the denial of affiliation was on valid grounds. I have

already found that the factual circumstances which arose and the regulations

considered in Jayagokulam Trust's case were different. There University denied

affiliation for starting new Engineering College for want of permission from the

Government. The State Government did not grant permission on the ground that

there was no requirement of new Engineering colleges. The Apex Court found that

the only provision which requires the involvement of Government is under Statute

9(7) of the Kerala University First Statute and that provision only required the

University to ascertain the "views" of the State Government before granting

affiliation and that cannot be characterized as approval and that in case the Statute

required any such approval, that would be repugnant to <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_59">Section 10(k)</a> of the central

Act. In that case, the Apex court found that there were other provisions available

for resolving the difference of opinion with consultees like State Government,

University etc. by the Task force. However, such provisions are not seen available
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            84</span>


in the Regulations 2020 or the APH 2020-2021. There is no task force also.

Similarly, I have also found that the judgments in <a href="/doc/57339414/" id="a_60">St. Josephs Hospital Trust v.

Kerala University of Health Sciences</a>: 2012 (4) KLT 444 or W.A.No.1485/<a href="/doc/89647955/" id="a_61">2019,

2002 (2) KLT 267 would not be applicable to the factual circumstances of the case.

In these cases also, it is seen that the AICTE has granted approval without insisting

on the requirements they have prescribed in para. 2.15.4(a) and (b) as well as para.

17.7 of the Approval Process Handbook. In the order dated 10.06.2020, except for

the requirement of NOC from State Government, other conditions fixed were in

tune with the parameters fixed by AICTE in the APH. It cannot be said that those

conditions are in conflict with the regulations or APH as insisted by it or that the

University has transgressed into the area occupied by AICTE. However, I am of

the view that much of the confusion could have been avoided in case the AICTE

had drafted the provisions in the APH with a little more care, clarity and

responsibility.

Apex Court considered a case where the College had challenged the affiliation

Regulations of the University, based on which NOC was denied for starting a

Pharmacy College. The Apex Court considered the question whether the

University has got any authority to deny NOC or whether the University is bound

to issue NOC for opening a Pharmacy college and thereby to promote the

mushroom growth of institutions. The University stated that most of the seats

were remaining vacant. After considering the provisions contained in the affiliation

Regulations of the University as well as those in AICTE Regulations and also the

provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_65">State Act</a>, it was found that there is no repugnancy

<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      " xxx The mushroom growth of educational institutionscannot be permitted. The
      observation made by the High Court that unfit institution will automatically shut down
      the courses is not the judicious approach warranted in such matters. It is not only that
      the requirement of the locality should exist but it has to be ensured that only the standard
      educational institutions should come up and once they come up, they should be able to
      survive. A large number of Institutions are not to be opened up to die an unnatural death
      on the principle of survival of the fittest and due to non - availability of teachers /
      students. Standard of education cannot be compromised and sacrificed by permitting
      institutions to come up in a reckless manner without there being any requirement for
      them at a particular place. There is a need to strengthen the existing system of education
      not to make it weak by further complicating the issues by wholly unwarranted approach
      as the one adopted by the High Court. It cannot be left at the choice of the institution to
      open the course whenever or wherever they desire. The High Court has also erred in
      observing that the seats remaining vacant could not be the relevant criteria for refusal of
      NOC.

<p id="p_94">The contention of the college relying on the judgment in Adhiyaman's case,

Jayagokulam Trust case, Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya's

case, Rungta Engineering College, Bhilai's case, was repelled and it was

observed that even in those judgments it was held that                            provisions of the

<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_66">University Act</a> regarding affiliation of technical colleges like the engineering

colleges and the conditions for grant and continuation of such affiliation by the

University shall, however, remain operative but the conditions for affiliation will

have to be in conformity with the norms and guidelines prescribed by the Council

in respect of the matter entrusted to it under S.10 of the AICTE / <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_67">Central Act</a>. In

para. 26 of the judgment it was held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">               26. xxxxA large number of institutions have already been permitted to function
       in the State by the Central Bodies. It is painful to note that at several places mushroom
       growth of the institutions had been permitted by such bodies in an illegal manner. In
       case there is no check or balance and the power is exercised in an unbridled reckless
       manner, the sufferer is going to be the standard of education. At the same time, there is a
       necessity of good institutions with new technology, but at the same time mushroom
       growth of the substandard institutions cannot be permitted. There has to be a
       requirement of educational institutions in the locality and that is one of the main
       considerations.</blockquote><p id="p_95">

</p><p id="p_96">      55.     In the present case, the statement filed by the learned Government

Pleader gives a picture of the deplorable condition of various Engineering Colleges

furnishing the actual intake, pass percentage, etc. Therefore, this Court would

reiterate the following observations in the common judgment dated 02.08.2019 in

W.P.(C) No. 16479 of 2019 and connected cases:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">      "It is also relevant to note that the alarming number of writ petitions coming up before
      this court complaining the lack of infra-structure in professional colleges on account of
      which large number of students are seeking transfer or re-allocation to other colleges
      would show that the anxiety expressed by the Division Benches of this court in 2011 and
      2012 were not misplaced. It is high time the AICTE and other regulatory bodies are to
      take remedial action to protect the student community and to strictly adhere to the
      regulations which are in force. "</blockquote><p id="p_97">



</p><p id="p_98">      56.     As far as the order dated 22.06.2019 issued by the Government is

concerned, NOC would be required only in cases where it is prescribed by the

AICTE. University itself has found that there is no requirement of NOC from the

Government for starting additional courses, when new norms are determined on

24.06.2020. Moreover, it is required under the regulations of AICTE or APH, for

starting new courses or new programmes in existing institution; that being so, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67"> W.P(C).NO.11778/2020 &amp; C/CASES            87</span>


the absence of any provision of law which insists an NOC from the Government

for affiliation of additional courses/new programmes in existing colleges, the

order passed by the Government is unwarranted. It shall therefore stand set aside.

</p><p id="p_99">      57.   By way of Ext.R2(f) which specifically mentions courses also, the

provisions relating to requirement of NOC from the Government has already been

deleted; requirement of NBA Accreditation is seen modified with pass percentage

and academic excellence.         It is seen that some of the Colleges are already

granted affiliation based on NBA accreditation at least in one course; whereas pass

percentage of 50 is insisted for the institution itself. Petitioners have pointed out

several instances where those who got affiliation are having lesser pass percentage.

Therefore, the respondents shall examine whether insisting of pass percentage of

50 for the whole institution would be more onerous than insisting NBA

accreditation in one course and see that one section of colleges is not subjected to

discrimination by adopting different yardsticks for the purpose of affiliation. The

norms are issued in the area which should have been covered by Statutes.

Therefore, whenever such norms are fixed, modified or cancelled, it is only

appropriate that such norms are made known to those concerned by way of orders.

with recommended short and Medium Term Perceptive for Engineering Education

      Electronics Engineering capacity utilization around 40% as opposed to Computer

      This is clear pointer that the demand lies in emerging technologies as opposed to
      traditional Engineering. We recommend that no additional seats are approved in
      Traditional Engineering areas, but institutions need to be encouraged to convert current
      capacity in traditional disciplines to emerging new technologies."</blockquote><p id="p_102">
