     THIS WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION
ON 24.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING:
 WP(C).No.1532 OF 2020(N)

                                3

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The petitioner in this present writ petition, has approached

this Court seeking ventilation of his grievance against the order

of the Pollution Control Board. An appeal preferred under

<a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_1">Section 28</a> of the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974 is stated to be pending before the Appellate Authority

established under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.   The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

petitioner is conducting chicken stall under the name and style

"K.K. Chicken Centre" in the shop bearing No.X/972 of

Koothattukulam Municipality. The aforementioned shop is owned

by his wife by virtue of this writ petition. For running the afore

mentioned business, he had already obtained Trade Licence

from the Municipality, which was valid upto 31.03.2020 and the

licence fee has already been paid. The petitioner submitted an

application to the 1st respondent ie. Pollution Control Board for

consent to operate the chicken stall as it is not situated in a

residential area. The 1st respondent inspected the site and on

being satisfied that the petitioners' stall satisfies the distance

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 4</span>

criteria, issued consent to operate dated 12.07.2019 (Ext.P3).

The 3Rd respondent is the owner of the shop and nursing

rancour against the petitioner, submitted a complaint to the

Pollution Control Board and was astounded to receive the

revocation of the intention notice dated 25.09.2019. The

petitioner submitted an application before the Secretary of the

Municipality under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a>, enquiring as to

the nature of the occupancy of the building door nos.X/950 to

X/990, whether the building is in the immediate vicinity of the

shop room of the petitioner, where the buildings of the

respondent nos.2 and 3 are located. Public Information Officer

issued reply dated 12.11.2019 (Ext.P4) stating that the building

bearing door numbers aforementioned falls into commercial

occupancy.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3.    On receipt of the application, the petitioner submitted

a detailed reply dated 18.10.2019 to revoke intention notice

Ext.P5.   Without   affording   an   opportunity   of   hearing   1 st

respondent revoked the consent by him order dated 04.11.2019

(Ext.P6). The aforementioned order is appealable, but appeal

has been pending for the last two months, no action has been

taken so far. In such circumstances, petitioners' predicament is

writ large.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.      The learned Government Pleader, Sri.Rajasekharan

Nair takes notice on behalf of respondent no.4 and the learned

Standing Counsel, Sri.T.Naveen on behalf of respondent No.1.

</p><p id="p_6">      5.      Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, I

am of the view that inaction on the part of the Appellate

Authority     constituted   under   the   provisions   of   the   Water

(Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_4">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 not only writ

large, but abberative as the mandatory provisions required to

be followed under the Act are not considered. The Judicial

Authorities responsible for these are reluctant to discharge their

obligation, so that this Court is burdened with unnecessary

litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the

matter, I dispose of the writ petition with a direction to the

appellate Authority constituted under <a href="/doc/938094/" id="a_5">Section 28</a> of the Water

Prevention Control of Pollution Act, 1974 to hear the interim

application and appeal so that the petitioner is able to ventilate

his grievance by pointing out the illegalities, if any, referred to
 WP(C).No.1532 OF 2020(N)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>

in the appeal against the impugned order there to. The

appellate Authority would not be precluded from to considering

the interim prayer ex parte as well and take up the interim

application within a period of one week from today. In case,

such interim application is not heard, there shall be an interim

stay of appeal, Ext.P6 during the pendency of appeal.
