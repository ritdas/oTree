R.C. Lahoti, CJI

	These two matters before us raise certain issues of far-
reaching implications in day-to-day life of the people in India 
relatable to noise pollution vis-a-vis right to life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1">Article 
21</a> of the Constitution as interpreted in its wide sweep by the 
constitutional courts of the country.  Though a limited grievance 
was raised to begin with but several intervenors and interlocutory 
applications enhanced the scope of hearing and the cases were 
heard in a very wide perspective centering around <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article 21</a> of the 
Constitution.  Several associated and incidental issues have also 
been gone into.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Facts in W.P.(C) No.72/98
	CWP No. 72/98 is filed by Shri Anil K. Mittal, an engineer by 
profession moving the Court pro bono publico.  The immediate 
provocation for filing the petition was that a 13 year old girl was a 
victim of rape (as reported in newspapers of January 3, 1998).  Her 
cries for help sunk and went unheard due to blaring noise of music 
over loudspeaker in the neighbourhood.  The victim girl, later in the 
evening, set herself ablaze and died of 100% burn injuries.  The 
petition complains of noise created by the use of the loudspeakers 
being used in religious performances or singing bhajans and the like 
in busy commercial localities on the days of weekly offs.  Best 
quality hi-fi audio systems are used.  Open space, meant for use by 
the schools in the locality, is let out for use in marriage functions 
and parties wherein merry making goes on with hi-fi amplifiers and 
loudspeakers without any regard to timings.  Modern residents of 
the locality organize terrace parties for socializing and use high 
capacity stereo systems in abundance.  These are a few instances 
of noise pollution generated much to the chagrin of students taking 
examinations who find it utterly difficult to concentrate on studies 
before and during examinations.  The noise polluters have no 
regard for the inconvenience and discomfort of the people in the 
vicinity.  Noise pollution has had its victims in the past and 
continues to have victims today as well.  The petitioner seeks to 
invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court so that there may not be 
victims of noise pollution in future.  The principal prayer is that the 
existing laws for restricting the use of loudspeakers and other high 
volume noise producing audio-video systems, be directed to be 
rigorously enforced.
</p>
<p id="p_3">Facts in C.A. No.         of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) 
No.21851/03)


Leave granted.
</p>

<p id="p_4">	The Government of India framed and published Noise 
Pollution Control and Regulation Rules, 1999.  On 11.10.2002 the 
Government of India brought in an amendment in the Rules.  The 
amendment empowered the State Government to permit use of 
loudspeaker or public address system during night hours (between 
10 pm and 12 pm mid-night) on or during the cultural or religious 
occasions for a limited period not exceeding 15 days.  Vires of this 
amendment were put in issue by the appellant submitting that the 
provision is not accompanied by any guidelines and is capable of 
being misused to such an extent that the whole purpose behind 
enacting the Rules itself may be defeated.  The High Court of Kerala 
found the petition devoid of any merit and directed the petition to 
be dismissed.  Feeling aggrieved, this petition has been filed by 
special leave.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	The special leave petition and, in particular, the writ petition 
raise issues of wide ranging dimensions relating to noise pollution 
and the implications thereof.  Taking cognizance of the matters as 
public interest litigation, the Court vide its order dated 6.4.98, 
directed the cause title of the petition filed by Shri Anil Kumar Mittal 
to be amended as "In re. Noise PollutionImplementation of the 
Laws for Restricting Voice of Loudspeakers and High Volume 
Producing Sound System".  The Court also appointed Shri Jitender 
Sharma, Senior Advocate and Shri Pankaj Kalra, Advocate to 
appear as Amicus Curiae.  Both the learned counsel were present in 
the Court and accepted the assignment.  Unfortunately, Shri Pankaj 
Kalra, Advocate expired during the pendency of the proceedings.  
Shri Sandeep Narayan, Advocate has appeared in his place and 
assisted the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	The Union of India and the Central Pollution Control Board 
have not opposed the prayer made in the writ petition and the 
appeal and have rather supported the writ petitioner.  Valuable 
inputs have been provided by the Central Pollution Control Board in 
the form of pleadings, authentic publications, research documents 
and other papers.  The Union of India, while not opposing the relief 
sought for by the petitioner, has pointed out several practical 
difficulties in completely regulating and where necessary, 
eliminating noise pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	Though, as we have already noted, the sweep of hearing in 
these matters has been very wide, the principal thrust of the writ 
petitioner and the learned Amicus has been directed towards noise 
created by firecrackers, loudspeakers used __  by political parties, at 
religious places and on religious and social occasions or festivals.   
Hindu Bokta Jana Sabai, Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces 
Manufacturers Association, Universal Society Performance, All India 
Federation of Fireworks Association, Indian Fireworks Manufacturers 
Association and some individuals have sought for interventions.  It 
is not necessary to notice the contents of the intervention 
applications in detail.  Suffice it to say that the reliefs sought for in 
the applications are conflicting.  Some of the intervenors have 
sought for:-
</p><p id="p_8">(i)	noise created by horns of engines, pressure horns in 
automobiles, loudspeakers, denting painting of cars, 
particularly, in residential areas and from unauthorized 
premises being prohibited;
</p>
<p id="p_9">(ii)	use of loudspeakers in religious places such as temples, 
mosque, churches, gurudwaras and other places being 
discontinued or at least regulated;
</p>
<p id="p_10">(iii)	firecrackers burst during Diwali festival and on other 
occasions for fun or merry making being prohibited 
completely, if the noise created exceeds certain decibels and 
being so regulated as to prevent bursting during night hours.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">Other set of intervenors seeks such like reliefs:-
</p><p id="p_12">(i) 	granting exemption in favour of bursting of firecrackers 
on or during festivals without regard to the limit of time as 
such bursting of firecrackers is associated with the 
performance of ceremonies relating to religion or social 
occasions;
</p>
<p id="p_13">(ii)	laying down mechanism for regulating the very 
manufacturing of firecrackers so that such firecrackers as 
unreasonably enhance noise pollution may be kept away from 
entering the markets and playing into the hands of the 
people.
</p>
<p id="p_14"> 	It is obvious that during the course of the hearing the scope 
got enlarged and the Court has been addressed on very many 
issues from very many angles.
</p>
<p id="p_15">	<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">Article 21</a> of the Constitution guarantees life and personal 
liberty to all persons.  It is well settled by repeated 
pronouncements of this Court as also the High Courts that right to 
life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> is not of mere survival or existence.  It 
guarantees a right of persons to life with human dignity.  Therein 
are included, all the aspects of life which go to make a person's life 
meaningful, complete and worth living.  The human life has its 
charm and there is no reason why the life should not be enjoyed 
along with all permissible pleasures.  Anyone who wishes to live in 
peace, comfort and quiet within his house has a right to prevent the 
noise as pollutant reaching him.  Noone can claim a right to create 
noise even in his own premises which would travel beyond his 
precincts and cause nuisance to neighbours or others.  Any noise 
which has the effect of materially interfering with the ordinary 
comforts of life judged by the standard of a reasonable man is 
nuisance.  How and when a nuisance created by noise becomes 
actionable has to be answered by reference to its degree and the 
surrounding circumstances, the place and the time. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">	Those who make noise often take shelter behind <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_5">Article 
19(1)</a>A pleading freedom of speech and right to expression.  
Undoubtedly, the freedom of speech and right to expression are 
fundamental rights but the rights are not absolute.  Nobody can 
claim a fundamental right to create noise by amplifying the sound 
of his speech with the help of loudspeakers.  While one has a right 
to speech, others have a right to listen or decline to listen.  Nobody 
can be compelled to listen and nobody can claim that he has a right 
to make his voice trespass into the ears or mind of others.  Nobody 
can indulge into aural aggression.  If anyone increases his volume 
of speech and that too with the assistance of artificial devices so as 
to compulsorily expose unwilling persons to hear a noise raised to 
unpleasant or obnoxious levels then the person speaking is violating 
the right of others to a peaceful, comfortable and pollution-free life 
guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21.</a>  <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_7">Article 19(1)</a>A cannot be pressed into 
service for defeating the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 
</p><p id="p_17">21.  We need not further dwell on this aspect.  Two decisions in this 
regard delivered by High Courts have been brought to our notice 
wherein the right to live in an atmosphere free from noise pollution 
has been upheld as the one guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_8">Article 21</a> of the 
Constitution.  These decisions are Free Legal Aid Cell Shri Sugan 
Chand Aggarwal alias Bhagatji v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and 
others, AIR (2001) Delhi 455 (D.B.) and <a href="/doc/1220539/" id="a_9">P.A. Jacob v. 
Superintendent of Police, Kottayam</a>, AIR (1993) Kerala 1.  We 
have carefully gone through the reasoning adopted in the two 
decisions and the principle of law laid down therein, in particular, 
the exposition of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.  We find ourselves 
in entire agreement therewith.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	The present cases provide an opportunity for examining 
several questions, such as what is noise?  What are its adverse 
effects? Whether noise pollution runs in conflict with the 
fundamental rights of the people? And what relief can be allowed by 
way of directions issued in public interest?
</p>
<p id="p_19">I
Noise  what it is?
</p>
<p id="p_20"> 	The word noise is derived from the Latin term "nausea". It 
has been defined as "unwanted sound, a potential hazard to health 
and communication dumped into the environment with regard to 
the adverse effect it may have on unwilling ears." 
</p>
<p id="p_21"> 	Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Sound which pleases the 
listeners is music and that which causes pain and annoyance is 
noise. At times, what is music for some can be noise for others . 
</p>
<p id="p_22"> 	<a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_11">Section 2(a)</a> of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_12">Control of Pollution) 
Act</a>, 1981, includes noise in the definition of 'air pollutant'.  
</p>
<p id="p_23"> 	<a href="/doc/152587107/" id="a_13">Section 2(a)</a>  "air pollutant" means any solid, liquid or 
gaseous substance including noise present in the atmosphere in 
such concentration as may be or tend to be injurious to human 
beings or other living creatures or plants or property or 
environment. 
</p>
<p id="p_24"> 	According to Encyclopaedia Britannica : "In acoustics noise is 
defined as any undesired sound." 
</p>
<p id="p_25"> 	According to Chambers 20th Century Dictionary , noise 
means  Sound especially of loud, harsh or confused kind;  a 
sound of any kind;  an over loud or disturbing sound; frequent or 
public talk. 
</p>
<p id="p_26"> 	In Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, the definition of noise 
has undergone a change.  Noise pollution stands carved out as a 
phrase separately from noise.  The two are defined as under :
</p>
<p id="p_27">"Noise  a sound; a harsh disagreeable sound, or such sound; a 
din. pollution  an excessive or annoying degree of noise in a 
particular area, e.g. from traffic or aeroplane engines." 
</p>
<p id="p_28"> 	"Pollution" is a noun derived from the verb "pollute". <a href="/doc/70356524/" id="a_14">Section 
2(c)</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 defines 
"environmental pollution" to mean the presence in the environment 
of any environmental pollutant. <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_15">Section 2</a> (b) of the said Act defines 
"environmental pollutant" to mean any solid, liquid or gaseous 
substance present in such concentration as may be, or tends to be 
injurious to environment. 
</p><p id="p_29"> 	Thus, the disturbance produced in our environment by the 
undesirable sound of various kinds is called " noise pollution".
</p>

<p id="p_30">II
Noise as nuisance and health hazard

 	Noise is more than just a nuisance. It constitutes a real and 
present danger to people's health. Day and night, at home, at work, 
and at play, noise can produce serious physical and psychological 
stress. Noone is immune to this stress. Though we seem to adjust 
to noise by ignoring it, the ear, in fact, never closes and the body 
still responds-sometimes with extreme tension, as to a strange 
sound in the night.
</p>
<p id="p_31"> 	Noise is a type of atmospheric pollution. It is a shadowy 
public enemy whose growing menace has increased in the modern 
age of industrialization and technological advancement. Although a 
soft rhythmic sound in the form of music and dance stimulates 
brain activities, removes boredom and fatigue, but its 
excessiveness may prove detrimental to living things. Researches 
have proved that a loud noise during peak marketing hours creates 
tiredness, irritation and impairs brain activities so as to reduce 
thinking and working abilities. Noise pollution was previously 
confined to a few special areas like factory or mill, but today it 
engulfs every nook and corner of the globe, reaching its peak in 
urban areas. Industries, automobiles, rail engines, aeroplanes, 
radios, loudspeakers, tape recorders, lottery ticket sellers, hawkers, 
pop singers, etc., are the main ear contaminators of the city area 
and its market place. The regular rattling of engines and 
intermittent blowing of horns emanating from the caravan of 
automobiles do not allow us to have any respite from irritant noise 
even in suburban zones .     
</p>
<p id="p_32"> 	In the modern days noise has become one of the major 
pollutants and it has serious effects on human health. Effects of 
noise depend upon sound's pitch, its frequency and time pattern 
and length of exposure. Noise has both auditory and non-auditory 
effects depending upon the intensity and the duration of the noise 
level.  It affects sleep, hearing, communication, mental and 
physical health. It may even lead to the madness of people. 
</p>
<p id="p_33"> 	However, noises, which are melodious, whether natural or 
man-made, cannot always be considered as factors leading to 
pollution. 
</p>
<p id="p_34"> 	Noise can disturb our work, rest, sleep, and communication. 
It can damage our hearing and evoke other psychological, and 
possibly pathological reactions. However, because of complexity, 
variability and the interaction of noise with other environmental 
factors, the adverse health effects of noise do not lend themselves 
to a straightforward analysis . 
</p>

<p id="p_35">Hearing Loss

"Deafness, like poverty, stunts and deadens its victims."- says 
Helen Keller. Hearing loss can be either temporary or permanent. 
Noise-induced temporary threshold shift (NITTS) is a temporary 
loss of hearing acuity experienced after a relatively short exposure 
to excessive noise. Pre-exposure hearing is recovered fairly rapidly 
after cessation of the noise. Noise induced permanent threshold 
shift (NIPTS) is an irreversible loss of hearing that is caused by 
prolonged noise exposure. Both kinds of loss together with 
presbyacusis, the permanent hearing impairment that is 
attributable to the natural aging process, can be experienced 
simultaneously .  
</p>
<p id="p_36"> 	NIPTS occurs typically at high frequencies, usually with a 
maximum loss at around 4,000 Hz. It is now accepted that the risk 
of hearing loss is negligible at noise exposure levels of less than 75 
dB(A) Leq (8-hr). Based on national judgments concerning 
acceptable risk, many countries have adopted industrial noise 
exposure limits of 85 dB(A) +5 dB(A) in their regulations and 
recommended practices .   [N.B.- Hz. is abbreviation of Hertz which 
is the unit of frequency, equal to one cycle per second.  Hertz (Hz) 
is the name, by international agreement, for the number of 
repetitions of similar pressure variations per second of time; this 
unit of frequency was previously called "cycles per second" (cps or 
c/s)].
</p> 
<p id="p_37">Interference with Communication 
 	The interference of noise with speech communication is a 
process in which one of two simultaneous sounds renders the other 
inaudible. An important aspect of communication interference in 
occupational situations is that the failure of workers to hear warning 
signals or shouts may lead to injury. In offices, schools and homes, 
speech interference is a major source of annoyance . 
</p>

<p id="p_38">Disturbance of sleep.

<p id="p_39"> 	Noise intrusion can cause difficulty in falling asleep and can 
awaken people who are asleep . 
</p>

<p id="p_40">Annoyance

 	Noise annoyance may be defined as a feeling of displeasure 
evoked by noise. The annoyance inducing capacity of a noise 
depends upon many of its physical characteristics and variations of 
these with time. However, annoyance reactions are sensitive to 
many non-acoustic factors of a social, psychological, or economic 
nature and there are considerable differences in individual reactions 
to the same noise .
</p>

<p id="p_41">Effect on performance
 	Noise can change the state of alertness of an individual and 
may increase or decrease efficiency. Performance of tasks involving 
motor or monotonous activities is not always degraded by noise. At 
the other extreme, mental activities involving vigilance, information 
gathering and analytical processes appear to be particularly 
sensitive to noise . 
</p>
<p id="p_42">Physiological Effects

 	It has been determined that noise has an explicit effect on the 
blood vessels, especially the smaller ones known as pre-capillaries. 
Overall, noise makes these blood vessels narrower. Noise causes 
the peripheral blood vessels in the toes, fingers, skin and abdominal 
organs to constrict, thereby decreasing the amount of blood 
normally supplied to these areas . 
</p>
<p id="p_43"> 	Possible clinical manifestations of stress concomitant with 
noise are : (i) galvanic skin response, (ii) increased activity related 
to ulcer formation, (iii)changes in intestinal motility, (iv)changes in 
skeletal muscle tension, (v) subjective response irritability 
perception of loudness, (vi)increased sugar, cholesterol &amp; 
adrenaline, (vii)changes in heart rate, (viii)increased blood 
pressure, (ix) increased adrenal hormones, (x)vasoconstriction. Not 
only might there be harmful consequences to health during the 
state of alertness, but research also suggests effects may occur 
when the body is unaware or asleep.  (Source; NOISE EFFECTS 
HANDBOOK, A Desk Reference to Health and Welfare Effects of 
Noise By Office of the Scientific Assistant, Office of Noise 
Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
October 1979, Revised July 1981)

 	The investigations have revealed that the blood vessels which 
feed the brain, dilate in the presence of noise. This is the reason 
why headaches result from listening to persistent high noise .  
</p>
<p id="p_44"> 	Field studies have also been conducted on various other 
groups such as people living near airports, and school children 
exposed to traffic noise,  showing that there may be some risk for 
these people. In addition, laboratory studies on animals and 
humans have demonstrated a relationship between noise and high 
blood pressure. Other studies have shown that noise can induce 
heart attacks . 
</p>
<p id="p_45"> 	Prolonged chronic noise can also produce stomach ulcers as it 
may reduce the flow of gastric juice and change its acidity. 
</p>
<p id="p_46">With what other stress effects can noise be associated?  
</p>
<p id="p_47"> 	Stress can be manifested in any number of ways, including 
headaches, irritability, insomnia, digestive disorders, and 
psychological disorders. Workers who are exposed to excessive 
noise frequently complain that noise just makes them tired.
</p>
<p id="p_48"> 	Quite a few field studies have been done on workers in 
Europe, examining the relationship between noise and illness. In 
these studies, noise has been related to the following:
</p>
<p id="p_49">General morbidity (illness);  Neuropsychological disturbances___ 
Headaches, Fatigue, Insomnia, Irritability, Neuroticism; 
Cardiovascular system disturbances___ Hypertension, Hypotension, 
cardiac disease; Digestive disorders___ Ulcers, Colitis; Endocrine and 
biochemical disorders;
</p>
<p id="p_50">Noise and the unborn. 
</p>
<p id="p_51"> 	There is ample evidence that environment has a role in 
shaping the physique, behavior and function of animals, including 
men, from conception and not merely from birth. The fetus is 
capable of perceiving sounds and responding to them by motor 
activity and cardiac rate change .
</p>
<p id="p_52">Special Effects on unborn, children and human beings 
generally

 	The fetus is not fully protected from noise.  Noise may 
threaten fetal development.  Noise has been linked to low birth 
weights. Levels of noise which do not interfere with the perception 
of speech by adults may interfere significantly with the perception 
of speech by children as well as with the acquisition of speech, 
language, and language-related skills.  Because they are just 
learning, children have more difficulty in understanding language in 
the presence of noise than adults do. Reading ability also may be 
seriously impaired by noise.  Apart from children, the noise 
pollution causes several adverse effects on human beings generally.  
Some of these are: (i) hearing loss, (ii) nonauditory physiological 
response such as stress, arousal response, cardiovascular effects 
etc.,(iii) communication interference, (iv) performance interference, 
and (v) sleep disturbance and so on. 
</p>

<p id="p_53">III
Sources of Noise Pollution.
</p>

<p id="p_54"> 	Noise pollution like other pollutants is also a by-product of 
industrialization, urbanization and modern civilization. 
</p>
<p id="p_55"> 	Broadly speaking, the noise pollution has two sources, i.e. 
industrial and non-industrial. The industrial source includes the 
noise from various industries and big machines working at a very 
high speed and high noise intensity. Non-industrial source of noise 
includes the noise created by transport/vehicular traffic and the 
neighbourhood noise generated by various noise pollution can also 
be divided into the categories, namely, natural and manmade.  
</p>
<p id="p_56"> 	Most leading noise sources will fall into the following 
categories: road traffic, aircraft, railroads, construction, industry, 
noise in buildings, and consumer products. 
</p>
<p id="p_57">1. 	Road traffic noise

 	Noise from the motors and exhaust systems of large trucks 
provides the major portion of highway noise impact, and provides a 
potential noise hazard to the driver as well. In addition, noise from 
the interaction of tyres with the roadway is generated by trucks, 
buses, and private autos.
</p>


<p id="p_58"> 	In the city, the main sources of traffic noise are the motors 
and exhaust systems of autos, smaller trucks, buses, and 
motorcycles. This type of noise can be augmented by narrow 
streets and tall buildings, which produce a "canyon" in which traffic 
noise reverberates.
</p>
<p id="p_59">2. 	Aircraft noise

 	Nowadays, the problem of low-flying military aircraft has 
added a new dimension to community annoyance, as the nation 
seeks to improve its "nap-of-the-earth" warfare capabilities. In 
addition, the issue of aircraft operations over national parks, 
wilderness areas, and other areas previously unaffected by aircraft 
noise has claimed national attention over recent years. 
</p>
<p id="p_60">3.  	Noise from railroads

 	The noise from locomotive engines, horns and whistles, and 
switching and shunting operations in rail yards can impact 
neighbouring communities and railroad workers. For example, rail 
car retarders can produce a high-frequency, high-level screech that 
can reach peak levels of 120 dB at a distance of 100 feet which 
translates to levels as high as 138 or 140 dB at the railroad 
worker's ear.
</p>

<p id="p_61">4. 	Construction noise

 	The noise from construction of highways, city streets, and 
buildings is a major contributor to the urban scene. Construction 
noise sources include pneumatic hammers, air compressors, 
bulldozers, loaders, dumptrucks (and their back-up signals), and 
pavement breakers. 
</p>
<p id="p_62">5. 	Noise in industry

 	Although industrial noise is one of the less prevalent 
community noise problems, neighbours of noisy manufacturing 
plants can be disturbed by sources such as fans, motors, and 
compressors mounted on the outside of buildings. Interior noise can 
also be transmitted to the community through open windows and 
doors, and even through building walls. These interior noise sources 
have significant impacts on industrial workers, among whom noise-
induced hearing loss is unfortunately common.
</p>
<p id="p_63">6. 	Noise in buildings

 	Apartment dwellers are often annoyed by noise in their 
homes, especially when the building is not well designed and 
constructed. In this case, internal building noise from plumbing, 
boilers, generators, air conditioners, and fans, can be audible and 
annoying. Improperly insulated walls and ceilings can reveal the 
sound of amplified music, voices, footfalls, and noisy activities from 
neighbouring units. External noise from emergency vehicles, traffic, 
refuse collection, and other city noises can be a problem for urban 
residents, especially when windows are open or insufficiently 
glazed. 
</p>
<p id="p_64">7. 	Noise from consumer products

 	Certain household equipment, such as vacuum cleaners and 
some kitchen appliances have been and continue to be 
noisemakers, although their contribution to the daily noise dose is 
usually not very large. 
</p>
<p id="p_65">IV
Noise pollution in the special context of Fireworks.
</p>

<p id="p_66"> 	Fireworks are used all over the world to celebrate special 
occasions. In India, fireworks are burst on festivals like Dussehra, 
Diwali and on special occasions like social gatherings, marriages, 
Independence day, Republic day, New year day, etc. In other 
countries of the world, fireworks are generally burst either on the 
New Year day or on the birthday of their respective countries. 
However, bursting of firecrackers is a health hazard since it is 
responsible for both air pollution and noise pollution .   
</p>
<p id="p_67"> 	The use of Fireworks has led to air pollution in the form of 
noise and smoke. Their excessive use has started to be a public 
hazard and violation of their fundamental rights as enshrined in the 
Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_68"> 	It has been held in the case of  "<a href="/doc/1347766/" id="a_16">Om Birangana Religious 
Society v. State</a>, 100 CWN 617"  that the "Freedom of speech and 
expression guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_17">Article 19(1)(a)</a>  of the Constitution of 
India includes, by necessary implication, freedom not to listen  
and/or to remain silent. A citizen has a right to leisure, right to 
sleep, right not to hear and right to remain silent.  He also has the 
right to read and speak with others". Because of the tremendous 
sound and noise, the citizens cannot exercise all these fundamental 
rights. 
</p>
<p id="p_69"> 	It has been seen that firecrackers noise is an impulsive noise 
and is hazardous. Bursting of a firecracker near the ear can lead 
sometimes to non-recoverable hearing loss. 
</p>
<p id="p_70"> 	Diwali is the most important festival of India. The bursting of 
firecrackers during this period is a wide spread practice. The 
unpredictable, intermittent and impulsive noise produced by 
bursting of crackers all around, turns the festival of lights into 
cacophony of noise.  People are unable to even sleep due to this 
excessive noise pollution. Several people are injured due to the 
noise produced by firecrackers every year. 
</p>
<p id="p_71"> 	Firecrackers not only increase the ambient noise level but also 
contribute significantly in increasing the air pollution by means of 
toxic gases and particles due to their blast wave resulting from a 
rapid release of energy.
</p>
<p id="p_72"> 	In order to assess the situation of noise pollution caused by 
Firecrackers at the time of Diwali the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB) has been conducting ambient noise level monitoring 
during Diwali festival regularly at various locations in Delhi since 
1993, to find increased ambient noise level caused by intensive 
burning of crackers. As in the past, the noise and air quality 
monitoring have been carried out in the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 
and 2002. The noise monitoring locations have been selected to 
cover almost all areas of Delhi .
</p>
<p id="p_73"> 	An analysis of the reports prepared in the years 1999, 2000, 
2001, and 2002 reveals that the ambient noise level on Diwali day 
exceeded the limit at almost all the places during these years. The 
noise level was higher during Diwali-2000 as compared to the 
values recorded during Diwali festival in the years 1999, 2001, and 
2002 .
</p>
<p id="p_74"> 	The percentage of violation in L.eq. noise level varied from 02 
to 49%  in the year 2002, 12 to 55% in the year 2001, 11 to 58% 
in the year 2000 and 22 to 47% in the year 1999 with respect to 
the day time standards at all the areas . [N.B.  Equivalent 
Continuous Sound Pressure Level, Leq is the level of that steady 
sound which over the same interval of time, contains the same total 
energy (or dose) as the fluctuating sound.  Equivalent continuous 
sound level has gained widespread acceptance as a scale for the 
measurement of long-term noise exposure.]

 	The ambient noise level conducted during the years 1999 to 
2002 on Diwali festival, exceeded the limit at all places in every 
year and the percentage of violation varies from 2% to 58% .
</p>
<p id="p_75"> 	Thus, the study does reveal that the noise levels that have 
been measured on all these occasions have been more than the 
prescribed norms. This is a point of worry as it has been discussed 
that noise pollution does tend to have adverse effects on a person. 
Thus immediate steps in this direction need to be taken. 
</p>
<p id="p_76"> 	The problem of noise pollution due to firecrackers is not only 
limited to India. Similar problems are being experienced in other 
countries as well. In fact in United Kingdom, in Nottingham the "Be 
Safe Not Sorry" campaign was launched after the post was 
inundated with letters from readers to the newspaper saying they 
were fed up with the noise, nuisance and the distress that fireworks 
cause. 
</p>

<p id="p_77">V
Methodology adopted in other countries for noise pollution 
control.
</p>
        
<p id="p_78"> 	Different countries of the World have enacted different 
legislations to control the noise pollution. For Example, in England 
there is a Noise Abetment Act, 1960 <a href="/doc/185391508/" id="a_18">Section 2</a> of this Act provides 
that loudspeakers should not be operated between the hours of 
9:00 in the evening and 8:00 in the following morning for any 
purpose and at any other time for purpose of advertisement and 
entertainment, trade or business. Control on <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_19">Pollution Act</a> of 1974, 
contains provisions for controlling noise pollution and it provides 
noise to be actionable must amount to nuisance in the ordinary 
legal sense. Section 62 of the English Control of Pollution Act, 1974, 
operates as perfect control for 'Street Noise'. This provision has 
been defined as a highway and any other road, footway or square 
or court which is for the time being open to public. In Japan there is 
Anti Pollution Basic Law, which helps to control the pollution 
including noise pollution. 
</p>
<p id="p_79"> 	A few of the notable legislations may be mentioned 
illustratively. 
</p>
<p id="p_80"><a href="/doc/117232455/" id="a_20">Noise Act</a> 1996- U.K. 
</p>

at night; about the forfeiture and confiscation of equipment used to 
make noise unlawfully; and for connected purposes. The kind of 
complaint referred to is one made by any individual present in a 
dwelling during night hours  that excessive noise is being emitted 
from another dwelling. "Night hours" means the period beginning 
with 11p.m. and ending with 7 a.m.  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_22">The Act</a> provides for the 
service of a notice on the offender by the prescribed officer if he 
thinks that the noise being emitted is more than the permissible 
limits. 
</p>
<p id="p_82"> 	In cases where the noise level does not come down in spite of 
the notice being served, the officer can seize such equipments 
which in his opinion are the source of such noise. 
</p>
<p id="p_83">Noise and Statutory Nuisance Act 1993 

 	<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_23">An Act</a> to make provision for noise in a street to be a

Australia

 	In New South Wales (NSW) no single government authority 
has the responsibility or capacity to be able to minimise all forms of 
noise pollution. The State is excluded from control of noise in a 
number of areas by commonwealth legislation. These include 
aircraft noise, where noise limits could affect trade, and the setting 
standards for noise emissions from new vehicles. In areas where 
the State does have powers to control noise the Environment 
Protection Authority (EPA) has an overall responsibility for 
environmental noise (as distinct from occupational noise), under 
the <a href="/doc/117232455/" id="a_25">Noise Control Act</a> 1975. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_26">The Act</a> deals with the prevention, 
minimisation and abatement of noise and vibration and empowers 
the EPA, the Waterways Authority, local government and the police 
for these purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_115"> 	The EPA controls noise from scheduled premises those 
required by the <a href="/doc/117232455/" id="a_27">Noise Control Act</a> to have a licence and noise 
associated with rail traffic and the construction or upgrading of 
freeways and toll roads. The Police and local council are generally 
responsible for neighbourhood noise issues and have authority to 
issue noise abatement directions to control noise from premises and 
for noise from burglar alarms. Local council have an essential role 
in minimising the effects of excessive noise, particularly in their 
local residential areas, from smaller factories, non-scheduled 
premises and public places. The Waterways Authority has specific 
responsibilities in relation to noise from vessels in navigable waters. 
</p>
<p id="p_116"> 	Under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/117232455/" id="a_28">Noise Control Act</a> 1975 in NSW 
the railway system is classified as scheduled premises and as such 
the EPA has a regulatory role, and seeks to achieve noise targets 
for rail operations throughout the State to minimise the impact on 
local residents. 
</p>
<p id="p_117"> 	The EPA issues licences for the management of scheduled 
premises. When issuing a licence the EPA sets initial noise limits 
that are achievable with the operation of plant and equipment 
currently installed, operated and maintained effectively. To achieve 
further improvements in noise exposure to residents, negotiations 
with the licensed premises are carried out and can be incorporated 
in the licence as Pollution Reduction Programs (PRPs). The EPA is 
currently working with industry to reduce noise levels from major 
sources.
</p>
<p id="p_118"> 	The Noise Control (Miscellaneous Articles) Regulation 1995 
was introduced to cover community noise issues not covered by 
previous legislation. It includes limitations on burglar alarms for 
both residential and commercial premises. Changes have been 
made to the night-time control of common domestic noise sources 
such as power tools, air conditioners, amplified music and lawn 
mowers. Under the new regulation only one warning to the offender 
is required and the warning is valid for 28 days. If an offence is 
committed within this period a fine can be issued without further 
warnings. The previous regulation warning was only active for 12 
hours which meant it was not very effective with repetitious 
offences typical in suburban areas. 
</p>
<p id="p_119"> 	The Noise Control (Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle 
Accessories) Regulation 1995 controls the noise of individual motor 
vehicles. It includes a provision to control noise from a range of

systems. It also places responsibility to ensure compliance of 
repairs/modifications of vehicles on the vehicle repairers.

<p id="p_121">Montgomery County Noise Control Ordinance

 	The Montgomery County Noise Control Ordinance allows for 
normal activities during regular hours; however, it does attempt to 
eliminate interference from noise when most of us want to rest and 
relax. It also seeks to control disturbing and unhealthy levels of 
noise in general. Key provisions of the Noise Control Ordinance: 
</p><p id="p_122">(i)   Provide day/night sound level limits. 
</p><p id="p_123">(ii)  Establish "quiet hours." 
</p><p id="p_124">(iii) Define sounds that constitute noise disturbances.
</p><p id="p_125">(iv) Establish a "nuisance provision" that prohibits certain noises at 
any time. 
</p><p id="p_126"> 	A noise disturbance, as defined by the ordinance, is any 
sound that is unpleasant, annoying, or loud; abnormal for the time 
or location; and prejudicial to health, comfort, property, or the 
conduct of business. Under the ordinance, it is unlawful to create a 
noise disturbance anywhere during "quiet hours," including multi-
family buildings and townhouses. The "nuisance provision" prohibits 
some noise disturbances anywhere at any time.
</p>
<p id="p_127"> 	The Montgomery County Noise Control Ordinance promotes 
peace and quiet for everyone by covering a wide variety of 
residential and business situations. The Ordinance does not cover 
noise from aircraft and railroads or motor vehicles on public 
roadways, as Federal and State governments supersede local 
regulation. Also exempt are emergency operations by public 
utilities.
</p>
<p id="p_128"> 	Among other provisions, the Montgomery County Noise 
Control Ordinance makes it illegal to: 
</p><p id="p_129">(i) 	Operate, or allow to be operated, a radio, television, or other

Statutory Laws in India

 	Not that the Legislature and the Executive in India are 
completely unmindful of the menace of noise pollution.  Laws have 
been enacted and the Rules have been framed by the Executive for 
carrying on the purposes of the legislation. The real issue is with 
the implementation of the laws.  What is needed is the will to 
implement the laws.  It would be useful to have a brief resume of  
some of the laws which are already available on the Statute Book. 
Treatment of the problem of noise pollution can be dealt under the 
Law of Crimes and Civil Law. Civil law can be divided under two 
heads (i) The Law of Torts (ii) The General Civil Law. The cases 
regarding noise have not come before the law courts in large 
quantity. The reason behind this is that many people in India did 
not consider noise as a sort of pollution and they are not very much 
conscious about the evil consequences of noise pollution. The level 
of noise pollution is relative and depends upon a person and a 
particular place. The law will not take care of a super sensitive 
person but the standard is of an average and rational human being 
in the society. 
</p>
<p id="p_137">The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000

 	In order to curb the growing problem of noise pollution, the 
Government of India has enacted the Noise Pollution(Regulation 
and Control) Rules, 2000. Prior to the enactment of these rules 
noise pollution was not being dealt specifically by a particular Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_138">"Whereas the increasing ambient noise levels in public places 
from various sources, inter-alia, industrial activity, 
construction activity, generator sets, loudspeakers, public 
address systems, music systems, vehicular horns and other 
mechanical devices, have deleterious effects on human health 
and the psychological well being of the people; it is 
considered necessary to regulate and control noise producing 
and generating sources with the objective of maintaining the 
ambient air quality standard in respect of noise;"     
</p>
<p id="p_139"> 	The main  provisions of the noise rules are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_140">1.	The State Government may categorize the areas into 
industrial, commercial, residential or silence areas/zones for the 
purpose of implementation of noise standards for different areas.
</p>
<p id="p_141">2. 	The ambient air quality standards in respect of noise for 
different areas/zones has been specified for in the Schedule 
annexed to the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_142">3.	The State Government shall take measures for abatement of 
noise including noise emanating from vehicular movements and 
ensure that the existing noise levels do not exceed the ambient air 
quality standards specified under these rules.
</p> 
<p id="p_143">4.	An area comprising not less than 100 meters around 
hospitals, educational institutions and courts may be declared as 
silence area/zone for the purpose of these rules. 
</p>
<p id="p_144">5.	A loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used 
except after obtaining written permission from the authority and 
the same shall not be used at night i.e. between 10.00p.m. and 
6.00 a.m.

</p><p id="p_145">6.	A person found violating the provisions as to the maximum 
noise permissible in any particular area shall be liable to be 
punished for it as per the provisions of these rules and any other 
law in force.

Punjab 11, accused/petitioner was convicted and sentenced under 
<a href="/doc/1099867/" id="a_49">Section 290</a> of Indian Penal Code 1860 and was fined Rs. 50 for 
causing noise and emitting smoke and vibrations by operating of 
heavy machinery in the residential area. The orders of the trial 
court was upheld by the District Magistrate in appeal. The High 
Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana also upheld the decision of the courts 
below and dismissed the revision petition. In the case of <a href="/doc/1161672/" id="a_50">Bhuban 
Ram &amp; Ors. v. Bibhuti Bhushan Biswas</a> AIR 1919 Calcutta 539,

causes nuisance by noise and the occupier was held liable to be 
punished under <a href="/doc/1099867/" id="a_51">Section 290</a> IPC. In  Ivour Heyden v. State of

is very much polluted from indiscriminating noise 
emitted from different quarters and on research it was 
found that persons who are staying near the Airport, 
are becoming victim of various ailments. Such persons

research it was also found that workers in various 
factories even become deaf and hard of hearing. It was 
further found on such research that as a result of this 
excessive noise pollution, people suffer from loss of 
appetite, depression, mental restlessness and insomnia. 
People also suffer from complain of excessive blood 
pressure and heart trouble. It is not necessary to go 
into the question about direct effect of such noise 
pollution because of indiscriminate and illegal use of 
such electric and air horn as it is an admitted position

silence.  It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to 
listen.  The right comprehends freedom to be free from what one 
desires to be free from.  Free speech is not to be treated as a 
promise to everyone with opinions and beliefs, to gather at any 
place and at any time and express their views in any manner.  The 
right is subordinate to peace and order.  A person can decline to 
read a publication, or switch off a radio or a television set.  But, he 
cannot prevent the sound from a loudspeaker reaching him.  He 
could be forced to hear what, he wishes not, to hear.  That will be 
an invasion of his right to be let alone, to hear what he wants to 
hear, or not to hear, what he does not wish to hear.  One may put 
his mind or hearing to his own uses, but not that of another.  
Noone has a right to trespass on the mind or ear of another and 
commit auricular or visual aggression.  A loudspeaker is mechanical 
device, and it has no mind or thought process in it.  Recognition of 
the right of speech or expression is recognition accorded to a 
human faculty.   A right belongs to human personality, and not to a 
mechanical device.  One may put his faculties to reasonable uses.  
But, he cannot put his machines to any use he likes.  He cannot use 
his machines to injure others.  Intervention with a machine, is not 
intervention with, or invasion of a human faculty or right.  No 
mechanical device can be upgraded to a human faculty.  A 
computer or a robot cannot be conceded the right under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_63">Art. 19 
(though they may be useful to man to express his faculties).</a>  No 
more, a loudspeaker.  The use of a loudspeaker may be incidental

part of the right".

</p>

<p id="p_172"> 	"Undisputedly, no religion prescribes that prayers 
should be performed by disturbing the peace of others 
nor does it preach that they should be through voice 
amplifiers or beating of drums. In our view, in a 
civilized society in the name of religion, activities which 
disturb old or infirm persons, students or children 
having their sleep in the early hours or during daytime 
or other persons carrying on other activities cannot be 
permitted. It should not be forgotten that young babies 
in the neighbourhood are also entitled to enjoy their 
natural right of sleeping in a peaceful atmosphere. A 
student preparing for his examination is entitled to 
concentrate on his studies without their being any 
unnecessary disturbance by the neighbours. Similarly, 
the old and the infirm are entitled to enjoy reasonable 
quietness during their leisure hours without there being 
any nuisance of noise pollution. Aged, sick, people

question is  whether the appellant can be permitted to 
violate the said provisions and add to the noise 
pollution. In our view, to claim such a right itself would 
be unjustifiable. In these days, the problem of noise 
pollution has become more serious with the increasing 
trend towards industrialisation, urbanization and 
modernisation and is having many evil effects including 
danger to health. It may cause interruption of sleep, 
affect communication, loss of efficiency, hearing loss or

be exceeding permissible limits prescribed under the

others to increase the same by beating of drums or by 
use of voice amplifiers, loudspeakers or by such other 
musical instruments and, therefore, rules prescribing 
reasonable restrictions including the Rules for the use of 
loudspeakers and voice amplifiers framed under the

publicity both by electronic and print media. It was said that 
Doordarshan and other television channels shall give publicity to 
these directions, at least once every day during prime time, during 
the fortnight before Dussehra and Diwali. The Ministry of 
Information and Broadcasting was asked to  bring these directions 
to the notice of the general public through appropriate

asked to broadcast these directions on prime time on FM and other 
frequencies for information of the general public.

of fireworks may face serious difficulty, even partial 
closure, on account of the directions made by this 
Court. 
</p>
<p id="p_192">We have grave doubts if the abovesaid considerations 
can come in the way of the enforcement of fundamental 
rights guaranteed by the Constitution for the citizens 
and people of India to live in peace and comfort, in an 
atmosphere free from pollution of any kind, such as one 
caused by noise and foul/poisonous gases. However 
still, without expressing any final opinion on the pleas 
advanced, we allow the parties adversely affected the 
liberty to make representation to their respective State 
Governments and the State Governments may, in their 
turn, if satisfied of the genuineness of the 
representation made, invite the attention of the Govt. of 
India, to the suggestions made."      
</p>

<p id="p_193">	We are happy to note that the initial reluctance to abide by 
the interim directions made by this Court as displayed by the 
subsequent interlocutory applications soon gave way to compliance.  
By and large the interim directions made by the Court were 
observed in compliance.  Police and civil administration remained 
alert during Diwali Festival to see that the directions made by the 
Court were complied with.  Resident Welfare Associations and 
school children gave a very encourageous response who voluntarily 
desisted from bursting firecrackers in prohibited hours of night and 
also bursting such firecrackers as produce high level noise.

<p id="p_194">IX
Difficulty in implementation of noise pollution control 
methodology in India.
</p>

<p id="p_195"> 	India has passed through the stage of being characterised as 
a developing country and is ready to enter and stand in the line of 
developed countries.  Yet, the issue of noise pollution in India has 
not been taken so far with that seriousness as it ought to have 
been.  Firstly, as we have stated earlier, there is a lack of will on 
the part of the Executive to implement the laws.  This has 
contributed to lack of infrastructure essential for attaining the 
enforcement of laws.  Secondly, there is lack of requisite awareness 
on the part of the citizens.  The deleterious effects of noise pollution 
are not well known to the people and are not immediately 
perceptible.  People generally accept noise pollution as a part of life, 
a necessary consequence of progress and prosperity.
</p>
<p id="p_196"> 	The problems that are being faced in controlling noise 
pollution are:-
</p><p id="p_197">1.	The Statutes and the Rules framed thereunder are not 
comprehensive enough so as to deal with all the problems 
and issues related to noise pollution.  This impression of ours 
stands reaffirmed on a comparative reading of legislation in 
India with these in other countries of the world to which we 
have referred to briefly earlier in this judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_198">2.	The authorities responsible for implementing the laws 
are not yet fully identified. Those which have been 
designated, do not seem to be specialised in the task of 
regulating noise pollution.  There is dearth of necessary 
personnel technically qualified to act effectively.  What is 
needed is a combination of technically qualified and 
administratively competent personnel with the requisite 
desire and dedication for implementation of the laws.
</p>
      
<p id="p_199">3.	There is lack of proper gadgets and equipments and 
other infrastructure such as labs for measuring the noise 
levels. Due to the shortage of the instruments needed for the 
purpose of measuring sound, the policemen who are on the 
job usually end up measuring sound with their ears itself and 
not with the use of technical instruments. 
</p>
<p id="p_200">X
 Firecrackers.
</p>
<p id="p_201"> 	In the context of firecrackers in particular, several questions 
do arise for which answers shall have to be found. What should be 
the maximum permissible sound level for firecrackers? What should 
be the method of checking whether a particular firecracker shall 
emit sound which shall be within permissible limits? Which authority 
shall be conferred with the responsibility for ensuring the effective 
implementation of these noise levels? What should be the time limit 
during which the bursting of firecrackers should be allowed? Should 
there be any relaxation in the hours fixed for bursting firecrackers 
during festival? Should the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, 
be amended in such a way that the firecrackers manufactured for 
export in other countries are exempted from the Indian noise 
standards?
</p>
<p id="p_202">What is the Maximum sound level that should be permissible 
for firecrackers?     
</p>
<p id="p_203"> 	At present the maximum permissible sound level for 
firecrackers as per the noise standard is provided by Item 89, Sch. 
I, Table 1.5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986: 
"89. Noise Standard for Fire- crackers

A.	(i) The manufacture, sale or use of fire-
</p><p id="p_204">crackers generating noise level 
exceeding 125 dB(AI) or 145dB(C)pk at 
4 meters distance from the point of 
bursting shall be prohibited.  
</p>
<p id="p_205"> 	(ii) For individual firecrackers 
constituting the series (joined fire-
</p><p id="p_206">crackers), the above mentioned limit be 
reduced by 5 log 10 (N)dB, where N= 
Number of crackers joined together."
</p>

<p id="p_207">The learned animus curiae had on 17th September 2001, filed 
certain suggestions for issuance of directions for consideration of 
the Court. In it he had suggested that the maximum noise level of 
firecrackers could be fixed at 65 dB(A). 
</p>	
<p id="p_208"> 	It is submitted that the limit of emission of noise prescribed in 
the Rules is too liberal and errs on higher side. It is suggested that 
the manufacture of Firecrackers or those dealing with them should 
ensure that only such crackers are produced and marketed which 
do not emit noise of more than 65 dB(A). 
</p>
<p id="p_209"> 	The Government of India had not accepted the above 
suggestion of the learned Amicus. The government replied to it in 
the following words. 
</p>
<p id="p_210">	"Sound level of 65 dB(A) for firecrackers 
is too low a level to be prescribed. The noise 
levels prescribed in GSR 682 (E) dated 5TH 
October, 1999, have been evolved by a 
technical committee and need to be complied 
with."
</p>

<p id="p_211"> 	The Fire workers industry also submitted an application to the 
Union Minister of Environment and Forest at a meeting convened in 
New Delhi on 15/04/2004, pleading justification for the increase 
proposed in the prescribed firecrackers noise standards from 125 
dB(AI) to 135 db(AI) and from 145 dB(c)p k to 155(C)pk. 
</p>
<p id="p_212"> 	In an Article on Firecracker Noise, a Hazard- A review of its 
Standards, by, Dr. S.P. Singhal, published in MAPAN- Journal of 
Metrology Society of India, Vol. 17, No. 3, 2002; pp. 101-117, Dr. 
Singhal has stated:
</p>
<p id="p_213"> 	"UK and many other European Economic 
Commission (EEC) countries have adopted an exposure 
limit of 140dB(lin) peak sound pressure level for 
impulsive or cracker noise for a maximum exposure of 
100 impulses per day. 
</p>
<p id="p_214"> 	European Standardization Committee CEN/TC/212 
WG3 is also working to set-up standards on fireworks. 
Some of the countries have desired the limit to be set 
at 112dB(AI) and, several others have wanted it to be 
set at125dB(AI) or even at 126-127 dB(AI) at the 
testing distance, with the peak sound pressure level to 
be 20dB higher than these limits. It has fixed a noise 
level of 120dB(AI) measured at the testing distance on 
an ad hoc basis for category 2 fireworks.
</p>
<p id="p_215"> 	Canada has adopted the damage risk criterion of 
140dBA peak sound pressure level at a distance of 5m 
from the point of explosion of the cracker. It is 
applicable in all categories of fireworks unless otherwise 
specified." 
</p>

<p id="p_216">Keeping all these submissions in mind it does seem that the present 
noise standards as prescribed in India by the Government of India, 
are correct and do not need to be altered at the moment. However, 
if the Government is of the opinion that this sound level needs to be 
increased or reduced at a later date it is free to do so.    
</p>

<p id="p_217">Should a firecracker be tested on the basis of sound level or 
on the basis of chemical compositions so as to check, does 
the firecracker correspond with the prescribed rules?
</p>
<p id="p_218">For an effective implementation of noise pollution prevention 
programme, it is essential that such a method be devised whose 
enforcement shall not be problematic. A rule should be so designed, 
that it is possible for all concerned to be able to implement it, and 
thus it is not violated by anyone due to some kind of supervening 
impossibility. Almost all the parties concerned have expressed a 
discontent about the present system of enforcement of noise level 
pertaining to firecrackers. Lack of infrastructure on account of noise 
measuring devices, high cost of such devices, low noise levels 
prescribed, expensive rates for getting samples tested, long time 
taken by the testing laboratories are a few of the difficulties that 
have been cited in the enforcement of the noise standards.
</p> 
<p id="p_219"> 	The Department of Explosives has filed two affidavits before 
the Court, the first on 1.4.2003 and the second on 16.2.2004, 
besides a joint affidavit which was filed by the Ministry of 
Environment and Forest on behalf of the Union of India on 
29.8.2003.
</p> 
<p id="p_220">	In the aforesaid Affidavits, the stand taken by  the 
Department of Explosives  before the Court is:
</p><p id="p_221">(i)	that "the firecrackers noise standard prescribed under the 
Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 requires costly instruments, 
wide infrastructure and special expertise in the fields of acoustic 
science." (para-8 of Affidavit dated 1.4.2003)

</p><p id="p_222">(ii) 	that "the Department is not prepared in terms of manpower 
equipments and infrastructure for implementation of the standard 
which is based on measurement of noise level" (para-9 of Affidavit 
dated 1.4.2003)

</p><p id="p_223">(iii)	that "the Department of Explosives is of the opinion that the 
noise level of firecrackers can be efficiently controlled by specifying 
the size, shape, composition and quantity of chemicals in the 
fireworks, which are the prime factors that determine the noise 
level which entails a lot of R &amp; D work. The maximum permissible 
size of firecrackers and the maximum possible weight of the 
chemicals for each variety would be mentioned in the list of 
authorized explosives appended to the Explosives Rules consequent 
upon amendment of the Explosives Rules."(para-15 of Affidavit 
dated 1.4.2003.)

</p><p id="p_224">(iv) 	that "the department is already publishing one authorized List 
of Explosives, which is updated periodically as and when new items 
of explosives are approved by the Department. The specification for 
the approved varieties are prescribed in the said Authorised List, in 
terms of permissible size, permissible composition of chemicals, 
mass of charge and other such physical and chemical properties. 
The items which are not listed in the authorized list cannot be 
manufactured, stored, transported or sold as per various provisions 
of the Explosives Rules. Anybody proposing to manufacture a new 
variety of fireworks shall apply to the Chief Controller of Explosives, 
Nagpur along with detailed drawings, samples and prescribed fee 
for testing and approval. Noise regulations for firecrackers can be 
implemented effectively through the Authorised List in four phases: 
</p>
<p id="p_225">(i)	The permissible sound level of 125 dB(AI) notified 
under the Rules is taken as the guideline for purpose of 
implementation by the Department of Explosives. 
</p>
<p id="p_226">(ii) 	To achieve this, the Department can experiment with 
various sizes, chemicals and compositions in order to 
devise the optimal set of factors for each variety, to 
result in the desired noise level. 
</p>
<p id="p_227">(iii)	This set of factors or parameters for each variety of 
firecrackers will then be notified under the Authorized 
List of Explosives under the Explosives Rules, 1983. 
</p>
<p id="p_228">(iv)	Any violation from the authorized List exceeding the 
permitted size, permitted chemical content and 
chemical composition will attract legal action."( para-16 
of affidavit dated 1.4.2003).
</p>

<p id="p_229"> 	In the Affidavit filed on 16.2.2004, the Chief Controller of 
Explosives stated:-
</p><p id="p_230">(1)	That since the role of the Department of Explosives is 
mainly administration and enforcement of the 
Explosives Rules 1983 and the status of the Department 
is statutory in nature hence the Department of 
Explosives had already taken up the matter and advised 
the fireworks manufacturers of developing and 
producing environment friendly fireworks besides 
advocating to promote, sale and use of only 
fireworks/crackers meeting the noise standards 
prescribed under Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 
and amendments thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_231">(2)	That it is impractical for Government of India to fix 
norms regarding chemical composition and the size of 
the firecrackers. It is the duty and responsibility of the 
manufacturer to control size and composition of 
firecrackers to comply with the noise limits prescribed 
under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.
</p>
<p id="p_232">(3)	That it is impractical owing to the shortage of  
infrastructure available with the Department of 
Explosives. The licensing for the manufacture of 
firecrackers shall be as per the <a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_71">Explosives Act</a>, 1884. 
The Power of the District Magistrate for issuing licenses 
is to be retained as per the Rules. 
</p>

<p id="p_233">(4)	That the matter is now open and the manufacturers are 
at liberty to manufacture, develop, promote and sell 
only those fireworks, which comply with the noise limits 
prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules 
1986 and Explosive Rules, 1983.
</p>
<p id="p_234">(5) 	That the Department of Explosives had already made 
mandatory for the manufacturers of fireworks to 
mention the noise levels in decibel units on firecrackers. 
The manufacturers are also required to declare on the 
packing of the boxes that the noise levels conform to 
the standards prescribed under the Environment 
(Protection) Rules, 1986.  The Department had already 
included the prescribed noise limits for firecrackers as 
additional conditions of licenses issued under the 
Explosives Rules 1983.  The authorities empowered to 
enforce the Explosives Rules 1983 have been clearly 
defined under the said Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_235">Desirability of fixing chemical composition for the 
firecrackers

	The learned Amicus Curiae has suggested that the 
Government of India should fix the permissible chemical 
compositions for the firecrackers.  He submitted ___ "To control the 
noise levels from firecrackers, it was felt that apart from 
firecrackers carrying on its label, the extent of its noise level 
emission, it may be appropriate if the Government was to fix norms 
regarding chemical composition and the size of firecrackers so as to 
confirm to the notified noise emission norms."  
</p>
<p id="p_236">In UK as well, the method of determining the noise level of a 
firecracker, is by fixing its chemical contents. The British Standard 
Institute has developed the British Standard Fireworks, Part 2. 
Specification for Fireworks (BS 7114: Part 2) of 1988, which 
prescribes the maximum permissible quantity of chemicals in a 
particular firework. The Standards prescribe the various 
specifications with which the firework has to comply for it to be 
manufactured or used in UK. 
</p>
<p id="p_237">	 During the course of hearing, submissions in extenso were 
made on the comparative merits and demerits of the two systems 
namely (i) measuring the noise level of firecrackers in decibels and 
thereby securing the implementation of rules in this regard, and (ii) 
securing the implementation of the rules by restricting and 
prescribing the size of chemical content, chemical composition etc. 
of firecrackers.  A tabulated statement of such comparison has been 
placed on the record by the Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces  
Manufacturers Association.  
</p>
<p id="p_238">	Briefly stated, it is pointed out that if the firecrackers are 
allowed to be manufactured in the manner in which they are being 
done now and the noise level is left to be measured at the time of 
bursting of firecrackers, several difficulties in implementation would 
arise, frustrating the regulation.  Very expensive instruments and 
gadgets are necessary to measure the sound level of firecrackers.  
A sound level meter with required capabilities may cost around Rs.3 
lacs or upwards. Factors like wind velocity, temperature and 
humidity have a bearing on the measurement of noise level.  The 
gadgets for monitoring these factors shall also be required to be 
installed at the testing field.  Technically trained persons would be 
required to be posted at every point of measuring.   Testing the 
sound level of firecrackers at the point of bursting would mean that 
the firecrackers have already reached the market.  The persons to 
be hauled up  would be unwary retailers or users and it would be 
difficult to fix the responsibility on the manufacturers or 
distributors.  Difficulties of proof in the court of law would also 
arise.  The noise level in a firecracker is not stable.  The same 
firecracker may have a different noise level at the time of 
manufacturing and at the time of use on account of climatic 
changes which would naturally occur by the lapse of time and 
change of place.  If the noise level was to be tested at the factory, 
the firecracker would have already been manufactured. There would 
also be other difficulties inasmuch as the clearance for marketability 
would depend on the firecrackers satisfying the test carried out and 
at that point of time the firecrackers have already been 
manufactured and shall have to be only destroyed if unsuccessful in 
the test.   That apart, the manufactures are spread throughout the 
country.  Some of them are small scale industries.  Either many a 
testing stations shall have to be established or else the 
manufacturers would be required to go to centralized testing 
stations carrying untested firecrackers.  Both seem to be difficult 
situations. 
</p>
<p id="p_239">	On the other hand, prescribing of weight and composition  of 
chemicals to be used in manufacturing firecrackers would mean 
experiment or analytical tests being carried out at any one station 
followed by publication of results and laid down standards.    
Experimental checks would be enough to satisfy the authorities, if 
the manufacturers were following the laid down standards as to size 
of firecrackers, weight and percentile composition of chemicals 
used. This system would enable identification of illegal firecrackers 
with comparatively more ease.  Size and mass of charge are two 
basic factors that determine the noise level of a firecracker.  By 
restricting these two prime factors, noise standard is achieved more 
effectively.  Though other factors like climatic conditions may affect 
the noise level to some extent, but this system seems to us to be 
more dependable and logical, at least on the materials made 
available before us. 
</p>
<p id="p_240">On a comparison of the two systems, i.e. the present system 
of evaluating firecrackers on the basis of noise levels, and the other 
where the firecrackers shall be evaluated on the basis of their 
chemical composition, we feel that a change in the method of 
evaluating the firecrackers shall surely be more beneficial. It shall 
reduce the expenditure that shall otherwise have to be incurred on 
expensive instruments that are necessary for the purpose of 
measuring sound. The firecrackers shall easily be identifiable on the 
basis of their mass of charge, and weight of the chemicals 
contained in the firecrackers can also be easily measured. There 
shall not be too much need of the personnel technically qualified for 
measuring sound, as what would then be needed, would be to 
simply weigh the chemical constituents. It shall to a great extent 
also be successful in putting an end to illegal fireworks, which come 
in bigger sizes, as they now shall be more easily identifiable. In 
short the implementation of the rules relating to firecrackers shall 
be easier and carried out by the enforcing authority more easily. 
</p>
<p id="p_241">Keeping all these considerations and the various submissions 
made before this Court in mind we are of the opinion that a method 
as proposed by the learned Amicus Curiae, of fixing the maximum 
chemical composition for each and every firecracker, keeping in 
mind the limit of 125dB(AI) as the maximum permissible limit, 
should be adopted. Every manufacturer should on the box of each 
firecracker mention details of its chemical contents as well. In case 
of a failure on the part of the manufacturer to mention these details 
or in cases where the contents of the box do not match to the 
chemical formulae as stated on their box, the manufacturer shall be 
liable for criminal prosecution. 
</p>
<p id="p_242"> 	The Department of Explosives should in public interest 
undertake necessary research activity for the purpose and come out 
with the chemical formulae for each firecracker. The Department 
shall at the time of giving the license for manufacturing a particular 
firecracker shall specify the ratio as well as the maximum 
permissible weight of every chemical used for the purpose.  
</p>
<p id="p_243">Response during hearing
	The civic awareness towards prevention of noise pollution in 
India is not as high as is expected.  It is regrettable to see that 
people indulge into making noise beyond tolerable limits and create 
health hazard unmindful of consequences which are likely to befall 
not only on others but also on themselves who create noise.  The 
enactment of laws has failed to create the requisite awareness.  
The best time to create awareness is in the childhood.  At middle-
school level education and in the age of adolescence the children 
should be taught in the schools, and in the homes as well by the 
parents___ What are the consequences of noise pollution and how 
much health hazard is created by bursting firecrackers?  
</p>
<p id="p_244"> 	An awareness towards protecting the environment from all 
sorts of pollutants and destructive activities needs to be created in 
the minds at an younger age.  Suitable courses of study need to be 
devised by preparing text-books to be handed down to the youth in 
its shaping age and whilst they are still in schools.
</p>
<p id="p_245"> 	We are happy to note the way the people of the country and 
especially the younger generation has responded to the interim 
order made from time to time by this Court.  News reports came to 
our notice wherein certain schools were stated to have organized 
special lectures for the children pointing out the adverse effects of 
noise pollution created by firecrackers just before the schools 
closed for Diwali festival.  The children decided not to burst 
firecrackers during Diwali Festival.  Some volunteered and took a 
vow to burst such firecrackers as do not create intolerable noise 
and confining their such fun and frolic only to the hours of the day 
and not to do so during the hours of night.  Such a response from 
young boys and girls who are our future and the educational 
institutions on whom lie the responsibility of shaping the future of 
this country is most welcome.
</p>
<p id="p_246"> 	Certain incidental and associated issues require to be dealt 
with and that we do hereafter.
</p>

<p id="p_247">Fixing of time limit for bursting firecrackers ___ Is relaxation 
desirable for festivals?
</p>
<p id="p_248"> 	The learned Amicus Curiae in his suggestions filed on 17th 
September 2001 had suggested that the "Bursting of crackers 
should be prohibited during night time, between 10.00 p.m. and 
06.00 a.m.".   The Court had agreed and directed, vide Order dated 
27.9.2001 ___ "The use of fireworks or firecrackers shall not be 
permitted except between 6.00 a.m. and 10.p.m. No fireworks or 
firecrackers shall be used between 10.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m.  The 
Government of India, has also expressed its opinion that there 
should be no relaxation in the time limit for bursting firecrackers.  
Relaxation of restrictions on bursting of crackers from 10.00 p.m. to 
6.00 a.m. shall not be given as it is night time. During the night 
time, people sleep and the high level of noise has deleterious 
effects on the health and well being of the people." 
</p>
<p id="p_249"> 	Several interlocutory applications have been filed in this 
Court, wherein it was pleaded that restriction on bursting of 
firecrackers in the night should be removed during the Diwali 
Festival.  Similar relaxation was demanded for other festivals.  
These applications highlighted practices prevalent in some of the 
western countries wherein such relaxation is allowed.  We do not 
think that we will be justified in granting any such relaxation.  
Indian society is pluralistic.  People of this great country belong to 
different castes and communities, have belief in different religions 
and customs and celebrate different festivals.  We are tolerant for 
each other.  There is unity in diversity.  If relaxation is allowed to 
one there will be no justification for not permitting relaxation to 
others and if we do so the relaxation will become the rule.  It will be 
difficult to enforce the restriction.
</p>
<p id="p_250">The Calcutta High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/738693/" id="a_72">Moulana Mufti Syed 
Md. Noorur Rehman Barkati v. State of West Bengal</a>  AIR 
(1999) Calcutta 15 has expressed the following view: 
</p>
<p id="p_251">"The condition of the European countries, England 
and America cannot be equated with the condition 
prevailing in the State of West Bengal, particularly in 
the City of Calcutta. .West Bengal has got its own 
peculiar problem and this Court cannot decide a matter 
looking at the Europe or America where the amenities 
and the facilities are better. Density of population is 
very thin. Roads are maintained in a perfect order. 
Traffic noise is insignificant. The use of horns by 
vehicles is a thing which is prohibited there unless in 
case of emergency. People are disciplined. Traffic 
moves in a disciplined manner. No horns are there. The 
Ambient Noise Level in those countries are not at par 
with those noise level in the City of Calcutta and/or in 
different parts of State of West Bengal.
</p> 
<p id="p_252">	Accordingly, whatever may be decided by the 
European countries or America, cannot have any direct 
bearing on the fixation of the sound level in the State of 
West Bengal. In other civilized countries, cars move 
without making any noise or sound.  Condition of the 
roads is such that it cannot create any noise beyond 
tolerance. People in those countries are not in the habit 
of creating unnecessary sounds but in our country 
because of the gift of the technology sound has become 
a source of pleasure for few people including some 
young people.   Use of unnecessary horn in vehicles has 
become a part and parcel of Indian culture".
</p>


<p id="p_253"> 	The picture of the entire country compared with the State of 
West Bengal does not bear any material difference. Thus a rule, 
practice or provision as to relaxation in Europe or America may not 
be of much help for us.  They do not have many festivals or 
celebrations round the year.  Their festivals and events are only at 
national level and one for all, unlike ours.  Further, in the European 
countries or even in America an insignificant percentage of the 
population indulges in bursting crackers. Very few families, mainly 
Indian, in these countries celebrate the festival of Diwali and burst 
crackers. Thus the noise pollution produced by this small use of 
firecrackers is not a cause of worry in these countries. 
</p>
<p id="p_254"> 	The situation in India is almost the opposite. The streets are 
congested and the density of population per square kilometer is 
one of the highest in the world. Firecrackers are burst in almost all 
the houses, thus leading to pollution in the form of noise and 
smoke___ both on a large scale, making it a cause of worry.     
</p>
<p id="p_255"> 	It is a judicially noticeable fact that in advanced countries 
there is a move for collective celebration of festivals. For example, 
in United States, on May Day, a show of fireworks is arranged 
outside the city.  People assemble in large numbers to witness such 
show which is officially arranged by the State.  Such example can 
be emulated in our country.  People belonging to that section of the 
society which wishes to celebrate a festival or an occasion may be 
encouraged to organize such event collectively and may have a 
show of fireworks away from the residential locality.  Such a move 
would save the people from the hazardous effects of noise pollution 
caused by fireworks and at the same time bring the people 
together and contribute in developing closeness, unity and 
brotherhood.
</p>
<p id="p_256">	In our opinion the total restriction on bursting firecrackers 
between 10 pm and 6 am must continue without any relaxation in 
favour of anyone.  
</p>

<p id="p_257">Whether such restriction is violative of <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_73">Article 25</a> of the 
Constitution ?
</p>
<p id="p_258">	   The affidavit filed by Mr. Mariappan, the Secretary of the 
Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association, 
alleges the restriction on bursting firecrackers to amount to 
infringement of religious rights under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_74">Article 25.</a>  He says ___
"Therefore, the interference with the 
date and time of celebrating the festivals, 
amounts to infringement of religious rights 
under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_75">Article 25</a> and the limitation under 
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_76">Article 21</a> does not cause any health hazard." 
</p> 

<p id="p_259"> 	The Court by restricting the time of bursting the firecrackers 
has not in any way violated the religious rights of any person as 
enshrined under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_77">Article 25</a> of the Constitution. The festival of Diwali 
is mainly associated with pooja performed on the auspicious day 
and not with firecrackers. In no religious text book it is written that 
Diwali has to be celebrated by bursting crackers. Diwali is 
considered as a festival of lights not of noises.  Shelter in the name 
of religion cannot be sought for, for bursting firecrackers and that 
too at odd hours.
</p>
<p id="p_260"> 	Another argument that has been put forward to remove the 
restriction during festivals is that they are celebrated by most of the 
people and that an inconvenience to a few should not become the 
reason for restraining a greater lot.  
</p>
<p id="p_261"><a href="/doc/1220539/" id="a_78">In P.A. Jacob v. Superintendent of Police, Kottayam</a> , 
AIR 1993 Kerala 1, it has been said "However wide a right is, it 
cannot be as wide, as to destroy similar or other rights in others.  
Jefferson said: No one has a natural right to commit aggression on 
the equal rights of another.  J.S. Mill said: If all mankind minus one 
were of one opinion, and if only one person was of contrary opinion, 
mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, 
than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing 
mankind."
</p>
<p id="p_262"> 	If at all the people feel it necessary to burst firecrackers they 
can choose and go for such firecrackers which on being burst emit 
colours or lights mainly and produce very little or no sound.  Their 
use can be permitted.  The Department of Explosives can, while 
working out formulae for firecrackers, also along side classify the 
crackers into two categories that could be: (i) sound emitting 
crackers, and (b) colours/light emitting crackers. A few examples of 
such colour emitting crackers are, snake tablets, sparklers, pencils, 
hunters, chakri, colour rockets, flowerpots, parachutes, etc.   
Category (b) firecrackers may not have restriction as to timings. 
Though, it would need expert examination and opinion if colour 
emitting crackers also emit fumes and gases which though not 
source of noise pollution yet would cause air pollution, equally bad.  
Till such time the Department of Explosives makes any such 
classification there shall be a total ban on bursting of firecrackers 
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.


Can an exception be carved out for firecrackers meant for 
export exclusively.
</p>
<p id="p_263">Should the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, be 
amended in such a way that the firecrackers manufactured for 
export and use in other countries are exempted from the Indian 
noise standards?
</p>
<p id="p_264">Mr. Mariappan, the Secretary of The Tamil Nadu Fireworks 
and Amorces Manufactures' Association, had in his affidavit dated  
8th February 2002, requested the Court to remove the restriction on 
manufacturing fireworks meant for exporting only and which are in 
excess of the sound levels prescribed for fireworks within the 
country.  It is submitted, "the Indian Standards on noise of 
firecrackers do not have any relevance to firecrackers intended for 
export. But the order of the Hon'ble Supreme court prohibits 
manufacture of firecrackers generating noise level exceeding 125 
dB(AI) or 145 dB(C)pk at 4 maters distance from the point of 
bursting. There is a total restriction on the manufacture of fireworks 
and crackers without any discrimination being made between 
firecrackers that are manufactured for use in India and those for 
use in foreign countries. The trade having been globalised, Indian 
firecrackers have to necessarily comply with foreign standards if 
they are to enter into the international markets. The Department of 
Explosives is already having various provisions laid down under the 
<a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_79">Explosives Act</a>, 1884 and the Explosives Rules, 1983, which govern 
the export of fireworks. Prior approval from the Department  of 
Explosives is imperative for every export of fireworks. Therefore the 
comprehensive position now imposed on firecrackers should be 
modified exempting firecrackers that are manufactured for use in 
foreign countries, from the purview of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_80">Environment (Protection) 
Act</a> 1986 and the Rules framed thereunder." 
</p>
<p id="p_265">The Court on the above-mentioned submission sought for the 
view of the Department of Explosives. The Department has 
expressed the view that firecrackers that are to be sold in foreign 
countries may be excluded from the purview of the noise standards 
provided they conform to the rules for  manufacturing  the   goods   
for   export.  They also submitted ___ "The firecrackers 
manufactured and sold for export purpose may be excluded from 
the purview of the firecrackers' noise standards provided they 
follow the rules for manufacturing of goods for export. This will 
enable the manufacturers to compete in the world market with the 
other suppliers of firecrackers. The firecrackers manufactured for 
export shall have a different colour code and a clear print indicating 
that they are not to be sold in India." 
</p>
<p id="p_266"> 	We are inclined to agree with the view of the Department of 
Explosives. Firecrackers for the purpose of export may be 
manufactured and bear higher noise levels subject to the following 
conditions: (i) The manufacturer should be permitted to do so only 
when he has an export order with him and not otherwise; (ii) The 
noise levels for these firecrackers should conform to the noise 
standards prescribed in the country to which they are intended to 
be exported as per the export order; (iii) These firecrackers should 
have a different colour packing, from those intended to be sold in 
India; (iv)  The firecrackers should have a clear print on them 
stating that they are not to be sold in India.  In case these 
firecrackers are found being sold in Indian territory, then the 
manufacturer and the dealer selling these goods should be held 
liable.
</p>
<p id="p_267">How to check/control noise pollution
 	The need for checking noise pollution as highlighted by the 
petitioners and several intervenors deserves appreciation.
</p>
<p id="p_268"> 	Need for specific legislation to control and prevent noise 
pollution still needs some emphasis.  Undoubtedly, some laws have 
been enacted.  Yet, compared with the legislation in developed 
countries India is still lagging behind in enacting adequate and 
scientific legislations.  We need to have one simple but specific and 
detailed legislation dealing with several aspects referable to noise 
pollution and providing measures of control therefor.  
</p>
<p id="p_269"> 	There is an equal need of developing mechanism and 
infrastructure for enforcement of the prevalent laws.  Those who 
are entrusted with the task of enforcing laws directed towards 
controlling noise pollution, must be so trained as to acquire 
expertise in the matter of fighting against noise pollution by taking 
preventing and deterrent measures both.  They need to be 
equipped with the requisite equipments such as audio meters as 
would help them in detecting the level of noise pollution more so 
when it crosses the permissible limits and the source thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_270"> 	Above all, there is need for creating general awareness 
towards the hazardous effects of noise pollution.  Particularly, in our 
country the people generally lack consciousness of the ill effects 
which noise pollution creates and how the society including they 
themselves stand to benefit by preventing generation and emission 
of noise pollution.  The target area should be educational 
institutions and more particularly schools.  The young children of 
impressionable age should be motivated to desist from playing with 
firecrackers, use of high sound producing equipments and 
instruments on festivals, religious and social functions, family get-
togethers and celebrations etc. which cause noise pollution.  
Suitable chapters can be added into text-books which teach civic 
sense  to the children and teach them how to be good and 
responsible citizen which would include learning by heart of various 
fundamental duties and that would obviously include learning not to 
create noise pollution and to prevent if generated by others.  
Holding of special talks and lectures can be organized in the schools 
to highlight the menace of noise pollution and the role of the 
children in preventing it.  For these purposes the State must play 
its role by the support and cooperation of non-government 
organizations (NGOs) can also be enlisted.
</p>
<p id="p_271">Similar awareness needs to be created in police and civil 
administration by means of carrying out a special drive to make 
them understand the various measures to curb the problems and 
the laws on the subject.   Resident Welfare Associations (RAWs), 
service clubs (such as Rotary International and Lions International) 
and societies engaged in preventing noise pollution as part of their 
projects need to be encouraged and actively involved by the local 
administration.  Festival and ceremonies wherein the fireworks and 
crackers are customarily burst can be accompanied by earmarking 
a place and time wherein and when all the people can come 
together and witness or view a show of fireworks dispensing with 
the need of crackers being burst in the residential areas and that 
too which is done without any regard to timings.  The 
manufacturers can be encouraged to make such fireworks as would 
display more the colours rather than make noise.
</p>
<p id="p_272"> 	Not only the use of loudspeakers and playing of hi-fi amplifier 
systems has to be regulated even the playing of high sound 
instruments like drums, tom-toms, trumpets, bugles and the like 
which create noise beyond tolerable limits need to be regulated.  
The law enforcing agencies must be equipped with necessary 
instruments and facilities out of which sound level meters 
conforming to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) code are a bare 
necessity.
</p>
<p id="p_273"> 	Preventive measures need to be directed more effectively at 
the source.  To illustrate, the horns which if fitted with the 
automobiles would create hawking sound beyond permissible limits, 
should not be allowed to be manufactured or sold in the market as 
once they are available they are likely to be used.
</p>
<p id="p_274">Loudspeakers and amplifiers or other equipments or gadgets 
which produce offending noise once detected as violating the law, 
should be liable to be seized and confiscated by making provision in 
the law in that behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_275"> 	Prohibiting the sale of such firecrackers which create noise 
pollution by producing noise beyond permissible limits is practically 
unmanageable.  A better option certainly is to prescribe the 
chemical contents and composition for each type of firecrackers to 
effectively curb noise pollution.  The Chief Controller of Explosives  
has also been agreeable to take steps in this regard but has pointed 
out difficulties attributable to shortage of personnel and non-
availability of lab facilities and requisite equipments for this 
purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_276"> 	We hasten to add that during the course of the proceedings 
the parties have been generally agreeable to solicit directions on 
the lines as indicated hereinabove.  There should be no difficulty in 
issuing directions and ensuring compliance to the extent as 
indicated hereinabove.  Wherever there are difficulties they have to 
be sorted out in the larger public interest.
</p>


<p id="p_277">DIRECTIONS
It is hereby directed as under:-    
</p>
<p id="p_278">I.  	Firecrackers 

</p><p id="p_279">1. 	On a comparison of the two systems, i.e. the present 
system of evaluating firecrackers on the basis of noise levels, 
and the other where the firecrackers shall be evaluated on the 
basis of chemical composition, we feel that the latter method 
is more practical and workable in Indian circumstances.  It 
shall be followed unless and until replaced by a better system.
</p>
<p id="p_280">2. The Department of Explosives (DOE) shall undertake 
necessary research activity for the purpose and come out with 
the chemical formulae for each type or category or class of 
firecrackers. The DOE shall specify the proportion/composition 
as well as the maximum permissible weight of every chemical 
used in manufacturing firecrackers. 
</p>
<p id="p_281">3. The Department of Explosives may divide the firecrackers 
into two categories- (i) Sound emitting firecrackers, and (ii) 
Colour/light emitting firecrackers. 
</p>
<p id="p_282">4. There shall be a complete ban on bursting sound emitting 
firecrackers between 10 pm and 6 am.  It is not necessary to 
impose restrictions as to time on bursting of colour/light 
emitting firecrackers.    
</p>
<p id="p_283">5. Every manufacturer shall on the box of each firecracker 
mention details of its chemical contents and that it satisfies 
the requirement as laid down by DOE. In case of a failure on 
the part of the manufacturer to mention the details or in 
cases where the contents of the box do not match the 
chemical formulae as stated on the box, the manufacturer 
may be held liable. 
</p>
<p id="p_284">6. Firecrackers for the purpose of export may be 
manufactured bearing higher noise levels subject to the 
following conditions: (i) The manufacturer should be 
permitted to do so only when he has an export order with him 
and not otherwise;(ii) The noise levels for these firecrackers 
should conform to the noise standards prescribed in the 
country to which they are intended to be exported as per the 
export order; (iii) These firecrackers should have a different 
colour packing, from those intended to be sold in India; (iv) 
They must carry a declaration printed thereon something like 
'not for sale in India' or 'only for export to country AB' and so 
on.
</p>

<p id="p_285">II. 	Loudspeakers
</p><p id="p_286">1.	The noise level at the boundary of the public place, 
where loudspeaker or public address system or any other 
noise source is being used  shall not exceed 10 dB(A) above 
the ambient noise standards for the area or 75 dB(A) 
whichever is lower. 
</p>
<p id="p_287">2.	No one shall beat a drum or tom-tom or blow a trumpet 
or beat or sound any instrument or use any sound amplifier at 
night (between 10. 00 p.m. and 6.a.m.) except in public 
emergencies. 
</p> 
<p id="p_288">3.	The peripheral noise level of privately owned sound 
system shall not exceed by more than 5 dB(A) than the 
ambient air quality standard specified for the area in which it 
is used, at the boundary of the private place.
</p>
<p id="p_289">III. 	Vehicular Noise
No horn should be allowed to be used at night (between 10 
p.m. and 6 a.m.) in residential area except in exceptional 
circumstances. 
</p>

<p id="p_290">IV.  	Awareness
</p><p id="p_291">1.	There is a need for creating general awareness towards 
the hazardous effects of noise pollution. Suitable chapters 
may be added in the text-books which teach civic sense to 
the children and youth at the initial/early level of education. 
Special talks and lectures be organised in the schools to 
highlight the menace of noise pollution and the role of the 
children and younger generation in preventing it. Police and 
civil administration should be trained to understand the 
various methods to curb the problem and also the laws on the 
subject. 
</p>
<p id="p_292">2.	The State must play an active  role in this process. 
Resident Welfare Associations, service Clubs and Societies 
engaged in preventing noise pollution as a part of their 
projects need to be encouraged and actively involved by the 
local administration. 
</p>
<p id="p_293">3.	Special public awareness campaigns in anticipation of 
festivals, events and ceremonial occasions whereat 
firecrackers are likely to be used, need to be carried out. 
</p>
<p id="p_294"> 	The abovesaid guidelines are issued in exercise of power 
conferred on this Court under Articles 141 and 142 of the 
Constitution of India.  These would remain in force until modified by 
this Court or superseded by an appropriate legislation. 
</p>
<p id="p_295">V  	Generally
</p><p id="p_296">1.  The States shall make provision for seizure and 
confiscation of loudspeakers, amplifiers and such other 
equipments as are found to be creating noise beyond the 
permissible limits.
</p>
<p id="p_297">2.	Rule 3 of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) 
Rules, 2000 makes provision for specifying ambient air quality 
standards in respect of noise for different areas/zones, 
categorization of the areas for the purpose of implementation 
of noise standards, authorizing the authorities for 
enforcement and achievement of laid down standards. The 
Central Government/State Governments shall take steps for 
laying down such standards and notifying the authorities 
where it has not already been done.
</p>
<p id="p_298">        Though, the matters are closed consistently with the 
directions as above issued in public interest, there will be liberty of 
seeking further directions as and when required and in particular in 
the event of any difficulty arising in implementing the directions.        
</p>
<p id="p_299">	The CWP, CA and all pending IAs be treated as disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_300">	Before parting, we would like to place on record our deep 
appreciation of valuable assistance rendered by Shri Jitendra 
Sharma, Senior Advocate assisted by Shri Sandeep Narain, 
Advocate (and earlier by late Shri Pankaj Kalra, Advocate) 


who highlighted several relevant aspects of the issues before us 
and also helped in formulating the guidelines issued as above.
