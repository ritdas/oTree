                R/SCR.A/4377/2015                                         JUDGMENT



</p><p id="p_4">         3.   The writ applicant herein is one of the accused persons in
         a complaint filed by the respondent No.2 for the offence
         punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">section 138</a> of the N.I. Act. The complaint
         filed in the court of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Court
         No.36, Ahmedabad came to be registered as the Criminal Case
         No.259 of 2012. The writ applicant herein is one of the
         independent directors of the accused No.1 company, namely,
         Electrotherm (India) Ltd. It appears from the materials on
         record that the cheque in question was signed by the accused
         Nos.4 and 12. The accused No.4 in the complaint is the
         Managing Director and CEO of the Company, and the accused
         No.12 is the authorized signatory.
</p>


<p id="p_5">         4.   The short point that falls for my consideration is whether
         the applicant herein, who is one of the Directors of the
         Company is responsible for the dishonour of the cheque issued
         by the original accused No.4 and 12 on behalf of the company.
</p>

<p id="p_6">         5.   Mr. Trivedi, the learned advocate appearing for the
         applicant submitted that his client may be a Director of the
         company, but is noway responsible for the day to day affairs of
         the management of the company. He submitted that mere
         reproduction of the provision of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_3">Section 141</a> in the complaint is
         not sufficient. The complainant must show something prima
         facie as to how a particular accused is responsible for the day
         to day affairs of the management of the company.
</p>

<p id="p_7">         6.   On the other hand, this application has been vehemently
         opposed by Mr. Siddhartha Samal, the learned advocate
         appearing for the respondent No.2-Bank. Mr. Siddhartha has
         drawn my attention to the averments made in para 2 of the

                 R/SCR.A/4377/2015                                         JUDGMENT




         complaint which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">              That accused No.1 is a Company incorporated under the
              <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_4">Companies Act</a> 1956. Accused No.2 is the Chairman and
              CTO, Accused No.3 is the Managing Director, Accused
              No.4 is the Joint Managing Director And CEO, Accused
              No.5 is the whole time Director, Accused Nos.6 to 9 are
              Directors, Accused No.10 is the Chief Financial Officer,
              Accused No.11 is the Company Secretary and Accused
              No.12 is the Authorized Signatory of Accused No.1 and
              hence, all accused are jointly and severally liable.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_8">         7.   He has also drawn my attention to the averments made
         in the complaint as contained in para 6, page 33. He submits
         that these averments are sufficient to fasten the liability on the
         accused herein by virtue of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_5">Section 141</a> of the Act. He submits
         that there is no merit in the application and therefore, the
         same is required to be rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_9">         8.   Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the
         parties and having gone through the materials on record, the
         only question that falls for my consideration is whether the
         complaint deserves to be quashed so far as the applicant-
         accused herein is concerned. The law so far as the liability of a
         Director of a Company under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_6">Section 141</a> of the Act is
         concerned, is no longer res integra. The Supreme Court in the
         case of <a href="/doc/832836/" id="a_7">National Small Industries Corporation Limited v.
         Harmeet Singh Paintal and another</a> (2010) 3 SCC 330
         has explained, the law very succinctly:
</p>
              1) Leave granted in all the above special leave petitions.
<p id="p_10">              The appeals arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) Nos. 445- 461
              of 2008 have been filed by the appellant-National Small
              Industries Corporation Limited against the common
              judgment and order dated 24.10.2007 passed by the
              High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in a batch of cases

         whereby the High Court quashed the summoning orders
         passed by the trial Court against respondent No.1 -
         Harmeet Singh Paintal, under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">Section 138</a> read with
         <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_9">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for
         short the Act)

</p><p id="p_11">         2) The connected criminal appeal arising out of S.L.P. Crl.
         No. 1079 of 2008 is filed against the judgment and order
         dated 24.05.2007 passed by the High Court of Delhi in
         Criminal Revision Petition No. 163 of 2005, whereby the
         High Court quashed the summoning order passed by the
         trial Court against respondent No.1 - Dev Sarin under
         <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_10">Section 138</a> read with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_11">Section 141</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_12">         3) Since all these appeals are identical and same legal
         issues arise, they are being disposed of by this common
         judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_13">         4) The appellant - National Small Industries Corporation
         Ltd. had filed 12 criminal complaints under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_12">Section 138</a>
         read with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_13">Sections 141</a> and <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_14">142</a> of the Act against M/s Jay
         Rapid Roller Limited, a Company incorporated under the
         <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_15">Companies Act</a>, its Managing Director - Shri Sukhbir
         Singh Paintal, and its Director - Shri Harmeet Singh
         Paintal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">         5) It is the claim of the appellant that so as to make the
         Managing Director and Director of the Company liable to
         be prosecuted under the provisions of the Act, they had
         specifically averred in the complaint that all the accused
         persons approached it for financing of bill integrated
         market support programme. It was also stated that the
         accused persons had issued cheques which were
         dishonoured on presentation against which the appellant
         had filed criminal complaints under the provisions of the
         Act against all the respondents herein. It is their further
         case that all the accused persons accepted their liability
         and delivered various cheques, which are the subject
         matter of the present appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_15">         6) In the connected appeal, the appellant - DCM Financial
         Services Ltd., entered into a hire purchase agreement on
         25.02.1996 with M/s International Agro Allied Products
         Ltd. At the time of entering into contract, the Company
         handed over post-dated cheques to the appellant
         towards payment of monthly hire/rental charges.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_16">         Respondent No.1 Dev Sarin was one of the Directors of
         the said Company. The cheque issued by International
         Agro and Allied Products Ltd. in favour of the appellant
         was duly presented for payment on 28.10.1998 and the
         same was returned unpaid for the reason that the
         Company had issued instructions to the bankers stopping
         payment of the cheque.
</p>
<p id="p_17">         7) The appellant issued a legal notice on 05.12.1998 to
         the Company, Respondent No.1 and other Directors
         under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_16">Section 138</a> of the Act informing them about the
         dis-honouring of the cheque in question. Despite the
         service of the notice, the Company did not make the
         payment to the appellant. The appellant, on 11.01.1999,
         filed a complaint before the Metropolitan Magistrate, New
         Delhi against respondent No.1 and others under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_17">Section
         138</a> read with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_18">Section 141</a> of the Act. By order dated
         04.02.1999, the Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi, after
         recording evidence summoned the accused persons
         including respondent No.1 herein.
</p>
<p id="p_18">         8) Respondent No.1 filed an application before the
         Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi for dropping of
         proceedings against him. By order dated 08.09.2004, the
         Metropolitan Magistrate dismissed the said application.
         Aggrieved by the said order, the respondent filed a
         petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_19">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure
         Code before the High Court for quashing of the
         complaint. The High Court, after finding that the
         averments against respondent No.1 are unspecific and
         general and no particular role is assigned to the
         appellant, quashed the summoning order insofar as it
         concerned to him.
</p>
<p id="p_19">         9) In this factual matrix, the issue which arises for
         determination before this Court is whether the order of
         the High Court quashing the summoning orders insofar as
         the respondents are concerned is sustainable and what
         should be the averments in the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_20">Section

         firm.
</p>
<p id="p_29">         12) It is very clear from the above provision that what is
         required is that the persons who are sought to be made
         vicariously liable for a criminal offence under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_25">Section 141</a>
         should be, at the time the offence was committed, was
         in-charge of, and was responsible to the company for the
         conduct of the business of the company. Every person
         connected with the company shall not fall within the
         ambit of the provision. Only those persons who were in-
         charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business
         of the company at the time of commission of an offence
         will be liable for criminal action. It follows from the fact
         that if a Director of a Company who was not incharge of
         and was not responsible for the conduct of the business
         of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable for
         a criminal offence under the provisions. The liability
         arises from being in-charge of and responsible for the
         conduct of the business of the company at the relevant
         time when the offence was committed and not on the
         basis of merely holding a designation or office in a
         company.
</p>
<p id="p_30">         13) <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_26">Section 141</a> is a penal provision creating vicarious
         liability, and which, as per settled law, must be strictly
         construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to make a bald
         cursory statement in a complaint that the Director
         (arrayed as an accused) is in charge of and responsible to
         the company for the conduct of the business of the
         company without anything more as to the role of the
         Director. But the complaint should spell out as to how
         and in what manner Respondent No.1 was in-charge of or
         was responsible to the accused company for the conduct
         of its business. This is in consonance with strict
         interpretation of penal statutes, especially, where such
         statutes create vicarious liability.
</p>
<p id="p_31">         14) A company may have a number of Directors and to
         make any or all the Directors as accused in a complaint
         merely on the basis of a statement that they are in-
         charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business
         of the company without anything more is not a sufficient
         or adequate fulfillment of the requirements under Section

         making Directors liable for the offences committed by the
         company under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_27">Section 141</a> of the Act, there must be
         specific averments against the Directors, showing as to
         how and in what manner the Directors were responsible
         for the conduct of the business of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_34">         16) In the light of the above provision and the language
         used therein, let us, at the foremost, examine the
         complainta filed by National Small Industries Corporation
         Limited and the DCM Financial Services Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_35">         17) In the case of National Small Industries Corpn. Ltd.,
         the High Court has reproduced the entire complaint in
         the impugned order and among other clauses, clause 8 is
         relevant for our consideration which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_36">         8. That the accused No. 2 is the Managing Director and
         accused No. 3 is the Director of the accused company.
         The accused No. 2 and 3 are the in-charge and
         responsible for the conduct of the business of the
         company accused No. 1 and hence are liable for the
         offences.
</p>
<p id="p_37">         18) In the case of DCM Financial Services Ltd., in
         complaint- Annexure-P2 the relevant clause is 13 which
         reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_38">         13. That the accused No. 1 is a Company/Firm and the
         accused Nos. 2 to 9 were in charge and were responsible
         to the accused No. 1 for the conduct of the business to
         the accused No. 1 at the time when offence was
         committed. Hence, the accused Nos. 2 to 9 in addition to
         the accused No. 1, are liable to be prosecuted and
         punished in accordance with law by this Honble Court as
         provided by <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_28">section 141</a> of the N.I. Act, 1881. Further the
         offence has been committed by the accused No. 1 with
         the consent and connivance of the accused Nos. 2 to 9.
</p>
<p id="p_39">         19) Now, let us consider whether the abovementioned
         complaint in both cases has satisfied the necessary
         ingredients to attract <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_29">Section 141</a> insofar as the
         respondents, namely, Directors of the company are
         concerned.

         of the Act, a three-Judge Bench of this Court considered
         the following questions which had been referred to it by a
         two-Judge Bench of this Court in SMS Pharmaceuticals vs.
         Neeta Bhalla and Anr. (2005) 8 SCC 89:
</p>
<p id="p_41">         (a) Whether for purposes of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_32">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable
         Instruments Act, 1881, it is sufficient if the substance of
         the allegation read as a whole fulfil the requirements of
         the said section and it is not necessary to specifically
         state in the complaint that the person accused was in
         charge of, or responsible for, the conduct of the business
         of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_42">         (b) Whether a director of a company would be deemed to
         be in charge of, and responsible to, the company for
         conduct of the business of the company and, therefore,
         deemed to be guilty of the offence unless he proves to
         the contrary.
</p>
<p id="p_43">         (c) Even if it is held that specific averments are
         necessary, whether in the absence of such averments the
         signatory of the cheque and or the managing directors or
         joint managing director who admittedly would be in
         charge of the company and responsible to the company
         for conduct of its business could be proceeded against.
</p>
<p id="p_44">         21) While considering the above questions, this Court
         held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_45">         18. To sum up, there is almost unanimous judicial opinion
         that necessary averments ought to be contained in a
         complaint before a person can be subjected to criminal
         process. A liability under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_33">Section 141</a> of the Act is sought
         to be fastened vicariously on a person connected with a
         company, the principal accused being the company itself.
         It is a departure from the rule in criminal law against
         vicarious liability. A clear case should be spelled out in
         the complaint against the person sought to be made
         liable. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_34">Section 141</a> of the Act contains the requirements
         for making a person liable under the said provision. That
         the respondent falls within the parameters of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_35">Section 141</a>
         has to be spelled out. A complaint has to be examined by
         the Magistrate in the first instance on the basis of
         averments contained therein. If the Magistrate is satisfied
         that there are averments which bring the case within
         <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_36">Section 141</a>, he would issue the process. We have seen

         that merely being described as a director in a company is
         not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_37">Section 141</a>.
         Even a non-director can be liable under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_38">Section 141</a> of
         the Act. The averments in the complaint would also serve
         the purpose that the person sought to be made liable
         would know what is the case which is alleged against
         him. This will enable him to meet the case at the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_46">         19. In view of the above discussion, our answers to the
         questions posed in the reference are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_47">         (a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint
         under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_39">Section 141</a> that at the time the offence was
         committed, the person accused was in charge of, and
         responsible for the conduct of business of the company.
         This averment is an essential requirement of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_40">Section 141</a>
         and has to be made in a complaint. Without this
         averment being made in a complaint, the requirements
         of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_41">Section 141</a> cannot be said to be satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p_48">         (b) The answer to the question posed in sub-para (b) has
         to be in the negative. Merely being a director of a
         company is not sufficient to make the person liable under
         <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_42">Section 141</a> of the Act. A director in a company cannot be
         deemed to be in charge of and responsible to the
         company for the conduct of its business. The requirement
         of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_43">Section 141</a> is that the person sought to be made
         liable should be in charge of and responsible for the
         conduct of the business of the company at the relevant
         time. This has to be averred as a fact as there is no
         deemed liability of a director in such cases.
</p>
<p id="p_49">         (c) The answer to Question (c) has to be in the
         affirmative. The question notes that the managing
         director or joint managing director would be admittedly in
         charge of the company and responsible to the company
         for the conduct of its business. When that is so, holders
         of such positions in a company become liable under
         <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_44">Section 141</a> of the Act. By virtue of the office they hold as
         managing director or joint managing director, these
         persons are in charge of and responsible for the conduct
         of business of the company. Therefore, they get covered
         under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_45">Section 141</a>. So far as the signatory of a cheque
         which is dishonoured is concerned, he is clearly
         responsible for the incriminating act and will be covered
         under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_46">Section 141</a>.</p><pre id="pre_4">

         persons who are in-charge of and responsible for the
         conduct of the business of the company at the time of
         the offence and the persons who are merely holding the
         post in a company and are not in-charge of and
         responsible for the conduct of the business of the
         company. Further, in order to fasten the vicarious liability
         in accordance with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_47">Section 141</a>, the averment as to the
         role of the concerned Directors should be specific. The
         description should be clear and there should be some
         unambiguous allegations as to how the concerned
         Directors were alleged to be incharge of and was
         responsible for the conduct and affairs of the company.

         while dealing with the same issue observed as under:
         &amp;&amp;It may be true that it is not necessary for the
         complainant to specifically reproduce the wordings of the
         section but what is required is a clear statement of fact
         so as to enable the court to arrive at a prima facie
         opinion that the accused are vicariously liable. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_49">Section
         141</a> raises a legal fiction. By reason of the said provision,
         a person although is not personally liable for commission
         of such an offence would be vicariously liable therefor.
         Such vicarious liability can be inferred so far as a
         company registered or incorporated under the
         <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_50">Companies Act</a>, 1956 is concerned only if the requisite
         statements, which are required to be averred in the
         complaint petition, are made so as to make the accused
         therein vicariously liable for the offence committed by
         the company. Before a person can be made vicariously
         liable, strict compliance with the statutory requirements
         would be insisted. Not only the averments made in para 7
         of the complaint petitions do not meet the said statutory
         requirements, the sworn statement of the witness made
         by the son of the respondent herein, does not contain
         any statement that the appellants were in charge of the
         business of the Company. In a case where the court is
         required to issue summons which would put the accused
         to some sort of harassment, the court should insist strict
         compliance with the statutory requirements. In terms of
         <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_51">Section 200</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the

         accused persons are responsible therefor. In the event,
         ultimately, the prosecution is found to be frivolous or
         otherwise mala fide, the court may direct registration of
         case against the complainant for mala fide prosecution of
         the accused. The accused would also be entitled to file a
         suit for damages. The relevant provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_52"> of the Code</a> of
         Criminal Procedure are required to be construed from the
         aforementioned point of view.

         3 SCC 693, while following SMS Pharmaceuticals case
         (supra) and Sabhita Ramamurthy case (supra), this Court
         held that with a view to make the Director of a company
         vicariously liable for the acts of the company, it was
         obligatory on the part of the complainant to make
         specific allegations as are required under the law and
         under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_54">Section 141</a> of the Act and further held that in the
         absence of such specific averments in the complaint
         showing as to how and in what manner the Director is
         liable, the complaint should not be entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_54">         25) The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced
         hereinbelow:-
</p>
<p id="p_55">         12. A person would be vicariously liable for commission
         of an offence on the part of a company only in the event
         the conditions precedent laid down therefor in <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_55">Section
         141</a> of the Act stand satisfied. For the aforementioned
         purpose, a strict construction would be necessary.

<p id="p_56">         13. The purported averments which have been made in
         the complaint petitions so as to make the appellant
         vicariously liable for the offence committed by the
         Company read as under:
</p>
<p id="p_57">         That Accused 1 is a public limited company incorporated
         and registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_56">Companies Act</a>, 1956, and
         Accused 2 to 8 are/were its Directors at the relevant time

         noticed hereinbefore, the Managing Director and all other
         Directors were also made accused. The appellant did not
         issue any cheque. He, as noticed hereinbefore, had
         resigned from the directorship of the Company. It may be
         true that as to exactly on what date the said resignation
         was accepted by the Company is not known, but, even
         otherwise, there is no averment in the complaint
         petitions as to how and in what manner the appellant
         was responsible for the conduct of the business of the
         Company or otherwise responsible to it in regard to its
         functioning. He
         had not issued any cheque. How he is responsible for
         dishonour of the cheque has not been stated. The
         allegations made in para 3, thus, in our opinion do not
         satisfy the requirements of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_57">Section 141</a> of the Act.

         precedents of SMS Pharmaceuticalss case (supra),
         Sabhita Ramamurthys case (supra) and Saroj Kumar
         Poddars case (supra), this Court reiterated that for
         launching a prosecution against the alleged Directors,
         there must be a specific allegation in the complaint as to
         the part played by them in the transaction. The relevant
         portion of the judgment is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_60">         7. This provision clearly shows that so far as the
         companies are concerned if any offence is committed by
         it then every person who is a Director or employee of the
         company is not liable. Only such person would be held
         liable if at the time when offence is committed he was in
         charge and was responsible to the company for the
         conduct of the business of the company as well as the
         company. Merely being a Director of the company in the
         absence of above factors will not make him liable.
</p>
<p id="p_61">         8. To launch a prosecution, therefore, against the alleged
         Directors there must be a specific allegation in the
         complaint as to the part played by them in the
         transaction. There should be clear and unambiguous
         allegation as to how the Directors are in-charge and
         responsible for the conduct of the business of the
         company. The description should be clear. It is true that
         precise words from the provisions of the Act need not be
         reproduced and the court can always come to a
         conclusion in facts of each case. But still, in the absence

         of any averment or specific evidence the net result would
         be that complaint would not be entertainable.
</p>
<p id="p_62">         27) The said issue again came up for consideration
         before a three-Judge Bench of this Court recently in
         <a href="/doc/177488211/" id="a_59">Ramraj Singh vs. State of M.P. &amp; Anr</a>. (2009) 6 SCC 729.
         In this case, the earlier decisions were also considered in
         detail. Following the decisions of SMS Pharmaceuticals
         case (supra), Sabhita Ramamurthys case (supra), Saroj
         Kumar Poddars case (supra) and N.K. Wahis case (supra)
         this Court held that it is necessary to specifically aver in a
         complaint under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_60">Section 141</a> that at the time when the
         offence was committed, the person accused was in-
         charge of, and responsible for the conduct of the
         business of the company. Furthermore, it held that
         vicarious liability can be attributed only if the requisite
         statements, which are required to be averred in the
         complaint petition, are made so as to make the
         accused/Director therein vicariously liable for the offence
         committed by the company. It was further held that
         before a person can be made vicariously liable, strict
         compliance of the statutory requirements would be
         insisted. Thus, the issue in the present case is no more
         res integra and has been squarely covered by the
         decisions of this Court referred above. It is submitted that
         the aforesaid decisions of this Court have become
         binding precedents.

<p id="p_63">         28) In the case of second SMS Pharmaceuticals vs. Neeta
         Bhalla, (2007) 4 SCC 70, this Court has categorically held
         that there may be a large number of Directors but some
         of them may not assign themselves in the management
         of the day-to-day affairs of the company and thus are not
         responsible for the conduct of the business of the
         company. Para 20 of the said judgment is relevant which
         is reproduced hereunder:-
</p>
<p id="p_64">         20. The liability of a Director must be determined on the
         date on `which the offence is committed. Only because
         Respondent 1 herein was a party to a purported
         resolution dated 15-2-1995 by itself does not lead to an
         inference that she was actively associated with the
         management of the affairs of the Company. This Court in
         this case has
         categorically held that there may be a large number of
         Directors but some of them may not associate

         themselves in the management of the day-to-day affairs
         of the Company and, thus, are not responsible for the
         conduct of the business of the Company. The averments
         must state that the person who is vicariously liable for
         commission of the offence of the Company both was in
         charge of and was responsible for the conduct of the
         business of the Company. Requirements laid down
         therein must be read conjointly and not disjunctively.
         When a legal fiction is raised, the ingredients therefor

         Advertising Pvt. Ltd. vs. State Govt. of NCT of Delhi &amp;
         Ors</a>., (2007) 5 SCC 54, learned counsel for the appellants
         argued that this Court has not allowed the recalling of
         summons in a criminal complaint filed under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_62">sections 138</a>
         and <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_63">141</a>. However, a perusal of the judgment would
         reveal that this case was of recalling of summons by the
         Magistrate for which the Magistrate had no jurisdiction.
         Further, para 22 of the judgment would reveal that in the
         complaint

</p><p id="p_66">         23...allegations have not only been made in terms of the
         wordings of section but also at more than one place, it
         has categorically been averred that the payments were
         made after the meetings held by and between the
         representative of the Company and accused nos. 1 to 5
         which would include Respondent Nos. 2 and 3.

<p id="p_67">         30) In para 24, this Court concluded that:

<p id="p_68">         it is therefore, not a case where having regard to the
         position held by the said respondents in the Company,
         they could plead ignorance of the entire transaction.

<p id="p_69">         Furthermore, this Court has relied upon S.M.S.

         are prima facie in that position. However, it is pertinent
         to note that in this case it was specifically mentioned in
         the complaint that (i) accused no. 2 was a director and in
         charge of and responsible to the accused Company for
         the conduct of its business; and (ii) the response of
         accused no. 2 to the notice issued by BSNL that the said
         accused is no longer the Chairman or Director of the
         accused Company was false and by not keeping sufficient
         funds in their account and failing to pay the cheque
         amount on service of the notice, all the accused
         committed an offence. Therefore, this decision is clearly
         distinguishable on facts as in the said case necessary
         averments were made out in the complaint itself.
         Furthermore, this decision does not and could not have
         overruled the decisions in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals case
         (three-Judge Bench)(supra), Ramraj Singhs case (three-
         Judge Bench)(supra), Saroj Kumar Poddars case (supra)
         and N.K. Wahis case (supra) wherein it is clearly held that
         specific averments have to be made against the accused
         Director.
</p>
<p id="p_71">         32) Learned counsel for the appellants after elaborately
         arguing the matter, by inviting our attention to <a href="/doc/1306412/" id="a_65">Paresh P.
         Rajda vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; Anr</a>., (2008) 7 SCC 442
         contended that a departure/digression has been made by
         the Court in the case of N. Rangachari vs. BSNL (supra).
         However, in this case also the Court has observed in para
         4 that the High Court had noted that:
</p>
<p id="p_72">         an overall reading of the complaint showed that specific
         allegations had been leveled against the accused as
         being a responsible officer of the accused Company and
         therefore, equally liable...
</p>
<p id="p_73">         In fact, the Court recorded the allegations in the
         complaint that the Complainant knew all the accused and
         that accused no. 1 was the Chairman of the accused
         Company and was responsible for day to day affairs of
         the Company. This Court though has only noted the
         decision in N. Rangacharis case (supra) and observed
         that an observation therein showed a slight departure
         vis-?nbsp;-vis  the   other  judgments     (i.e.  S.M.S.
         Pharmaceuticals first case and S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals
         second case), but then Court went on to record that in
         N.K. Wahis case (supra) this Court had reiterated the
         view in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals case (supra). The Court

         then concluded in para 11 that:
</p>
<p id="p_74">         it was clear from the aforequoted judgments that the
         entire matter would boiled down to an examination of the
         nature of averments made in the complaint....
         On facts, the Court found necessary averments had been
         made in the complaint....
</p>
<p id="p_75">         33) Though, the learned counsel for the appellants
         relying on a recent decision in <a href="/doc/1957018/" id="a_66">K.K. Ahuja vs. V.K. Vora &amp;
         Anr</a>., (2009) 10 SCC 48, it is clearly recorded that in the
         complaint it was alleged that the accused were in-charge
         of and was responsible for the conduct of the day-to-day
         business of the accused Company and further all the
         accused were directly and actively involved in the
         financial dealings of the Company and the same was also
         reiterated in the pre-summoning evidence. Furthermore,
         this decision also notes that it is necessary to specifically
         aver in a complaint that the person accused was in-
         charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business
         of the Company.
</p>
<p id="p_76">         34) After noting Saroj Kumar Poddars case (supra) and
         N.K. Wahis case (supra), this Court further noted in para
         9 that:
</p>
<p id="p_77">         &amp;&amp;the prevailing trend appear to require the
         Complainant to state how a Director who is sought to be
         made an accused, was in-charge of the business of the
         Company, as every Director need not be and is not in-
         charge of the business of the Company&amp;...
</p>
<p id="p_78">         35) In Para 11, this Court has further recorded that:
</p>
<p id="p_79">         &amp;..When conditions are prescribed for extending such
         constructive criminal liability to others, courts will insist
         upon strict literal compliance. There is no question of
         inferential or implied compliance. Therefore, a specific
         averment complying with the requirements of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_67">Section
         141</a> is imperative&amp;

         Though the Court then said that an averment in the
         complaint that the accused is a Director and in-charge of
         and responsible for the conduct of the business may be
         sufficient but this would not take away from the
         requirement that an overall reading of the complaint has

<p id="p_82">         A company, though a legal entity, can act only through

         can be prosecuted for offences by the company. But
         insofar as other Directors are concerned, they can be

         those who, at the time of the commission of the offence,
         were in charge of and were responsible for the conduct of
         the business of the company.

         (SC) : (2001) 1 SCC 1, it has been pointed out that
         three categories of persons can be discerned as brought
         within the purview of the penal liability, through the legal
         fiction envisaged in <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_84">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable
         Instruments Act. They are: (1) The company which
         committed the offence. (2) Every person who was in-
         charge of and responsible to the company for the
         conduct of the business of the company. (3) Any other
         person who is a director or a manager or a secretary or
         any officer of the company with whose connivance or
         with whose neglect the company has committed the
         offence. [Followed in <a href="/doc/326620/" id="a_85">M/s. B.S.I. Ltd v. Gift Holdings
         Pvt Ltd</a>, 2000 Cr. LJ 1424 : AIR 2000 SC 926]

         The Apex Court in the said case of Anil Hada further
         explaining the law as to the liability of the company and
         its directors, for committing offence of dishonour of
         cheque, has held that normally an offence can be
         committed by human beings who are natural persons.
         Such offence can be tried according to the procedure
         established by law. But there are offences which could be
         attributed to the juristic persons also. If the drawer of a
         cheque happens to be a juristic person like a body
         corporate it can be prosecuted for the offence under
         <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_86">Section 138</a> of the Act. Now there is no scope for doubt
         regarding that aspect in view of the clear language
         employed in <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_87">Section 141</a> of the Act. In the expanded
         ambit of the word company even firms or any other
         associations of persons are included and as a necessary
         adjunct thereof a partner of the firm is treated as a
         director of that company.
</p>
<p id="p_108">         Thus when the drawer of the cheque who falls within the
         ambit of <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_88">Section 138</a> of the Act is a human being or a
         body corporate or even a firm, prosecution proceedings
         can be initiated against such drawer. In this context the
         phrase as well as used in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_89">Section 141</a>
         of the Act has some importance. The said phrase would
         embroil the persons mentioned in the first category
         within the tentacles of the offence on a par with the
         offending company. Similarly the words shall also in sub-
         section (2) are capable of bringing the third category
         persons additionally within the dragnet of the offence on
         an equal par. The effect of reading <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_90">Section 141</a> is that
         when the company is the drawer of the cheque such
         company is the principal offender under <a href="/doc/534021/" id="a_91">Section 138</a> of

         the Act and the remaining persons are made offenders by
         virtue of the legal fiction created by the Legislature as
         per the section. Hence the actual offence should have
         been committed by the company, and then alone the
         other two categories of persons would become liable for
         the offence.

<p id="p_109">         <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_92">Section 141</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_93">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> would
         provide that if the person committing an offence under
         <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_94">Section 138</a> is a company, every person who, at the time
         the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was
         responsible to the company for the conduct of the
         business of the company, as well as the company, shall
         be deemed to be guilty of the offence. <a href="/doc/38262/" id="a_95">Section 141(2)</a>
         provides, where any offence has been committed by a
         company and it is proved that the offence has been
         committed with the consent or connivance of, or is
         attributable to, any neglect on the part of, any director,
         manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such
         director, manager secretary or other officer shall also be
         deemed to be guilty of that offence. So, the joint reading
         of the sub-sections (i)a(2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_96">Section 141</a> would make it
         clear that both the company as well as other persons who
         are connected and responsible for the conduct of the
         business of the company are liable to be proceeded.
</p>
<p id="p_110">         Where offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_97">Section 138</a> of Negotiable
         Instruments Act is committed by a company, the
         complaint must prima facie disclose the act committed
         by the Directors from which a reasonable inference of
         their vicarious liability cane be drawn. [<a href="/doc/423086/" id="a_98">Ashok
         Muthanna v. Exports Finance Ltd</a> (2001) 2 Crimes

         Vicarious liability in legal parlance means the liability of
         the master for the acts of the servant or agent done in
         the course of employment. <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_99">Section 141</a> makes a natural
         person vicariously liable for the contravention committed
         by a company provided such person has some nexus with
         the crime either because of his connivance with it or due
         to by criminal negligence which had resulted in its
         commission. No doubt the law makes the principal liable
         for the acts of his agent, but unless there is some
         absolute duty cast upon the principal, he cannot be held
         responsible for the acts of his agent. [State of

               statutes are to be construed strictly. Penal statutes
               providing constructive vicarious liability should be
               construed much more strictly. When conditions are
               prescribed for extending such constructive criminal
               liability to others, courts will insist upon strict literal
               compliance. There is no question of inferential or
               implied compliance. Therefore, a specific averment
               complying with the requirements of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_107">Section 141</a> is
               imperative. As pointed out in <a href="/doc/141294/" id="a_108">K. Srikanth Singh vs.
               North East Securities Ltd</a> - 2007 (12) SCC 788, the
               mere fact that at some point of time, an officer of a
               company had played some role in the financial
               affairs of the company, will not be sufficient to
               attract the constructive liability under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_109">Section 141</a>
               of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_112">               18 Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_110">section 141</a> provides that a
               Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer,
               though not in charge of the conduct of the business
               of the company will be liable if the offence had
               been committed with his consent or connivance or
               if the offence was a result of any 12 negligence on
               his part. The liability of persons mentioned in sub-
               section (2) is not on account of any legal fiction but
               on account of the specific part played - consent and
               connivance or negligence. If a person is to be made
               liable under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_111">section 141</a>, then it is
               necessary to aver consent and connivance, or
               negligence on his part.

<p id="p_113">               19 This takes us to the next question under sub-
               section (1) of <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_112">section 141</a>, as to (i) who are the
               persons who are responsible to the company for the
               conduct of the business of the company, and (ii)
               who could be said to be in charge and was

               conduct of the business of the company. Therefore,

               company though a legal entity can act only through
               its Board of Directors. The settled position is that a

               responsible for the company's business and affairs
               and can be prosecuted for offences by the

               concerned, they can be prosecuted only if they
               were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of
               the company's business.

               evident that a person who can be made vicariously
               liable under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_131">Section 141</a> is a

               "person in charge of the business of the company"
               was considered by this Court in <a href="/doc/50504/" id="a_132">Girdhari Lal Gupta

               control of the day to day business of the company.
               This Court pointed out that a person may be a
               director and thus belongs to the group of persons
               making the policy followed by the company, but yet
               may not be in charge of the business of the
               company; that a person may be a Manager who is
               in charge of the business but may not be in overall
               charge of the business; and that a person may be

               business of the company, neither the question of

               sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_135">section 141</a> does not arise. To put
               it differently, to be vicariously liable under sub-
               section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_136">Section 141</a>, a person should fulfill the
               'legal requirement' of being a person in law (under

               the company for the conduct of the business of the
               company and also fulfill the 'factual requirement' of

<p id="p_126">               24 Therefore, the averment in a complaint that an
               accused is a director and that he is in charge of and
               is responsible to the company for the conduct of the
               business of the company, duly affirmed in the
               sworn statement, may be sufficient for the purpose
               of issuing summons to him. But if the accused is not
               one of the persons who falls under the category of
               'persons who are responsible to the company for
               the conduct of the business of the company' (listed
               in para 14 above), then merely by stating that 'he
               was in charge of the business of the company' or by
               stating that 'he was in charge of the day to day
               management of the company' or by stating that he
               was in charge of, and was responsible to the
               company for the conduct of the business of the

<p id="p_127">               25 It should, however, be kept in view that even an

               necessary averments in the complaint as to how

</p>

<p id="p_128">               26 Another aspect that requires to be noticed is
               that only a Director, Manager, Secretary or other

               <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_142">section 141</a>. But under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_143">section
               141</a>, it is theoretically possible to make even a
               person who is not a director or officer, liable, as for
               example, a person falling under category (e) and (f)
               of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_144">section 5</a> of Companies Act, 1956. When in SMS
               Pharma (I), this Court observed that 'conversely, a
               person not holding any office or designation in a
               company may be liable if he satisfies the
               requirement of being in charge of and responsible
               for conduct of the business of the company', this
               Court obviously had in mind, persons described in
               clauses (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1230543/" id="a_145">section 5</a> of Companies Act.
               Be that as it may.

<p id="p_129">               27 The position under <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_146">section 141</a> of the Act can be
               summarized thus :
</p>

<p id="p_130">               (i) If the accused is the Managing Director or a Joint
               Managing Director, it is not necessary to make an
               averment in the complaint that he is in charge of,
               and is responsible to the company, for the conduct
               of the business of the company. It is sufficient if an
               averment is made that the accused was the
               Managing Director or Joint Managing Director at the
               relevant time. This is because the prefix `Managing'
               to the word `Director' makes it clear that they were
               in charge of and are responsible to the company,
               for the conduct of the business of the company.

<p id="p_131">               (ii) In the case of a director or an officer of the
               company who signed the cheque on behalf of the

                purity in the administration of justice and should

               Categories of Directors
               The Companies Act refers to the following two
               specific categories of Directors:
</p>

<p id="p_143">               1. Managing Directors; and
</p><p id="p_144">               2. Whole-time Directors.

<p id="p_145">               A Managing Director is a Director who has
               substantial powers of management of the affairs of
               the company subject to the superintendence,
               control and direction of the Board in question. A
               Whole-time Director includes a Director who is in
               the whole-time employment of the company,
               devotes his whole-time of working hours to the
               company in question and has a significant personal
               interest in the company as his source of income.
</p>

<p id="p_146">               Every public company and private company, which
               is a subsidiary of a public company, having a share
               capital of more than Five Crore rupees (Rs.
               5,00,00,000/-) must have a Managing or Whole-time
               Director or a Manager.

               appointment, the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_171">Companies Act</a> recognizes the
               following further types of Directors:
</p>

<p id="p_148">               1. First Directors: Subject to any regulations in the
               Articles of a company, the subscribers to the
               Memorandum of Association, or the company's
               charter or constitution ("Memorandum"), shall be
               deemed to be the Directors of the company, until

               annual general meeting ("AGM").

               office expires in the normal course, the resulting

               vacancy may, subject to the Articles, be filled by
               the Board. Such person so appointed shall hold
               office up to the time which the Director who
               vacated office would have held office if he or she
               had not so vacated such office.
</p>

<p id="p_150">               3. Additional Directors: If the Articles specifically so
               provide or enable, the Board has the discretion,
               where it feels it necessary and expedient, to
               appoint Additional Directors who will hold office
               until the next AGM. However, the number of
               Directors and Additional Directors together shall not
               exceed the maximum strength fixed in the Articles
               for the Board.
</p>

<p id="p_151">               4. Alternate Director: If so authorized by the Articles
               or by a resolution passed by the company in
               general meeting, the Board may appoint an
               Alternate Director to act for a Director ("Original
               Director"), who is absent for whatever reason for a
               minimum period of three months from the State in
               which the meetings of the Board are ordinarily held.
               Such Alternate Director will hold office until such
               period that the Original Director would have held
               his or her office. However, any provision for
               automatic re-appointment of retiring Directors
               applies to the Original Director and not to the
               Alternate Director.
</p>

<p id="p_152">               5. 'Shadow' Director: A person, who is not
               appointed to the Board, but on whose directions the
               Board is accustomed to act, is liable as a Director of
               the company, unless he or she is giving advice in
               his or her professional capacity. Thus, such a
               'shadow' Director may be treated as an 'officer in
               default' under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_172">Companies Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_153">               6. De facto Director: Where a person who is not
               actually appointed as a Director, but acts as a
               Director and is held out by the company as such,
               such person is considered as a de facto Director.

               <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_173">Companies Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_154">               7. Rotational Directors: At least two-thirds of the
               Directors of a public company or of a private
               company subsidiary of a public company have to
               retire by rotation and the term "rotational Director"
               refers to such Directors who have to retire (and
               may, subject to the Articles, be eligible for re-
               appointment) at the end of his or her tenure.
</p>

<p id="p_155">            8. Nominee Directors: They can be appointed by
               certain     shareholders,   third   parties   through
               contracts, lending public financial institutions or
               banks, or by the Central Government in case of
               oppression or mismanagement. The extent of a
               nominee Director's rights and the scope of
               supervision by the shareholders, is contained in the
               contract that enables such appointments, or (as
               appropriate) the relevant statutes applicable to
               such public financial institution or bank. However,
               nominee Directors must be particularly careful not
               to act only in the interests of their nominators, but
               must act in the best interests of the company and
               its shareholders as a whole.The fixing of liabilities
               on nominee Directors in India does not turn on the
               circumstances of their appointment or, indeed, who
               nominated them as Directors. Chapter 4 and
               Chapter 5 that follow set out certain duties and
               liabilities that apply to, or can be affixed on,
               Directors in general. Whether nominee Directors are
               required by law to discharge such duties or bear
               such liabilities will depend on the application of the
               legal provisions in question, the fiduciary duties
               involved and whether such nominee Director is to
               be regarded as being in control or in charge of the
               company and its activities. This determination
               ultimately turns on the specific facts and
               circumstances involved in each case.

               The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956,
               read with the rules and regulations made
               thereunder, requires every company desirous of
               listing its shares on a recognized Indian stock
               exchange, to execute a listing agreement
               ("Agreement") with such Indian stock exchange.
               This Agreement is in a standard format (prescribed
               by the Securities Exchange Board of India ("SEBI")),
               as amended by SEBI from time to time. The
               Agreement provides for the following further
               categories of Directors:

</p>

<p id="p_161">               Executive and non-executive Directors
               An Executive Director can be either a Whole-time
               Director of the company (i.e., one who devotes his
               whole time of working hours to the company and
               has a significant personal interest in the company
               as his source of income), or a Managing Director
               (i.e., one who is employed by the company as such
               and has substantial powers of management over
               the affairs of the company subject to the
               superintendence, direction and control of the
               Board). In contrast, a non-executive Director is a
               Director who is neither a Whole-time Director nor a
               Managing Director. Clause 49 of the Agreement
               prescribes that the Board shall have an optimum
               combination of executive and non-executive
               Directors, with not less than fifty percent (50%) of
               the Board comprising non-executive Directors.
               Where the Chairman of the Board is a non-
               executive Director, at least one-third of the Board
               should comprise independent Directors and in case
               he is an executive Director, at least half of the
               Board should comprise independent Directors.

         Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_171">                Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a
                serious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into
                motion as a matter of course. It is not that the
                complainant has to bring only two witnesses to
                support his allegations in the complaint to have the
                criminal law set into motion. The order of the
                Magistrate summoning the accused must reflect
                that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case
                and the law applicable thereto. He has to examine
                the nature of allegations made in the complaint and
                the evidence both oral and documentary in support
                thereof and would that be sufficient for the
                complainant to succeed in bringing charge home to
                the accused. It is not that the Magistrate is a silent
                spectator at the time of recording of preliminary
                evidence before summoning of the accused.
                Magistrate has to carefully scrutinise the evidence
                brought on record and may even himself put
                questions to the complainant and his witnesses to
                elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the
                allegations or otherwise and then examine if any
                offence is prima facie committed by all or any of
                the accused.

                of the recent trend found that in respect of offences
                under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_175">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments
                Act alleged against a company, all the Directors of
                the company are being routinely roped in as
                accused with a statement that they are in-charge of
                and responsible to the business of the company as
                required under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_176">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable
                Instruments Act. In fact, it has been seen that some
                times, even the nominee Directors nominated by
                the financial agencies like IDBI have also been
                arrayed as accused for the offence committed by
                the Company on the Board of which they have been
                nominated. The need to carefully scrutinize the
                material and if necessary to question the
                complainant as to the basis for implicating an
                accused as observed by the Supreme Court in the
                above cited judgment cannot be ignored.
</p>
<p id="p_173">                Considering this, it appears necessary that at any
                rate even if on the basis of formal allegations in the
                complaint such Directors have been summoned to
                face the trial, they must be afforded an opportunity
                at least at the earliest stage to show with reference
                to the material which may be placed before the
                Court that they are not in-charge of and are not
                responsible to the business of the company and on
                that basis seek their discharge from the array of the
                accused. In such cases, I think it will be a great
                injustice if they are asked to go through the ordeal
                of the trial and plead their defence only during the
                trial. [<a href="/doc/553306/" id="a_177">Om Prakash Agrawal v. State of A.P</a>.,

                Merely being a Director of the company in the
                absence of above factors will not make him liable.

<p id="p_175">                8. To launch a prosecution, therefore, against the
                alleged Directors there must be a specific allegation
                in the complaint as to the part played by them in
                the transaction. There should be clear and
                unambiguous allegation as to how the Directors are
                incharge and responsible for the conduct of the
                business of the company. The description should be
                clear. It is true that precise words from the
                provisions of the Act need not be reproduced and
                the Court can always come to a conclusion in facts
                of each case. But still in the absence of any
                averment or specific evidence the net result would
                be that complaint would not be entertainable.

                circumstances which may clearly indicate that the
                Director could not have been concerned with the
                issuance of cheques and asking him to stand the
                trial would be abuse of the process of the court.
                Despite the presence of basic averment, it may
                come to a conclusion that no case is made out
                against the Director. Take for instance a case of a
                Director suffering from a terminal illness who was
                bedridden at the relevant time or a Director who
                had resigned long before issuance of cheques. In
                such cases, if the High Court is convinced that
                prosecuting such a Director is merely an arm-
                twisting tactics, the High Court may quash the
                proceedings. It bears repetition to state that to
                establish      such       case      unimpeachable,
                uncontrovertible    evidence   which    is  beyond
                suspicion or doubt or some totally acceptable
                circumstances will have to be brought to the notice
                of the High Court. Such cases may be few and far
                between but the possibility of such a case being
                there cannot be ruled out. In the absence of such
                evidence or circumstances, complaint cannot be
                quashed;

<p id="p_178">                d) No restriction can be placed on the High Court's
                powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_182">Section 482</a> of the Code. The High
                Court always uses and must use this power
                sparingly and with great circumspection to prevent
                inter alia the abuse of the process of the Court.
                There are no fixed formulae to be followed by the
                High Court in this regard and the exercise of this
                power depends upon the facts and circumstances of
                each case. The High Court at that stage does not
                conduct a mini trial or roving inquiry, but, nothing
                prevents it from taking unimpeachable evidence or
                totally acceptable circumstances into account which
                may lead it to conclude that no trial is necessary
                qua a particular Director.

<p id="p_179">         91 In view of the above, there is no cogent material on
         record to fasten any vicarious liability so far as the other
         accused are concerned who are Non-Executive Directors
         including the Office Bearers concerned with the Accounts
         Department of the company.</p><pre id="pre_7">

                 R/SCR.A/4377/2015                                          JUDGMENT




</pre><p id="p_180">               92 The plain reading of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_183">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act would
               clearly go to show that by reason thereof, a legal fiction
               had been created. A legal fiction, as is well-known,
               although is required to be given full effect, yet has its
               own limitations. It cannot be taken recourse to for any
               purpose other than the one mentioned in the statute
               itself. <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_184">Section 138</a> of the Act moreover provides for a
               penal provision. A penal provision created by reason of a
               legal fiction must receive strict construction. Such a
               penal provision, enacted in terms of the legal fiction
               drawn, would be attracted when a cheque is returned by
               the bank unpaid. Before a proceeding thereunder is
               initiated, all the legal requirements therefor must be
               complied with. The Court must be satisfied that all the
               ingredients of commission of an offence under the said
               provision have been complied with. [See: <a href="/doc/1081906/" id="a_185">Raj Kumar
               Khurana v. State of (NCT of Delhi) and another</a>,
               (2009) 6 SCC 72]."
</p>
<p id="p_181">         10.   I also take notice of the fact that this Court quashed the
         proceedings of the criminal case referred to above so far as
         the other two independent directors are concerned, namely,
         Pradeep Krishna Prasad and Ram Singh in the Special Criminal
         Applications Nos. 5208 of 2014 and 5209 of 2014, decided on
         27th April, 2015. I am informed by Mr. Samal, the learned
         counsel appearing for the Bank that the judgment has been
         accepted and has attained finality.
</p>

<p id="p_182">         11.   In view of the above, this application succeeds and is
         hereby allowed. The proceedings of the Criminal Case No.259
         of 2012 pending in the court of the learned Metropolitan
         Magistrate, Court No.36, Ahmedabad are hereby quashed so
         far as the applicant is concerned.         The case shall now proceed
         further expeditiously in accordance with law so far as the other
         co-accused are concerned.          Rule is made absolute to the
         aforesaid extent.</p><pre id="pre_8">
