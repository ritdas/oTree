HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

AFR
 
(Judgment reserved on 15.12.2017)
 
(Judgment delivered on 31.08.2018)
 

 
Court No. - 35
 

 
Case :- WRIT - A No. - 53263 of 2015
 

 
Petitioner :- Ram Dulari
 
Respondent :- State Of U.P. &amp; 5 Others

Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.,S.M. Shukla
 

 

 

 
Hon'ble Surya Prakash Kesarwani,J.
</pre> 

 
<p id="p_1">	1. Heard Sri Yogesh Agarwal, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Ajit Kumar Singh, learned Additional Advocate General assisted by Sri I.S. Tomar, learned Additional Chief Standing Counsel for the State respondents.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">	2. This is the fourth round of litigation by the petitioner to get pension which was part of service conditions of her husband, namely Sri Nigam Singh who was working as clerk in Sunder Mundar Jaiswal Nagar Palika Inter College, Mirzapur. He retired on 30.09.1999 and died on 28.03.2010.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">	3. It appears that a Government Order No.5310/iUnzg-8-3004(2)/1974 dated 31.03.1978 was issued by the State Government and in consequence thereof, the D.I.O.S. Mirzapur vide letter No. ys[kk /15940-16019/1979-80, dated 24.01.1980, required teaching and non-teaching staff of educational institutions being run by Local Bodies to fill-up option form for provident fund and pension. Another Government Order No.4376/15-8-90/3003/(78)/90, dated 06.10.1990 was issued providing for fill up option by teaching and non-teaching staff of Educational Institutions regarding provident fund and pension. The District Inspector of Schools, Mirzapur accepted the option of teaching staff but rejected the option of non-teaching staff. Consequently, a non-teaching staff Sri Shiv Vibhuti Singh and husband of the petitioner Sri Nigam Singh filed a Writ Petition No.2213 of 1999 which was disposed of by order dated 08.02.1999. In compliance to the aforesaid order of this Court dated 08.02.1999, the option exercised by non-teaching staff was accepted by the D.I.O.S. Vide letter No.G.P.F./9855/99-2000, dated 04.12.1999. Thereafter, the provident fund of non-teaching staff including the husband of the petitioner was being deducted and deposited along with the contribution of management under the head "General Provident Fund". On retirement, on 13.09.1999, the husband of the petitioner completed formalities of his pension papers which were forwarded by the D.I.O.S. Mirzapur for sanction to the Deputy Director of Education, Vindhyachal Division, Mirzapur. The pension of aforesaid Sri Shiv Vibhuti Singh was sanctioned by Letter No.2467-2471, dated 21.11.2001 but pension papers of the husband of the petitioner was forwarded to the Directorate of Education for guidance. 	
</p> 
<p id="p_4">	4. When nothing was done by the Authorities, then the husband of the petitioner filed  Writ-A No.28706 of 2006 (<a href="/doc/146551/" id="a_1">Nigam Singh vs. State of U.P. and others</a>) which was disposed of by this Court by order dated 03.05.2011 as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_5">	"Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">	The relief prayed for in the present writ petition is for payment of pension to the petitioner who has retired from the post od clerk of a recognised and aided Intermediate College at par with the clerks of Government Colleges, who according to petitioner retire from the same post.
</p> 
<p id="p_7">	Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that although the institution was being run and managed by Nagar Palika Mirzapur the payment of salary to the staff of the institution was being released under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_2">U.P. Act</a> No. 24 of 1971 by the State Exchequer. Therefore, the retiral dues are also to be released accordingly.
</p> 
<p id="p_8">	Learned counsel for the Nagar Palika Parishad, Mirzapur Sri C.K. Parekh with reference to <a href="/doc/842876/" id="a_3">section 73</a> of the Municipalities Act and 16 H of the Intermediate Education Act and the Notifications issued (copies where of has been enclosed with the counter affidavit) contends that the retiral dues to the employees of the institution which are run by local bodies are to be determined with reference to the provisions of the U.P. Nagar Palika Non Centralised Retirement Benefit Regulation, 1984. 
</p> 
<p id="p_9">	From the facts as noticed above it is clear that the controversy involved in the present writ petition is with regard to rules which would regulate the payment of retiral dues to the employees of the recognised and aided Intermediate institution run by the Nagar Palika. According to the petitioner the Scheme which is applicable to any other recognised and aided institution would apply to the employees of the institution run by the Nagar Palika Parishad in as much as salary was being paid under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_4">U.P. Act</a> No. 24 of 1971. While according to Nagar Palika Parishad special rules framed in the matter of employees of Nagar Palika will apply.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">	I am of the considered opinion that the issues raised can be more appropriately examined by respondent no.1 at the first instance. 
</p> 
<p id="p_11">	In view of the aforesaid writ petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to make a representation ventilating all his grievances before respondent no.1 within two weeks from today alongwith certified copy of this order. On such representation being made, respondent no.1 shall consider and decide the same by means of a reasoned speaking order, preferably within six weeks after affording opportunity of hearing to the Nagar Palika.
</p> 
<p id="p_12">	All consequential action shall be taken immediately thereafter. In order to avoid any such controversy in future the State Government may also issue a circular in respect of payment of retiral dues to the employees of the Intermediate institutions run by the Nagar Palika Parishads."
</p> 
<p id="p_13">(Emphasis supplied by me)
 

 
</p><p id="p_14">	5. Pursuant to the afore-quoted order of this Court dated 03.05.2011, the petitioner filed a detailed representation before the Secretary Education (Madhyamik), Government of U.P. Lucknow narrating the facts as aforementioned. This representation of the petitioner was disposed of by order dated 15.12.2012 observing that the provisions of the Intermediate Education Act, 1921, is not applicable to non-teaching staff of educational institutions being run by Local Bodies rather they shall be governed by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1986722/" id="a_5">Municipalities Act</a>. 
</p> 
<p id="p_15">	6. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed Writ-A No.39062 of 2012 (<a href="/doc/470443/" id="a_6">Ram Dulari vs. State of U.P. and others</a>), which was disposed of by order dated 29.11.2012 as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_16">	"In the present case, husband of petitioner namely Nigam Singh had earlier filed Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 28706 of 2006 and said writ petition had been decided on 3.5.2011 and pursuant thereto representation in question has been decided. Petitioner submits that pension is liable to be paid by the State Government and in this regard there is judgment rendered in W.P. No. 3925 of 2006. Against the same special appeal had been filed, but with no interim order. State Government based on the same, on 25.4.2012 has proceeded to pass order mentioning therein that pension shall be payable, but same shall be subject to the decision of special appeal. Petitioner submits that she is entitled for pension from the office of the District Inspector of Schools and coupled with this qua managerial contribution matter has already been decided by this court in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 75746 of 2005 (Smt. Shanti Solanki Vs. State of U.P. and others) and this Court on 06.09.2006 has struck down the condition imposed in the Government Order dated 26.07.2001 wherein cut of date has been fixed for depositing management contribution and directives have been issued therein giving permission to the petitioners of the aforesaid writ petition to deposit the management contribution together with interest within a period of six weeks,
 
	Consequently, District Inspector of Schools, Mirzapur is directed to see and ensure that final decision is taken on the same in the light of decision of Government Order dated 25.4.2012 and judgment rendered in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 75746 of 2005 (Smt. Shanti Solanki Vs. State of U.P. and others) decided on 06.09.2006, preferably within period of next three months from the date of production of certified copy of this order. 
</p> 
<p id="p_17">With these observations, writ petition is disposed of." 
</p> 
<p id="p_18">(Emphasis supplied by me)
 

 
</p><p id="p_19">	7. It shall not be out of place to mention that the question of payment of pension to non-teaching staff of Educational Institutions being run by the Nagarpalika Soron, District Etah came for consideration before this Court in Writ-A No.3925 of 2006 (<a href="/doc/187320238/" id="a_7">Shyam Lal and another vs. State of U.P. and others</a>), which was allowed by order dated 17.01.2011 as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_20">	"1. Both the petitioners are employees of Sant Tulsi Das Municipal Inter College, Soron, District Etah (hereinafter referred to as the "College"). The petitioner no. 1 was working as Chowkidar having been appointed on 05.08.1966 and on attaining the age of superannuation retired on 28.02.2000. The petitioner no. 2 was appointed as Mali on 10.08.1966 and on attaining the age of superannuation retired on 31.01.2002. Since thereafter both the petitioners made strenuous efforts to get their retiral benefits running between the State Government and Municipal Board, Etah but having failed to get retiral benefits approached this Court by means of the present writ petition where an order was issued on 12.12.2005 by the Assistant District Inspector of Schools, Etah informing the Manager/Principal of the College that the College in question is governed by local body whereupon U.P. Municipalities Act, 1916 (hereinafter referred to as the "1916 Act") is applicable and, therefore, pension of non teaching staff of the said institution is not payable by educational department but has to be paid by Nagar Palika, therefore, pension papers are being returned.
</p> 
<p id="p_21">	2. The petitioners have sought a writ of certiorari for quashing the order dated 12.12.2005 and also a writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to pay pension and other retiral benefits forthwith.
</p> 
<p id="p_22">	3. On behalf of respondents no. 1 to 4 a counter affidavit has been filed stating that by Government Order dated 18.10.1982 issued to Officer In-charge, Nagar Palika, Auraiyya informing that the Government Notification dated 13.06.1909 as amended partially on 12.07.1982 provides that the institutions run by local bodies shall not be governed by provisions of Intermediate Education Act, 1921 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act, 1921") in respect to the appointment, funds and other conditions of service and such employees will be governed by 1916 Act and the Rules framed thereunder. They also admits that one employee, namely, Sri Jagdish Parashar, a Head Clerk of the College in question though was sanctioned payment of pension by the Government by letter dated 03.08.2005 but it was made clear that it shall not be treated as a precedent. To the same effect is a letter dated 21.03.2006 issued by the Director of Education, U.P., Allahabad informing all educational authorities that the retired employees of colleges maintained by local bodies shall not be entitled for payment by the Government but shall be governed by rules and regulations applicable to Nagar Palika employees.
</p> 
<p id="p_23">	4. The petitioners have specifically stated in paras 18, 19 and 20 of the writ petition that U. P. High Schools and Intermediate Colleges (Payment of Salaries of Teachers and other <a href="/doc/88376/" id="a_8">Employees) Act</a>, 1971 (hereinafter referred to as '1971 Act') is applicable upon the various schools run by Nagar Palika in the State of U.P. and petitioners' College was also governed by said Act and salary was paid to petitioners through the office of respondent no. 4 by applying provisions of 1971 Act.
</p> 
<p id="p_24">	5. These submissions have been replied in para 12 of the counter affidavit which reads as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_25">	^^12- ;g fd ;kfpdk ds izLrj 18] 19] 20] 21] 22 ds mRrj esa ;g dguk gS fd ikfydk }kjk lapkfyr ek/;fed fo|ky;ksa esa dk;Zjr f'k{k.ksRrj deZpkfj;ksa dks ek= osru forj.k dh f'k{kk foHkkx }kjk fu;ekuqlkj fd;k tk jgk gSA f'k{k.ksRrj deZpkfj;ksa dh vU; lsok 'krsZa iwoZ izLrj esa of.kZr 'kklu ds i= fn0 18-10-1982 ds vuqikyu esa uxj ikfydk vf/kfu;e 1916 ds vUrxZr cuk;h x;h lsok fu;ekoyh dh lsok 'krsZ ykxw gSaA**
 
</p><p id="p_26">	6. In para 14 of counter affidavit the respondents have also admitted that the provident fund is deducted by educational authorities though the amount of group insurance it is alleged that deducted by Nagar Palika. 
</p> 
<p id="p_27">	7. The only question up for consideration, therefore, is whether pension to petitioners is payable by State Government or by Nagar Palika, Soron, District Etah. 
</p> 
<p id="p_28">	8. <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_9">Section 73</a> of 1916 Act reads as under: 
</p> 
<p id="p_29">	"73. Appointment, etc., of servants on the educational establishment.--(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), the appointment of persons on the educational establishment of a Municipality shall be made by such authority as may be specified in this behalf by the State Government, and different authorities may be specified for different classes of posts on the establishment. 
</p> 
<p id="p_30">	(2) The State Government may make rules regulating the recruitment, punishment, appeal and other conditions of service of persons appointed to the educational establishment of a Municipality.
</p> 
<p id="p_31">	Provided that the appointment of a teacher or Head of an institution shall be governed by the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973, or the Intermediate Education Act, 1921, as the case may be." 
</p> 
<p id="p_32">	9. Proviso to sub-section 2 of Section 73 was inserted by <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_10">U.P. Act</a> No. 10 of 1978 make it clear that appointment of teaching staff of an institution established by Municipality shall be governed by provisions of Act, 1921. The power has been conferred upon the State Government to make rules regulating recruitment, punishment and other conditions of service of staff of educational establishment of a municipality unlike the Regulations framing power conferred under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_11">Section 297</a> upon a Municipality governing the conditions of service of all servants of a Municipality. A pervasive control, therefore, has been given to State Government by virtue of <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_12">Section 73</a> of 1916 Act in respect to employees of educational establishment of a Municipality. This is further fortified from the fact that for the purpose of application of payment of salary the employees of institution in question are governed by provisions of 1971 Act which has not been disputed by respondents. The amount of provident fund is also deducted by educational authorities and deposited into funds as decided by the Government like the funds of other Government servants. The letter dated 18.10.1982 appears to have been issued with reference to some notification of 1909 without looking to the fact that <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_13">Section 73</a> as it stands today was substituted by <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_14">U.P. Act</a> No. 7 of 1953 and proviso to sub-<a href="/doc/34705/" id="a_15">section 2</a> was inserted by <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_16">U.P. Act</a> No. 10 of 1978. It does not appear that while issuing aforesaid letter dated 18.10.1982 the aforesaid provisions were taken into consideration by the authorities concerned. It further refers to <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_17">Section 16-K(3)</a> of Act, 1921 though no such provision exist either in the Act, 1921 or 1916 Act.
</p> 
<p id="p_33">	10. <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_18">Section 16-H</a> of Act, 1921 confers power upon the Government to exclude certain institutions from being governed by certain provisions of Act, 1921 and reads as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_34">	"16-H. Exemption of certain classes of institutions from the operation of certain sections.--(1) The provisions of <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_19">Sections 16-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_20">16-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_21">16-C</a>, sub-section (2) to sub-section (13) of <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_22">Section 16-D</a> and <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_23">Sections 16-E</a>, <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_24">16-F</a> and <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_25">16-G</a> shall not apply to recognised institutions maintained by the State Government or the Central Government. 
</p> 
<p id="p_35">	(2) In the case of recognised institutions maintained by a local body, the State Government may declare that all or any of the provisions referred to in sub-section (1) shall not apply or shall apply subject to such alterations, modifications or additions as it may make and the provisions, if any, so made applicable, shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force." 
</p> 
<p id="p_36">	11. It is not shown that in exercise of such powers any order was issued with reference to institution in question or the institutions maintained by local body. Moreover, the exemption contemplated under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_26">Section 16-H(2)</a> is in reference to only limited provisions, i.e., 16-A, 16-B, 16-C, 16-D (2 to 13), 16-E, 16-F and 16-G and not to the other provisions of Act, 1921. After insertion of proviso to sub-section 2 of Section 73 of 1916 Act it is now absolutely clear that entire provisions of Act, 1921 are applicable to an institution of Municipality.
</p> 
<p id="p_37">	12. Moreover the letter dated 18.10.1982 is not a Government Order applicable to all institutions of Municipalities but even otherwise is confined to only Nagar Palika Auraiyya. There is nothing to show that any provision was made under any statutory provision by the State Government making only Nagar Palika responsible for payment of retiral benefits of educational institutions of Nagar Palika even though the institution is governed by 1971 Act. In absence of any provisions shown to this Court, I am not inclined to accept the defence of respondents that in view of letter dated 18.10.1982 the retiral benefits of petitioners are not payable by the State Government. 
</p> 
<p id="p_38">	13. Learned counsel for the respondent at this stage contended whether the petitioners were governed by provisions pertaining to provident fund or contributory provident fund is not clear and, therefore, whether petitioners were entitled for pension cannot be stated at this stage.
</p> 
<p id="p_39">	14. However, in the counter affidavit no such dispute has been raised that the petitioners are not entitled for payment of any retiral benefits and the only defence taken therein relying on the letter dated 18.10.1982 that it is the liability of Nagar Palika concerned. As already discussed above, this Court is not inclined to accept the above defence taken by respondents. 
</p> 
<p id="p_40">	15. In the result, the writ petition is allowed. The impugned order dated 12.12.2005 is hereby quashed.

Lucknow, all Divisional Joint Director of Education U.P., all Divisional Deputy Director of Education of U.P. and all D.I.O.Ss. in U.P. that the pension to non-teaching staff of Educational Institutions being run by Local Bodies shall be sanctioned by the Secondary Education Department.

<p id="p_58">	14.

</p> 
<p id="p_59">	15. Being extremely harassed and finding herself totally helpless, the petitioner widow lady has filed the present writ petition to continue with her struggle to get her pension, and prayed as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_60">	"i) issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned communication/ order dated 05.08.2015 passed by the Deputy Director of Education, Vindhyachal Mandal, Mirzapur (Annexure No.1 to the Writ Petition)

</p> 
<p id="p_63">	iv) award cost of the instant writ petition in favour of the petitioner"
</p> 

 
<p id="p_64">	16. It appears from the order dated 31.07.2017 passed in this writ petition that the State-Respondents again attempted to dispute the payment of pension by the Education Department to non-teaching staff of Educational Institutions being run by the Local Bodies. A counter affidavit dated 14.01.2016 was filed by one Sri Shamim Ahmad Khan, Accounts Officer in the office of Joint Director of Education, Vindhyachal Region, Mirzapur which itself evidences the harassing attitude adopted by the authorities. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_65">	17. Thereafter, this Court passed an order in this writ petition on 20.04.2017 expressing displeasure on the conduct of the authorities.
</p> 
<p id="p_66">	18. Thereafter, Sri Sanjay Agarwal, Additional Chief Secretary, Secondary Education, Government of U.P. filed an affidavit dated 17.08.2017 in which he admitted the knowledge of filing of various writ petitions from time to time by the husband of the petitioner and after his death, by the petitioner and the orders passed therein. He stated in paragraphs 20, 21, 22 and 23 as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_67">	"20. That, in view of the aforesaid order dated 22.06.2012, the papers pertaining to pension of late Nigam Singh were sent for sanction to the Executive Officer, Nagar Palika Parishad, Meerzapur.
</p> 
<p id="p_68">	21. That, in pursuance of the directions issued vide order no.1371 dated 11.08.2017, Government Order No.552 dated 25.04.2012 (Shiksha Anubhag-12) as also the order passed by this Hon'ble Court in Special Appeal No.902/2011 titled as Principal Secretary, Madhyamik Shiksha Vs. Shyam Lal and others, the family pension to the petitioner has been sanctioned. True copy of the letter No.1670 dated 12.08.2017, letter No.1664-1668 dated 11.08.2017 alongwith letter Nos.1669 dated 11.08.2017 are being filed herewith collectively and marked as Annexure No.1 to this affidavit.
</p> 
<p id="p_69">	22. That, in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances as stated hereinabove, it is respectfully submitted that the pension of late Nigam Singh and the family pension of the petitioner alongwith commutation has been sanctioned and has been sent to the Treasury for payment. 
</p> 
<p id="p_70">	23. That, the deponent tenders his unconditional apology for the inconvenience caused to this Hon'ble Court as the same was unintentional."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_71">	19. Thus, after about 19 years of journey of harassment and arbitrary actions of the State-Respondents and after the petitioner lost her husband, she was sanctioned the pension which was her statutory right. In the afore-noted background of facts and the submissions made by learned counsels for the parties, this Court passed the order dated 04.10.2017 as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_72">	"Learned standing counsel states that pursuant to the order dated 20.4.2017 an affidavit of compliance has been filed on 18.8.2017 which is not on record. Office is directed to trace it out and place it on record.
</p> 
<p id="p_73">	Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the husband of the petitioner had retired in the year 1999 who pursued the matter for several years to get pension but despite orders of this court pension was not paid by the State-respondents. Her husband died on 28.3.2010. Thereafter, she also filed writ petition and despite orders of this court the pension was not paid to her. It is only when the order dated 20.4.2017 was passed by this court, the respondents paid pension in August 2017. During this long span of about 18 years the petitioner and her husband have been harassed by the respondents by not granting pension. The petitioner and her husband spent lot of time and money for statutory right of pension being part of conditions of service. He, therefore, submits that accountability of the officers and employees of the State Government should be fixed, heavy cost be imposed and the interest may also be awarded to the petitioner in view of the law laid down by this Court in the Case of M/s. Ansal Housing and Construction Limited Vs. State of U.P. 2014(10) ADJ 348, (which was affirmed by Hon'ble Supreme Court) and Dnyandeo Sabaji Naik Vs. Pradnya Prakash Khadekar, 2017(5)SCC 496.
</p> 
<p id="p_74">	He further submits that the conduct of the authorities itself is not only in breach of the State litigation policy as well the National Litigation Policy but also requires consideration by this Court to ask the State Government as to whether any statutory provisions, guidelines or policy have been framed to protect its own people from the arbitrary actions of authorities and employees coupled with their accountability and also to compensate people for the harassment and loss being caused by them. He further submits that for such actions of the State-respondents cost and interest deserves to be awarded but instead of burdening the State exchequer, such cost and interest deserves to be recovered from the erring officers and employees in view of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. Vs. Atma Singh Grewal 2014 (13) SCC 666 and the judgment of this Court in First Appeal Defective No.292 of 2016, decided on 8.9.2016.
</p> 
<p id="p_75">	Learned standing counsel prays for and is granted a week's time to enable the respondent no.1 to file his personal affidavit specifically on the points/submissions noted above.
</p> 
<p id="p_76">	Put up on 11.10.2017.
</p> 
<p id="p_77">	Learned Advocate General/Additional Advocate General is requested to assist in the matter on the next date fixed.
</p> 
<p id="p_78">	Let a copy of this order be given free of cost to the learned Chief Standing Counsel within 24 hours for communication to the State Government and to do the needful. "
</p> 

 
<p id="p_79">	20. There was absolutely no dispute that pension was payable husband of the to the petitioner. The only dispute raised by the respondents was that the pension is payable by the Local Body under the Local Bodies Department of the State Government and not by the Education Department of the State Government since the Educational Institution in question, although regulated and governed by the provisions of U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921; was being run by a Local Body. Thus, in any case, the matter could have been easily clarified/ resolved by the State Government itself but instead of helping the retired deceased employee to get pension being the only source of his livelihood and after his death to her widow i.e. the petitioner, the State-Respondents continuously acted arbitrarily and continued to cause harassment. What is more alarming is that even after the clear position of law as reflected by the provisions of U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921 and explained by this Court in the case of Shyam Lal and another (supra) and various orders passed by this Court in four writ petitions filed by the petitioner or her deceased husband, the State-Respondents continued with their arbitrary approach causing harassment and irreparable loss to the petitioner. 
</p> 
<p id="p_80">	21. In the case of <a href="/doc/1375046/" id="a_32">Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K. Gupta</a> (1994) 1 SCC 243 (Paras-8, 10 and 11), Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the question of imposition of cost/ compensation and recovery thereof from the erring officers and held as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_81">	"8..........................Under our Constitution sovereignty vests in the people. Every limb of the constitutional machinery is obliged to be people oriented. No functionary in exercise of statutory power can claim immunity, except to the extent protected by the statute itself. Public authorities acting in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions oppressively are accountable for their behaviour before authorities created under the statute like the commission or the courts entrusted with responsibility of maintaining the rule of law.................................
</p> 
<p id="p_82">	10..........................The jurisdiction and power of the courts to indemnify a citizen for injury suffered due to abuse of power by public authorities is founded as observed by Lord Hailsham in Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Broome, 1972 AC 1027 : (1972) 1 All ER 801 on the principle that, an award of exemplary damages can serve a useful purpose in vindicating the strength of law'. An ordinary citizen or a common man is hardly equipped to match the might of the State or its instrumentalities. That is provided by the rule of law. It acts as a check on arbitrary and capricious exercise of power. In Rookes v. Barnard, 1964 AC 1129 : (1964) 1 All ER 367, 410 it was observed by Lord Devlin, 'the servants of the government are also the servants of the people and the use of their power must always be subordinate to their duty of service'. A public functionary if he acts maliciously or oppressively and the exercise of power results in harassment and agony then it is not an exercise of power but its abuse. No law provides protection against it. He who is responsible for it must suffer it. Compensation or damage as explained earlier may arise even when the officer discharges his duty honestly and bona fide. But when it arises due to arbitrary or capricious behaviour then it loses its individual character and assumes social significance. Harassment of a common man by public authorities is socially abhorring and legally impermissible. It may harm him personally but the injury to society is far more grievous. Crime and corruption thrive and prosper in the society due to lack of public resistance. Nothing is more damaging than the feeling of helplessness. An ordinary citizen instead of complaining and fighting succumbs to the pressure of undesirable functioning in offices instead of standing against it. Therefore the award of compensation for harassment by public authorities not only compensates the individual, satisfies him personally but helps in curing social evil. It may result in improving the work culture and help in changing the outlook. Wade in his book Administrative Law has observed that it is to the credit of public authorities that there are simply few reported English decisions on this form of malpractice, namely, misfeasance in public offices which includes malicious use of power, deliberate maladministration and perhaps also other unlawful acts causing injury. One of the reasons for this appears to be development of law which, apart, from other factors succeeded in keeping a salutary check on the functioning in the government or semi-govemment offices by holding the officers personally responsible for their capricious or even ultra vires action resulting in injury or loss to a citizen by awarding damages against them. .................................
</p> 
<p id="p_83">	11.................................... In a modern society no authority can arrogate to itself the power to act in a manner which is arbitrary. It is unfortunate that matters which require immediate attention linger on and the man in the street is made to run from one end to other with no result. The culture of window clearance appears to be totally dead. Even in ordinary matters a common man who has neither the political backing nor the financial strength to match the inaction in public oriented departments gets frustrated and it erodes the credibility in the system. Public administration, no doubt involves a vast amount of administrative discretion which shields the action of administrative authority. But where it is found that exercise of discretion was mala fide and the complainant is entitled to compensation for mental and physical harassment then the officer can no more claim to be under protective cover. When a citizen seeks to recover compensation from a public authority in respect of injuries suffered by him for capricious exercise of power and the National Commission finds it duly proved then it has a statutory obligation to award the same. It was never more necessary than today when even social obligations are regulated by grant of statutory powers. The test of permissive form of grant is over. It is now imperative and implicit in the exercise of power that it should be for the sake of society. When the court directs payment of damages or compensation against the State the ultimate sufferer is the common man. It is the tax payers' money which is paid for inaction of those who are entrusted under the Act to discharge their duties in accordance with law. It is, therefore, necessary that the Commission when it is satisfied that a complainant is entitled to compensation for harassment or mental agony or oppression, which finding of course should be recorded carefully on material and convincing circumstances and not lightly, then it should further direct the department concerned to pay the amount to the complainant from the public fund immediately but to recover the same from those who are found responsible for such unpardonable behaviour by dividing it proportionately where there are more than one functionaries.

<p id="p_84">	22. In this backdrop, this court passed a detailed order dated 11.10.2017 and required the respondent No.1 to answer the following questions:
</p> 

 
<p id="p_85">	(i) Whether any statutory provisions, guidelines or policy have been framed by the State Government to protect its own people from the arbitrary actions of authorities and employees coupled with their accountability and also to compensate people for the harassment and loss caused by them.
</p> 
<p id="p_86">	(ii) Why cost and interest be not awarded and instead of burdening the State exchequer, such costs and interest be not recovered from the erring officers and employees in view of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd.

</p> 
<p id="p_87">	(iii) Whether the conduct of the State-Respondents in dragging the petitioner in litigation for more than 19 years to get her undisputed statutory pension, is in breach of the State Litigation Policy and the settled law? 
</p> 
	
 
<p id="p_88">23. An affidavit of compliance was filed by the respondent No.1 on 24.10.2017 to answer the above noted questions which was not found satisfactory. Therefore, this court directed the respondent Nos.7 and 8, namely the Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. Lucknow and the Principal Secretary (Law), Government of U.P. Lucknow, to answer the following questions:
</p> 
<p id="p_89">"1. Whether any statutory provisions, guidelines or policy have been enacted/framed by the State Government to protect its own people from the arbitrary actions or inaction of authorities and employees or abuse of power by them coupled with their accountability and also to compensate people for the harassment and loss caused by them? 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_90">2.Whether in public interest and to protect its own people, the State Government proposes to enact/frame law as mentioned in question No.1 above? 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_91">3.Why cost and interest be not awarded and instead of burdening the State exchequer, such costs and interest be not recovered from the erring officers and employees in view of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. Vs. Atma Singh Grewal, (2014) 13 SCC 666? 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_92">4. Whether the conduct of the State-Respondents in dragging the petitioner uncalled for in litigation for more than 19 years to get her undisputed statutory pension, is arbitrary and resulted in abuse of power?
</p> 

 
<p id="p_93">5. Whether respective Administrative Departments under Section 3 of the Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam 2011 read with Notification No.375/91-2013 dated 27.11.2013 issued thereunder have nominated first Appellate Officers/Second Appellate Officers/Revising Officers and communicated it to the Public Services Management Department, Uttar Pradesh?

<p id="p_94">6. Whether any penalty under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_33">Section 7(1)</a>/(2) has been imposed and compensation under sub-Section(3) has been granted so far to any person ? If answer is in affirmative, disclose details of any one month of the year 2017. 
</p> 
<p id="p_95">7. Whether any Rules under Section 7(10) of the Adhiniyam 2011, have been framed? "
</p> 

 
<p id="p_96">24. Thereafter the matter was heard at length on 15.11.2017, 14.12.2017 and 15.12.2017. The learned Additional Advocate General made a statement which was noted in the order dated 15.12.2017, as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_97">"Learned Additional Advocate General submits that the State Government shall take all possible steps for enactment of a law with reference to point nos. 1,2 and 3 mentioned in the order dated 1.11.2017. Since the matter has already been sufficiently heard and as such the judgment may be reserved and liberty may be granted to the State respondent to bring on record the report of the Committee constituted under the aforesaid notification dated 14.12.2017 and a copy of enactment if it is legislated, by means of a written submission, within eight weeks.
</p> 
<p id="p_98">Written submission as requested by the learned Additional Advocate General shall be filed within eight weeks from today.
</p> 
<p id="p_99">In view of the aforesaid, Judgement is reserved."
</p> 

 
<p id="p_100">25. A report of the Committee as constituted under the Notification dated 14.12.2017 was filed along with an affidavit dated 17.02.2018 on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 7, which was belatedly placed on record of the present writ petition. The aforesaid committee has expressed opinion that there is no need to enact a law with reference to point Nos.1, 2 and 3 of the Order dated 24.10.2017. However, in the aforesaid affidavit dated 17.02.2018 filed on behalf of the State Government it has not been stated that the report of the committee dated 02.02.2018 has been accepted. On 15.12.2017, a statement was made by the learned Additional Advocate General that the State Government shall take all possible steps for enactment of a law with reference to point No.1, 2 and 3. Therefore, the report of the committee dated 02.02.2018 filed along with the affidavit dated 17.02.2018 is rejected. 
</p> 
<p id="p_101">	26. Much emphasis has been laid by the State Government on the averments made in para-7 of the personal affidavit of Sri Rajive Kumar, Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. Lucknow dated 14.12.2017 that "The Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2011 has also been enacted by the State Government with the purpose to protect its own people from arbitrary action or inaction of the authorities and employees coupled with their accountability." He stated in paras-7, 9, 14 and 15, as under:
</p> 
<p id="p_102">	"7. That in the aforesaid meeting, serious discussions were made on the points and it was concluded that Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2011 has also been enacted by the state government with the purpose to protect its own people from the arbitrary action or inaction of the authorities and employees coupled with their accountability. It was also decided in the meeting that vide circulation/ publication of the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2011 by department of public service management (Lok Seva Prabandhan) is necessary, so that the public at large might come to know the same. Accordingly based on this decision taken in meeting dated 06-12-2017 advertisements were published in 134 news papers for wide publicity of provisions of Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2011.
</p> 
<p id="p_103">9. That it is further submitted with regards to point no.2 whether in public interest and to protect it's own people, the State Government proposes to enact/ frame law it is to submit that initially under the ambit of Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2011, only 139 serves of 30 departments and 10 services of all other departments (total 149 services) were notified. Thereafter recently the State Government of UP vide notification dated 27.10.2017 and 31.10.2017, has increased through notification, 88 services under the ambit of this adhiniyam. Thus at present, 227 services of 33 departments and 10 services of all departments i.e. total 237 services have been notified under this Adhiniyam, 2011.

<p id="p_106">"Right to Public Services" Legislation in India:
</p> 

 
<p id="p_107">27. 'Citizen's Charter' to strive for a sustained improvement in the quality of public services provided to the citizens was introduced by Government of India in 1997 which was voluntary in character. To improve public service delivery, a service excellence model called 'Sevottam' was initiated in 2005 to give a new thrust to the implementation of Citizen's Charter. Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) was launched in the year 2007. To equip public with the statutory right to get delivery of services within stipulated time,  The Right of Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of their Grievances Bill, 2011 (Bill No.131 of 2011) was introduced in the Lok Sabha in the year 2011 but it lapsed. In the meantime, "Right to public services legislations" were legislated by several States, the first being the State of Madhya Pradesh, followed by State of Bihar, N.C.T. of Delhi, State of Punjab, Rajsthan, Himanchal Pradesh, Kerla, Uttarkhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Odissa, and Jharkhand etc. The State of Madhya Pradesh enacted the Madhya Pradesh Lok Sewaon Ke Pradan Ki Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2010 and it saw path-breaking success and received The UNPSA Award in the year 2012 which is most prestigious international recognition of excellence in public service. Delhi Government enacted the Delhi (Right of Citizens to Time Bound Delivery of Services) Act 2011 and introduced e-monitoring of services with facility to citizens to track their applications and electronic disposal of works and monitoring so as keep a check on the non-performing departments and staff. The Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2011 was enacted by the U.P. Legislature with the Statement of Objects and Reasons, as under:-
</p> 
<p id="p_108">"For the delivery of Public Services provided by various departments of the Uttar Pradesh Government generally no time-limit was fixed and neither the competent officers for delivery of such services within stipulated time-limit were properly designated nor their responsibilities were fixed, due to which the people of the State were facing difficulties. It was, therefore, decided to make a law to provide for the delivery of services to the people of the State within stipulated time-limit and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto."

</p><p id="p_358">	30. Sections 4 and 5 of The Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Adhiniyam, 2011, mandates that the designated officer to acknowledge the applications and either to provide the services within the stipulated time or to reject the application recording reasons in writing and intimate it to the applicant. Section 6 of the Adhiniyam 2011 provides for appeal within 30 days before the first appeal officer and thereafter, a second appeal within 60 days before the second appellate authority.  Under sub-section (5) of Section 6 of the Adhiniyam, an application may be submitted directly to the first appeal officer in the event the designated officer or the authorised officer, as the case may be does not acknowledge the application under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_61">Section 6</a>. Under clause (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 6 of the Adhiniyam, an application may be submitted directly to the second appellate authority in the event the designated officer does not comply with the order of providing service. 
</p> 
<p id="p_359">	31. Power to impose penalty has been conferred only upon the second appellate authority under Section 7 of the Adhiniyam, 2011. Sub-Section (1) provides for a lump sump penalty being minimum Rs.500/- and maximum Rs.5000/- by the second appellate authority in the event of failure of the designated officer to provide service without sufficient and reasonable cause. Sub-section (2) has conferred power upon the second appellate to impose penalty of not less than Rs.500/- and not more than Rs.5000/- in the event the first appeal officer has failed to decide the appeal within the stipulated time limit without any sufficient and reasonable cause. Sub-section (3) empowers the second Appellate Authority to grant compensation to the Appellant not exceeding the penalty imposed under sub-Section (1) and Sub-Section (2). Sub-section (4) confers power upon the second appellate authority to recommend disciplinary action against the designated officer or the first appeal officer where designated officer or first appeal officer has failed to discharge duties under the Act. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_360">	32. Affidavits filed by the Chief Secretary and the Additional Chief Secretary show that no penalty under Section 7 of the Adhiniyam has been imposed so far either upon any designated officer or upon any first appeal officer in any matter covered by Notifications under Section 3 of the Adhiniyam 2011. This shows that the officers and employees of various departments of the State Government have no will to implement provisions of the Adhiniyam 2011 and which could not achieve any result so far.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_361">	33. The sufferer of the high-handedness and inaction of the government officers and employees, are ordinary citizen or a common man who is hardly equipped to match the might of the State or its instrumentalities. Sovereignty vests in the people. Every limb of the constitutional machinery is obliged to be people oriented. Public authorities acting in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions oppressively are accountable for their behaviour. Servants of the government are in fact servants of the people. Therefore, the use of their power must always be subordinate to their duty of service. If a public functionary acts maliciously or oppressively and the exercise of power results in harassment and agony then it is not an exercise of power but it is abuse of power for which the law does not protect them and they must suffer. Harassment of a common man by public authorities is socially abhorring and legally impermissible which not only causes harm to him individually but also causes more grievous injury to the society. 
</p> 

 
<p id="p_362">	34. The provisions of Adhiniyam 2011 have limited application. It does not operate against higher rank officers including the officers at the Government level. It also does not have any inbuilt mechanism for monitoring timely disposal of applications by the designated officer and appeals  by  the  first  appeal officer  or  the  second  appellate authority under Sections, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Adhiniyam, 2011. Apart from usual protection under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_62">Section 9</a>, the officers and employees have been protected from penal action under Section 7 of the Adhiniyam, 2011 on the ground of "sufficient and reasonable cause" for failure to provide service. No guidelines have been provided under the Adhiniyam or the Rules for "sufficient and reasonable cause". There is need to  provide  more  effective  provisions  and  to implement the provisions in more potent and fruitful manner as has also been expressed by the Chief Secretary in para-7 and 14 of his affidavit dated 14.12.2017 which shall not only compensate the individuals and satisfy them personally but shall also help in curing social evil and the prevailing situation of frustration amongst people which erodes the credibility in the system.
</p> 

 
<p id="p_363">Conclusion:-
</p> 

 
<p id="p_364">	35. In view of the above discussion, the writ petition is allowed with costs of Rs.5000/- which shall be paid by the State-respondents to the petitioner within one month. The petitioner shall also be entitled for simple interest @ 8% per annum on delayed payment of pension/ family pension, in terms of the judgment of this court dated 17.01.2011 in Writ-A No.3925 of 2006 (<a href="/doc/883858/" id="a_63">Shyam Lal and others vs. State of U.P. and others</a>) quoted in para-7 above. Since order for pension has now been passed by the State authorities, therefore, no further order is required to be passed at this stage. Considering the prevailing grave situation of helplessness of ordinary citizen, following directions are issued:-
</p> 
<p id="p_365">	(i) The State Government shall immediately take effective steps to make the Adhiniyam, 2011, more effective and powerful and shall immediately take all possible steps to implement it particularly in the light of the aforequoted averments made in paras-7 and 14 of the affidavit of the Chief Secretary dated 14.12.2017 that The Adhiniyam, 2011 has been enacted by the State to protect its own people from arbitrary action or inaction of the authorities and employees coupled with their accountability AND that the Government is committed to make the Adhiniyam, 2011 more effective and powerful, and will implement penalty provision of the Adhiniyam in more potent and fruitful manner.
</p> 
<p id="p_366">	(ii) Every designated officer under <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_64">Section 3</a>, every first appeal officer and every second appellate authority under Section 6 of the Adhiniyam, 2011 shall compulsorily maintain regularly the register under Rule 16 of the Uttar Pradesh Janhit Guarantee Rules, 2011. Failure to do so shall be treated as dereliction in duty and accordingly disciplinary proceeding shall immediately be initiated against the officer by the Competent Authority. 
</p> 
<p id="p_367">	(iii) As early as possible preferably within three months, the State Government shall introduce a system to ensure that within the time stipulated for services provided in the notifications under <a href="/doc/799347/" id="a_65">Section 3</a>, message through electronic medium shall be send by the concerned designated officer/ first appeal officer/ second appellate authority to every applicants on their mobile number giving status of their applications/ appeals and in case of rejection or non-disposal thereof, the Applicants/ Appellants shall also be apprised of their right of appeal under Section 6 of the Adhiniyam, 2011.
</p> 
<p id="p_368">	(iv)  As early as possible, the State Government shall develop mechanism preferably by e-governance for regular monitoring of applications and appeals pending beyond the stipulated time limit and facility for tracking of Applications/ Appeals by Applicants/ Appellants. Till this is done, monthly status report of all applications and appeals pending beyond the stipulated time limit under Sections 3 and 6 of the Adhiniyam, 2011, shall be submitted in the first week of the following month by each designated officer, the first appeal officer and the second appellate authority to the State Government or to an officer/ officers authorised by it who shall ensure that necessary action is taken immediately.
</p> 
<p id="p_369">	(v) The Chief Secretary of the Government of U.P. and the Principal Secretary of Lok Sewa Prabhandan Vibhag shall send copies of this order to all the District Magistrates in the State of Uttar Pradesh for apprising  the Employees' Associations, Bar Associations including Tehsil Bar Associations, Trade Associations, Labour/ Trade Unions and other Associations of people, for awareness about right of people to receive notified services within stipulated time and the provisions of Appeal and Penalty under the Adhiniyam, 2011. 
</p> 
<p id="p_370">	(vi) The State Government shall ensure that within three months, the relevant portion of the Notifications under Section 3 of the Adhiniyam 2011 relating to each notified department along with provisions of appeal under <a href="/doc/1490821/" id="a_66">Section 6</a> and penalty under Section 7 of the Adhiniyam, 2011, are displayed in Hindi at appropriate places easily accessible to public in the campus of concerned offices, for awareness amongst people about their right to receive notified services within stipulated time.  
</p> 
<p id="p_371">	36. Let a copy of this order be sent by the Registrar General of this Court to the Chief Secretary of the Government of Uttar Pradesh to ensure compliance of the directions given above. 
</p> 
<p id="p_372">Order Date :- 31.08.2018
