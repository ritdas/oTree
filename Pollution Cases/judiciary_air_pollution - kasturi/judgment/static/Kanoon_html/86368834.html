     THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, NAGARATHNA .J, MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.    This Writ Petition is sought to be filed in public interest

assailing the Final Notification dated 05.11.2012 issued by

respondent No.5 - Deputy Commissioner, Shimoga District,

Shimoga (Annexure-N) and order dated 16.01.2013 which is

at Annexure-T.     Relief is also sought with regard to quashing

of licenses issued by respondent No.5, which are at Annexures

T.1 to T.8.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Petitioners claim to be the residents of Mathikoppa

Malavalli of Masagalli village, Bheemanakere post, Hosanagara

Taluk, Shimoga District, owning agricultural lands around the

safer zone. That survey No.16 of Masagalli village which was

a gomal land was de-reserved and has been notified as the

safer zone area.    This has been pursuant to the order of this

Court in WP No.17087/1997 dated 10.07.1998, pursuant to

which the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011

(for short 'the Act') was promulgated and thereafter the Rules

were also framed. Section 6 of the Act deals with the

conditions for grant of license.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               -7-</span><p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">3.    The grievance of the petitioners is that, respondent No.5

</p><p id="p_6">- Deputy Commissioner has notified the safer zone to an

extent of 15 acres in Sy No.16 without hearing the villagers

and that the safer zone is located in gomal land.     The further

grievance of the petitioners is that, identification of the safer

zone is in close proximity to various establishments such as

Government School, Anganavadi Kendra, residential area and

reserved forest. It is under these circumstances that the Final

Notification dated 05.11.2012 (Annexure-N) with regard to

location of safer zone has been assailed.


</p><p id="p_7">4.    Statement of objections has been filed on behalf of

respondent Nos.1 to 3 and 5 to 8.           It is stated that the

challenge has been made repeatedly to the location of safer

zone in the instant case. That initially one Dyavappa Gowda

had preferred WP No.13695/2013 opposing the constitution of

the safer zone. That Writ Petition was not pressed and it was

dismissed on 09.04.2013.       That the petitioners herein are

acting at the behest of certain vested interests.           That

petitioner No.1 herein is preferring this Writ Petition at the

behest of Dyavappa Gowda. In fact, another petition in WP

No.41820/2012 was filed challenging the very proposal to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                -8-</span>


identify and establish the safer zone. In that Writ Petition, the

son of Dyavappa Gowda, one Veerendra was petitioner No.2.

That Writ Petition was withdrawn on 02.08.2013.          That this is

the third time these petitioners have filed the Writ Petition

once-again assailing the location of safer zone in the area.       It

is also stated that petitioner No.1 is a chronic litigant and

these Writ Petitions are not filed with a     bona fide object in

mind, but with an oblique motive.       It is also averred that as

against petitioner No.3, an FIR in Crime No.14/2012 has been

registered   in   Hosanagara   Police    Station   and    that   the

prosecution is pending.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.    The statement of objections also narrates that Sy.No.16

is measuring 334 acres and that a meager extent of 15 acres

has been notified as a safer zone for stone crushing units

having regard to Section 6 of the Act.     That Writ Petitions are

filed with mala fide intent and with an oblique motive in order

to thwart the location of safer zone in the area.          It is also

averred that the location of safer zone is having regard to the

parameters mentioned in Section 6 of the Act. The fact that

there are also certain quarries operating in the said survey

numbers has not been objected to by the petitioners.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              -9-</span>


Contending that the procedure laid down under the Act has

been followed in identifying the safer zone, respondent Nos.1

to 3 and 5 to 8 have sought dismissal of the Writ Petition.   No

rejoinder has been filed by the petitioners to the statement of

objections filed by respondent Nos.1 to 3 and 5 to 8 denying

the averments made against them in the statement of

objections.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.    We have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and

learned Additional Government Advocate for respondent Nos.1

to 3 and 5 to 8 and perused the material on record. No relief

has been sought as against respondent No.4 - Karnataka

State Pollution Control Board.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7.    Section 6 of the Act deals with the manner in which the

license has to be granted under the Act while setting up a

stone crusher unit. It mandates that the stone crushing unit

cannot be established outside the safer zone.     No two safer

zones can be located within a radius of fifty kilometers.

Section 6 of the Act reads as under;

</p><p id="p_32">8.    In the instant case, it is noted that initially three areas

were identified for the location of safer zones in Masagalli

village.   After obtaining the requisite permission from the

Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, as well as, 'No

Objection' from the Forest Department, the safer zone was

located at Sy.No.16, which is a Government gomal land to an

extent of 15 acres. Thereafter, licences in respect of various

parcels of that land has been granted to certain persons for

the establishment of stone crusher units, subject to certain

terms and conditions.     In this regard, the communication

dated 07.08.2012 made by the Deputy Commissioner to the

Member Secretary, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is

perused. It is stated therein that Sy.No.16 of Masagalli Village

is totally 334 acres in extent which is gomal land and out of

that an extent of 15 acres was being set apart for location of

the safer zone. The reasons as to why the relaxation had to

be made for locating the safer zone in Sy.No.16 are stated in

that communication.     Thereafter, on approval being granted

by   the   Karnataka    State    Pollution    Control   Board,   the

Notification dated 05.11.2012 was issued by the Deputy

Commissioner with regard to location of the safer zone. The

said notification has been issued after obtaining clearance

from both respondents Karnataka State Pollution Control

Board and Deputy Conservator of Forest. The clearance given

by the Board is not assailed in this Writ Petition


</p><p id="p_35">9.    On   consideration   of    the     averments   made   by   the

petitioners in their Writ Petitions and also the objections filed

on behalf of respondent Nos.1 to 3 and 5 to 8, it is noted that

for the third time the location of safer zone in Sy.No.16 of

Masagalli village has been assailed before this Court.           The

contents of statement of objections clearly indicate that these

Writ Petitions have not been filed with a bona fide intent, but

at the instance of certain vested interests who had earlier

assailed the setting up of safer zone and had not pursued the

Writ Petitions.   The averments made against the petitioners

have not been countered by them by filing any rejoinder.

That apart, we find that respondent No.5 has taken note of

the parameters set in <a href="/doc/160985695/" id="a_3">Section 6</a> of the Act and has issued the

final notification for locating the safer zone in Sy.No.16.

Annexure-E, which is the communication issued by respondent

No.5-Deputy Commissioner to the Karnataka State Pollution

Control Board, states at para-2(c), the reasons as to why the

relaxation have been made. The Pollution Control Board has

considered this and has approved the location of the safer

zone.   In that view of the matter, it would not be proper for

this Court to sit in judgment over what has been stated by the

authorities and approved by the Pollution Control Board.

Therefore, we find that the Writ Petition has to be dismissed

not only for being a motivated petition and not in public

interest, but also on merits. Accordingly, the Writ Petition is

dismissed. However, we refrain from imposing costs.
