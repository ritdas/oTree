                     Dated, this the 12th day of November, 2007

                                    JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">H.L.Dattu, C.J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        This appeal arises out of an order passed by the learned Single Judge

in W.P.(C) No.18107 of 2006 dated 26th March, 2007. By the impugned order,

the learned Single Judge has confirmed the orders passed by the Tribunal and

has further directed the third respondent         Grama       Panchayat   to issue

appropriate licence to the 5th respondent to run his crushing unit within the limits

of the Valakom Grama Panchayat.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        (2) This litigation has a chequered career. Initially, the Panchayat had

granted permission to the 5th respondent to start his crushing unit within the

limits of the Valakom Grama Panchayat. After change of the composition of

the Panchayat, they have cancelled the permission granted earlier. The 5th

respondent was made to run from pillar to the post. Every time whenever the

Panchayat passed orders refusing to grant permission to the 5th respondent to

run his crushing unit, he had to approach the various authorities.

</p><p id="p_4">        (3)  Since the third respondent Grama Panchayat refused to grant

renewal of the licence to the 5th respondent to commence his crushing unit, he

had to file an appeal before the Tribunal for Local Self Government

Instututions. The Tribunal is not only a fact finding authority, but also can

decide the question of law. During the pendency of the appeal before the

Tribunal, the Tribunal had appointed an advocate as Court Commissioner who

in turn has submitted a report before the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_5">        (4)  The Tribunal taking into consideration the report of the Court

W.A.No.2283/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              2</span>

Commissioner and also taking into consideration the assertions and allegations

made by the petitioners and its denial by the 5th respondent, has thought it fit

to direct the Grama Panchayat to grant permission to the 5th respondent to run

his crushing unit in Valakom Grama Panchayat. Aggrieved by the said order

passed by the Tribunal, the petitioners were before this Court in W.P.(C)

No.18107 of 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        (5) The learned Single Judge of this Court after tracing the history of

the case and also the various orders passed by the Grama Panchayat and the

Tribunal, has thought it fit to direct the Grama Panchayat to issue appropriate

licence to the 5th respondent to run his crushing unit.       The Court also has

directed the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to have effected inspections

of the crushing unit of the 5th respondent in regard to the air, noise and water

pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        (6) Aggrieved by the orders passed by the learned Single Judge, the

petitioners in the writ petition have presented this writ appeal before us.

</p><p id="p_8">        (7)  Sri.K.Ramakumar, learned counsel appearing for the appellants

would submit that for enhancing the crushing capacity of the crushing unit,

necessary permission requires to be obtained by the 5th respondent from the

Grama Panchayat as well as the Pollution Control Board, and since that has not

been obtained, the learned Single Judge was not justified in directing the

Grama Panchayat to issue necessary licence.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        (8) Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the 5th respondent would

submit that the 5th respondent has no intention whatsoever to increase the

crushing capacity of the crushing unit and therefore, the question of obtaining

fresh permission from the Grama Panchayat and the Pollution Control Board

W.A.No.2283/2007
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                             3</span>

would not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        (9) The learned Single Judge in his order at paragraph 8 has specifically

observed that the 5th respondent has not increased the crushing capacity of the

crusher unit.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        (10) The 5th respondent had commenced the crushing unit some time in

the year 1992. In between, he had abandoned the crushing unit. After some

time, in the year 2004, he sought for renewal of the licence to run the crushing

unit.   The Grama Panchayat initially had granted permission to the 5th

respondent to run his crushing unit. The change of composition of the Grama

Panchayat has resulted in withdrawing the permission granted earlier. That is

how then 5th respondent had to approach the Tribunal. As we have already

noticed, the Tribunal taking into consideration the report of the Court

Commissioner and further being of the opinion that if a direction is issued to the

Grama Panchayat to permit the 5th respondent to run his crushing unit in

Valakom Grama Panchayat it would not cause any prejudice to the petitioners,

has accordingly passed an order. The order so passed by the Tribunal is

confirmed by the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        (11) Since the 5th respondent is not seeking for enhancement of the

crushing capacity of the crushing unit, the question of obtaining a fresh licence

either from the Grama Panchayat or from the Pollution Control Board would not

arise. In that view of the matter, we do not see any error in the orders passed

by the learned Single Judge which would call for our interference.       Therefore,

while affirming the reasons and the conclusions reached by the learned Single

Judge, we reject the writ appeal.   We make it clear that the Pollution Control

Board will take effective steps to monitor the crushing unit of the 5th respondent.

If, for any reason, the crushing unit of the 5th respondent causes any air, noise

or water pollution, the Pollution Control Board would take effective steps as

provided under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974.
