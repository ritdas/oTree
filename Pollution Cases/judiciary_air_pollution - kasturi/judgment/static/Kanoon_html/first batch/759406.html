<p id="p_1">      By sale deed No. 3242/99 of S.R.O, Tripunithura the petitioner

purchased 5.4 cents of land in survey no. 1199/2 of of Nadama Desom

on 16-12-1999. The said 5.4 cents of land was part of 23 cents. In

respect of the balance property, the 4th respondent acquired rights

and started a hospital therein. For the purposes of treating waste

water from the hospital, the 4th respondent started construction of a

waste water treatment plant, for which an underground tank was to

be constructed. It is while the 4th respondent was constructing that

tank, the petitioner has filed this original petition challenging the

same. According to the petitioner, the establishment of the waste

water treatment plant very near to the petitioner's house would cause

inconvenience to the petitioner,         insofar as    it is likely to cause

pollution.    Complaints were filed by the petitioner before the

Municipality and other authorities. Initially, there was a stop memo

issued by the Municipality.            But, ultimately, by Ext. P6, the

Tripunithura Municipality granted permission to the 4th respondent to

complete the construction on condition that the 4th respondent obtains

consent from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board for operating

the plant. The petitioner is challenging Ext. P6 order seeking the

following reliefs:
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "i.    Issue a writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ, order or
     direction quashing Ext. P6.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     ii.    Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ,
     order or direction commanding respondents 1           to 3 to take
     immediate steps to close down the Waste Water Treatment Plant
     referred to in Exts.P2 to P5 being constructed by the 4th
     respondent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     iii.   Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ,
     order or direction commanding the 3rd respondent to consider and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">O.P.. No. 3685/2003                  -: 2 :-</span>

      take appropriate action on Ext. P5 within a time limit to be
      specified by this Hon'ble Court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      iv.    Pass an order of injunction restraining the 4th respondent or
      any others under him or for him from constructing or using the
      Waste Water treatment plant mentioned in Exts.P2 to P5 pending
      disposal of the O.P."</blockquote><p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">      2. According to the petitioner, the waste water treatment plant

is constructed against the provisions of the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_1">Environment Protection

Act</a>, 1986 and Rules, the Water (Prevention and control of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Pollution)

Act</a>, 1974 and Rules and the Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control of Pollution)

Act</a>, 1981 and Rules.          The petitioner also alleges that although

ostentatiously the plant is for treating waste water, the real intention

of the hospital is to dump all bio-medical waste therein.

</p><p id="p_5">      3. The respondents have filed two counter affidavits and have

now produced documents in support of the contention that the waste

water treatment plant would not cause any pollution to anybody and

that the same is being constructed after obtaining consent from the

Pollution Control Board. The Pollution Control Board has also filed a

counter affidavit wherein, they have stated that if the 4th respondent

complies with the conditions specified in the consent, no pollution

would be caused to the petitioner's well or the environment due to the

working of the sewage treatment plant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4. I have considered the rival contentions in detail.

</p><p id="p_7">      5. The original petition was filed on 31-3-2003. Much water has

flown under the bridge over the past 7 years. In fact, the petitioner

herself has leased out the building adjacent to the 4th respondent's

hospital, wherein the petitioner alleges likelihood of pollution and

they are using the said building including the well as is evident from

Ext. R4(d) lease deed executed by the petitioner in favour of the 4th

respondent. The contention of the petitioner in the original petition is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O.P.. No. 3685/2003               -: 3 :-</span>

that the waste water treatment plant of the 4th respondent would

cause pollution to the well of the petitioner. The petitioner has not

produced any material before me to show that the water in the well

of the petitioner is already contaminated because of the waste water

treatment plant established by the 4th respondent. On the other hand,

the Pollution Control Board has been renewing the consent issued to

the 4th respondent, the latest of which is produced as Ext. R4(c), is

valid up to 30-6-2012. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary

produced by the petitioner, I cannot enter a finding that the waste

water treatment plant established by the 4th respondent would cause

pollution to the water of the petitioner's well.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      6. The petitioner raises a contention that the 4th respondent has

not obtained permission under Section 448 of the Kerala Municipality

Act. But, such a contention was not raised in the original petition at

all. For the first time, the petitioner is raising that contention at the

time of hearing the original petition today. I do not think that the 4th

respondent is expected to answer that contention at this late stage,

which is not supported by any pleadings in the original petition.

Therefore, I am not inclined to consider that contention in this original

petition.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      In view of my above findings, there is no merit in the original

petition and accordingly the same is dismissed.
</p>
