1977: Section 3 and Schedule I--Cess--Levy and collection of
Industry  manufacturing Rayon Grade pulp--Neither  chemical,
textile nor paper industry.
%

of--No	room  for any intendment--No  equity  about  tax--No

HEADNOTE:
    The	   respondent,	 Andhra	  Pradesh    Rayons    Ltd.,
manufacturing  Rayon  Grade Pulp, a base  material  for	 the
manufacture of synthetics or man-made fabrics, was  assessed
by the petitioner under the provisions of Water	 (Prevention
and <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Cess Act</a>, 1977 which provided	 for
levy  and  collection  of  Water  cess	from  the  specified
industries  enumerated in Schedule I of the Act. On  appeal,
the  Appellate	 late  Committee  confirmed  the  order	  of
assessment   on	  the  ground  that   the   respondent	 was
manufacturing Rayon Grade Pulp which came under the category
of Textile industry.
    The	  respondent  filed  a	writ  in  the	High   Court
challenging  the levy Inter alia on the ground that  it	 was
not  one  of the industries mentioned in the  Schedule.	 The
High Court upheld this contention.
    Before this Court, it was sought to be canvessed by	 the
petitioner that Rayon Grade Pulp was covered either by	Item
No. 7 of the Schedule, which was chemical industry, or	item
No.  10 which was textile industry, or item No.11 which	 was
paper industry.
Dismissing the petition, it was,
						   PG NO 380
						   PG NO 381
    HELD:  (I)	The  Act  being fiscal	in  nature  must  be
strictly construed. The question as to what is covered	must
be  found  out from the language according  to	its  natural
meaning, fairly and squarely read. [385F; 386B]
    (2)	 In a taxing Act one has to look merely at  what  is
clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There  is
no  equity about a tax, there is no presumption as  to	tax.
Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. [385H]
    (3) Whether a particular industry is an industry covered
in  Schedule  I	 has  to be judged  normally  by  what	that
industry  produces  mainly,  its  predominant  purpose	 and
process,  and  not by any ancillary  or	 incidental  process
carried on by it. [386D]
    (4)	 Chemical  process would be involved  to  a  certain
extent,	 more  or less in all industries,  but	an  industry
would  be  known as a chemical industry if  it	carries	 out
predominantly	chemical  activities  and  is  involved	  in
chemical endeavours. [386E]
    (5)	 Taxing consideration may stem	from  administrative
experience  and	 other	factors of  life  and  not  artistic
visualisation  or  neat	 logic and so  the  literal,  though
pedestrian, interpretation must prevail. [386C]
    (6) One of the well recognised canons of construction is
that  the  legislature	speaks its mind by  use	 of  correct
expression and unless there is any ambiguity in the language
of   the   provision  the   Court  should   accept   literal
construction if it does not lead to an absurdity. [387E]
    (7)	 There	is  no absurdity  in  the  literal  meaning.
Broadly	 and literally it can be said that the	Rayon  Grade
Pulp  is neither chemical industry nor textile industry	 nor
paper industry. [387G;386H]

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">    CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave Petition (C)
No. 8566 of 1988.
</p><p id="p_2">    From  the  Judgment	 and Order dated  9.10.1987  of	 the
Andhra Pradesh High Court in W.P. No. 306 of 1983.
    R. Mohan for the Petitioner.
</p><p id="p_3">    The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
    SABYASACHI	MUKHARJI, J. This petition is for  leave  to
appeal	under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_8">Article	136</a> of	the  Constitution  from	 the
judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated
9th  October, 1987. The question that was urged	 before	 the
High Court and the question which is sought to be raised  in
this petition is whether the respondent Pradesh Rayons	Ltd.
which is manufacturing Rayon Grade Pulp, a base material for
manufacturing  of  synthetics  or  manmade  fabrics  is	  an
industry as mentioned in Schedule I of the Water (Prevention
and  Control of Pollution) cess Act, 1977 for  the  purposes
of  levy of Water Cess under the Act. The water	 (Prevention
and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_9">Control  Of  Pollution) Act</a>, 1974	was  passed  by	 the
Parliament  to	"provide for the prevention and	 control  of
water	pollution  and	the  maintaining  or  restoring	  of
wholesomeness  of water, for the establishment, with a	view
to  carrying out the purposes aforesaid, of Boards  for	 the
prevention and control of water pollution, for conferring on
and  assigning to such Boards powers and functions  relating
thereto	 and  for  matters  connected  therewith".  For	 the
aforesaid  purposes, the Act contemplated creation of  State
Boards at State level and the Central Board at the  national
level.	Thereafter,  the Water (Prevention  and	 <a href="/doc/1940190/" id="a_10">Control  of
Pollution)  Cess Act</a>, 1977 being Act 36 of 1977	 was  passed
(hereinafter called 'the Act'). The preamble to the said Act
states	that the said Act was "to provide for the  levy	 and
collection  of a cess on water consumed by persons  carrying
on certain industries and by local authorities, with a	view
to augment the resources of the Central Board and the  State
						   PG NO 383
Boards	for  the prevention and control of  water  pollution
constituted  under  the	 Water (Prevention  and	 <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_11">Control  of
Pollution)  Act</a>, 1974". Therefore, the said Act	 was  passed
only for the purpose of providing for levy and collection of
cess  on  water	 consumed by  persons  carrying	 on  certain
industries  with  a  view to augment the  resources  of	 the
Central Board and the State Boards. <a href="/doc/885113/" id="a_12">Section 2(c)</a>  stipulates
A  `specified  industry'  means any  industry  specified  in
Schedule T. <a href="/doc/1632123/" id="a_13">Section 3</a> provides as follows:
</p><p id="p_4">    "3.	 Levy  and collection of cess.--(1) There  shall  be
levied	and collected a cess for the purposes of  the  Water
(Preven-tion  and  <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_14">Control  of	Pollution)  Act</a>,  1974	 and
utilisation thereunder.
</p><p id="p_5">    (2) The cess under sub-section ( I) shall be payable by-
</p><p id="p_6">    (a) every person carrying on any specified industry; and
</p><p id="p_7">    (b) every local authority,
    and	 shall	be  calculated on the  basis  of  the  water
consumed by such person or local authority, as the case	 may
be,  for  any  of the purposes specified in  column  (1)  of
Schedule II, at such rate, not exceeding the rate  specified
in  the	 corresponding entry in column (2) thereof,  as	 the
Central	 Government  may, by notification  in  the  Official
Gazette, from time to time, specify."
</p><p id="p_8">    Therefore, this section provides for levy and collection
of  cess  from the specified industries. Specified  industry
is one which is mentioned in Schedule I which is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    "1. Ferrous metallurgical industry.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">    2. Non-ferrous metallurgical industry.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">    8. Ceramic industry.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">						   PG NO 384
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">    9. Cement industry.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">    15. Processing of animal or vegetable products industry."</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">    Therefore, the short question, is, whether the  industry
run  by the respondent herein for manufacturing Rayon  Grade
Pulp, a base material for manufacture of synthetics or	man-
made fabrics is one of the industries mentioned in  Schedule
I hereinbefore.
</p><p id="p_10">    In	this case, the respondent company was registered  as
company	 in  1975.  The	 supply of  energy  to	the  company
commenced  on August 22, 1981 and the production began	from
September 1, 1981. The company manufactures rayon grade pulp
of  26250  tonnes per annum. The Company was served  with  a
notice on 12th August, 1981 to furnish the quantum of  water
consumed for assessment under the Act. Based on the  returns
filed  by the respondent as required under section <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_15">S of	 the
Act</a>,  assessment  of water cess was made by an	order  dated
31st  December	1981.  Aggrieved  by  the  said	 order	 the
respondent  filed an appeal before the	Appellate  Committee
constituted  under the Act. The Appellate committee  by	 its
order dated 30th November, 1982 conformed the orders of	 the
assessment  passed by the petitioner. Before  the  Appellate
Committee  various  contentions were urged and only  one  of
such  contention  survives now and is  agitated	 before	 us,
namely, that the Rayon Industry is nOt included in  Schedule
I of the said Act. The Appellate Committee by its order said
as follows:
</p><p id="p_11">    "We	 are unable to agree with the arguments advanced  by
the learned counsel. The appellant industry is manufacturing
Rayon  Grade Pulp which comes under the category of  textile
industry as it involves the production of Rayon Grade  Pulp.
a  base	 material for manufacture of synthetic	of  man-made
fibres.''
						   PG NO 385
    From  the  aforesaid,  it  appears	that  the  Appellate
Committee  was	of the view that the respondent	 herein	 was
manufacturing  Rayon  Grade  Pulp  which  comes	 under	 the
category  of  Textile mentioned in Schedule I  of  the	Act.
Textile	 industry is item No. 10 in the aforesaid  Schedule.
Aggrieved  by the decision of the Appellate  Committee,	 the
respondent  herein  filed  writ	 petition  challenging	 the
constitutional	validity of the Act as well as the  levy  of
cess  on  water	 on the ground that it was not	one  of	 the
industries mentioned in the Schedule. The High Court by	 its
order  dated  9th  October,  1987  rejected  the  contention
relating  to  the  constitutional validity  but	 upheld	 the
contention  that  the  respondent's  industry  was  not	  an
industry  which is mentioned in Schedule I and as  such	 was
not  liable  to	 pay  cess.  It	 is  the  propriety  or	 the
correctness of that decision which is sought to be canvassed
before	us  by this petition. It must,	therefore,  be	made
clear  that  we are not concerned with	the  correctness  or
otherwise  of  the  decision of the  High  Court  about	 the
constitutional validity of the Act in question. That is	 not
at  issue  before us since the	petitioner,  Andhra  Pradesh
State  Board for Prevention and Control of  Water  Pollution
has  not  challenged  that finding.  The  only	question  is
whether	 the respondent is an industry as mentioned  in	 the
aforesaid schedule. The High Court in the impugned  judgment
has held that Rayon Grade Pulp is not covered by any of	 the
items specified in the said Schedule. We are of the  opinion
that the High Court was right. Before us it was sought to be
canvassed  that Rayon Grade Pulp is covered either  by	Item
No. 7 which is chemical industry or 13y item No. 10 which is
textile industry or item No. I1 which is paper industry.  We
are unable to accept the contention.
</p><p id="p_12">    It	has to be borne in mind that this Act with which  we
are concerned is an Act imposing liability for cess. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_16">The Act</a>
is  fiscal in nature. <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_17">The Act</a> must, therefore,	be  strictly
construed  in  order  to find out  whether  a  liability  is
fastened on a particular industry. The subject is not to  be
taxed  without clear words for that purpose; and  also	that
every  Act  of	Parliament must be  read  according  to	 its
natural	 construction of words. See the observations  in  Re
Micklethwait,	[1885]	11  EX	452,  456.  Also   see	 the
observations  in  Tenant v. Smith, [1892] AC  150  and	Lord
Halsbury's   observations   at	page  154.  See	  also	 the
observations  of Lord Simonds in St. Aubyn v. AG,  [1951]  2
All E.R. 473 at 485. Justice Rowlatt of England said a	long
time  ago,  that in a taxing ACt one has to look  merely  at
what  is clearly said. There is no room for any	 intendment.
There  is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption  at
to tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be  implied.
One  has  to  look  fairly at the  language  used.  See	 the
observations  in Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC, [1921]J 1  KB
						   PG NO 386
64  at 71. This Court has also reiterated the same  view  in
<a href="/doc/1338548/" id="a_18">Gursahai Saigal v. C.I.T. Punjab</a>, [1963] 3 SCR 893; <a href="/doc/386457/" id="a_19">S.L.  T.

[1977] 1 SCR 9.
</p><p id="p_13">    The	 question  as to what is covered must be  found	 out
from  the language according to its natural  meaning  fairly
and  squarely read. See the observations in IRC v.  Duke  of
Westminster,  [1936]  AC I at 24, and of this Court in	<a href="/doc/1350547/" id="a_21">A  V
Fernandez  v. The State of Kerala</a>, [1957] SCR  837.  Justice
Krishna Iyer of this Court in <a href="/doc/1983544/" id="a_22">Martand Dairy &amp; Farm v.  Union
of  India</a>,  [1975] Suppl. SCR 265 has observed	that  taxing
consideration  may stem from administrative  experience	 and
other factors of life and not artistic visualisation or neat
logic and so the literal, though pedestrian,  interpretation
must prevail.
</p><p id="p_14">    In this case where the question is whether a  particular
industry is an industry as covered in Schedule I of the Act,
it has to be judged normally by what that industry  produces
mainly.	 Every industry carries out multifarious  activities
to  reach  its goal through  various  multifarious  methods.
Whether	 a  particular industry falls within  the  realm  of
taxation,  must	 be judged by the  predominant	purpose	 and
process	 and  not  by any ancillary  or	 incidental  process
carried on by a particular industry in running its business.
    Chemical process would be involved to a certain  extent,
more  or  less in all industries, but an industry  would  be
known as a chemical industry if it carries out predominantly
chemical activities and is involved in chemical endeavours.
    We fail to see that Rayon Grade Pulp could be considered
even  remotely connected as such with chemical	industry  or
textile	 industry  or paper industry. In  all  preparations,
there is certain chemical process but that does not make all
industries  chemical industries. The  expression  "chemical"
means,	 according  to	Collins	 English   Dictionary.	 any
substance  used	 in or resulting from a	 reaction  involving
changes	 to  atoms or molecules or used	 in  chemistry.	 The
Concise	 Oxford	 Dictionary, 8th Edition  page	170  defines
"chemical''  as made by or relating to,	 chemistry.  Broadly
and literally, in our opinion, it can be said that the Rayon
Grade Pulp is neither chemical industry nor textile industry
nor  paper  industry. We find it difficult on  a  broad	 and
literal construction to bring the industry of the respondent
into  any of these categories. In other words, to  find	 out
the  intention of the legislation, if possible it should  be
						   PG NO 387
found  out  from  the language used in case  of	 doubt.	 The
purpose	 of legislation should be sought for to clarify	 the
ambiguity  only,  if  any. The	fairest	 and  most  rational
method,	 says  Blackstone,  to interpret  the  will  of	 the
legislator  is by exploring his intentions at the time	when
the  law was made, by signs the most natural  and  probable.
And  these  signs  are either the words,  the  context,	 the
subject	 matter, the effects and consequence, or the  spirit
and  reason  of	 the law. See Commentaries on  the  Laws  of
England	 by  Blackstone (facsimile of 1st edition  of  1765,
University of Chicago Press, 1979 Vol. 1 p. 59.). The  words
are  generally	to be understood `in their  usual  and	most
known  signification', although terms of art `must be  taken
according  to the acceptation of the learning in  each	art,
trade  and science. If words happen still to be dubious,  we
may establish their meaning from the context, which includes
the  preamble  to  the statute and laws	 made  by  the	same
legislator  on	the  same subject. Words are  always  to  be
understood  as	having regard to the subject matter  of	 the
legislation. See Cross Statutory Interpretation, 2nd Edition
page 21.
</p><p id="p_15">    This  Court	 in Lt Col. Prithi Pal Singh  Bedi  etc.  v.
Union  of India &amp; Ors., [1983] I S.C.R. 393 at page  404  of
the   report  reiterated  that	the  dominant	purpose	  in
construing  a statute is to ascertain the intention  of	 the
Parliament.   One   of	the  well   recognised	 canons	  of
construction is that the legislature speaks its mind by	 use
of  correct expression and unless there is any ambiguity  in
the language of the provision the Court should adopt literal
construction if it does not lead to an absurdity. Therefore,
the  first  question  to be posed is whether  there  is	 any
ambiguity  in the language used. If there is none, it  would
mean  the language used, speaks the mind of  Parliament	 and
there  is  no need to look somewhere else  to  discover	 the
intention  or meaning. If the literal construction leads  to
an absurdity, external aids to construction can be  resorted
to. To ascertain the literal meaning it is equally necessary
first  to ascertain the juxtaposition in which the  rule  is
placed,	 the purpose for which it is enacted and the  object
which it is required to subserve and the authority by  which
the rule is framed.
</p><p id="p_16">    Bearing  the aforesaid principle in mind, we  find	that
there is no absurdity in the literal meaning. The purpose of
the Act is to realise money from those whose activities lead
to  pollution  and  who	 must  bear  the  expenses  of	 the
maintenance  and running of the State Board. It is a  fiscal
provision  and	must,  therefore,  not	only  be   literally
construed  but also be strictly construed. Having regard  to
the literal expression used and bearing in mind the  purpose
for  the  legislation, we arrive at a  result  that  certain
						   PG NO 388
industries  have to pay the expenses of the maintenance	 and
functioning  of the State Boards. Considering the  principle
broadly and from commonsense point of view, we find  nothing
to warrant the conclusion that Rayon Grade Pulp is  included
in  either of the industries as canvassed on behalf  of	 the
petitioner  here  and  as  held by the	High  Court  in	 the
judgment under appeal.
</p><p id="p_17">    In	this case, we must also note that neither the  water
Pollution  Board nor any authorities under the Act  nor	 the
High  Court proceeded on any evidence how these	 expressions
are  used  in the particular industry or understood  in	 the
trade	generally.   In	 other	words,	 no   principle	  of
understanding  in  "common  parlance"  is  involved  in	 the
instance case.
</p><p id="p_18">    In	that view of the matter, we are of the opinion	that
the  contention	 sought	 for  by the  petitioner  is  of  no
substance.
</p><p id="p_19">    Our	 attention, however, was drawn to the decision of  a
learned	 single	 Judge of the High Court of Kerala  in	<a href="/doc/251686/" id="a_23">M/s.
Gwalior	 Rayon	Silk  Mfg. (Wvg.) Co. Ltd.,  Mavoor  v.	 The
Appellate  Committee</a> for Water Cess, Trivandrum and  others,
A.I.R.	1983 Kerala 110. There, the learned single Judge  of
the  Kerala  High  Court held  that  industry  manufacturing
rayon-grade  pulp is chemical industry. The High  Court	 has
observed  that the product of the Pulp Division of  a  rayon
silk  manufacturing company is rayon-grade  pulp,  extracted
from  bamboo  or wood. The High Court noted  that  the	pulp
produced  in  the Pulp Division of the company	is  the	 raw
material  for  the  Staple Fibre Division.  The	 High  Court
further	 observed  that the pulp in question is	 a  chemical
used as chemical raw material, in the form known as chemical
cellulose,  for preparation of fibres. The High Court  noted
that  for  the	scientist cellulose  is	 a  carbohydrate  an
organic compound, a saccharide and for the layman also it is
a  chemical  like salt and sugar. Manufacture of  pulp	from
wood  or bamboo involves consumption of large quantities  of
water  which  get  polluted in the  process;  and  "chemical
industry'' in the context in which it is used in Schedule  I
of the Act, can therefore, include an industry manufacturing
rayon-grade pulp. We are unable, with respect, to accept the
circuitous process of reasoning of the Kerala High Court. As
mentioned  hereinbefore,  looked  at  from  this  circuitous
method	every industry would be chemical industry. It  could
not  have  been	 the intention	to  include  all  industries
because every industry has to go to certain chemical process
more  or less and, therefore, it could not be so  construed.
Such expression should, therefore, be construed	 reasonably,
strictly  and  from a commonsense point of  view.  The	High
						   PG NO 389
Court  of  Kerala  has	set out in  the	 said  judgment	 the
company's case in that case which also produced Rayon  Grade
Pulp  and  the	manufacturing  process	consisted  only	  of
isolating cellulose present in bamboo and wood by removal of
"lignin" and other contents, and that the resultant  product
is  not	 chemical  cellulose. It explained  the	 process  as
under:
</p><p id="p_20">    "The  actual process of manufacture of Rayon grade	pulp
is by feeding the raw materials on the conveyors leading  to
the  chippers, where they are chipped into small  pieces  in
uniform sizes. The raw materials are washed by a  continuous
stream	of  water  before they are  fed	 into  chippers	 for
removal	 of their adhering mud and dirt. The chips are	then
conveyed  into Digesters, where they are subjected  to	acid
pre-hydrolysis,	 using dilute sulphuric acid  solution.	 The
spent  liquor is then drained out, and the chips  washed  to
remove the acid. The chips are again cooked using a solution
containing  cooking chemicals at high temperature  of  above
160C.  After  the  chips are thus  cooked  the	pressure  is
released, and the material is collected in a blow tank, from
where  the  chipped  pulp is sent to  "Knotter	Screen"	 for
removal	 of  uncooked  particles. The pulp is  washed  in  a
series	of washers in a counter-current manner.	 The  washed
pulp  is  bleached in a multi-staged  Bleaching	 Plant,	 and
converted  into	 sheets in a continuous	 machine.  The	pulp
sheets	so  obtained are sent to other factories  for  their
conversion into Staple Fibre."
</p><p id="p_21">    The	 said High Court also relied on a passage  from	 the
"Book of Popular Science" Grolier, 1969, Vol. 7, p. 55 which
reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_22">    "Just what is a chemical, after all? Presumably it is  a
pure  chemical substance (an element or compound) and not  a
mixture.  Thus sulphuric acid is a chemical ..	But  common
salt and sugar, with which all of us are familiar, are	also
pure chemical substances .... The truly chemical industries,
which  manufacture chemicals, are seldom well  known to	 the
public. This is because we, as consumers, do not  ordinarily
make  use of chemicals in their pure form. Instead they	 are
converted into products that reach the consumer only after a
number of operations ...."
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">				   (Emphasis supplied)
						   PG NO 390
    As	mentioned  hereinbefore, the  expression  should  be
understood not in technical sense but from broad commonsense
point  of view to find out what it truly means by those	 who
deal  with them. Bearing the aforesaid perspective in  mind,
we  are	 unable to agree with the view of  the	Kerala	High
Court	expressed  in  the  aforesaid  judgment.   In	that
conspectus  of	the Kerala High Court  everything  would  be
included in the process of chemical.</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">    In	the  aforesaid	view of the matter  we	are  of	 the
opinion	 that  the  High  Court of  Andhra  Pradesh  in	 the
impugned judgment was right and the High Court of Kerala  in
the judgment referred to hereinbefore was not right.
    In the aforesaid view of the matter this petition  fails
and is accordingly dismissed.
