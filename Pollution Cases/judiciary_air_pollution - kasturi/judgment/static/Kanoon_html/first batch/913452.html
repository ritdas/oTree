                              Order On Board

18/06/2019

</p><p id="p_3">  1. The Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (for short, 'the

     Board') through its Regional Officer filed a complaint under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section

     200</a> of the CrPC read with <a href="/doc/188229543/" id="a_2">Section 19</a> of the Environment

     (Protection) Act, 1986 against petitioner No.1 - South Eastern

     Coalfields Limited (SECL), a company incorporated under the

     provisions of the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_3">Indian Companies Act</a>, 1956 and its Chief General

     Manager, Dipka Project - petitioner No.2 herein for commission of

     the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_4">Sections 15</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/69926654/" id="a_5">17</a> of the Environment

     (Protection) Act, 1986 (for short, 'the Act of 1986') stating inter alia

     that petitioner No.1 SECL was granted consent under the

     provisions of <a href="/doc/1166145/" id="a_6">Sections 25</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/87734/" id="a_7">27</a> of the Water (Prevention and Control
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>

  of <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_8">Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 which was renewed from time to time, but it

  was not renewed after 30-11-2001 and the SECL is continuing its

  extraction of coal which is violation of <a href="/doc/760991/" id="a_9">Sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1533428/" id="a_10">7</a> of the Act of

  1986 and punishable under <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_11">Sections 15</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_12">17</a> of the Act of 1986. It

  was also pleaded that after the said grant, petitioner No.1 SECL

  has expanded its mining capacity from 10 million tonnes to 15.394

  million tonnes from 2001-2002, but no such consent was obtained

  from the Board which is clear violation of <a href="/doc/760991/" id="a_13">Sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1533428/" id="a_14">7</a> of the Act

  of 1986 and petitioner No.1 SECL and petitioner No.2 - its Chief

  General Manager are responsible for obtaining the said consent

  and without obtaining consent to protect the environment, they are

  involved in continuous mining work, therefore, they are liable to be

  punished and the said act was punishable under <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_15">Sections 15</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_16">17</a>

  of the Act of 1986.     The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Korba, on

  satisfying himself with the averments of the complaint made and

  documents annexed thereto, took cognizance of the offence under

  <a href="/doc/591495/" id="a_17">Sections 15</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1374329/" id="a_18">17</a> of the Act of 1986 against the petitioners herein

  and issued process thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2. The petitioners herein without entering into appearance before the

  said Court, after receiving the summons, immediately questioned

  the order taking cognizance dated 29-8-2005 by way of revision

  under <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_19">Section 397</a> read with <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 399</a> of the CrPC before the

  Court of Session.    The revisional Court by the impugned order

  dated 9-6-2011 dismissed the revision finding no merit.      Feeling

  aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order dismissing revision and

  affirming the order of taking cognizance, this petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_21">Section

  482</a> of the CrPC has been filed by the SECL questioning those
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>

  orders.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3. Mr. Shailendra Shukla, learned counsel appearing for the

  petitioners, would make two fold contentions: -

</p><p id="p_6">     1. The complaint under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_22">Section 200</a> of the CrPC read with

        <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_23">Section 19</a> of the Act of 1986 was filed by the Board through

        its Regional Officer which is violative of <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_24">Section 19(a)</a> of the

        Act of 1986, as the Central Government has not authorized

        the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board to file

        complaint and since the manner of instituting complaint has

        already been provided in the Act of 1986, therefore, in

        absence of valid authorization under <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_25">Section 19(a)</a> of the Act

        of 1986 by the Central Government, the complaint case as

        framed and filed and cognizance taken by the learned Chief

        Judicial Magistrate deserve to be quashed being non-

        maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     2. The offences are said to have been committed by petitioner

        No.1 Company and petitioner No.2 is said to be the Chief

        General Manager, but there is no averment that petitioner

        No.2 was the person who, at the time of alleged offence

        committed, was directly in-charge of and responsible to the

        company for the conduct of business, as pleading to that

        effect is absolutely lacking and missing in the complaint,

        therefore, the complaint filed and cognizance taken are liable

        to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4. Mr. Animesh Tiwari, learned counsel appearing for the respondent,

  while replying the contentions made on behalf of the petitioners,

  would submit as under: -
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              4</span><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">     1. By notification dated 16th April, 1987, the Central Government

        has authorized the Regional Officers of the State Board for

        institution of complaint under <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_26">Section 19(a)</a> of the Act of 1986

        and therefore this objection that the complaint is filed by an

        unauthorised person, has no legs to stand.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     2. Though the pleading as mandated in <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_27">Section 16(1)</a> of the Act

        of 1986 that petitioner No.2 was the person who at the time

        the alleged offence was committed was directly in-charge of

        and responsible to the company, has not been pleaded, but

        substantially the requirements of <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_28">Section 16(1)</a> have already

        been pleaded in the complaint in paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 11,

        therefore, substantial compliance of the proviso to <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_29">Section

        16(1)</a> has been made. As such, technical objection should

        not prevail over the overwhelming public health and the

        matter requiring protection of environment has to be

        construed strictly and the petition being devoid of merit

        deserves to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">5. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, considered the rival

  submissions and also went through the record with utmost

  circumspection.
</p>
<p id="p_13">6. On consideration of the submissions of learned counsel for the

  parties, following two questions arise for consideration: -

</p><p id="p_14">     1. Whether, the complaint as framed and filed is bad for non-

        compliance of <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_30">Section 19(a)</a> of the Act of 1986?

</p><p id="p_15">     2. Whether, the compliant is liable to be rejected for non-

        compliance of <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_31">Section 16(1)</a> of the Act of 1986?
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

     Re Question No.1: -
</p>
<p id="p_16">  7. <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_32">Section 19(a)</a> of the Act of 1986 provides as under: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "19. Cognizance of offences.--No court shall take
           cognizance of any offence under this Act except on a
           complaint made by--
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             (a) the Central Government or any authority or officer
             authorised in this behalf by that Government; or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             (b) xxx      xxx   xxx"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">  8. A careful analysis of the language of <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_33">Section 19(a)</a> of the Act of

     1986 clearly shows that it prohibits institution of prosecution for an

     offence under the Act except on fulfillment of one or two conditions,

     either the prosecution must be instituted by the Central Government

     or the State Government or a person authorised in that behalf by

     the Central Government or by any authority or officer authorised in

     this behalf by the Central Government.
</p>
<p id="p_18">  9. The Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/1447296/" id="a_34">A.K. Roy and another v.

     State of Punjab and others</a> 1 while dealing with the provisions

     contained in <a href="/doc/172356374/" id="a_35">Section 20(1)</a> of the Prevention of Food Adulteration

     Act, 1954 has clearly held that where a power is given to do a

     certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or

     not at all. Other modes of performance are necessarily forbidden. It

     was further held that the intention of the legislature in enacting

     <a href="/doc/1507523/" id="a_36">Section 20(1)</a> was to confer a power on the authorities specified

     therein which power had to be exercised in the manner provided

     and not otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_19">  10. Now, the question is whether in the instant case, the provisions

     contained in <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_37">Section 19(a)</a> of the Act of 1986 have been complied


1 (1986) 4 SCC 326

<p id="p_20">11. The notification issued by the Central Government on 16th of April,

   1987, has been brought to the notice of this Court during the course

   of hearing, which has been issued by the Central Government

   contained in <a href="/doc/660281/" id="a_54">Section 19(a)</a> of the Act of 1986 and therefore the

   submission raised in this behalf on the part of the petitioners is

<p id="p_23">14. In order to answer question No.2, it would be expedient to notice

   <a href="/doc/473956/" id="a_55">Section 16</a> of the Act of 1986 which provides as under: -

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">  15. A careful perusal of <a href="/doc/846813/" id="a_56">Section 16(1)</a> of the Act of 1986 would show

     that it creates a deeming legal fiction whereby every person, who is

     in charge of and/or responsible to the company for the conduct of

     its business becomes automatically guilty of the offence committed

     by such a company and is liable to be proceeded against and

     punished accordingly. No other overt act and or direct commission

     of the offence by such a person is necessary barring the factum of

     being in charge of the company or responsible thereto for the

     conduct of the business of the company.

       141</a> that at the time the offence was committed, the person accused

       was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the

       company.    Their Lordships further held that this averment is an

       essential requirement of <a href="/doc/867156/" id="a_60">Section 141</a> and that has to be made in

       the complaint. The proposition of law so laid was followed in the

      fictions. It was held in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the report, relying

      upon its earlier decision in the matter of <a href="/doc/1396559/" id="a_71">Ram Kripal Prasad v.

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">            9. Once it is held as above, the argument of the learned
            counsel for the petitioner falls in its place and stands
            conclusively repelled. It is settled beyond cavil that rules
            of evidence and deeming fictions are not to be expressly
            spelt out and pleaded. They are matters which are for
            consideration and application in the course of the trial.
            To require that the complaint itself must plead a rule of
            evidence or, in terms, spell out a deeming fiction
            provided by the statute therein is an argument bordering
            on hypertechnicality. One must always keep in mind the
            broader perspective that the administration of criminal
            law is more a matter of substance than of form and
            should not be allowed to be obscured by pettifogging
            technicality. This aspect seems to be well covered if not
            wholly concluded by the recent Full Bench judgment of
            this Court in <a href="/doc/1396559/" id="a_73">Ram Kripal Prasad v. State of Bihar</a>, 1985
            Pat LJR 271 : (1985 Cri LJ 1048). Therein also in the

            complaint must, in term, plead each and every relevant
            fact including the precise number of employees in the
            establishment. Repelling such a contention on principle
            and precedent, it was concluded by the Full Bench in the
