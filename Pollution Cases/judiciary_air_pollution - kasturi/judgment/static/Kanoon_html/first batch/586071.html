                          MR.JUSTICE M.S.SHAH


                  Date of Order: 02/05/2003


ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">                   (Per : MR.JUSTICE M.S.SHAH)
     The present application is filed by an industrial
     unit which is manufacturing CPC Blue (Alpha), which is a
     chemical product with great potential for pollution. In
     the case of <a href="/doc/783573/" id="a_1">Pravinbhai J Patel vs. State of Gujarat &amp;
     Ors</a>., 1995 (2) GLR 1210 this Court had enumerated the
     products causing serious pollution and categorised them
     as specified items. CPC (Blue) was one of them.
</p>

<p id="p_2">     2.The units manufacturing specified items were
     placed in Schedule I under the Environmental Audit Scheme
     which was framed by this Court vide the order dated
     13.3.1997 in MCA No.326 of 1997. The Scheme was framed
 for ensuring that the industrial units manufacturing
products with potential for causing pollution install
proper   equipments   and   operate    the  Environmental
Management Systems for preventing and for containing
pollution within the permissible norms prescribed by the
relevant statutes, such as Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_2">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 and Air (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_3">Control
of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 and also the norms stipulated
under the <a href="/doc/182701402/" id="a_4">Environment Protection Act</a>, 1986. This Court
required the industrial units with pollution potential to
be subjected to internal audit as well as external audit
in the matter of meeting relevant norms prescribed under
the aforesaid legislations. As far as external audit is
concerned,   this Court had directed that the units
manufacturing specified items (such as CPC Blue) be
subjected to external audit of NEERI i.e.         National
Environmental Engineering Research Institute at Nagpur to
study the report of the internal auditor, and (if
necessary) to make inspection and take samples and
thereafter    to    submit    a     report   recommending
improvements/upgradations to the Environmental Management
System installed at a particular unit manufacturing a
specified item.      For   this   purpose,   each     unit
manufacturing any specified item was initially required
to deposit external auditor's fees of Rs.1,00,000/- with
the Registry of this Court with a further clause that the
unit may be required to pay further fees to the external
auditor as provided in clause 6(c) of the Scheme.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.The present application     is    filed   by   the
applicant-Unit    contending     that   although   it  is
manufacturing CPC Blue, which is admittedly Schedule I
item, it is entitled to get a refund of Rs.1 lac
deposited by it with the Registry in August, 1997 because
NEERI team has not come to the industrial unit for taking
samples or for personal inspection.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.In response to the notice issued by this Court,
Mr NR Shahani, learned counsel has appeared for NEERI and
has produced the letter dated 17.3.2003 from NEERI
addressed to the Deputy Registrar of this Court pointing
out that M/s. Gooly Chem (the present applicant) was one
of the industrial units manufacturing specified items,
which was subjected to the external audit by NEERI and
that the NEERI has already submitted a detailed report
being Evaluation Report No.30 to GPCB in February, 2002.
The said Evaluation of Audit       Reports   of   various
Industries in the State of Gujarat includes evaluation of
the audit   report of M/s.      Gooly Chem, Behrampura,
Ahmedabad, which is the present applicant and the NEERI
report in respect of the said unit has made detailed
 reference   to   the   following   aspects   of   environmental
audit:-
</p>

<p id="p_5">ParaParticulars


10.2Material Audit
10.3Energy Audit
10.4Water &amp; Wastewater Audit
10.5Environmental Quality Audit
10.5.1Stack Emissions
10.5.2Solid/Hazardous Wastes
10.5.3Noise Levels
10.6Health &amp; Safety Audit


Mr Shahani also points out that NEERI is an
institution established by the Central Government.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.Mr Guliwala, however, persists that since the
NEERI officers have not come to the applicant-unit for
personal inspection and for taking samples, the NEERI is
not entitled to any fees.
</p>

<p id="p_7">6.It appears that the entire Environmental Audit
Scheme is being misread by the applicant. The Scheme is
not required to be read like a statute.      A purposive
reading of the Scheme makes it clear that what was of
significance was the external environmental audit by an
independent expert agency like NEERI for evaluating
whether the Environment     Management   Systems   in   a
particular unit manufacturing the specified item were
adequate for preventing/containing pollution within the
specified norms.   It was only if NEERI had any doubts as
to whether those Environmental Management systems were
regularly operated then only the NEERI scientists would
be required to come down personally        for   surprise
inspection and for taking samples. After the inspection
was carried out and samples were taken by the Officers of
GPCB and after studying their reports, if NEERI was of
the   view   that   it could evaluate the Environment
Management System of a particular unit without going down
to that industrial unit for personal inspection, it
cannot be said that the NEERI has not performed the task
of external audit assigned to it.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7.In view of the above, we see no merit in this
application and the same is accordingly dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_9">The Registry shall pay the amount of Rs.1 lac to
NEERI by a demand draft as their fees for external
Environmental Audit. If the amount was invested in a
fixed deposit, the same shall be paid over to NEERI along
 with interest accrued thereon.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.Subject to    the   aforesaid   directions,   the
application is dismissed.
