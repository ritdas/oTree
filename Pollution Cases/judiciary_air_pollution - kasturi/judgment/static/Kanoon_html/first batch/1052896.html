<p id="p_2">S. B. MAJMUDAR, J. -
</p>
<p id="p_3">Leave granted

</p><p id="p_4">2. We have heard learned counsel for the parties finally in this appeal

</p><p id="p_5">3. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants made twofold grievances in
this appeal. In order to appreciate those grievances it would be necessary
to note a few relevant facts

</p><p id="p_6">4. The Water (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_1">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1974 (hereinafter
to be referred to as "the Act") was adopted by the Legislative Assembly,
State of Manipur in pursuance of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_2">Article 252</a> of the
Constitution of India by its Resolution No. 36 in its sitting held on
28-12-1987. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_3">As the Central Act</a> was adopted and became applicable to the
State of Manipur, Appellant 1 State of Manipur under <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_4">Section 4</a> of the Act
became empowered to constitute the State Pollution Control Board
(hereinafter to be referred to as "the Board"). In exercise of its powers
under <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_5">Section 4</a> of the Act, Appellant 1 State Government by various
notifications constituted/reconstituted the Board from time to time. What
is relevant for the present purpose is the reconstitution of the Board by
government notification dated 5-5-1995. Pursuant to the said notification,
the Governor of Manipur reconstituted the Board as per <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_6">Section 4</a> of the Act
nominating various members including the Chairman who was the then Hon'ble
Minister (STE), Manipur. The said Chairman became entitled to hold his
office for three years from the date of his nomination as laid down by
<a href="/doc/121033656/" id="a_7">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act. He of course could continue to hold office as
Chairman even after expiry of the period of three years till his successor
entered upon his office. The said Chairman resigned on 10-7-1996.
Thereupon, the present respondent was appointed as Chairman of the Board to
fill up the vacancy caused on the resignation of the erstwhile Chairman.
The said order of nomination in favour of the respondent was dated
16-10-1996. The said nomination was until further orders. It appears that
thereafter the Board was reconstituted in exercise of the powers under
<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_8">Section 4</a> of the Act by the Governor of Manipur by notification dated
26-5-1997 and in that reconstituted Board the respondent was shown as
Chairman and the reconstituted Board was to continue until further orders.
Then followed another order of the Governor, Manipur dated 28-10-1997 which
recited that in supersession of the previous order issued and pursuant to
sub-section (9) of <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_9">Section 5</a> and sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_10">Section 12</a> of the Act
read with sub-rule (2) of Rule 11 of the Manipur Water (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Rules, 1991, the respondent's office of Chairman was
restricted to a period of three years from the date of his initial
nomination i.e. from 16-10-1996 it was to continue up to 15-10-1999. We may
also mention that in the meantime the Board was reconstituted by further
notification dated 8-12-1997 under <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_11">Section 4</a> of the Act wherein the
respondent was shown as the Chairman and he was to continue until further
orders. After the aforesaid order dated 28-10-1997 read with further
notification dated 8-12-1997 the respondent's tenure as Chairman met with
rough weather. Some allegations were made against him while functioning as
Chairman invoking his disqualification alleging that he had abused his
position as member so as to render his continuance as the Chairman of the
Board detrimental to the interest of the general public as provided under
<a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_12">Section 6(1)(g)</a> of the Act

</p><p id="p_7">5. It may be stated at this stage that the Chairman is also considered to
be a member of the Board as laid down by sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_13">Section 4</a> of
the Act which reads as follows

    "4.(2) A State Board shall consist of the following members, namely -
</p>
<p id="p_8">    (a) a chairman ....."
</p>
<p id="p_9">6. Pursuant to the show-cause notice issued to the respondent and after
considering his reply, the Governor of Manipur in exercise of the powers
under <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_14">Section 5(3)</a> read with <a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_15">Section 6(1)(g)</a> of the Act by order dated
19-10-1998 directed that the respondent be removed from office as Chairman
of the Board. The respondent thereafter carried the matter in a writ
petition before the High Court of Assam, Imphal Bench. A learned Single
Judge who heard his writ petition was pleased to allow the same on
30-4-1999. It may be noted that the learned Single Judge had directed that
the respondent shall continue to hold his office as Chairman as his removal
was being set aside and his tenure will end on 15-10-1999 counting three
years from 16-10-1996 when he was appointed as Chairman of the Board
pursuant to the earlier referred orders. The appellants carried the matter
in appeal before the Division Bench and having failed to convince the
appellate court on the merits of their appeal, they are before us in the
present appeal

</p><p id="p_10">7. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants raised two contentions in
support of this appeal, (i) that when the Court held that the respondent
was given reasonable opportunity to meet the charges against him as
mentioned in the show-cause notice, the Court could not have sat as a court
of appeal and could not have decided on merits and ought not to have held
that the respondent was not guilty of any abuse of power as reasonable
opportunity as required under <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_16">Section 5(3)</a> read with <a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_17">Section 6(2)</a> was made
available to him, and (ii) in any case, learned Single Judge was in error
in directing the appellants to continue the respondent as Chairman up to
15-10-1999 on the supposition that a clear three years' time was available
to him for continuing as Chairman even if not removed from the office in
the meantime as if the term of 3 years was to run from the date of his
order of nomination dated 16-10-1996. Learned Senior Counsel for the
appellants in this connection heavily relied upon <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_18">Section 5(6)</a> of the Act

</p><p id="p_11">8. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that
pursuant to the order of the High Court the respondent is already
continuing as a sitting Chairman of the Board and his tenure is almost
coming to an end and he does not intend to continue as Chairman beyond
15-10-1999; therefore, the first contention canvassed by learned Senior
Counsel for the appellants on the merits of the controversy has almost
become academic as no interim relief was granted by this Court against the
order of the High Court, nor was any interim relief granted pending appeal
against the order of learned Single Judge by the Division Bench of the High
Court

</p><p id="p_12">9. So far as the second contention is concerned, it was submitted by
learned counsel for the respondent that pursuant to the reconstitution of
the Board by order of the Governor of Manipur dated 26-5-1997, the
respondent would have been entitled to continue even for three years from
26-5-1997 as laid down by <a href="/doc/121033656/" id="a_19">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act but as there was a later
order of the, Governor dated 28-10-1997 his tenure could extend to a period
of three years from his initial nomination i.e. 16-10-1996 as clearly laid
down by that order. The respondent does not intend to continue beyond
15-10-1999 as directed by the High Court and against which direction the
respondent has not thought it fit to file any cross-appeal

</p><p id="p_13">10. Having given our anxious consideration to the rival contentions, we
find that as the High Court's direction in favour of the respondent's
tenure which is to expire on 15-10-1999 has almost worked itself out and
less than a month remains for him to act as Chairman of the Board, the
first grievance raised by learned Senior Counsel for the appellants in
connection with the removal of the respondent by order dated 19-10-1998 has
become of academic interest. We, therefore, did not permit learned Senior
Counsel for the appellants to canvass this point any further before us.
That takes us to the consideration of the second point

</p><p id="p_14">11. <a href="/doc/121033656/" id="a_20">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act lays down as follows

    "5. Terms and conditions of service of members. - (1) Save as otherwise
    provided by or under this Act, a member of a Board, other than a
    member-secretary, shall hold office for a term of three years from the
    date of his nomination

    Provided that a member shall, notwithstanding the expiration of his
    term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his
    office."
</p>
<p id="p_15">12. It is therefore, obvious that the term of office of a member of the
Board which would include the Chairman as already noted earlier, as laid
down by <a href="/doc/51092376/" id="a_21">Section 4(2)(a)</a> of the Act, would be three years from the date of
his nomination. He would also be entitled to continue to hold office beyond
the permitted time till his successor enters upon his office. However, if
this provision would have stood by itself, the respondent would have been
entitled to hold office effectively for a period of three years from the
date, when he was nominated on 16-10-1996 as the Chairman. He would have
been then entitled to continue up to 15-10-1999 as Chairman and the vacancy
of Chairman could not have arisen prior to that date. Consequently, there
would have been no occasion for the State Government to resort to filling
up of that vacancy earlier. However, sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_22">Section 5</a> becomes
relevant at this stage. It lays down that a casual vacancy in a Board shall
be filled by a fresh nomination and person nominated to fill the vacancy
shall hold office only for the remainder of the term for which the member
in whose place he was nominated was to hold his office. We may also in this
connection, refer to sub-sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_23">Section 5</a> which read thus

    "5. (3) The Central Government or, as the case may be, the State
    Government may, if it thinks fit, remove any member of a Board before
    the expiry of his term of office, after giving him a reasonable
    opportunity of showing cause against the same(4) A member of a Board,
    other than the member-secretary, may at any time resign his office by
    writing under his hand addressed -
</p>
<p id="p_16">    (a) in the case of the Chairman to the Central Government or, as the
    case may be, the State Government; and

</p><p id="p_17">    (b) in any other case, to the Chairman of the Board; and the seat of
    the Chairman or such other member shall thereupon become vacant."
</p>
<p id="p_18">13. It is obvious that if such removal takes place as per <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_24">Section 5(3)</a> the
vacancy arising out of such termination cannot be anything but a casual
vacancy depending upon such a contingency. Another instance of a casual
vacancy is furnished by the provisions of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_25">Section 5</a>
which deal with the resignation of the members of the Board, other than the
member-secretary. If a member including Chairman resigns before his term is
over, the seat of the Chairman or such other member thereupon shall become
vacant. But that apart, <a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_26">Section 6(1)</a> deals with disqualification of sitting
members of the Board. If such disqualification is found to have been
incurred by any member under sub-section (1) then under sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_27">Section 6</a> after giving him reasonable opportunity he can be removed from
his office prior to the expiry of the usual term of his office of three
years. That would be a third instance of a casual vacancy. When such casual
vacancies occur, sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_28">Section 5</a> would start operating and if
another member is nominated to fill up that vacancy, then his term of
office would be for the remainder of the unexpired term of the member in
whose place he steps in by nomination. In the facts of the present case, it
is easy to visualise that as the earlier Chairman resigned on 10-7-1996 and
he was nominated as Chairman on 5-5-1995, his regular term of office would
have expired on 4-5-1998. In the meantime, because of his resignation,
casual vacancy of Chairman occurred and the said vacancy was filled up by
nomination of the respondent on 16-10-1996. Therefore, the unexpired term
of his tenure as a substituted nominee Chairman would have continued only
up to 4-5-1998. On that day, by the thrust of sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_29">Section 5</a>,
vacancy of the Chairman could be said to have occurred and till that
vacancy was filled up in accordance with law by the State authorities, the
respondent could have continued to hold office beyond 4-5-1998 till his
successor was available to hold that office. It is of course true that in
the meantime the appellants themselves thought that the respondent was
liable to be removed from office and passed order on 19-10-1998. That
appeared to have been on the assumption that the successor was not
available to take charge from the respondent. Be that as it may, so far as
the impugned direction of the High Court is concerned and to which
exception is taken by learned Senior Counsel for the appellants, it is to
be stated on the correct interpretation of relevant provisions of the Act
as mentioned earlier, that in case of any casual vacancy of any member of
the Board duly constituted under <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_30">Section 4</a>, the successor nominee who fills
up such vacancy will have only the unexpired period of office available in
the light of the initial appointment of the original incumbent member vice
whom he walks in to fill up the vacancy. It may also be noted that it
appears that whenever there is a vacancy which is filled up, the State
authorities seem to be reconstituting the entire Board every time when new
members are inducted or a new Chairman is inducted. In fact, sub-section
(3) of <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_31">Section 4</a> does not seem to have been kept in view as it lays down
that every State Board shall be a body corporate with the name specified by
the State Government in the notification under sub-section (1), having
perpetual succession and a common seal. Under these circumstances, even
though the State Government has authority to reconstitute the Board from
time to time only because some casual vacancy occurred, it may not strictly
be necessary for the authorities to undertake the exercise of
reconstituting the entire Board nor could the said reconstitution be
directed to continue until further orders, as the tenure of the members of
the reconstituted Board also will be governed by sub-section (1) of Section
</p><p id="p_19">4. It must, therefore, be held while accepting the second contention of the
learned Senior Counsel for the appellant that the High Court, with respect,
was in error in taking the view that the tenure of the respondent as
Chairman could have gone beyond 4-5-1998 or that there was no vacancy of
Chairman from that date till the expiry of 3 years from the date of
nomination of the respondent as Chairman. However, the aforesaid conclusion
of ours will have no effect on the final orders passed by the High Court in
favour of the respondent as the respondent has only less than a month to
continue as the Chairman of the Board and as fairly stated by his counsel
he does not intend to continue beyond that date. Consequently, after
15-10-1999 it will be open to the appellant authorities to fill up the
vacancy of the Chairman in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed
accordingly. No costs
