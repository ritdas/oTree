JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

	
 

<p id="p_1">1.	This
Revision Application filed under Section 397 read with <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_1">Section 401</a> of
the Code of Criminal Procedure challenges the judgment and order
dated 30-5-1990 passed by the learned 2nd Joint Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Anand in Criminal Case no.4950 of 1988
whereby the learnd Magistrate convicted and sentence the present
respondents-accused till rising of the Court and to pay a fine of
Rs.500/-, in default, S.I. for 30 days.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">2.	The
facts leading to the institution of the present Revision Application
are that the present petitioner Jagdip V. Pandya, Assistant Law
Officer, Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Race Course, Baroda had
lodged complaint under <a href="/doc/13901571/" id="a_2">Sections 31</a>, <a href="/doc/115069358/" id="a_3">39</a> and <a href="/doc/122145316/" id="a_4">40</a> of  (The) Air 
Pollution (Prevention and <a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_5">Control of Pollution) Act</a>, 1981 on the
basis of the fact that the Unit of the respondents at Vasad during
the manufacturing process used raw material 10DT(800 grade)  which
emits black-white smoke with great density and caused pollution and
this fact was noticed by the complainant during the inspection which
was carried out on 4-6-1988. On the basis of the said complaint,
offence was registered and the case was numbered as Criminal Case
no.4950/1988.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">3.	Before
the learned Magistrate, the respondents pleaded guilty and prayed for
mercy and imposition of lesser sentence as they are poor persons
whereupon the learned 2nd Joint Judicial Magistrate, First
Class, Anand passed the judgment and order dated 30-3-1990 in
Criminal Case no.4950/1988 whereby the respondents-accused were
convicted and setenced till rising of the Court and to pay fine of
Rs.500/-, in default, S.I. for 30 days. It is against this judgment
and order of the learned Magistrate that the present petitioner
(original complainant)has  approached this Court by way of the
present Criminal Revision Application.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">4.	Heard
learned Advocate Mr. K.H.Baxi for the petitioner, learned Advocate
Mr. R.N. Shah for the respondents nos.1 and 2 and Ms. Falguni
D.Patel, learned A.P.P. for the State.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">5.	Mr.
</p><p id="p_6">K.H.Baxi, learned Advocate for the petitioner  has submitted that the
learned Magistrate has erred in awarding less than the minimum
sentence prescribed under <a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_6">Section 37</a> of  (The) Air (Prevention and
<a href="/doc/82542966/" id="a_7">Control of Pollution) Act</a>,1981 and as such , the sentence being
inadequate,the judgment and order passed by the learned Magistrate is
bad in law and requires to be quashed and set aside.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">6.	As
against that Mr. R.N. Shah learned Advocate for the respondents
submitted that the offence is registered in the year 1988 and since
such a long period has elapsed this Court should not interfere in
Revision. In support of his submission Mr. Shah had placed reliance
on the decision rendered in the case of  <a href="/doc/1649689/" id="a_8">C.M. Rao, Food Inspector v.
Rohitkumar Kanchanlal Bhavsar &amp; Ors</a>. ( 1994-2  G.L.R.  Vol.35
Page 1638).He further submitted that the respondents had already
closed the entire unit after the incident in question and now they
are not carrying out any manufacturing activities since then, and
hence, also this Court should not intefere with the said judgment and
order of the learned Magistrate. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_8">7.	This
Court has gone through the Purshis whereby the respondents had
pleaded guilty as also the judgment and order dated 30-5-1990 passed
by the learned 2nd Joint Judicial Magistrate, First Class,
Anand in Criminal Case no.4950 of 1988. Undoubtedly, the learned 2nd
Joint Judicial Magistrate, First Class,  imposing  the above referred
sentence  against the respondents contrary to the provisions of law.
A bare look at the relevant provisions of law, more particularly,
<a href="/doc/187489184/" id="a_9">Section 37</a> of the said Act  makes it clear that the respondents
accused ought to have been awarded the minimum sentence of six
months. Merely because long period of time has elapsed since the
incident that  by itself would not be a ground for taking a lenient
view in the matter.  The decision cited by Mr. Shah has  no bearing
on the facts of the present case as the observation made therein are
based on the peculiar facts and circumstances of that particular
case.  That apart, the learned Magistrate has also not assigned
sufficient  reason in support of his conclusion. Thus, there being
error  of law apparent on the face of the record, the Revision
Application deserves to be allowed.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">8.	In
the result this Revision Application is allowed. The judgment and
order dated 30-5-1990 passed by the 2nd Joint Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Anand in Criminal Case no.4950 of 1988 is
hereby quashed and set aside. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_10">9.	The
matter is remanded to the trial Court for fresh consideration on
merits and in accordance with law and as early as possible after
affording opportunity of hearing to both the parties,without taking
into consideration the Purshis filed by the respondents pleading
guilty.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">10.	Office
is directed to forward the R &amp; Proceedings to the trial Court
immediately.
